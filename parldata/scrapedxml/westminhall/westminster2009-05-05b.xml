<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0001.htm#0905051000423">
	<p pid="b.1.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and to have secured this important debate, in my capacity as chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on fibromyalgia, a position that I have held since July 2005. I know that several hon. Members want to take part in the debate, and that was enormously helpful in securing it. The timing today is not helpful to everyone; early on a Tuesday morning following a bank holiday is a problematic time for those travelling long distances from their constituencies. Nevertheless the debate fulfils a long overdue promise to the dedicated and hard-working campaigners on fibromyalgia. I can find no record of a previous debate in the House on the subject, which makes it all the more important to the millions of fibromyalgia sufferers in the country. I have several questions to put to the Minister on behalf of campaigners, and I hope that she will be able to reassure them. I indicated what those subject areas were to the Minister's staff, but I am not sure whether all the information went through in a timely way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/2">I should take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to fibromyalgia, as there is little knowledge of the condition. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition of widespread pain and profound fatigue. Its name is made up of &quot;fibro&quot; for fibrous tissues such as tendons and ligaments, &quot;my&quot; indicating muscles and &quot;algia&quot; meaning pain. A patient can experience widespread muscular pain, stiffness, constant fatigue and non-refreshing sleep. The pain tends to be felt as an aching or burning, and is often described as being felt from head to toe. It can change location and can be worse at some times than others. Because it can come and go, sufferers can feel suddenly drained of energy, as if someone has just pulled the plug on them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/3">Sixty-eight per cent. of patients report that fibromyalgia has a very strong impact on their overall quality of life, with at least half reporting that the condition strongly impacts on their concentration and memory, physical mobility, overall mood, motivation and drive. A survey of five European countries has shown that fibromyalgia affects between 2 per cent. and 4.5 per cent. of the population, or at least one in 50 people, from children to the very elderly. Fibromyalgia has been shown to have more impact on patients' lives than many other forms of widespread pain and chronic illness. I believe that the sheer scale of the illness and the suffering that results from it mean that it is high time fibromyalgia was taken seriously as an issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/4">My constituent, Jean Turner, is a trustee of the Fibromyalgia Association UK, and works tirelessly to provide help and support for sufferers of the illness. Jean is a fibromyalgia sufferer and first reported her excessive tiredness to her GP in 1981. After blood tests and referral to a cardiac specialist to investigate the tiredness she was told that there was nothing wrong. Over the next seven years Jean underwent tests for arthritis, attended a private chiropractor for pain relief and was referred to an allergy specialist, but all the tests were returned as negative. Between 1988 and 1994 Jean did not feel able to visit her GP, because she was made to feel that the illness was all in her head. Fortunately, even though Jean's GP was convinced that there was nothing wrong with her, she insisted on seeing a specialist and was eventually referred to a rheumatologist, who finally diagnosed fibromyalgia and osteoporosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/5">I am sure that we would all agree that the 13 years taken to reach a diagnosis in Jean's case was far too long. Diagnosis times have improved, but too many people are still needlessly suffering in pain while medical professionals struggle to reach a diagnosis. I am pleased to report that in the past few years Jean has learned how to deal with her condition and enjoys a much better quality of life, but all that Jean and other sufferers would ask is to be believed when they say that they are in pain and are not hypochondriacs. Sufferers want support to be available from the NHS. They want guidelines finally to be produced by NICE, and they want GPs to be trained properly in diagnosing the condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/6">Many people do not know that fibromyalgia is a very common illness. It is in fact as common as rheumatoid arthritis and can be even more painful. It is a condition with no age limits. It affects mainly women, from children to the elderly, and the mean age is 49. A staggering 2.7 million people in the UK suffer from the illness. People with mild to moderate cases of fibromyalgia are usually able to live a normal life, given the appropriate treatment. However, if the symptoms are severe, they may not be able to hold down a paying job or enjoy much of a social life.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/7">Fibromyalgia is a condition that often develops after some sort of trauma that seems to act as a trigger, such as a fall or car accident, a viral infection, childbirth, an operation or a huge emotional event. However, sometimes the condition begins without any obvious trigger. The cause of fibromyalgia has yet to be found, but in the past several years research has produced some insights into that puzzling condition; it has identified a deficiency in serotonin in the central nervous system, and a resulting imbalance of substance P, a spinal fluid that transmits pain signals. The effect of that is disordered sensory processing. The brain registers pain when others might experience a slight ache or stiffness. We can only hope that research will discover the cause and result in more effective treatment in the years to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/8">I want to consider some of the problems that fibromyalgia sufferers face, beginning with diagnosis. Fibromyalgia is not new, but for most of the last century it was very difficult to diagnose. As I have said, part of the problem is that it is difficult to identify the illness by standard laboratory tests or X-rays. Blood tests and scans will return a negative result and a patient will not necessarily look ill, or will not appear clinically weak. Furthermore, many of the symptoms are found in other conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. It is therefore not surprising that it has been dubbed &quot;the invisible illness&quot;. The problem comes when doctors do not have the experience or expertise to make a diagnosis. Nearly half of all specialists reported fibromyalgia as being &quot;very or somewhat&quot; difficult to diagnose.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/9">Not only is the condition difficult to diagnose; diagnosis is a lengthy process in itself. The average time taken for diagnosis is more than two years, and patients report seeing between two and four physicians before a diagnosis is reached. That lengthy period can be very worrying, frustrating and upsetting for patients. Despite the fact that several specialist fibromyalgia syndrome clinics are provided by NHS consultants around the UK, most of those do not appear in their own right on the NHS choose and book system. Even those GPs who know about the condition&mdash;and there are too few of those&mdash;who are looking for specialist help within the NHS cannot always refer patients directly to consultants with an interest in and knowledge of fibromyalgia. One of the immediate actions that the Minister could take today is to rectify the situation. Those clinics could be added to the choose and book system, and the NHS could build and provide an extensive list of accepted specialist NHS services around the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/10">What about the treatment of the condition when a diagnosis is reached? At present, treatment for fibromyalgia aims at reducing pain and improving sleep. Treatment therefore focuses on the symptoms rather than the condition. The best that a doctor can do is give guidance on ways of coping with and treating some of the symptoms. I hope that it does not appear that I am criticising GPs, specialists or the NHS in general. That is not my purpose as I believe that they do fantastic work under immense pressure; however, a major problem is that GPs get little or no training on the condition, and even consultant rheumatologists, who would usually diagnose fibromyalgia, often have little or no specific training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/11">Professional development is currently hampered by out-of-date medical tests containing erroneous information. Much of the fibromyalgia information that is used by the NHS is provided by voluntary organisations such as the Fibromyalgia Association. In 2008 it was FibroAction that helped NHS Direct to update its online information. It is clear that things need to change. Getting an accurate diagnosis is difficult, and about half of our GPs admit that the condition is often misdiagnosed. They highlight a lack of confidence in their ability to recognise the symptoms of fibromyalgia, or to differentiate the condition from others with similar symptoms. The problem does not rest with GPs alone. It is widespread in the medical profession. Education on the condition is urgently needed; the Government, through the NHS, could be the catalyst.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on his excellent and informative speech, and thank him for the work that he does as chairman of the all-party group on fibromyalgia. In the Kettering area, the Nene Valley fibromyalgia support group does wonderful work, as do support groups throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/2">The central point that my hon. Friend makes is fundamental, is it not? The NHS needs to provide as much help and support for GPs as possible. If it is difficult for specialists to identify the condition, it must be near to impossible for GPs.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.4.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0001.htm#0905051000425">
	<p pid="b.4.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his support for the all-party group, and for his interest in the subject. I know that his constituents in Kettering will be pleased to hear that he has raised the matter of GP training.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/2">I also know that the Minister's heart is in the right place, and that she is anxious for the NHS to help. However, recent parliamentary questions from hon. Members throughout the House have had a less than encouraging response. In June 2008, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> asked what plans the Department of Health had to improve treatment for people with fibromyalgia. The answer came:</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/3" class="indent">&quot;There are no specific plans to improve the treatment for those living with fibromyalgia.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-06-30.655"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 June 2008; Vol. 478, c. 655W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/4">Another hon. Member asked how many people were diagnosed in his constituency, the region and nationwide since 1997. The answer was:</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Information on the number of people diagnosed with fibromyalgia is not collected.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-11-21.998"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 November 2007; Vol. 467, c. 998W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/6">Among other things, I asked the Minister what steps were being taken to raise awareness of fibromyalgia, and what progress there was on diagnosis and treatment. The response was:</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/7" class="indent">&quot;We have made no assessment of the progress being made by the national health service into improving the diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia. We have taken no recent steps to raise the awareness of fibromyalgia among the general public and health professionals.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-10-09.516"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 October 2007; Vol. 464, c. 516W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/8">I shall not embarrass the Minister by going through all the parliamentary questions and answers on the subject, but there is a discernible pattern. There is clearly no focus on the illness in the Department, and thus no focus on it in the NHS, yet the condition acts as a significant drag on the economy. In 2006, through a parliamentary question, I ascertained that 8,400 people who were claiming incapacity benefit or severe disablement had been given a primary diagnosis of fibromyalgia. We know that that is the tip of an iceberg, as most fibromyalgia sufferers on benefits will have been diagnosed with something else. The economic cost of the failure to diagnose the problem swiftly does not affect only the Department for Work and Pensions; the cost to the NHS and local authorities, too, will be huge. Better awareness and education of health professionals would considerably reduce that financial burden.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/9">Many groups work tirelessly for the sufferers of the condition, and do their best to raise its profile. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to their ongoing work. As chair of the all-party group on fibromyalgia, I work closely with the Fibromyalgia Association UK and FibroAction, but the message regularly comes back that there is a problem in raising the profile of the condition. There is only so much that the third sector can do. Is it not time for the Department to consider a nationwide awareness campaign to highlight fibromyalgia syndrome, and the importance of fast diagnosis and the provision of treatment? Do the millions of people who suffer with the illness not deserve at least that from their NHS?</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/10">Raising the profile of the condition is difficult without the support of the relevant authorities. I draw the House's attention to an application made by FMA UK in July 2007 to the medical advisory board of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The aim of that application was to establish a set of clear guidelines on fibromyalgia. In May 2008, FMA UK had still not received a response, and asked me to intervene. Despite my intervention, still no response was received. Suddenly, and incredibly coincidentally, in the last couple days&mdash;since today's debate was arranged&mdash;FMA UK has finally been contacted by NICE. FMA UK was informed that its application had been unsuccessful.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/11">The fact that FMA UK has received an answer does not excuse the arrogance or incompetence&mdash;or both&mdash;that NICE has shown until now. Frankly, it is insulting and deeply frustrating for those who work tirelessly to raise the profile of the condition to have to wait for a debate such as today's before the relevant authorities take them seriously. A delay of two years is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/12">Given everything that I have said this morning, it is imperative that a clear medical framework is set out for GPs. It is more than long overdue. NICE's response will be extremely disappointing to FMA UK, as well as to fibromyalgia sufferers throughout the country, and I urge NICE to consider the matter again. Will the Minister give fibromyalgia sufferers some hope this morning by saying that she will personally intervene, asking NICE to ensure a clear set of guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of the illness?</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/13">The many sufferers of fibromyalgia also look to the Department of Health for leadership and support. They were particularly gratified that the chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, recognised the impact of fibromyalgia and its prevalence in the UK as a cause of chronic pain in his annual report of 2008. Sir Liam said:</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Chronic pain reduces the quality of life more than almost any other condition. The impact of pain on people's lives is significant, bringing emotional and financial burdens to patients and loved ones. A major initiative to widen access to pain services is badly needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/15">Sir Liam has articulated what FM sufferers require&mdash;information, and access to NHS tailored services.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/16">The voluntary organisations know that some good specialist NHS services are provided for fibromyalgia patients. Such services include those provided by the clinic at Guy's hospital. Professor John Davies has had many years' experience in treating sufferers of fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis. Russells Hall hospital in Dudley has been providing a chronic pain service for more than 25 years, but only in the last 12 years has it developed from being a single-person service to the present well-resourced and multidisciplinary team. There are also good multidisciplinary teams at the Royal Bolton and Poole hospitals. We have also seen some great local initiatives. For instance, an eight-week course for fibromyalgia patients is being run by south-west Essex community services in conjunction with Basildon university hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/17">I have already said that I have enormous respect for the many hard-working organisations, such as FibroAction and FMA UK; and, of course, one should not forget the work of the PolkaDotGals and their splendid calendar.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/18">Although she is not my constituent, I feel that I ought to mention Lindsey Middlemiss, who I believe is here today. Lindsey is a constituent of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase>. My hon. Friend is unable to attend the debate, but I know that he takes a keen interest in Lindsey's work and that he supports the work of the all-party group. Not only is Lindsey the chair and founder of FibroAction, but she is involved with the West Berkshire Neurological Alliance that operates in my constituency of Reading, East.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/19">Lindsey developed the illness following a whiplash injury. She deteriorated so rapidly that within nine months she had to give up her career. Her story is similar to that of many other sufferers; despite numerous visits to her GP and several tests, it took her more than two years to secure a diagnosis. Lindsey was lucky enough to obtain private treatment, but many others may not have been so fortunate. One of the common problems for fibromyalgia patients is that the lack of NHS treatment and understanding means that they need private treatment, and their families have built up large debts in their attempt to help.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/20">One of the major obstacles faced by Lindsey was that her GP was not aware of any other treatments or services that could help her. It was down to Lindsey's determination and her family's support that she met Professor Davies at the fibromyalgia clinic at Guy's hospital. With his help, Lindsey's condition proved manageable, but Lindsay would like to know why it took five years and a great deal of money for a healthy young woman to get the health care that she so desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/21">Where do we go from here? In February 2005, Dr. Ernest Choy and Dr. Serena Carville from King's college London produced a nine-point recommendation for the management and treatment of fibromyalgia. It is a credible report and is worth mentioning for that reason. I shall not go into the full details of the plan today, but I would like to highlight some of the most important and thought-provoking points. Choy and Carville concluded that a full understanding of fibromyalgia requires an assessment of pain, function and the psychological impact on patients. They also believe that individually tailored exercise programmes, including aerobic exercise and strength training, can be very beneficial, as well as other therapies, such as relaxation and physiotherapy. Relaxation works very well for almost everyone affected by this condition. It reduces tension in the mind and body and calms the symptoms, especially the pain. Choy and Carville concluded that, ultimately, medical professionals need to be able to listen to, and believe in, an individual's experience of pain. Only then can a programme of treatment be established to reassure them and reduce stress and anxiety.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/22">I ask the Minister to assist fibromyalgia sufferers by helping to deliver the following: first, it is clear that we need to work towards providing greater education for general practitioners. It is unsatisfactory that many GPs are not confident or able to diagnose the illness in a timely fashion. Timely diagnosis is key to helping people with this condition. Secondly, it is not acceptable that NICE has only just acknowledged FMA UK's application to provide a clear and unequivocal set of guidelines for GPs. Those guidelines could be used in the training of the medical profession and could reduce the stressful experience currently associated with diagnosis.</p>

	<p pid="b.6.0/1">I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for securing this debate. I was taken aback by some of the statistics that he gave, which were new to me&mdash;and I was also slightly taken aback by the PolkaDotGals' charity calendar. However, there is the risk&mdash;this was the experience with drugs for dementia and other illnesses&mdash;that NICE will use the lack of a good evidence base as a reason for refusing to recommend treatment. Is that a risk, given some of the issues that he has mentioned, about credibility, belief and so on?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.7.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="7"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0001.htm#0905051000427">
	<p pid="b.7.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that NICE has behaved in that way in the past, but we are looking not for advice on drugs, but for a set of guidelines so that people can be diagnosed quickly and GPs can properly understand their functions in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/2">Thirdly, effective treatment needs to be available throughout the country, but that should be signposted by the NHS, rather than third-party organisations. Fourthly, the profile of fibromyalgia desperately needs to be raised. As I mentioned before, despite its dedication, the voluntary sector can only do so much. We all have a part to play in raising awareness, but help from the Government is much needed. As we have seen, fibromyalgia is a complex condition with numerous contributing factors, and although research has advanced our understanding, it is clear that much work remains to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/3">I know that the Minister has many pressures on her time and that there are also many pressures on the resources of the NHS. However, I know that she understands the chronic pain and suffering affecting millions of people throughout the UK and that she will do her utmost to provide assistance. I hope that today's debate will help to raise the profile of this &quot;invisible&quot; illness; that is the very least that I can do to help to support the many campaigners who have done their best to raise its profile.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.7.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="7"  time="009:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0002.htm#0905051000428">
	<p pid="b.7.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" name="Robert Wilson">the hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> on obtaining the debate, which will come as a great encouragement and boost to the morale of many who suffer from fibromyalgia. They will take satisfaction from the fact that the illness has been given prominence through this debate. Part of the problem for sufferers is that the condition takes so long to be recognised by the health services that they often come to believe that they are in some way responsible or guilty. They exhibit symptoms but are without the support necessary to bring some relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/2">I also congratulate the hon. Gentleman, who made a comprehensive speech, on his work, as chairman of the all-party group on fibromyalgia, in bringing together sufferers, as well as medical professionals and academics who now recognise the condition as a proper medical condition and are working in centres of excellence to alleviate it. Part of the problem is that we have very little idea of what causes the condition&mdash;whether the genetic make-up of the individuals or an environmental aspect that they have experienced. Evidence is now being gathered relating the absence of serotonin to the symptoms of the disease. If that can be established, a much more profound and substantial method of treatment could be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/3">Much of the problem is that sufferers experience a delay in diagnosis, during which there is often a deterioration in the condition and its symptoms, so guidance for GPs, to help them to identify the condition, would represent a great step forward in supporting sufferers. My constituency is rather sparsely populated, so it is often difficult for my constituents to get to support groups and to meet other people suffering from the condition. I have seen evidence that meeting other sufferers to discuss their experiences, symptoms and treatment can give individuals great confidence that there is a possibility that something can be achieved to alleviate their symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/4">Sometimes, individual experiences of the condition count for as much as anything else. I have received correspondence on the matter from one of my constituents, and if Members will bear with me, I shall read out a couple of her comments. They spell out many of the messages that we heard from the hon. Gentleman. Mrs. Lewis from Ystradgynlais wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I first started having a muscular problem in March 2001 and was originally treated for a frozen shoulder. Gradually, I started developing other symptoms...widespread pain varying in where it would be from one day to the next, poor sleep patterns due to waking in pain and discomfort...severe migraines, tinnitus, all of which can be conditions on their own but added together form part of Fibromyalgia.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/6" class="indent">After nearly 2 years of a growing list of symptoms, I was referred to a rheumatologist with a queried diagnosis of Lupus, an auto immune condition. He, quite rudely, disagreed with this diagnosis on the basis that I could touch my toes and was flexible but ignored the comments that after 4 years of yoga, I was more than able to do these things but would suffer greatly afterwards. He never investigated further to see what other cause could be behind my symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/7" class="indent">Two weeks later after a conversation with a colleague...it was suggested to me that I may have FM. On looking it up online, I asked my doctor if this could be the possible cause and on researching it, he agreed with this diagnosis and has been treating me for this condition ever since.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/8" class="indent">As time has gone on, my condition has deteriorated and more symptoms...now afflict me. I am shortly to join in a pain management programme for which I will have to travel 55 miles there and then back each way once a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/9" class="indent">I have every confidence in my doctor's ability to treat me but there is a lot of ignorance and misconception about this condition. The NHS recognises that this is a very real syndrome yet many doctors and even the consultants lack this knowledge and refuse to accept it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/10">She goes on to talk about the difficulties of obtaining benefits:</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/11" class="indent">&quot;And as for the DWP. . . they also have difficulty accepting this condition exists and as there is a variability of problems that presents and the pain levels can fluctuate, then they err on the side of caution and turn many of us down for the benefits we need to live on.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/12" class="indent">All of us sufferers have good days, bad days, and very bad days. The symptoms can be few one day and then flare up badly and cause long lasting spells when one is unable to function without a great deal of help. Yet the funding for this help via the benefits system is so hard to get. Surely it should be a lot easier than us being made to feel like frauds when trying to claim DLA for example?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/13">That letter expresses better than I can the frustrations and concerns felt by the sufferers.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/14">I know that it is difficult for the medical profession to deal with a condition that has such a range of symptoms, especially when the origin and cause have yet to be established. The Minister would do well to take on board the comments made by the hon. Member for Reading, East and do what she can to ensure that the condition is recognised, that GPs diagnose it earlier than in the past and that provision is made for help through pain relief and encouraging good sleeping patterns, which make such a difference to the sufferers. I ask the Minister to take on board all those concerns.</p>

	<p pid="b.9.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" name="Robert Wilson">the hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> on securing the debate. This is one of those occasions when all the parties can come together to make the case for improving awareness of the condition both among the public and the medical profession&mdash;particularly in primary care.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/2">Fibromyalgia is something of a Cinderella condition; it is widely misunderstood and there is a great deal of ignorance about it, which has a significant impact on those who suffer from it. It is right to acknowledge fibromyalgia awareness day, which is on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-12">12 May</phrase>. It is a moment to concentrate minds and to focus the attention of the Department of Health, the national health service and NICE on a more effective approach to tackling the condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/3">In securing the debate, the hon. Gentleman has already demonstrated one notable advance&mdash;he has had a response from NICE. I will return to the role of NICE later, but it is shocking that it has taken two years for it to respond to a request for guidance on the treatment of the condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/4">The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> have both highlighted just how awful the condition is. Sufferers often have a sense that no one believes them, especially when they have to apply for benefits because they cannot keep their employment. They feel that no one believes that the condition is disabling, so they are left utterly alone. It is a chronic condition, and one that applies particularly to women. Its impact on relationships, social lives and the capacity to work is substantial. It is often the case that conditions such as fibromyalgia, myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome have a greater impact on people's lives and their capacity to function as human beings than many conditions that attract much greater attention in public discourse and in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/5">It was a breakthrough when the chief medical officer acknowledged the significance of the condition and made a clear plea for action to be taken. As the hon. Member for Reading, East mentioned in his speech, a major initiative to widen access to pain services is badly needed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.9.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="9"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0002.htm#0905051000431">
	<p pid="b.9.2/1">I am pleased to see the Minister nodding, but she must follow the advice. We need to find an agreed way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/2">The hon. Gentleman talked very effectively about the problems of securing a diagnosis. It is hard to convince GPs and others that the problem is genuine. A newspaper article quoted Julia Fitzgerald, who, after eventually securing a diagnosis, was offered antidepressants. That was the medical profession's response to her condition. Moreover, the fact that it takes between two and four clinicians to secure a diagnosis is simply unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/3">As the hon. Gentleman said, the priority must be to improve the training of GPs and other members of the medical profession, to ensure that when a patient presents with the condition they receive greater understanding. It is not good enough just to look at the training of new doctors coming through the system. We need to focus on continuing professional development for those who are already in post and who are all too often failing to give their patients an adequate or accurate diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/4">The hon. Gentleman referred to some of the parliamentary questions that have been raised about fibromyalgia. Reading the answers, one cannot escape from the sense that the Department of Health has a lack of interest in the issue, so this is a good occasion for the Minister to reassure us that that is not the case. In one answer, she said:</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/5" class="indent">&quot;We are unaware of any plans the National Institute for Health and Clinical excellence may have to publish guidelines on the treatment...There are no specific plans to improve the treatment for those living with fibromyalgia.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-06-30.656"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 June 2008; Vol. 478, c. 656W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/6">In another answer, she said:</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/7" class="indent">&quot;We have made no assessment of the causes of fibromyalgia.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-04-28.148"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 April 2008; Vol. 475, c. 148W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/8">She also said:</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/9" class="indent">&quot;Information on the number of people diagnosed with fibromyalgia is not collected.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-12-17.1207"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 December 2007; Vol. 469, c. 1207W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/10">In November 2007, she said:</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/11" class="indent">&quot;We are not aware of any progress having been made into the causes of, or treatment for, fibromyalgia.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-11-21.998"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 November 2007; Vol. 467, c. 998W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/12">I am not underestimating the complexity of the condition, but those answers suggest a lack of focus. If the Minister can reassure us that there will be a renewed focus, concentrating particularly on the chief medical officer's clear statement, that would provide a degree of comfort to sufferers.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/13">The hon. Member for Reading, East talked about getting right the referral from primary care to a specialist centre. Such a problem is not unique to fibromyalgia. Someone I am trying to help at the moment is having a similar experience with a mental health condition. Persuading the NHS to make the right referral can be a real challenge. Changing or adapting the choose and book system to ensure that when any clinician across the country is faced with a patient with such a condition&mdash;or has the potential to suffer from it&mdash;they can point the patient to the right specialist centre wherever they live would be an enormous advance.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.2/14">I return to the role of NICE. It is scandalous that it has managed to ignore for two years a clear request for guidance on the treatment of fibromyalgia. We hear that the application was unsuccessful. I now ask the Minister to engage with NICE&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.10.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman accept that NICE is independent? We have discussed the various roles of NICE in this Chamber, and all hon. Members have accepted the importance of its independence. That is the issue that will cause me difficulty in this debate.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.10.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="10"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0002.htm#0905051000433">
	<p pid="b.10.1/1">I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention and I would be happy if she could offer further clarity. I fully accept the absolute importance of the independence of NICE, but is she able to request that it investigate a particular condition and consider providing guidance?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.11.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" colnum="11"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0002.htm#0905051000434">
	<p pid="b.11.0/1">The importance of NICE's independence makes things difficult. However, I am confident that the debate will assist in other ways.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.11.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="11"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0002.htm#0905051000435">
	<p pid="b.11.1/1">None the less, I should like the Minister to consider whether the governance of NICE allows her to make such a request. A request would not challenge NICE's independence&mdash;it is not an order. Will she request NICE to investigate the possibility of preparing guidance on the treatment of fibromyalgia? That would be a very valuable step for her to take.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.11.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" speakername="Bob Spink" colnum="11"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0002.htm#0905051000436">
	<p pid="b.11.2/1">I apologise for arriving late, Mr. Gale&mdash;I had another appointment&mdash;but I have taken a great interest in this matter in the House, as the hon. Gentleman will know. Does he agree that although NICE is independent, it does not live in a vacuum? The institute will be aware of political indifference in the House and prejudice in the NHS against what is a debilitating condition. Consequently, the Benefits Agency does not take the issue as seriously as it might, which disadvantages people with real, debilitating conditions who deserve better.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.11.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="11"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0002.htm#0905051000437">
	<p pid="b.11.3/1">That was a helpful intervention. NICE can take from this debate a clear message that we want it to take the condition seriously and to come up with clear recommendations for its treatment. The hon. Gentleman was right to identify, as I have, the importance of the Department for Work and Pensions taking the condition more seriously. There can be nothing worse for a person who is unable to work because they suffer from a debilitating condition than for those who provide benefits not to accept or believe that the condition is serious. That has to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.3/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire read a letter from one of his constituents detailing the problems that people often experience in accessing pain management courses. Pain management services are not part of the 18-weeks target and many people in the country are left waiting a scandalously long time for access to them. Given how debilitating the condition is, it is important that access to pain management is improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.3/3">I conclude by returning to what Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, said on the matter. His 2008 annual report could not have been clearer:</p>
	<p pid="b.11.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Chronic pain reduces the quality of life more than almost any other condition. The impact of pain on people's lives is significant, bringing emotional and financial burdens to patients and their loved ones.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.11.3/5">We need to take the impact of the condition on whole families into account. He concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.11.3/6" class="indent">&quot;A major initiative to widen access to pain services is badly needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.11.3/7">One good thing about the fact that not too many people have turned up for the debate is that the Minister has plenty of time to respond. She could provide enormous reassurance to those who suffer from the condition if she announced the clear initiative for which Sir Liam Donaldson has called.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.11.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" speakername="Anne Milton" colnum="11"  time="010:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0002.htm#0905051000438">
	<p pid="b.11.4/1">I join other hon. Members in paying tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" name="Robert Wilson">the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson)</phrase>, especially since it appears that there has never been a debate in the House on fibromyalgia. We should also bear in mind the prevalence of the condition. He mentioned that one in 50 people suffer from it, which is significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/2">I also pay tribute to the Fibromyalgia Association and its website. I have trawled many websites in my time and I was extremely impressed with the association's site. It was in nice, plain English and was useful not only to people who suffer from the condition, but to people such as parliamentarians, who quickly have to get up to speed on a number of chronic conditions. The website refers to current treatment, with the focus on reducing pain and increasing sleep which, of course, is the first thing to go when people are suffering acute pain. It also raises issues that have not yet been mentioned in the debate&mdash;the difficulties of diagnosing and treating children, and the problem of education.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/3">My hon. Friend mentioned a constituent of his who took 13 years to get a diagnosis. Without any treatment or support, doubtless 13 years feels like a life sentence of self-doubt and disillusionment with the professionals, but even the average of two years for diagnosis is a terrible length of time for people to suffer from a disease that they fear people do not believe in.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/4">The economic cost in terms of benefits is just one of the problems. I put together a flow chart of how someone with fibromyalgia might feel. It starts with pain&mdash;people do not know the origin of the pain&mdash;and goes on to reduced mobility and social isolation. The lack of diagnosis causes depression; people lose their employment and families break down. Both lead to reduced income. Furthermore, the impact on family, carers and friends is immense. Fibromyalgia and other undiagnosed chronic conditions take a significant toll on the spouses and children of the people who have them. In an ideal world, we would have increased awareness, early diagnosis and intervention, treatment, support and rehabilitation. That applies to fibromyalgia and many other chronic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/5">Clearly, the debate has done much to highlight the problems faced by fibromyalgia sufferers. The belated response from NICE, to which many hon. Members referred, was not the answer we wanted, but it demonstrates that debates such as this are useful. They raise awareness and get the Minister's attention&mdash;she has a significant brief. Sometimes, particularly at the moment, this place gets something of a knocking from the press and the public, but opportunities such as this debate are extremely important. They demonstrate that we can make a difference. We can ensure that illnesses that do not have the profile that they should have among the public and medical profession bubble to the surface, so that the Minister can take steps to address some of the issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> made some valid points on the problems with the NICE analysis and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> mentioned depression and psychological problems such as guilt. Again, those additional problems are often related to the delay in diagnosis. One cannot underestimate the impact of that delay. The hon. Gentleman read out the words of one of his constituents. As he rightly said, individual experiences successfully and evocatively encapsulate the problems suffered by thousands of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> quoted the chief medical officer on access to the management of pain relief. That problem goes much wider than fibromyalgia. More than 60 per cent. of all health care occurs in the community these days and one of the biggest challenges facing all Governments in the next 20 or 30 years will be the management of long-term conditions. That will include the management of chronic pain. It is not easy to manage, as different conditions produce different types of pain, but we must get a grip on it. I welcome the chief medical officer's words. Without a doubt, that is what will put people back into the communities where they live, re-establish their social networks, get them back into employment and increase their income. It is vital that we manage that for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/8">The hon. Member for North Norfolk catalogued the depressing responses to parliamentary questions. Like him, I have no doubt that the Minister, in her response, will sweep away the impressions that they have created. I hope that she will confirm and re-establish that the Government take the condition seriously. Specifically, what steps is she taking to ensure that the training of doctors in particular includes a greater awareness of the significance of the signs and symptoms with which patients might present?</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/9">Fibromyalgia is not the only condition of which I have heard recently whose diagnosis creates issues in GPs' surgeries. As my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East said, we are not knocking GPs; it is an indication of the huge breadth of knowledge that they need these days. As medical care and treatment become increasingly specialised, it is important that the Government take steps to ensure that GPs receive continuing professional education so that they can be confident in recognising and accessing treatment for such conditions. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> reinforced that point. It involves not only GPs but all health care workers. The issue could also, in some instances, be addressed in schools. There has never been a greater need for awareness of the implications of signs and symptoms in the minds of the public sector workers who work with and meet the people affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/10">What specific plans does the Minister have for improving the treatment of fibromyalgia and access to secondary referral? The answers to parliamentary questions have been disappointing, and I am sure that she will take steps to address that. Raising the profile and awareness of fibromyalgia among the groups that I mentioned is vital. Will she give the matter personal attention and demonstrate that the Government are aware that people with the syndrome are not getting the attention that they deserve, and will she take steps to ensure that attitudes from the Department of Health downwards change so that people get the care that they deserve and need?</p>
	<p pid="b.11.4/11">This is also a useful opportunity for the Minister to clarify the position of NICE. As she said, NICE is independent, which is extremely important. However, as I understand it, it works within a framework put together by the Government. Although we broadly welcome NICE's independence and much of the work that it does, there are situations in which access to treatment regimes is not being made available by NICE. Response is slow. I am sure that she will take this opportunity to clarify those issues and demonstrate that she can do something to improve the lot of people with fibromyalgia.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.14.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="14"  time="010:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0003.htm#0905051000439">
	<p pid="b.14.0/1">I sincerely congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" name="Robert Wilson">the hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> on securing this debate, and I acknowledge that we have not discussed fibromyalgia in the House before. I know that he has worked extremely hard to champion the cause of people living with fibromyalgia, not least as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on the condition. I am grateful to him for giving us the opportunity to debate it today. As he acknowledged at the beginning of his speech, although we meant well, the weekend situation caused us some difficulty in responding to all the points in advance. Every one of us wants the best for those suffering from that chronic, distressing, uncomfortable and painful condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.0/2">I recognise how distressing fibromyalgia can be to those living with the condition and to their families, and I know that much of that distress is caused by difficulties recognising, acknowledging and accepting the condition and its impact. Like other chronic conditions, fibromyalgia can significantly affect physical and emotional well-being and disrupt work, social and family life.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.0/3">What can we do to raise the profile of fibromyalgia? I believe that this is the start of an important dialogue, particularly with the all-party group. I think that Members, particularly Front Benchers, recognise that setting NHS must-dos is not easy, as such things affect every one of us and every part of our bodies. The Department of Health must be sparing in setting those priorities centrally because of the criticism that we often receive when we attempt to do so. I know that everyone in this Chamber is here in good heart, but it is important to put it on the record that if we were to keep giving the NHS priorities, my list, let alone those of the rest of the ministerial team, would be long.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.0/4">The Department has set up the National Quality Board to advise Ministers what priorities the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence should adopt in setting NHS standards, as well as which conditions require the Department's closer attention. The priorities are likely to be based on an objective assessment of the burden of disease and an analysis of the gap between the quality of existing services and best current practice. That is something that we can work with.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.0/5">Like other chronic conditions, fibromyalgia can significantly affect physical and emotional well-being, which in turn affects the social and financial economy of the family, the community and the country. Sadly, there is no cure, so treatment aims to ease symptoms as much as possible and improve patients' quality of life. However, we all know that care for people with fibromyalgia varies widely, as has been demonstrated by Members today, particularly those representing rural areas. In the worst cases, people with the condition are left feeling that the health care system does not recognise their illness. I can understand why patients would feel that way. I acknowledge the points made today. The case has been made that better services, quicker diagnosis and better understanding can make a major difference to the quality of life of people with fibromyalgia. I want to respond as positively as I can to the issues raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.0/6">Let me be clear that we want to ensure that people with the condition live as well as possible. Their quality of life is important to all health professionals, particularly Ministers with responsibility for health. I pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of the voluntary sector in helping people with fibromyalgia, especially FibroAction and the Fibromyalgia Association UK. It is important to raise awareness among the medical profession and the public at large, and such organisations have been at the forefront of improving knowledge of this distressing condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.0/7">As a health professional, I know that it is unnerving to be faced with a patient who knows more about their condition than I do, but in these days of technology, the internet provides access to wider knowledge and patients feel that they have more autonomy. To receive no response is thus even more frustrating. I totally acknowledge what has been said today, and I am confident that there are people present here who could enlighten us even further.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.0/8">There is comprehensive information on the care of people with fibromyalgia specifically for health professionals on NHS Evidence, which is the new web-based portal that provides all health and social care professionals with authoritative clinical and non-clinical evidence and best practice. It provides access to a range of information, including primary research literature, practical implementation tools, guidelines and policy documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.0/9">The NHS Choices website provides information to help put patients in control of their health care. It contains a number of sections that deal with fibromyalgia. There is detailed information on diagnosis, treatment and on living with the condition. NHS Choices has launched a free training programme for health professionals to improve their understanding of all the features available on NHS Choices, including how to direct patients to local services and how to access NHS accredited information about healthy living and conditions.</p>

Patients can now make choices about where they go and doctors can advise them on what might be best. Will she explore whether the system can guide clinicians to the right specialist services, wherever they are in the country?</p>

	<p pid="b.15.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I believe that best practice happens in certain areas. As with any new initiative, some places take the reins quicker and more effectively than others. We are working towards that being addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/2">Hon. Members have mentioned awareness of the condition among GPs and other health professionals. I am sure that all hon. Members are aware that the Department does not specify the content of training curricula. That is done by the royal colleges and is determined by regulatory requirements and the needs of the service. Nevertheless, we expect all health care staff to learn and to get the training and skills that they need to deal with all their patients. Obviously that includes those with fibromyalgia.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.2/1">I thank the Minister for her response so far. I am interested by the NHS Evidence web portal. I believe that it is for health professionals. Is it possible for members of the public or parliamentarians to look at what it advises general practitioners to do, so that we have a clear view of the situation?</p>

	<p pid="b.16.0/1">NHS Choices and NHS Evidence are certainly becoming more transparent and open. I am happy to investigate that for the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/2">Although we cannot direct the curriculum, we expect all health care staff to get the training and skills that they need. Education and training for health care staff is, and always has been, a priority for the Department of Health. However, we accept that there is room for improvement. As will be obvious from Lord Darzi's review of the NHS, we are looking at the content of curricula for undergraduate and postgraduate training in health and social care. That is important because of how long-term conditions will be treated in the community in future, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> said. We are looking at this matter, but we cannot dictate it.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.1/1">While I appreciate that the Government do not dictate the curricula, does the Minister not accept that there are issues, not only with fibromyalgia, but with many chronic conditions? There is an issue with GPs getting time off to do adequate training. Some GPs need training, but do not volunteer for it. There are issues for other health care staff and for nurses in particular. There can be problems with the ring-fencing of training budgets and with their use to cover shortfalls elsewhere. I am worried that we will slip backwards on training issues because NHS finances are quite tight. That would be a false economy. Money for continuing professional development is vital.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.2/1">That point was well made and it is well taken. The safety and quality that are required in the NHS cannot be provided, nor the professionalism of the health care team maintained, without the knowledge that is required. I am confident that it will be accepted that nurses are at the centre of that team and that they direct it.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.2/2">The transparency that we have asked for replaces ring-fencing and is much better than it. We will be able to see where the money is spent and whether education and training are given priority. The settlement for the NHS has been made up to 2010-11. We have always said that investment in education and training is paramount in everything we do, particularly at this difficult time. I should ask the Conservatives whether that investment will continue during the recession under their pledges on NHS funding. Some health professionals are not aware of conditions that may present at their practices in the way that they could and should be. We must correct that situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.3/1">I am grateful for the Minister's generosity in continuing to give way.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.3/2">Having just checked, I understand that NHS Evidence is a new portal that was developed primarily by NICE. Given that NICE has been fairly unhelpful in its willingness to provide guidance on this condition, does the Minister know what NHS Evidence says about the treatment of this condition or what advice it gives to GPs? Should that be investigated to ensure that NHS Evidence is giving helpful guidance?</p>

	<p pid="b.17.1/1">Moving on swiftly, Lord Darzi's review of the NHS will look at the content of the curricula for undergraduate and postgraduate training in health and social care. Fibromyalgia diagnosis and care will benefit from that work. I hope that that will give reassurance to hon. Members and to sufferers.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.1/2">The hon. Member for Reading, East will be aware that in 2003 the chief medical officer issued a newsletter to all doctors in England to raise awareness of the condition and the extent to which it affects the population. We can send out such directives, but it is difficult to monitor how they are received. However, we know that it was well received by patients and health professionals. I have asked officials to look into the feasibility of reporting that exercise.</p>

	<p pid="b.17.3/1">We want to look at what has happened with that exercise since 2003, and to report back, and we are able to repeat that exercise easily, especially given what the chief medical officer has said about pain, which has been acknowledged on both sides of the House today.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.3/2">Guidance has been mentioned, particularly the use of NICE guidance in securing improvements and reducing variations in the quality of care. As the hon. Gentleman and others have said, the Fibromyalgia Association UK has asked NICE, as part of its topic selection process, to consider developing clinical guidance on the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia. Hon. Members have acknowledged the importance of NICE's independence, but I have also been asked other questions. Both FMA UK and the hon. Gentleman have expressed concern at the slow progress in receiving a response from NICE, and I can confirm that the association has now been informed of the outcome of this topic. I have been asked whether I can intervene. Anyone can write to NICE with a request, but after matters are considered by the panel of experts, they are passed to Ministers for approval, so it is difficult for Ministers to intervene at the beginning of the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.3/3">In 2006, we launched the musculoskeletal services framework, which sets out guidance to provide high-quality and integrated services for people with musculoskeletal conditions, including fibromyalgia. The framework will help to improve the assessment and diagnosis of, and treatment for, fibromyalgia and other musculoskeletal conditions. It will encourage the giving of more support to help people to manage their own conditions, and it will get across better information and advice. It will also provide a clearer focus on the needs of children and families. The framework also supports an 18-week target for the time from referrals from GPs to the start of hospital treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.3/4">Pain is a common, distressing and often disabling symptom in many musculoskeletal conditions, including fibromyalgia. The Department of Health has already supported the work of the NHS on the management of chronic pain through a number of important initiatives, including the musculoskeletal services framework, the 18-week commissioning pathway for the management and treatment of chronic pain, and the NHS Choices website. I must correct <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> on one point: the development of the 18-week commissioning pathway for pain, in particular, assists commissioners in delivering the appropriate services for their populations. The pathway for chronic pain, which was developed with leading pain clinicians and with the consensus of a wide range of key stakeholders, will help to transform services with examples of good practice. It recommends the use of the brief pain inventory to assess the level and impact of pain, which is an important tool in assessing the patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.3/5">I worked for many years as a community and district nurse, and I observed at first hand, when I told patients that their test results had come back negative, the guilt that they experienced for feeling pain when their test was negative. My practice, at all times, was to accept that the patient had the pain that they said they had. Those are the only criteria on which health professionals should operate. These issues are so mixed, especially when psychological aspects are taken into consideration. The fact that some patients are prescribed antidepressants, rather than analgesia, as has been mentioned, shows the need for pain to be managed differently, and I commend the chief medical officer for his statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.3/6">I recently responded to an Adjournment debate in the main Chamber that had been secured by the chair of the all-party group on chronic pain, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1956" name="Anne Begg">the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg)</phrase>. I certainly think that the two all-party groups should talk together. On that evening, the chair was supported by the Chronic Pain Policy Coalition, and I met them at the end of the debate to say how important work on pain is. It should not be something that one puts up with; there is a limit. Pain is subjective, and it is important to have the correct measuring tools. I remember that one of the most distressing parts of my work as a practising nurse was to leave someone in pain without having an answer for them&mdash;that is no longer acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.3/7">Officials are currently scoping regional events to support the voluntary sector in influencing commissioners to provide better pain services locally, and to engage with professional bodies to raise awareness about chronic pain and about the needs of patients with chronic pain. The development and content of those events is being taken forward with the third sector, and I will ask officials to ensure that fibromyalgia groups are involved in that process. Once again, I thank the hon. Member for Reading, East for bringing this important issue to the attention of the House, and particularly for the manner in which he has done so.</p>

	Economic Recovery (Lancashire)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.19.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="19"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0004.htm#0905051000452">
	<p pid="b.19.2/1">It is a great privilege and pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I am delighted to have the opportunity to open this debate on initiative, skills and economic recovery in Lancashire. I shall draw on my experience as an MP for Blackpool and Lancashire, where, as Members will know, regeneration has been key to everything that we have been trying to do over the past six to eight years to broaden our skills base and opportunities. That regeneration has been not just of buildings but of human capital, which I shall focus on today.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/2">I shall also draw on my experience in recent months as a member of the Select Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills and as chairman of the all-party group on skills, which works with the National Skills Forum. Several reports are highly relevant to the issues that we shall discuss today. The Select Committee report, &quot;Re-skilling for recovery&quot;, was produced in the aftermath of Lord Leitch's report. It emphasised the role of bottom-up initiatives, which are particularly important to regional and sub-regional skills policy&mdash;Lord Leitch did not deal with that significantly in his final report&mdash;and how small and medium-sized enterprises respond to the Leitch agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/3">The all-party group and the National Skills Forum have produced two reports. The first, &quot;Closing the gender skills gap&quot;, was published in February. It looked specifically at more flexible working, which women need, as well as more child care support and cover, and challenging gender stereotypes. It focused on what sector skills councils could do, particularly in respect of apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/4">The most recent report from the all-party group and the National Skills Forum is &quot;Progression through apprenticeships&quot;, which looked at clearer mapping between diplomas and apprenticeships, easier access for apprentices to higher and further education, recognition of the need to reform funding for the over-19s, and good information, advice and guidance. All those issues are relevant to the situation in Lancashire in terms of skills initiatives and how we combat the downturn.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/5">The north-west has a strong and proud history of industrial development and manufacturing, but at present, skills levels in the region are below the average for England and Wales. That is not surprising, given global economic changes that have seen UK priorities shift away from manufacturing and towards the service and financial sectors. The north-west and Lancashire have made strong strides in those areas, but compared with London and the south-east there is still a gap to be plugged.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/6">Skills levels in Lancashire generally share the greatest similarity with the UK average for the region. Wealthier areas of Lancashire have benefited from the growth of Manchester as the economic hub of the north-west. Shifting populations have been a key factor in the past 20 years, with many people leaving economically challenged areas of the region for other parts of the country such as the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/7">The north-west matches the national average for people with low and mid-level skills but has a smaller proportion of those with skills at the highest level. The average in England and Wales is 19 per cent. with skills at level 4 and above, but it drops to 17 and 16 per cent. in areas of Lancashire and the lakes. Therefore we need to do a great deal to encourage those with higher level skills to remain in or to move to the area. That is particularly true for what, for the sake of this debate, I will call second-level towns and cities in Lancashire, although I believe that the phenomenon is countrywide.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/8">That view of skills and skills needs was confirmed relatively recently in statistics produced for the Lancashire Economic Partnership in a report on skills in Lancashire that came out in November 2008. It stressed the importance of improving the quality of the education offer, particularly at further and higher education level, of attracting and retaining people with higher level skills in Lancashire, and of upskilling the existing work force. It identified three sub-areas in Lancashire: the Fylde coast, which covers Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre; Pennine Lancashire, which covers Burnley, Blackburn, Rossendale and Pendle; and mid-Lancashire, which covers Lancaster, Preston, Chorley and South Ribble. The key issues for all those areas are changes in the future skills profile&mdash;the skills levels of 300,000 people in the region will probably need to be improved by 2015&mdash;and demographic changes, which mean that the majority of those people will have to be of working age.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.0/1">My hon. Friend mentioned areas of Lancashire but one that I did not hear mentioned in any of the three cohorts was the area of west Lancashire that includes Skelmersdale, which is an area of high deprivation. As it desperately needs investment in skills, I was sad not to hear it mentioned in the list that he read out.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.20.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="20"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0004.htm#0905051000454">
	<p pid="b.20.1/1">My hon. Friend chides me for a purpose. I saw her in the Chamber but did not know whether she wished to intervene or speak on the issue. She is absolutely right, of course. Historical problems in Merseyside have had a strong impact on that area, but as she may wish to mention later, there are some encouraging signs in that area of her constituency, not least in the construction industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/2">Big numbers need to move in terms of skills levels, and level 4 is one of them. Lancashire is well placed for that because of its proximity to large higher education institutions in Greater Manchester and Merseyside, but there are other areas such as level 2. By 2015, about a third of the demand will be from hotels, restaurants and distribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/3">It is true that small and medium-sized enterprises dominate the Lancashire economy. That means that all the problems nationally in getting small and medium-sized enterprises to train exist and may be magnified in the Lancashire area. As I have already said, and as the report points out, we need to attract new non-Lancashire graduates but also to encourage Lancashire residents who study outside the region to return when they complete their studies.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/4">One of the things that we have to ask ourselves in a recession or downturn is what we are training people for. A key task for the Government and business and education institutions during a recession is to refocus learning opportunities around enabling skills, and to give people credit, in both senses of the word, for training that does not necessarily lead directly to employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/5">Research has shown that people are most ready to believe that they can retrain or re-enter employment during the first few months of unemployment, so intervention should be made early during the economic downturn. The recent Government announcements in the Budget in that respect were very welcome. There will be significant consequences for Train to Gain. More flexibility needs to be built into the programme to ensure that many more unemployed people will be able to access training or ongoing education, and&mdash;this is particularly true for Lancashire&mdash;the Government or their agencies, not necessarily employers, will increasingly need to co-ordinate and sponsor ongoing education and training, at least for temporary periods. That will prevent Train to Gain being snatched away from people who are facing redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/6">Another report that has just appeared looks at the skills that will be needed for an upturn in the north-west. It draws on experience statistics, which are modestly encouraging for the north-west as compared with other regions. It expects a smaller contraction of the economy in the north-west than elsewhere in the UK, especially London, and a stronger recovery in 2012-13. Some of the reasons for that are resilience in the engineering and the aerospace sectors, which are very important in my part of the world; new opportunities from renewable and low-carbon technologies; and a likely increase in self-employment and micro-enterprise. I can vouch for that in Blackpool, where we have the important Get Started unit as part of the enterprise centre. It is funded from a local enterprise growth initiative and &pound;30 million that was given by the Government to Blackpool. I was told recently that, of the 300 to 400 people who came through its doors who got on to self-employment or micro-enterprises, 80 per cent. are still trading after a year. For anyone who knows the statistics for small businesses and start-ups, that is an encouraging sign.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/7">There are other initiatives in my constituency, including in Bloomfield ward, where Jobcentre Plus has been doing an interesting and positive pilot looking at a small number of people, who are nevertheless important, who have been out of the work force for a long period. It is just as well that we have taken that approach, because there is a structural weakness in, or structural challenge for, second-level cities and towns in dealing with some of the current problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/8">In January, the Centre for Cities highlighted as potential problem areas in the region&mdash;particularly in Lancashire&mdash;Blackpool and Warrington, because of leisure and distribution redundancies, with Blackpool again, and Bolton, in terms of construction. We have to recognise that although we have done fantastic things in the regeneration of our big cities over the past 10 to 12 years, regeneration has not always trickled down to second-level towns and cities; in Lancashire, for example, we are talking about Preston, Burnley and Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/9">The phenomenon does not exist just in Lancashire. On the other side of the Pennines, the same thing can be seen when comparing Bradford with Leeds. We cannot assume that city regions, however dynamic they are, will automatically trickle down their activity to such areas. It is even more important to recognise that fact in a recession. That is why public sector jobs, which are continuing to move out of the south-east as part of the Government's strategy, need to go not just to major cities, but also to second-level areas. In Blackpool and the Fylde, for example, we have enormous experience over 50 years of public sector jobs, including in the civil service. At the moment, the town council, with the ReBlackpool scheme, is redeveloping the Talbot and Brunswick gateway, which we hope may be a recipient of the net outflow of jobs from the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/10">I have mentioned already the concentration of aerospace industry in Lancashire and the importance of employment in that sector. That employment is holding up, but it is all the more important to support the supply chain and smaller companies, because the ratio of direct to indirect jobs that are dependent on the sector is anything between 1:3 and 1:5. The executive director of the Northwest Aerospace Alliance, Martin Wright, said at the beginning of April that improvements are needed to the credit available to the 1,500 small firms making up the supply chain in the region if we are to maintain the support of companies such as BAE Systems, which is involved in a major way in fighter jet-building programmes: not just the Eurofighter&mdash;the Typhoon&mdash;but the Americans' F-35 jet-building programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/11">The report also highlighted the importance of educational infrastructure in raising skills levels, especially given the rising demands of employers. Importantly, it also highlighted issues to do with retirement and replacement. Industries in the north-west&mdash;in Lancashire in particular, the engineering, chemical and nuclear industries&mdash;all have significantly ageing work forces, so it is important to look not just at how to bring new young people in, but at how to retrain and reskill older workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/12">The report also identified the need to underpin skills in the so-called STEM subjects&mdash;science, technology, engineering and mathematics&mdash;and in respect of innovation. I was encouraged to see that my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, on his recent tour of the north-west, visited a number of areas and looked at clean technologies, high value-added manufacturing and emerging technologies and, in particular, the apprenticeship centre at the Springfields nuclear fuel plant, which is one of the leading apprentice training centres in the UK. Close to 2,000 people are employed at Springfields, including a large number of my constituents. With the change and development in the economy towards nuclear power, that is a key area for development. I praise the nuclear academy at Springfields, in particular, and the sector skills council Cogent for taking those things forward and developing them. That is a bright side to what is going on.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/13">Companies looking for new staff in a recession will be overwhelmed with quality applications from people with experience and the knowledge and qualifications to match it. Recent graduates and those in entry-level jobs will thus find it more difficult than ever to push forward with their careers and may decide to stay put on a lower salary until the recovery starts. The downturn offers new opportunities not just for Government, but for businesses to consider ways in which young people may want to do some volunteering and offer them time for community courses and other activities. Those are not just things worth doing for the sake of society; they build up practical skills and experience.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/14">The downturn must not be an excuse for pushing young people out of the classroom and into the job market. Education and training continue to offer a strong route to success for young people and should not be seen as expendable. Promises or suggestions about slashing public spending as a knee-jerk reaction to a long-term problem&mdash;such as those made on occasions by the official Opposition&mdash;are not the answer. Now is the time to invest in young people entering the job market. We must not cut them adrift.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/15">I was pleased with several announcements in the Budget that will benefit us in Lancashire. The extra support to help people find work quickly, providing a guarantee of a job or training, is needed. The &pound;120 million for work-focused re-employment training will provide unemployed 18 to 24-year-old youngsters with real help for 12 months to find work and get into work in sectors with strong future local demand. The funding for traineeships in the care sector and the spreading of business rates over three years are both important initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/16">In April, the Government announced the results of the economic challenge investment fund, which was set up with the Higher Education Funding Council, for universities to bid for money to set up schemes to help individuals in business through the downturn. The total value of the 77 bids accepted by HEFC, a number of which come from Lancashire and the north-west, is important, because it is in addition to the &pound;148 million that HEFC is providing over three years to support universities and colleges to respond to employer demand for courses and training, and to raise work force skills to higher levels. The north-west is well placed to benefit from such initiatives. The regional focus of higher education in the north-west, as I shall mention shortly, is much stronger than in some other regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/17">I want to say a few words about the importance of apprenticeships in skills development and in tackling the downturn. I have already mentioned the changes in demography, which have been well advertised by the head of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, Chris Humphries, and several others. We know that demography will ensure that the profile of apprenticeships will have to change significantly from 2010, which means that we will need more flexibility in delivery. Sadly, as things stand, some of the apprentices who have been tempted into SME work under Train to Gain are now finding themselves in difficulty because of the downturn and they will need to benefit from being picked up and sheltered via universities and the further education sector, as is happening already in one or two universities in the north-west and in Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/18">Skills and apprenticeships were at the heart of the policies needed before the recession and that remains even truer now. Regeneration is about reskilling people as well as being about buildings and structures. What does that mean in practical terms? Apprenticeships need to prioritise a solid skills base for service and manufacturing in Lancashire, specifically in areas of growth, such as construction and green-collar jobs, but we must also ensure that teachers and employers regard apprenticeships as viable alternatives to A-levels and for higher education entry.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/19">The signs so far are that the Government's strong, consistent investment in apprenticeships is beginning to pay off. We can certainly say that that is so in Lancashire. There is a higher number of apprenticeship starts in Lancashire than in most areas. Work-based learning grew by 30 to 35 per cent. between 2005-06 and 2006-07 &mdash;significant and important figures. We have to consider in this mix whether a greater combination of on-work and apprenticeship activity and possibly a more modular approach in some cases will increase completion rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/20">Further education college leavers are achieving their aims at a wide level under Train to Gain in Lancashire and the north-west, but I want a much more energetic and proactive examination of some of the missing or neglected areas. The National Skills Forum's recent report on women and skills suggested that the Government should ask the National Apprenticeship Service to explore ways of increasing the number of part-time apprenticeships, which would benefit women who want to take apprenticeships but are unable to commit themselves to full-time work.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/21">The expansion of manufacturing apprenticeships and the Government's new manufacturing strategy provide the opportunity to develop green-collar jobs throughout the UK, and specifically in Lancashire. Expanding apprenticeships in a low-carbon economy is a vital first step in ensuring that we are prepared to take advantage of the upturn. Lancashire can benefit from investment in green jobs during the downturn, particularly in manufacturing and wind farm projects, a number of which are posited for Lancashire and the north-west, and will create jobs for sheet metal workers, machinists and truck drivers. Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings will require roofers, insulation installers and electricians. The issue is also about reskilling people with green credentials, as Chris Humphries of the Commission for Employment and Skills highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/22">Many of the issues that I have talked about, such as older workers, soft skills and graduate output and retention in the region, can be met via further education. I shall refer to SQW Consulting's recent report to the Northwest Regional Development Agency on the impact of further education in the north-west. It emphasises that apprenticeship starts are consistently higher than in any other region, and that the proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds at sixth form and further education colleges is much higher than elsewhere, but that 37 per cent. of businesses still believe that their existing work force has skills gaps, which emphasises the need to upskill and retrain the existing work force, particularly women. Leadership and management skills are still lower than elsewhere, despite good Train to Gain figures in Lancashire and the north-west. The north-west has the highest number at 4,900 in 2007-08, while the figure for Blackpool in the same year went up from 400 to 900.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/23">The report also emphasises the point that further education colleges are key to the economy of the north-west and Lancashire. In the north-west, they employ the equivalent of 24,000 staff, their input to the north-west's economy is estimated at &pound;1,450 million, and they bring in learners who contribute &pound;277 million per annum to the region's economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/24">The report identifies expanding delivery of higher education into further education and improving progression from further education to higher education as key to success. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/25" class="indent">&quot;Much of the growth in level 4 will come from people already in employment and often supported through an employer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/26">That means that we must think dynamically about Train to Gain mechanisms and new initiatives such as the skills accounts, as the Select Committee said. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" name="David Evennett">the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett)</phrase>, the shadow spokesman on education, were at the useful meeting of the all-party National Skills Forum when we discussed some of the suggestions from City and Guilds.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/27">Higher education portability is key to delivery. We must build on the recommendations in the Burgess report, and we must do so faster and more smartly. The Higher Education Funding Council made a useful contribution via the lifelong learning networks, but it must boost its regional presence in the north-west. I have recently returned from a visit with the Select Committee to the Washington region to study the role of community colleges, skills outreach, and development in higher education, and clearly we can do much in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/28">The north-west is well placed. We have an active North West Universities Association under a vigorous executive director, Keith Burnley. We do not have the same divide or educational apartheid between Russell group and non-Russell group universities. In my neck of the woods we have two leading vice-chancellor contributors to the debate in Paul Wellings at Lancaster university and Malcolm McVicar, both of whom have made their mark in intellectual capital and public sector training. My college, Blackpool and The Fylde, is an associate college of Lancaster university and has made a major contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/29">If we are to ensure a critical mass of higher education delivery where little existed previously, it is important that the investment already going into Lancashire, including Blackpool and The Fylde's higher education centre and the higher education hubs in Blackburn and Burnley, is sustained. It is also important that we use the experience of those with proven success in the area, such as the Open university. We should also recognise the role of union learning reps&mdash;union learning has been very successful in the north-west in getting older workers to reskill and to upskill&mdash;especially if we give them new roles in the environmental agenda, build on new rights to request training, and pass on some of that expertise to SME groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/30">FE colleges are strongly engaged with initiatives to get workless and unemployed people back to work, and I make no apology for citing my local FE college, Blackpool and The Fylde college, as an excellent example of carrying forward those initiatives to support the workless and unemployed back into work. I am sure that the Minister would not forgive me if I did not take this opportunity to say that work underlines the importance of the college's bid for a site in central Blackpool under the new capital funding programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/31">The initiatives to get the workless and unemployed back into work include the creation of the Fylde coast partnership; &pound;450,000 of funding from the Lancashire economic partnership to address employability and getting people back into work; &pound;1.2 million of Train to Gain money, which was spent on helping people to gain level 2 or Skills for Life qualifications; and national vocational qualifications in the work force, on which &pound;468,000 was spent in 2008-09. In the past 12 months, Blackpool and The Fylde college put 900 people through Skills for Life and employability skills programmes, and under the Government's local enterprise and growth initiative programme, the successful build-up initiative matches the skills of redundant or unemployed construction workers with public sector projects in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/32">The colleges responded to the need for bespoke provision for programmes that do not attract Government funding, and have put a lot of effort into creating multi-agency partnerships. A good example is their work with Global Renewables at ICI's former Hillhouse works where, in partnership with Wyre council, Jobcentre Plus and other agencies, they are helping to recruit and train 180 new, locally sourced staff to operate a new, state-of-the-art treatment plant.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/33">In all those areas there is a strong fit and connection between the activities of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, and the Department for Work and Pensions. I draw the Minister's attention to an issue that Blackpool and The Fylde college has flagged up. There is not yet full integration between programmes provided by Jobcentre Plus and those available to the unwaged through the Learning and Skills Council's adult responsiveness funding. The rules on jobseeker's allowance favour people on programmes that last 13 weeks, which do not usually lead to a qualification. In contrast, FE provision usually leads to a qualification, is not time-limited, and is free to the unemployed. However, during a recession, when fast re-entry to the labour market may be difficult, an attractive choice for any individual would be to embark on a programme of training to levels 2, 3 and 4, but that would take longer than 13 weeks and would be impossible because they would be called in by Jobcentre Plus and compelled to attend a 13-week programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/34">The head of my college, Pauline Waterhouse, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/35" class="indent">&quot;The economy in Lancashire requires many more Level 3 and 4 qualified people. Some interdepartmental coordination and the loosening of some long standing restrictions would provide a unique opportunity to respond to the recession and to meet the skills needs of Lancashire.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/36">Therein lies an important lesson, not just for Lancashire but for areas throughout the country. There needs to be&mdash;I know that this is developing&mdash;strong co-ordination between the DWP and DIUS in the way in which they tackle the economic downturn, as we stressed in our Select Committee report. The DWP may need to operate far more on a sub-regional basis, particularly if it is to address the agenda of worklessness hotspots effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/37">The same message of co-operation has to be carried through for the resilience of regional and sub-regional economies, such as Lancashire. It is about practical politics, as I said on Second Reading of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, whose remaining stages we shall consider later today. However, it is also about applying smart research, human capital and aspirations. Those pragmatic qualities have stood us in good stead in previous downturns in the north-west and in Lancashire, despite the rather negative reaction of the Government whose access to power 30 years ago we celebrate, if that is the word, today. We have those pragmatic qualities in abundance in the north-west, across Lancashire and, of course, in Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/38">This debate is about the focused support of Government and the energetic activity of local regeneration agencies such as our own, ReBlackpool, under its executive, Doug Garrett, co-operating with the council and the Northwest Development Agency. I pay tribute to the agency. Whatever people's views about the role of regional development agencies, it is widely recognised as having been one of the most focused and effective agencies in respect of regeneration and skills creation under Steve Broomhead, its chief executive. Given what I have described, I believe that the blue-sky and, if I can use the expression, green-sky thinking that can come out of this period can deliver positive prospects in Lancashire, even in times as challenging as these.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.27.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" speakername="Rosie Cooper" colnum="27"  time="011:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0005.htm#0905051000455">
	<p pid="b.27.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is vital to the people and businesses of Lancashire and my constituency of West Lancashire. I would like to add just a few comments. I believe that the Government were right in their decision and strategy to offer real help to businesses and families at this time. A &quot;do nothing&quot; approach is not an option, as we have seen in the past. There are communities that still feel the effects of those past failures, including in my constituency. However, it is a difficult balancing act that the Government have to pull off. There needs to be real help now, but measures also need to be put in place that will ensure that the British economy and local economies such as that of Lancashire are well placed as we move out of the economic downturn.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/2">I recently held a round-table discussion with business leaders in my constituency and was delighted to welcome my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government. It was an opportunity to debate the issues and challenges facing local businesses in the current economic climate. The clear message from those businesses was that they wanted targeted help and support specific to their industry to get them through this period. If we can provide that, they can be optimistic about the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/3">However, economic challenges in different parts of the country vary and require a different set of solutions. For that reason, this debate focusing on Lancashire is very important. I shall give a couple of examples that highlight the types of help and support that local businesses say they need. One company at the recent round-table discussion expressed a desire to expand its operation from its current 20 staff to 40. It wanted to offer job opportunities for local people. It wanted to invest in training and skills through apprenticeships. It sought the help of the local authority and wanted to discuss plans for expansion and job creation, as well as using empty business units, but it reported a lack of engagement on the part of the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/4">Companies that are part of the automotive industry supply chain have found themselves making people redundant. We hope that that will be only for a period of four or five months, until the larger manufacturers start to increase production again and are ordering parts from those supply companies. However, the companies are concerned that the men whom they have let go will find employment in different spheres. The companies would then lose the skills and experience of those men, which they would prefer not to happen. They need support that will help them to retain those workers. That is not only desirable but necessary. They argue for a scheme that provides training initiatives on site for a short defined period. That benefits the workers and companies by offering stability and ensuring that the pool of skills and experience is retained.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/5">Another prime example, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South referred, is the construction industry. We are well aware of the state of that industry. However, there will be a time&mdash;very soon, we hope&mdash;when construction skills are in huge demand again. We cannot allow a skills drain to happen. That would only further damage the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/6">West Lancashire construction academy, which opened in 2007, is a learning centre that supports skills development for the construction industry. It offers industry-standard facilities for new learners and provides upskilling opportunities for those already working in the construction industry. Vocational centres such as that will play a vital role in preparing youngsters and in providing the retraining that the industry will require when circumstances improve and there is once more a requirement to build homes, schools and hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/7">There will also be a &pound;41 million investment in a new build Skelmersdale college, although that is caught up in the current review. I hope that, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families has said, the review will be needs-based and that therefore the scheme will go ahead quickly. That needs to happen for two reasons. The first is to encourage students to increase their skills and learning in state-of-the-art facilities, rather than in, I am sad to say, the near-derelict current premises that Skem college has. We need to say to the talented young people of West Lancashire, &quot;You are valued and we want you to stay here and learn, and thereafter reinvest your skills in your community.&quot; Secondly, the investment is needed as a cornerstone of the redevelopment of Skelmersdale town centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/8">As I said at the beginning, I believe that there are two strategic priorities: first, to provide short-term help and support to enable businesses to continue operating through the current circumstances, and secondly to allow businesses to expand and grow, maximising the opportunities that will exist post-downturn. The investment that I have outlined is essential. Investing in skills and the work force is also essential. However, it does not fill me with confidence when the West Lancashire area appears to be, once again, not included in a discussion about Lancashire generally. That, I fear, is not a simple omission. I am rather tired of the agendas of the main towns of Liverpool, Manchester and Preston being the only discussion in town. It is very sad that when Lancashire is divided into three skills areas, as described by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South, West Lancashire is omitted.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/9">I seek an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister that the various areas of my West Lancashire constituency&mdash;right across Ormskirk, Burscough, Skelmersdale, Up Holland and Parbold&mdash;are high on his agenda. I would be grateful if he could both respond to me today and write to me thereafter, as I am sure that my constituents will be very concerned about these matters. It is vital that West Lancashire is high on the Government's agenda. We need skills and resources, and we need to say to the people there, &quot;You're valued and we need you as well as the people in the large towns of Liverpool, Manchester and Preston.&quot; It is simply not acceptable not to include semi-rural areas such as my constituency. I would be grateful for the Minister's comments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.28.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" speakername="Stephen Williams" colnum="28"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0005.htm#0905051000456">
	<p pid="b.28.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> on securing the debate and speaking with great knowledge about both his constituency and the wider region. This is the fourth anniversary of the 2005 general election. He mentioned the 30th anniversary&mdash;not such a happy anniversary&mdash;of the 1979 general election. For me, today is a happy anniversary&mdash;the fourth anniversary of my gaining Bristol, West for the Liberal Democrats. In 2005, my first party conference as a Member of Parliament&mdash;as an MP, one's experience as a conference goer changes completely from what it was before&mdash;was in Blackpool, and I greatly enjoyed my four or five days in the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/2">The hon. Gentleman talked about the structural change that has taken place in the regional economy. He is a historian, so he will know of the great contribution that Lancashire and the north-west made to this country's becoming the world's first industrial nation. However, there has been a structural change in the industries and services from which people derive their employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/3">The hon. Gentleman hinted at the fact that the role of economic powerhouse has perhaps also undergone a geographical shift, moving from the county of Lancashire and to the Greater Manchester city region. We have seen the development of the knowledge economy in the city of Manchester, with the merger of the Victoria university of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. The forthcoming BBC media village at Salford will also contribute to the growth of that new economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/4">Half the region's value added comes from Greater Manchester, but the hon. Gentleman rightly focused on the economic needs of what he called the second-tier towns in other parts of Lancashire. I hope that that would include the area represented by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">the hon. Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase>, although I do not want to intrude on the regional rivalry between Lancastrian Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/5">Like all other regions around the country, Lancashire is being challenged by the recession, and the hon. Gentleman mentioned some of the skills that will be needed to ensure that his region emerges stronger from that recession. In particular, he mentioned the skills needs of the aerospace industry, and I empathise with what he said because the south-west, which I represent, is also a world centre for that industry, and its skills needs are very similar. In particular, there is a worrying shortage of people going into engineering at the technical and graduate levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/6">The hon. Gentleman mentioned several of the things that play an important role in ensuring that more people go into engineering, such as information, advice and guidance. The issue may well come up again this afternoon, when we debate the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill on Report, and the Minister will know that it was a hot topic in the Committee that considered the Bill. It is important that young people are encouraged to go into STEM subjects&mdash;science, technology, engineering and maths&mdash;at school and to pursue them at college and university. If they do not, the country will not have the technical and graduate engineers that it needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/7">Good information, advice and guidance should also encourage more young people to go into apprenticeships. Far too often, the advice given to young people is skewed towards the vested interests of the setting in which they receive their education, such as their school, and it does not necessarily encourage them to look at other opportunities, such as taking up an apprenticeship and forming a relationship, probably, with a further education college.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned gender gaps in skills, and that is particularly relevant to engineering, because fewer than 5 per cent. of those who take up engineering apprenticeships are women. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the report on the gender skills gap by the all-party group on skills, and I was pleased to make a contribution to that report.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/9">Engineering skills are not only needed by the aerospace industry, but are essential if we are to meet our 2020 targets for green energy. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the nuclear academy in his area, but my party does not feel that nuclear is part of making Britain carbon-neutral later in this century. We need to develop green technologies, and the hon. Gentleman mentioned green-collar jobs, to use a phrase that we have taken from the other side of the Atlantic in the past few months. However, we will not be able to build wind farms and harness the wind, wave and tidal power of the west coast, which the hon. Gentleman represents, unless we have the skilled engineers to build and service the dynamos and, indeed, the more highly skilled engineers to design them in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/10">There are, of course, many national pressures on the north-west, and we are having this debate in the context of a terrible downturn in the economy. The hon. Gentleman referred several times to young people's skills needs, and I for one would be fearful of entering the current labour market on graduation or on leaving school. So far, however, the Government's response has been inadequate. The youth guarantee in the Budget offers currently unspecified training opportunities for young people, but only if they have already been unemployed for 12 months&mdash;it is obviously a relief that can come into force only after the next election.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/11">The Government's main fiscal response to the recession is &pound;12 billion of borrowed money to fund a cut in VAT, but the Liberal Democrats believe that that money would be much better used for localised capital projects. The region's capital needs were mentioned by both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady, who also talked about the construction industry and the construction academy in her constituency. Local rail schemes in my region and, I dare say, in the north-west would benefit if we used that borrowed money for capital expenditure now rather than frittering it away on small price increases.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.30.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="30"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0005.htm#0905051000457">
	<p pid="b.30.0/1">The hon. Gentleman and I will probably not agree on the nuclear issue, and I believe that we need both green energy and nuclear energy to meet the Government's requirements. Although I think that we agree on the importance of young people, does he agree that we also need to look at the needs of older people&mdash;those in their 40s and 50s&mdash;as I said in my speech? The skills base in tourism and related activities is key to keeping Blackpool's tourism going, but there is enormous scope for people coming from other jobs in their 40s and 50s to reskill and retrain in service industries such as leisure and hospitality. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we need to do more on that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.30.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" speakername="Stephen Williams" colnum="30"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0006.htm#0905051000458">
	<p pid="b.30.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I want shortly to pick up on his points about people returning to employment or finding alternative employment later in their careers. However, on his point about our energy needs for the future, we will have to disagree about nuclear, although I am glad that we agree on the need for green energy. However, the choice in terms of how we make up the gap between a carbon-reduced economy and a green economy is really between nuclear and carbon capture and storage, both of which should be temporary fixes to enable us to reach our demanding 2020 targets, on which there is now broad consensus.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/2">Part of the &pound;12 billion for the cut in VAT could also have been spent on construction and particularly on supporting the further education college capital programme. One of the last Westminster Hall debates in which I spoke was about that programme, and it was initiated by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>, who highlighted the case of King George V college in Southport, which is in the historic county of Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/3">I turn now to the subject of the hon. Gentleman's intervention. He said that many of the people whom we need to reskill and to acquire high-level skills are already in the work force. That is one of the points made in the oft-quoted Leitch report from 2007, which said that roughly 70 per cent. of the 2020 work force have already left compulsory education. If we are to meet the report's targets&mdash;we can have a debate about whether they are set at the right level or whether targets are the right way forward&mdash;and upskill our working population, we need a much more flexible approach to our learning models and to the financial help given to learners on their journey. One policy difference between the Liberal Democrats and the Government&mdash;the hon. Gentleman may have some sympathy with us on this&mdash;is over the support given to part-time learners. Many adults who will get access later in life to higher education, in particular, will do so part-time. At the moment, the financial regime does not make that easy.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/4">The Government's response to the recession that is the context of the debate needs to be more flexible, and to adapt to the way in which people now choose to work and learn. We need seriously to consider a new economic model. Now is not the time to engage in a philosophical debate about everything that may have gone wrong in the past couple of decades with the working of capitalism, but there is an important role for social enterprise in particular in our future economic model. I have been pleased recently to support many social enterprises in my constituency. Many of the historical origins of social enterprise are in the north-west of England, and particularly with the co-operative movement, with its origins in Rochdale.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/5">Whatever our approach may be to the future, I think that everyone agrees that we are in an economic emergency and we need an urgent response from the Government. We certainly need an apology from them for their role in getting us into this mess.</p>

	<p pid="b.31.0/1">I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate today. I am conscious that the Minister has many questions from hon. Members to answer, so I shall keep my remarks reasonably brief.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> on initiating this debate on opportunities, the need for skills, and the strategy for economic recovery in Lancashire. I listened with interest to his points, which were very constructive, as always in his debates. I agreed with some, and, as he will understand, disagreed with others. Speaking of anniversaries, I believe that the 30th anniversary of the election of Margaret Thatcher is to be remembered and celebrated, as she replaced a failed, bankrupt and incompetent Labour Government. Some things do not change, do they? We are 30 years on with a similar Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/3">Education, training and upskilling have never been more important than they are today in our difficult economic times. As we have seen recently, unemployment is rising quickly and it is therefore incumbent on the Government to provide those who are losing their jobs with opportunities to learn new skills or retrain during the recession. Britain's ability to come out of recession will depend on the strength of its skills base. With skilled workers, businesses are better able to adapt to changing market conditions and to innovate to identify new opportunities. Similarly, skilled individuals are better able to cope with economic turbulence.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/4">Regrettably, we start, in this country, from a weak skills base. We hear bandied around quite a lot the figures about 5 million people who are classed as functionally illiterate, and millions more who struggle with basic numeracy. One third of British adults do not have a basic school-leaving qualification. That is disgraceful and is double the proportion in Germany and Canada, with just 28 per cent. of British workers qualified to apprentice, skilled craft and technician level against 51 per cent. in France and 65 per cent. in Germany. We are also concerned about the number of young people leaving school unable to read and write to the expected standard. We want to help those who have lost their jobs, those who need new skills, and those who are in work to upskill to keep up with the changing world.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/5">I have listened with interest to the accounts of the situation in Lancashire by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">the hon. Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase> and the hon. Member for Blackpool, South and I see that some good points are emerging, but there are still concerns, and unemployment must of course be among those. I understand that unemployment in Lancashire has risen dramatically in the past 12 months. Clearly, more needs to be done to help Lancashire residents back into work. We have just experienced another Labour Budget and we are all aware that we live in an age of considerable anxiety. Money will be tight, and it is essential that it should be spent effectively and wisely. Regrettably, I do not share the hon. Members' enthusiasm for the Budget. Given the things that they highlighted about it, it was obviously different from the one that the Opposition listened to. Money has been wasted and badly spent by the Government in the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/6">We need the Budget to build confidence, within our economy, work force and businesses. That is what any Government should provide in a recession; they should make people feel more confident about future prospects and about the country's ability to get through the huge problems we face. With 11,000 people becoming unemployed in the north-west in the past month, that confidence boost is urgently needed. Regrettably, the Chancellor of the Exchequer failed to deliver. He did not use the Budget to take action on Labour's debt crisis, built up over the years. That is so dramatic and regrettable: we have the worst public finances ever recorded in the UK, and the national debt will, under Labour, soon be doubled. Perhaps the most shocking statistic of all will be the racking up of more borrowing in the next two years than was done by all previous Governments in British history, combined.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/7">That will have a bad effect on Lancashire, as it will on the rest of the country. As a result, every child born in Lancashire will have &pound;22,500 of Government debt hanging over them. Simply paying the interest on the unprecedented national debt will cost more than the entire schools budget. The Budget is clobbering hard-working families and businesses in Lancashire and across Britain with new tax rises: a &pound;1,000 new tax rise for every family, including tax hikes for responsible drinkers and motorists.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/8">Labour's tax rises for jobs and average earners are wrong. The Budget should have been set out with a different approach for a different purpose: to restrain spending, of course, but starting with waste. We would of course have looked at areas where waste could be abolished and cuts could be made in wastage and bureaucracy. We believe in helping families and savers. Helping savers&mdash;this has not come out in the speeches so far&mdash;is hopefully one way of developing an economic recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/9">We would also have introduced grants for 25,000 masters students in science and engineering, and created new training and apprenticeship opportunities in Britain. We would have unleashed more than &pound;30 billion of private sector investment in green technology companies, to create jobs. The hon. Member for Blackpool, South raised the issue of green technology, and it is important that we should be innovative, and should look forward; however, we really need an economic recovery, and we all need to work hard together to get it.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/10">Skills training, and the Government's financing of it, has been a matter of mixed blessings. There have been areas of considerable failure. The Learning and Skills Council budget has increased to &pound;10.9 billion, but there are fewer people around the country enrolling on further education courses. I am not sure what the figures are for enrolments in Lancashire, but overall they are lower than when Labour came to power. They are down almost 7 per cent. from 2006 and 17 per cent. from 2005. There is a worry about people getting into colleges to train for skills and qualifications. Adult and community courses have also been hit. They are an important route into training for many people who have been out of the labour market for some time. Yet there are 1.4 million fewer publicly funded places than there were in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.1/1">We know that the LSC has been part of the problem, and the Government are attempting to deal with that in legislation. We are not so keen on their proposed solutions to the problems that the LSC has. It has already been through two major reorganisations, and the cost of reorganisation is always a worry. The money is not then spent on what should be its purpose: training and upskilling. The Higher Education Funding Council for England employs far fewer staff and distributes &pound;7.5 billion annually; it is an efficient organisation doing a good job.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/2">Training, opportunities, funding and further education should be more available, because that is the way forward. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1623" name="David Willetts">the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts)</phrase>, have outlined measures that a Conservative Government would take to help people to retrain and upskill during this difficult time. That would be for the whole country, but obviously Lancashire would be a vital part of that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.34.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="34"  time="011:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0006.htm#0905051000460">
	<p pid="b.34.0/1">There are obviously ideological points of difference between the Front Benches on such matters, and the hon. Gentleman has been drawing some of them to our attention. Does he not agree that the thrust of what has been said thus far is that regions or sub-regions need an overall strategy to take these things forward? As I understand it, the Conservative party's policy of abolishing regional development agencies will hinder rather than assist that process.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.34.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" speakername="David Evennett" colnum="34"  time="011:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0006.htm#0905051000461">
	<p pid="b.34.1/1">The answer must be based on how successful RDAs have been. In certain regions they are causing great problems because they have not achieved what is needed. Indeed, the Government's failures in training, retraining and upskilling are reflected in the position that we find ourselves in today. Some matters need to be debated further, but bureaucracy alone will not achieve the economic recovery that we want.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/2">It is vital that we give further education colleges more freedom from bureaucratic intervention, that we streamline the funding body, and that we allow colleges to offer qualifications and courses that they feel are best for their communities. We also need to remove top-down bureaucracy from FE colleges by moving towards greater self-regulation, as has happened in higher education. That will enable us to reduce the vast number of bodies that now play a part in the monitoring and regulating of FE. We will ensure quality control in our expanded FE sector by allowing the sector skills councils to accredit courses, providing &pound;35 million additional annual funding to enable them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/3">The Government should refocus the Train to Gain budget away from providing certificates for dead-weight courses. Instead, the money should be given to further education colleges, which are more responsive to the needs of local people and local businesses. The hon. Members for West Lancashire and for Blackpool, South said how important it was for the local business community to have the trained work force that it needs, and that both their speeches suggested it does not currently have.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/4">We need to make a major investment in the adult community learning fund; as I said, &pound;100 million for much-needed courses will help people to update their skills or to gain new ones. When the Conservative party comes into government, we will also make available a &pound;100 million NEETs fund, targeting special help for the many young people who leave school only to find themselves with no education, employment or training. That is a disaster for the individuals concerned, a disaster for the economy, and a disaster for our nation. The number of NEETs is unacceptably high, and action is needed to deal with that growing problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/5">We will ensure that adult community learning support and the NEETs fund will be made available for local further education colleges, so that they can take their place once again at the heart of community life. I understand the comments of the hon. Member for Blackpool, South about FE and HE working closely together in a progression. We passionately believe in that, but we also believe that FE colleges are central to community redevelopment, through economic initiatives and retraining.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/6">With such measures in place, I believe that Britain's skills base will be strengthened. That will improve the country's ability to tackle future economic difficulties, rebalance our economy and transform people's lives. That, of course, would help Lancashire and the rest of the country. The hon. Member for Blackpool, South and everyone else could look positively towards improving opportunities for all.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/7">I believe that we need a new Government to put forward such an agenda with dynamism and commitment. The present Government is fading and failing. I listened with great interest to the speech of the hon. Member for Blackpool, South, but he is pushing at the wrong door.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.2/1">It occurs to me that Mr. Gale may have been our Job; but you shall be our Solomon.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his speech, which was typically considered, thoughtful and erudite. He has great knowledge and experience in the matter, and speaks with real authority. The general tone of the debate has been thoughtful, considered and constructive. It avoided the yah-booism to which we sometime sink. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" name="David Evennett">The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett)</phrase>, when speaking from the Front Bench, may be obliged to indulge in a little more of that, but he too made some interesting points; if I have time, I shall deal with them later.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/3">It seems obligatory at this point to make a remark about the Thatcher anniversary. I say merely that it could hardly be a more timely reminder.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/4">I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South shares the Government's view that skills initiatives can and must play a central role in helping to bring Britain safely through the global economic downturn, creating new jobs for the future. He has said as much in the House on many occasions, and also as a member of the Select Committee on Innovation, Universities and Skills. The Government have pledged to do everything in their power to bring Britain out of the recession as soon and as strongly as possible. In responding to the debate, I want to mention some of the ways in which we are delivering on that pledge, both nationally and in Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/5">The key principles of the Government's approach are clear and, I believe, uncontroversial. First, we must encourage firms to carry on investing in the skills of their work force even though they may be under considerable and even increasing pressure. We should also continue to persuade the one third of businesses that do not train their staff to begin doing so. In its open letter of last winter, the UK Commission for Employment and Skills pointed out that companies that do not train their staff are two and a half times more likely to fail than those that do. That fact has, if anything, become still more pertinent in the months since the letter was published.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/6">I know that this territory is just as familiar to my hon. Friend as it is to me, if not more so, and that he recognises, as I do, the combined impact of initiatives such as the skills pledge, the streamlining and flexing of the Train to Gain service to employers, and the rising numbers of public and private sector employers taking on apprentices. There is an obvious link, with skills helping people to find and keep jobs and helping businesses to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/7">The figures tell their own story. In less than two years, 14,460 employers have signed the skills pledge, covering more than 6 million workers. Since the launch in April 2006, more than 127,000 employers have engaged with Train to Gain, with the aim of improving the skills of their work force. The latest evaluations tell us that employers are satisfied, and that Train to Gain is having a beneficial impact on their business and their staff productivity. The number of apprentices has grown, from 65,000 12 years ago to about 250,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/8">These are all things that have been discussed many times before in the House and in Select Committee, but we should make no apology for that. Even in really tough economic circumstances, the initiatives are making a tangible change in the country's attitude to skills and the employers' role.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/9">The second key principle is that we should respond vigorously to the fact that, when redundancies loom, the better a person's skills, the more likely they are to keep their job or get another. Train to Gain has supported more than 971,000 people in beginning to learn. More than 461,000 learners have achieved a qualification; more than 359,500 learners have achieved a full level 2 qualification; and more than 32,000 learners have full level 3 achievements. As many as 89 per cent. of new learners said that their training gave them skills that would help them with current and future jobs; 34 per cent. of learners completing a Train to Gain course reported getting a promotion; and 45 per cent. of new learners reported receiving a pay rise. That is good news for people who are in work, but we are also providing special support for those thousands of workers who have been made redundant or who are at risk of redundancy&mdash;those mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper) and for Blackpool, South.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/10">The new adult advancement and careers service, announced last year, will bring together advice on employment and on the skills needed to get into work or to get on in work. In addition, a new package of support, worth &pound;108 million, is now available to those who are under notice of redundancy or who have become unemployed. It will help 40,000 people over two years to improve their employability skills, with personalised support lasting between two and eight weeks; it will help people to increase their skills and to re-enter the job market. We are making &pound;83 million available for 75,000 new work-focused training opportunities for those reaching six months of unemployment, to help them significantly increase their skills so that they can enter work. The training will be relevant to the local jobs market and will allow people to progress. Individuals will be able to continue training through Train to Gain with their new employer once they get back into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/11">The third feature of our approach is to recognise that the recession will not last for ever and that what we do now will help to determine how well we emerge from it. We must ensure that we have the skills required to seize the opportunities of a new global economy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South has said on many occasions, the Government have a vital role to play in enabling us to do that. Through public policies on taxation, regulation and expenditure, infrastructure, procurement and innovation, we can set the agenda. In short, we must help to ensure that we meet current and future skills needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/12">We are ensuring that we have the analytical and practical means to collect, process and deploy intelligence quickly and effectively, so that we can develop the skills that we need in order to succeed. We know broadly where the UK's future strengths need to lie: in, as hon. Members have said, high value-added, knowledge-intensive areas where the combination of a skilled work force, innovative companies and a research base that is excellent by international standards have maximum effect. I am talking about low-carbon, green technologies and high value-added manufacturing and engineering.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/13">My hon. Friend also reminded us that there must also be a strong local and regional dimension to the Government's efforts, and he is right to note that that dimension will not be helped by the official Opposition's policy of scrapping regional development agencies. The precise needs of one region differ from another. In my own region&mdash;the west midlands&mdash;we depend heavily on manufacturing industries, which have been especially badly hit by the global downturn. Manufacturing also provides many of the jobs in the north-west, where firms are under the same sorts of pressures. At the last count, more than 250,000 people were unemployed in that region&mdash;almost 8 per cent. of the working-age population. The same is true at county level. Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-01">1 August</phrase> last year, the Lancashire office of the Learning and Skills Council has been made aware of 82 companies making staff redundant. The majority of the companies involved employed at least 20 people. I know that my hon. Friend understands the part that the learning and skills system plays in responding to such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/14">Redundancy response groups have been set up in some parts of Lancashire, such as Blackburn, Chorley and South Ribble, with a further group planned for Preston. I sympathise with the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire that her constituency not be left out, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South had no intention of slighting her constituency or sub-region. I often feel that my own constituency, as an outer-city constituency, is squeezed between, on the one hand, the particular needs and glamorous clamour of the city centre and, on the other, the rich, suburban neighbourhoods. I know how sensitive those issues can be, but I assure her that the Government have no sense that West Lancashire, just because it might sometimes be squeezed by Liverpool, Manchester and Preston, is anything other than of equal importance. However, I would be happy to write to her about that in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/15">As well as those redundancy response groups, ad hoc groups have been formed to address the needs of particular companies and their employees. Their members include the LSC, Jobcentre Plus, the Northwest Regional Development Agency, local authorities, training providers, enterprise agencies and further education colleges. For example, at the request of the employer, a group has been put in place to address the ongoing redundancies at Leyland Trucks. My hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire mentioned the car industry, to which I, as a Member with a constituency interest in that industry, am very sympathetic. Flexible and responsive work is being undertaken in Lancashire, and across the country, to respond to the particular needs of industries such as automotive manufacturing, and the group put in place to help with Leyland Trucks has been able to identify and address some of the needs of the more than 400 people who have lost their jobs already and the 70 currently under statutory notice.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/16">Further education providers have been keen to support staff at the plant. Notable among these is Preston college, which is delivering courses in performing manufacturing operations, handling materials and elements of business improvement techniques on site. Increasingly, first-class providers will deliver flexible courses at the time needed in the place needed. The old model where a person turns up to college at 10 minutes to 9 on a Monday morning is increasingly the old model.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.0/1">I agree entirely with what the Minister is saying about the work-based delivery of learning&mdash;the statistics that I quoted underline this point. However, does he agree that it is important that further education colleges find places in the local community&mdash;I pay tribute to my own FE college, which has done this&mdash;particularly for women with work-life balance issues, so that people can access courses and training as close as possible to their homes? That way, they will not necessarily have to travel to an FE college, which might, even if only two or three miles away, pose difficulties, given the work-life juggling that some people have to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. Increasingly, the best FE colleges recognise that provision needs to be delivered where it is needed and can be accessed, and they are finding ways of doing that. However, developments in the structure and funding of FE colleges will help them to find ways of doing that on a smaller scale. In the past, FE colleges would provide courses in workplaces, or other such small locations, only if the number of learners was relatively large. It was often impractical, therefore, to offer such courses. However, that, too, is changing. Good colleges are providing courses on a much smaller scale; sometimes they are almost, but not quite, on a personal level. By the same token, as well as providing learning in workplaces and the community, which might be less intimidating for some people, increasingly FE colleges will open their buildings to community groups, outside the regular education framework, for the extension of informal adult learning. That is what we envisaged in the recent White Paper, &quot;The Learning Revolution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/2">Other learning needs are being identified through skills training analysis interviews carried out under the rapid response fund. Lancashire LSC has identified a designated person to handle inquiries about course availability from Jobcentre Plus. Those and similar small-scale, networked and integrated ways of working are being constantly developed and trialled using practical experience. They characterise the approach throughout Lancashire and the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/3">The Budget that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor published a fortnight ago will reinforce local and national initiatives of the sort that I have been describing. The measures that he announced to promote industries and jobs for the future were good news for Lancashire in particular, because the county is one of the most important centres of high-tech industry outside the south of England. The latest data available&mdash;for 2006&mdash;show that in Lancashire 3.1 per cent of all jobs were in high-tech sectors, which compares with only 0.9 per cent nationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/4">Let us consider employment in high-tech manufacturing alone. In 2006, this accounted for 19.1 per cent.&mdash;nearly one in five&mdash;of Lancashire's manufacturing work force. That is more than double the national average of 8.1 per cent and the figure of 9.8 per cent. for the north-west region. Lancashire should be well placed, therefore, to benefit from the creation of a strategic investment fund worth &pound;750 million of new money over two years. That will support priorities critical for industrial growth and jobs, as set out in our industrial activism strategy, &quot;Building Britain's Future&quot;. For example, the Government will set aside &pound;50 million of the fund to enable the technology strategy board, which my Department sponsors, to increase its capacity to support innovation in areas with high potential for driving growth, such as those mentioned by hon. Members today&mdash;low-carbon technologies, manufacturing, and live sciences and STEM subjects.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/5">Looking to the future, the Budget recognises how essential it is to have a strong science and research base to develop the ideas and skills that new, high-value, high-tech businesses will need. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor restated the Government's ongoing commitment to continued and increased funding for science and research through the protection of the ring fence around the science budget. That will be worth some &pound;4 billion next year, which is more than three times the 1997 figure.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/6">The Budget offered more help to people without a job and longer-term measures to help us prepare to take advantage of future opportunities. My hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South and for West Lancashire mentioned the need for long-term training as well as short-term preparedness. There will be additional investment of more than &pound;260 million for training and subsidies to help young adults aged 18 to 24, who are approaching 12 months of unemployment, to acquire the skills at all levels or get the experience that they need to work in sectors with strong future demand. That includes &pound;122 million for my own Department to deliver more than 70,000 work-focused pre-employment training places in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/7">The range of measures to which I have referred today illustrate the Government's activist approach. That approach is predicated on our belief that it is not good enough to stand idly by letting people and businesses suffer until things pick up again. It is our duty and our promise to take whatever action is needed to help Lancashire and the whole country cope with current problems and emerge from the recession with realistic hopes for a brighter future.</p>

	Devonport Naval Base
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.41.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" speakername="Gary Streeter" colnum="41"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0007.htm#0905051000467">
	<p pid="b.41.2/1">It is a pleasure to sit under your wise counsel, Mr. Wilshire, and I am delighted that my colleagues, the hon. Members for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) and for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) are able to attend the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/2">In July 2007, the Government announced the outcome of their naval base review. It stated that the three bases, Devonport, Faslane and Portsmouth, are to remain open but that each would be optimised to achieve savings for the Ministry of Defence, which is a perfectly laudable objective. More than 22 months have elapsed, but we are still waiting to find out what the announcement means for Devonport.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/3">Why does it matter? That the ships that defeated the Spanish armada in 1588 sailed from the mouth of the Plym and that Devonport has been providing support services to the Royal Navy since 1691 are important, but it is not only about history or heritage, although Plymouth is the size it is because of the dockyard and the naval base. It matters because Her Majesty's naval base at Devonport is a huge local employer&mdash;it employs about 2,500 people directly&mdash;and because one in 10 of all jobs in the city travel-to-work area have been created directly or indirectly through the dockyard and naval base. It also matters because the dockyard and naval base support 24,000 jobs and contribute &pound;850 million to the local economy, according to the university of Plymouth's business school, and especially because millions of pounds a year flow through the local economy because of the salaries and spending of the 5,000 men and women who serve on the frigates and submarines that are base-ported at Devonport, a significant proportion of whom&mdash;perhaps 40 per cent.&mdash;live locally with their families, spend locally and contribute to the local economy in many ways. For all those reasons, a severe pruning of our naval base or the shifting of the frigates to Portsmouth or the submarines to Faslane would devastate the local economy. It really matters to our city.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/4">Since July 2007, there have been many meetings between the Minister and his colleagues, local Members of Parliament, business and community leaders, trade unions and others. At all times, the Minister has treated us courteously and listened to our concerns with respect. On many occasions, he and other Ministers have said that the future of Devonport is secure, but I am afraid that that is an entirely meaningless statement. First, perhaps deliberately, it fails to distinguish between the dockyards and the naval base. I recognise that there is a promising work load for the dockyard in the next five to seven years, especially once the displaced aircraft carrier work begins, but that is not what we are talking about: we are talking about the naval base. Secondly, the expression, &quot;Devonport has a secure future&quot; says nothing about the scale of that future. What future does it have if the frigates and nuclear submarines go? How many people will it employ? We have been told that it will be the home of our amphibious fleet, but that is very small compared with the activity generated by frigates and submarines.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/5">We can no longer accept generalities from the Minister; we need specifics. I recognise that since the naval base review announcement, the whole of the defence procurement industry has been transformed. That is often given as the reason for the delay, which I understand. However, there have been 22 months of delay. Why do this Government find it so hard to take tough decisions?</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/6">Why have I chosen to introduce this debate today rather than at another time in the past two years? In the past few weeks, we have been beset by leaks, speculation and rumours and it is impossible for the city to continue under the current level of uncertainty. Even this morning in the <i>Plymouth Herald</i>, Tim Jones, the chairman of Devon and Cornwall Business Council, made it clear that investors are delaying their investment decisions until the future of the naval base is sorted out. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/7" class="indent">&quot;We are talking about millions of pounds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-15">15 April 2009</phrase>, the BBC ran a story claiming that senior MOD sources had told it that the frigates were going to Portsmouth. A Portsmouth MP appeared on television celebrating a great success, but the MOD said simply that no decisions had been taken. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-27">27 April 2009</phrase>, Channel 4 ran a story based on reports prepared for Faslane that were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and stated that Devonport will cease to be a submarine base after 2015. That fits in with the Minister's well-received words that even if vessels are to leave us, they will not do so for five years. The MOD said that the Channel 4 story was only speculation, but that was hardly a robust denial.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/9">That brings me to an important question: when the Minister says that no decisions have been taken, does he mean that they have not been taken by Ministers, but that the Navy Board has taken them and that they have not yet been signed off, doubtless because of political sensitivities, or does he mean that the Navy retains an open mind on all such issues? If the latter is true, why is it taking so long? Having been a Minister&mdash;a thousand years ago, at least&mdash;and having some knowledge of how these things work, I put it to the Minister that the decisions that the frigates will go to Portsmouth and the submarines will go to Faslane have already been taken, and that, understandably, he is trying to find a way to break this devastating news to the local population without causing political mayhem.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/10">Rear-Admiral Mike Wood, who retired in 2003, stated recently that he suspected that MOD Ministers were holding back on revealing the real future of Devonport because the Government did not want bad news to emerge close to a general election. Can the Minister see the damage that this level of uncertainty is causing us? If the decisions have been taken&mdash;I hope they have not&mdash;it is far better for us to know the truth so that the city can plan its recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/11">I should like to mention two other things at this stage. It is not the slightest bit good for the MOD to think that taking the frigates and submarines away would be compensated, as some media reports would have it, by the contract to decommission the nuclear reactors of the submarine fleet in Devonport. That would be a highly controversial decision. It would once again confuse the naval base and the dockyard and it would require a major dialogue with city leaders and a massive public consultation exercise before it could be agreed. Will the Minister say something about the fact that it would also require substantial compensation?</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/12">It also seems to be in Ministers' minds that if our naval base shrinks significantly, the city would gain in the medium term by the release of MOD property for commercial purposes. I must tell the Minister that without substantial Government investment, any such real estate is of limited value, not least because of contamination and location. It should not be seen as any form of compensation unless it comes with significant capital.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/13">What do we want? We in Plymouth are very reasonable people. We want the frigates to remain at Devonport and we believe that we made a compelling case for that in the naval base review. We also want the submarines to stay. Is it really wise, when there is a Scottish National party Executive who want to break away from the United Kingdom, to base our entire nuclear fleet, including our nuclear deterrent, in Scotland? If Scotland became an independent country, which I very much hope it never does, where would our submarines go?</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/14">We accept that the MOD must make savings, but not that that must happen by ripping the heart out of Devonport. We want the frigates and submarines to stay but, above all, we want to call a halt to the endless foot-dragging and uncertainty. We know that the Minister is arranging a trip to Plymouth tomorrow, but let me warn him, in the right spirit, that simply saying that no decisions have yet been made will go down like a lead balloon. It would be better for him to reduce his carbon footprint and stay in London than to travel to the south-west to tell us that there is no news.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/15">I e-mailed the Minister's office nine questions on Friday lunchtime, and I am keen to give him plenty of time to answer them today. First, will he confirm that no hidden MOD document exists suggesting that Devonport naval base will close in 2015 or at any other time? I hope that that will be an easy one to deal with. Secondly, when will the Government be able to tell us the practical, on-the-ground implications of the naval base review? What will be the job losses, savings and changes? It has been 22 months. Thirdly, which decisions in the process fall to the Navy Board and which to Ministers? When the Minister says that no decisions have been made, does that include Navy Board decisions on base-porting?</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/16">Fourthly, has a decision been taken at any level in the MOD or the Royal Navy to transfer the frigates to Portsmouth? Fifthly, has a decision been taken at any level in the MOD or the Royal Navy to transfer the submarines to Faslane? Sixthly, if we are to lose either the frigates or the submarines base-ported in Plymouth, will the Minister spell out precisely what we are to get in return? What will be the long-term operational activity in the naval base?</p>

	<p pid="b.43.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and congratulate him on securing this timely debate. He is making a strong case that has cross-party support in calling for an end to the uncertainty. Is he as worried as I am that the Trident update and the carriers will be put into the melting pot for review by an incoming Tory Government, as was widely reported last week? Is he taking his Front-Bench colleagues to task for dashing our hopes of obtaining the certainty that we need?</p>

	<p pid="b.43.1/1">I am doing my best today to get some answers from this Government, who as far as I know have at least another year to run. I hope that we will not hear for the next 12 months that the decision is very close and will be announced soon, while day follows day and it is still not made.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/2">Eighthly, how much real estate can be released from the naval base to the city as a result of the review, and how much capital will the Government provide to make any such assets viable for commercial or residential use?</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/3">During the intervention, I forgot my seventh question, which I know the Minister is keen to answer. Seventhly, if we are to lose the frigates and submarines, what implications will that have, not just for the naval base but for the work force at the dockyard? Although I do not want to confuse his answers, co-location is an important point. Ninthly, when will the MOD engage in a dialogue with the city about the proposed decommissioning of nuclear submarines? It is a hugely significant and sensitive issue. I was told by the chief executive of Plymouth city council as recently as last Friday that no real dialogue has yet started on the matter between the MOD and the city.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/4">If the Minister cannot give us the answers today, although I know he will do his best, will he at least give us a specific date when he will be able to do so? The endless leaks from within the MOD are deeply damaging. The Government have had 22 months to make the decisions. The city of Plymouth has served the Royal Navy since 1588, and we are seeking a long-term future. We deserve to be treated better than this.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">The hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> has provided me with a number of questions. I counted 10; he said that he had only nine, so I think I counted his final demand for a date as an additional question.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.2/2">The hon. Gentleman is right to mention the history of Devonport and the fantastic support and service that it has provided for the Royal Navy over the centuries. He is also right to discuss the importance of the employment that the naval base provides for the city and the economy of the wider area.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.2/3">The hon. Gentleman's frustration is understandable. I get it in the neck from my hon. Friends as well as from him for not being able to be clear as quickly as everybody understandably wants. All I ask is that he and others accept that I am doing my best to plough through the situation and get to a point where we can be as clear as possible as soon as possible in an enormously complicated situation. It is okay for him to refer to 22 months, but he knows&mdash;I think he acknowledged it in his speech&mdash;that an awful lot has happened in those 22 months. We have had to re-profile the carriers, for example, and the MOD equipment review has taken place. Both have affected our ability to enter into agreement and know exactly where we stand with regard to the situation at Devonport and elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="b.45.0/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> for securing this timely debate. My concern is that if a statement is forthcoming to finalise and explain exactly what is going on, we want something more than simply, &quot;Your frigates are going to X, Y or Z.&quot; We need to understand the evidence behind the decision. At the moment, that is not clear. What is the business case, and why does the Navy feel that the frigates need to be moved out of Plymouth?</p>

	<p pid="b.45.1/1">I understand that people will not accept it. I do not see why anybody as steeped in the issue as my hon. Friend would accept decisions without evidence, backup and reasoning. If decisions are taken and we attempt not to provide that evidence, I am sure that we will hear about it in no uncertain terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/2">On employment, the naval base review said that we need all three naval bases, but that we need to optimise those naval bases to increase efficiency. The hon. Member for South-West Devon and others have said that they do not disagree with that in principle, but they want to know the detail. They are hearing rumours and believing stories that the situation in Devonport will be decimated. I do not see that, and I do not believe it to be true.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/3">The first of the hon. Gentleman's questions was whether there was some document lying around in the MOD saying that Devonport would close in 15 years. I have never seen any such document, and I am as steeped in the situation as in any other. I wind up reading the <i>Plymouth Herald </i>more often than the <i>Coventry Telegraph </i>nowadays, so I know all the stories being peddled about the situation. There is no such document or plan. I am not aware that anybody in the MOD has ever pushed the point of view&mdash;certainly not while I have been Minister&mdash;that Devonport will close within 15 years. I am completely and utterly unaware of any such information.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/4">With regard to the employment situation, all the scenarios that we are considering lead us to believe that Devonport will have roughly the same size work force going forward as it has now. There will be no substantial change. There might be some slight decrease or increase, but there will be no substantial change in the size of the work force in Devonport in any of the scenarios that we have been considering to bring to a conclusion all the details flowing from the naval base review.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/5">Of course, things will change over time. They cannot stay as they are. If we are to optimise the benefits of proper management of all our naval bases, things will inevitably change. The hon. Gentleman has seen change. Plymouth has changed, and has benefited from that change. It is not only an area of supply for the Royal Navy; it produces equipment such as Jackals in what were recently naval base buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/6">The hon. Gentleman must expect change. I think he knows that there will be change, but under all the scenarios that we are considering, the work force would stay roughly the same size.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/7">The hon. Gentleman has asked a series of questions about whether decisions have been taken, when they will be taken and when they can be known about. I am not in a position to make a detailed announcement. I do not want to go to Plymouth to be mauled because I cannot make a detailed announcement. I would like to be able to put a bit more information into the public domain, but there are many moving parts in the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/8">We must try to reach a long-term commercial arrangement with Babcock, which is a private company. Those negotiations are worth a lot of taxpayers' money and we cannot do or say anything that would detract from our negotiating position. We want a long-term agreement with Babcock and we expect to be able to enter into one before the end of the year. We might be able to clarify some of the issues ahead of the terms of business agreement. Two issues have to be deconflicted: I cannot confirm things if it would weaken our position in our discussions with Babcock to do so, but I want to give assurances to the local community that things will be okay in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/9">The hon. Gentleman talks about the leak a couple of weeks ago that spoke of all the frigates moving to Portsmouth. He said that he used to be a Minister, so he knows that it would be pretty stupid for a Minister to say that a decision had not been taken when it had. There is no final decision on moving frigates from Plymouth to Portsmouth. He should understand why that is. I gave a commitment that there would be no base-porting changes for five years. That was reinforced by the Secretary of State on a recent visit to Devonport. We were trying to give people a degree of assurance that there was no imminent decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/10">The hon. Gentleman knows that a future service combatant&mdash;I get criticised for using the jargon&mdash;will replace the Type 22 and Type 23 frigates in the long term. However, that is still conceptual. We have not decided how many of what kind of variant there will be. We do not know where the new ships should be based because we do not know what complexities they will have. If all future service combatants had to be based elsewhere, it would make sense to move the existing frigates to the new location so that there was not a step change with the change of ship. There has been no decision on whether all the variants of the ship will be based in Portsmouth or Devonport. The guarantee stands that there will be no base-porting changes for five years. I hope to say more about that ahead of the terms of business agreement, and I am sorry that I cannot say more today.</p>

	<p pid="b.46.1/1">If we decide that all future service combatants and existing frigates will move to Portsmouth, we will have to study that and explain it, not least to my hon. Friend. We would have to give reasons for that decision. I would not shirk from that. I accept that we would have to do that if such a decision were taken. However, that decision has not been taken. I will clarify the situation as soon as I can. I am sorry that I cannot clarify it today.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/2">The hon. Member for South-West Devon tends to dismiss the amphibious force. The number of ships that have sailed in and out past Plymouth sound in the history of Devonport is an absolute glory. The amphibious element is an important part of our force structure and it will stay in Plymouth. I will try to reinforce the amphibious element in Plymouth by moving the landing craft of the Royal Marines there, along with the training. If that is possible, it will be done as soon as possible. Those landing craft could then be collocated with Ocean, Bulwark, Albion and the rest of our amphibious capability in Plymouth. That direction of travel is an important guarantee to the city. Flag officer sea training will also stay in Plymouth. Moving it has not been considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.0/1">The Minister has indicated that the time scale might be moving. He said he hoped that the deal with Babcock would be in place by the end of the year and that he might be able to give more information on base-porting before then. However, on a visit to Plymouth in early March, the Secretary of State for Defence&mdash;the Minister's lord and master&mdash;said that the decision on the future of the naval base would be made within weeks. The <i>Plymouth</i><i> Herald</i> stated at that time:</p>

	<p pid="b.47.1/1">I am not trying to do that, nor am I trying to be opaque. We might make further announcements fairly soon. If we can, we will. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that the situation is not just political, but economic. The city needs to be able to plan for the future. We want to be part of that future and help the city to be successful. We must plan with the city. If I can make announcements soon, I will do so. I cannot guarantee that I will because of the complexities of the situation. I believe that I will be able to give a degree of clarity ahead of the terms of business agreement negotiations, but I am not suggesting that nothing will be said ahead of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/2">It is unfair of the hon. Gentleman to say that we do not talk with the city about these things. There has been a long-standing consultation process. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> set up the strategy group that involves local businesses and the city council. We participate in it. I hope that some land will be released under Project Roundel. The hon. Gentleman should not dismiss that. Devonport naval base covers a huge tract of land. Under any scenario, much of that would not be put to good economic use for military purposes alone. Land should be released to the city so that it can make good use of it. That is what we want to do. My hon. Friends the Members for Plymouth, Sutton and for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) and the hon. Member for South-West Devon are constantly exploring what Government funding might be available for that.</p>

	Health Food Products (Channel Islands)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.48.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="48"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0008.htm#0905051000481">
	<p pid="b.48.1/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to raise my concerns about food supplements and herbal remedies being marketed in this country by companies based in the Channel Islands. This issue has been raised before, in an Adjournment debate in June 2007, by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>. As the problem continues to grow, however, I felt it should be raised again. My attention has been focused on this issue by the Health Food Manufacturers Association, and my concern is shared by many hon. Members, including those who have signed my current early-day motion 152, and those who signed early-day motion 357, which I tabled in the previous Session.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/2">Most, if not all, health food businesses based in the Channel Islands market at UK consumers food supplements and herbal remedies that either contain illegal ingredients or are marketed using claims that would be illegal if those products were placed directly on to the UK market&mdash;sometimes both. Many right hon. and hon. Members, and certainly millions of our constituents, will have received or seen catalogues that market vitamins, minerals, food supplements and herbal remedies, but while such marketing is tightly regulated in the UK, such regulation does not cover operators based in the Channel Islands. That is particularly worrying because many people in the UK assume that our consumer protection laws also cover the Crown dependencies, but that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/3">Some of the products marketed by Channel Island operators contain ingredients that are considered illegal in the UK, including ingredients such as DHEA, or dehydroepiandrosterone&mdash;I apologise for my difficulty in saying that, as I am a chemist.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.48.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1832" speakername="David Wilshire" colnum="48"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0008.htm#0905051000482">
	<p pid="b.48.2/1">I think that we would all have trouble with that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.48.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="48"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0008.htm#0905051000483">
	<p pid="b.48.3/1">I shall call it a steroid, Mr. Wilshire, which is a class C drug in this country, believe it or not. Another such ingredient, which I can pronounce, is melatonin, which is categorised as a medicine here.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/2">Another aspect of the problem is that some products are marketed with illegal claims, including medicinal claims. The use of unsubstantiated medicinal claims is especially worrying because it targets vulnerable people. The illegal medicinal claims include claims relating to cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia and diabetes. It has been claimed that probiotics</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/3" class="indent">&quot;significantly decrease a risk of cancer&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/4">or that the product Chelogarde</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/5" class="indent">&quot;reduces heart disease by up to 50%&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/6">Such medicinal claims are extremely dangerous, as they can discourage people from seeking proper medical advice, and so put their health at serious risk. In the UK, we have strict regulation to prevent that, and no medicinal claims may be made for products that do not hold a marketing authorisation under the Medicines Act 1968. The European Union has recently introduced a raft of directives and regulations, which apply to foods in general, that are designed to protect consumers. They include the food supplements directive and the regulation on the use of nutrition and health claims for foods, the short title of which&mdash;the nutrition and health claims regulation&mdash;is more widely used.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/7">The Government are also in the process of implementing the traditional herbal medicinal products directive, which is intended to further protect consumers. The UK has implemented, or is in the process of implementing, all that legislation, with which responsible UK operators have to comply. As my hon. Friend the Minister will be aware, I have serious concerns that much of that legislation is unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome on companies in the UK, but we are obliged, by our treaty obligations, to implement it.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/8">Our Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the MHRA, and our trading standards officers, have powers to take steps against UK operators that contravene those regulations and directives, but they do not have jurisdiction in the Channel Islands. Therein lies the crux of the problem. The Channel Islands do not have similar legislation, and so companies in Guernsey and Jersey, in particular, are able to abuse the situation and market vitamins, minerals, food supplements and herbal remedies, which may contain illegal ingredients, to UK consumers using illegal claims. Clearly, operators are keen to take advantage of that lack of regulatory control. In the last decade, the turnover of Channel Island businesses that deal with such products has risen from zero to an estimated &pound;100 million today, and the business is still growing. Meanwhile, the turnover in the UK sector has stagnated in comparison.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/9">The problem is further exacerbated by the inequities of the low-value consignment relief, or LVCR, regime, which allows companies based in the Channel Islands to avoid paying VAT on deliveries in which the contents are valued at less than &pound;18. I shall not go into the details of that issue, as it was raised in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-27">27 January</phrase> by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase>. However, the freedom to make illegal medicinal claims with impunity, combined with the price advantage generated by the LVCR regime, has led to Channel Island operators capturing a substantial share of that market in the UK. That not only poses a serious threat to UK consumers, but gravely undermines the responsible UK suppliers and health food businesses that continue to make considerable investments to comply with the law.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/10">That unlevel playing field has arisen because the Channel Islands are not members of the EU. The relationship between the Channel Islands&mdash;as well, incidentally, as the Isle of Man&mdash;and the EU is set out in protocol 3 to the Act of accession that was annexed to the 1972 treaty of accession, by which the UK became a member of the then European Economic Community. Even though the Channel Islands are not members of the EU, some EU laws apply to them. That was confirmed in May 2007, when a Minister in the other place acknowledged:</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/11" class="indent">&quot;The United Kingdom (UK) view is that the nutrition and health claims directive, the food supplements directive and the medicines directive remove barriers to the free movement of goods within the European Union...it is our view that the directives should apply to the Channel Islands under protocol 3&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-05-23.113"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>23 May 2007; Vol. 692, c. WA113</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/12">However, despite the view that the Crown dependencies should implement the legislation in question, only limited progress has been made. The Medicines (Human and Veterinary) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2008, received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-10">10 December 2008</phrase>, after a protracted delay. Although the introduction of that law in Guernsey is a very positive step, it is not fully consistent with the EU medicines directive. That was confirmed by the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, when she said, in response to a written question:</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/13" class="indent">&quot;The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has reviewed the draft&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/14">as it then was&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/15" class="indent">&quot;Medicines (Human and Veterinary) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2008 in respect of human medicinal products and believes that it is not consistent with the Medicines Directive 2001/83/EC.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-03-27.414"><i>Official Report</i>, 27 March 2008; Vol. 474, c. 414W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/16">The Government of Guernsey now have to bring forward secondary legislation to implement fully the EU medicines directive. That must be an absolute priority, and should take place as soon as possible. Only when Guernsey has fully implemented the directive will it be able to prohibit and allow enforcement action to be taken when food supplements are marketed with medicinal claims. I am keen to hear the Minister's view on what kind of assistance is provided to the Government of Guernsey in that respect. Is there a time scale for Guernsey to bring forward such secondary legislation? Guernsey has not made any firm commitment to a timetable for bringing forward other legislation, including the food supplements directive and the nutrition and health claims regulation. What steps are the Government taking to ensure that that happens?</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/17">Let me turn to Jersey. Although Jersey has some basic medicine law in place, as is the case in Guernsey, it does not meet the obligations set out by the EU medicines directive. I understand that discussions on the implementation of the EU medicines directive with the officials in Jersey are only beginning. I am keen to know what discussions have already taken place on that issue in Jersey and whether any further meetings are planned for the near future. Will my hon. Friend say what resources are provided to the Government of Jersey to assist them in implementing the EU medicines directive?</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/18">Encouragingly, Jersey has made a commitment to implement the food supplements directive and the Nutrition and Health Claims (England) Regulations 2007 as part of the major update of food safety legislation that is under way there. I am aware that my hon. Friend's colleague from the Ministry of Justice, Lord Bach, visited Jersey on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-17">17 April</phrase> this year. Based on the feedback from that visit, this debate is extremely timely. Is the Minister aware whether there is an agreed time scale for when the Government of Jersey will bring forward such legislation?</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/19">In terms of drafting legislation, I appreciate that there are limited resources available to Crown dependencies, but I am anxious to be reassured that our Government are doing everything in their power to encourage the Channel Island authorities to meet their obligations and implement these regulations effectively and without any further delay. I am also anxious to be reassured that our Government and their officials in the relevant institutions will work with other UK authorities and businesses, including the postal authorities, advertising regulators, periodical publishers, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and others, to ensure that every avenue is explored to protect UK consumers and the responsible UK health food businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/20">I am keen to know what discussions the Minister or his colleagues have had on the issue with any of the authorities I have just mentioned. Dealing with this matter is not just about implementing the legislation; it is about effective enforcement. I would like to press the Government and the relevant authorities to provide the necessary assistance to the Crown dependencies to enable them to enforce legislation to protect UK consumers. There is a pressing urgency about the matter because the European Commission is about to introduce maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals under the provisions of article 5 of the food supplements directive, which may limit the potency&mdash;and hence the attractiveness&mdash;of products in the UK market. That would obviously give the Channel Islands' suppliers yet another potential advantage over the UK market.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/21">The nutrition and health claims regulations threaten to restrict even further the ability of responsible mainland suppliers to make a range of currently acceptable modest and accurate claims about their products. That will give companies operating in the Channel Islands yet another advantage over UK-based suppliers. By 2011, the issue will have got worse because, when the directive on traditional herbal medicinal products is fully implemented, herbal suppliers on the mainland will be unable to compete in that business area with their competitors in the Channel Islands. So, urgent action is overdue, and I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to give me an assurance today that there will be no further intolerable and unjustifiable delays in requiring our Crown dependencies to address these matters by replacing the earlier promises that they have given, which have not entirely been maintained, with legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/22">I should add that the current economic recession is making it even harder for UK companies to stay in business, especially when faced with such aggressive and unfair competition. What is more, it is a constitutional quirk that, if the European Commission becomes aware of the failure to enact and implement appropriate legislation in the Crown dependencies, it is not the authorities of the Crown dependencies but the British Government who would face enforcement action. I am sure that the Government wish to avoid that.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/23">I am grateful that my hon. Friend the Minister is present this morning. I fully understand that the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South, cannot be here because she is dealing with the swine flu outbreak. I look forward to my hon. Friend's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.51.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="51"  time="013:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0009.htm#0905051000484">
	<p pid="b.51.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> on taking up the issue, on obtaining the debate and on putting the case so strongly&mdash;he has done so not only today but on previous occasions. He has a long track record on pursuing these issues, and rightly so. I hope that I can give him the reassurances that he has sought. Before I turn to the main focus of the debate, which is the importation of health food products from the Channel Islands, it might be useful, because my hon. Friend raised the matter, to set out the constitutional position of the Crown dependencies&mdash;not just on this issue, but generally. That is the backcloth to which the strictures he gave at the end of his remarks relate.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/2">Protocol 3 to the treaty of accession to the European Community governs the relationship between the Crown dependencies&mdash;the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man&mdash;and the European Union. It does not govern the relationship between the UK and the Crown dependencies, or between the UK and the European Commission. The term &quot;Crown dependencies&quot; is unique to the relationship that the UK has with those three territories.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/3">For the purposes of this debate, key points about the status of the Crown dependencies need to be made. Unlike the overseas territories, the Crown dependencies are not part of our colonial past and they have no representation to Government at Westminster. They are not part of the UK; they are self-governing dependencies and they have their own directly elected legislative assemblies, their own fiscal and legal systems and, indeed, their own courts of law.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/4">We are constitutionally responsible for their defence, international representation and good governance. The Crown dependencies are not part of the European Union, but they have a relationship with it. As my hon. Friend said, protocol 3 defines the extent to which the three islands are part of the European Union. Under that agreement, the Channel Islands are part of the customs territory of the Community and they are part of common customs tariffs, levies and agricultural import measures, which apply to trade between the Channel Islands and non-member countries, so although there is free movement of goods and trade between the islands and member countries, other Community rules do not generally apply. I have set out that relationship to emphasise the constitutional position and thus who is responsible for the enforcement of directives.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/5">Let me turn specifically to the importation of health food products from the Channel Islands. We are talking not about commercial imports, but about personal imports for use by individual consumers. It is important to be clear that businesses importing products for marketing in the UK from the Channel Islands must comply with the relevant UK law. The Ministry of Justice provides the official channel of communication between the UK and the Channel Islands. As my hon. Friend mentioned, Lord Bach, the Minister responsible for the Crown dependencies, visited Guernsey in February 2009 and Jersey only last month&mdash;nice work if you can get it, if you do not mind my saying so, Mr. Wilshire. While Lord Bach was there, he discussed the implementation of the food supplements directive and the nutrition and health claims regulations during meetings with the authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/6">The Food Standards Agency is the Government organisation responsible for the legislation that governs health food products&mdash;namely the food supplements directive and the nutritional health claims regulations. The Food Standards Agency has received representations from the UK supplements industry in relation to their concern that large volumes of food supplements, which would be regarded as illegal in the UK, are being sold to UK consumers by companies based in Jersey and Guernsey. Those concerns relate particularly to the use of medicinal claims for unlicensed supplements.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/7">The agency's legal advice is that because the aim of the food supplements directive is the free movement of goods within the European Community, the Crown dependencies will have to implement the provisions of the directive and ensure that food supplements produced in and supplied from those territories are compliant with the directive. That advice also applies to the nutritional and health claims regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/8">The FSA has collaborated effectively and engaged productively on matters relating to the Channel Islands with a range of stakeholders, including the food supplements industry in the UK, the Ministry of Justice, the Treasury, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and, of course, the Governments of Jersey and Guernsey.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/9">A meeting was held between the agency and officials from Jersey and Guernsey to discuss matters face to face in April 2008, at which representatives of the Jersey Government indicated that they were in the process of implementing food safety legislation that will include the provisions of the food supplements directive and the nutrition and health claims regulations. Guernsey Government officials were considering implementation of national legislation to enact the provisions of the directive and the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/10">Jersey and Guernsey also agreed to work with companies based on the islands to prevent the sale of food supplements that are illegal in the UK. In January this year, the FSA was advised by the Government of Jersey that work is still progressing under its programme to update Jersey's food safety legislation. Jersey is also working with Customs to identify importers and exporters of health foods in order to investigate their products. The Jersey Government are working with trading standards to prevent Jersey businesses making inappropriate health claims, and with the Jersey Economic Development Department on the possibility of revoking the licences of food business operators who may damage the reputation of the island.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/11">The Government of Guernsey advised the FSA that discussions at official level on implementing the food supplements directive and the nutrition and health claims regulations are ongoing, but that priority is being given to drafting the secondary legislation that is necessary to ensure that the EC medicines directive, which prohibits marketing food supplements with medicinal claims and which allows enforcement action to be taken, is fully implemented. I am pleased to tell my hon. Friend that the timetable is for that legislation to be implemented this summer. That is a positive move, the outcome of which will address some of the key concerns raised by the supplements industry and by him.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/12">A request for more drafting time will be put forward for consideration by the Jersey Government's Council of Ministers as part of its 2010 legislative programme. I am able to report that further progress to my hon. Friend. There will be further dialogue in 2009 with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to resolve outstanding technical issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/13">In April, officials from Guernsey informed the Ministry of Justice that a detailed analysis of the implementation of the legislation is under way so that the board at the Health and Social Services Department can decide on the appropriate way forward. The pace of progress in respect of food supplements will therefore begin to increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/14">Apart from implementation of legislation, concerns have been raised by the supplements industry about products on sale in the Channel Islands that would be considered illegal in the UK. The FSA brought those concerns to the attention of officials in Jersey and Guernsey who have undertaken discussions with companies. They have made several visits to companies to ensure that they are fully aware of the concerns. FSA officials continue to liaise with officials in Jersey and Guernsey to keep abreast of developments and to direct action against companies that have been identified as marketing illegal products.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/15">I have listened to my hon. Friend's contribution and I will draw the points that he made to the attention of ministerial colleagues in the Ministry of Justice, because there are important matters that they need to be aware of and take forward. I reassure my hon. Friend that the Government recognise the concerns of the supplements industry that he raised today. I emphasise my thanks to him for bringing them forward in a variety of ways, including today's debate, particularly given the forthcoming setting of maximum levels for vitamins and minerals, and the finalisation of the positive lists of vitamin and mineral sources in the food supplements directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/16">We recognise the risk that further market share could be opened up for companies trading in the Channel Islands if legislation is not fully implemented, and recognising that risk drives us all to ensure that we get the job done as soon as possible. The FSA has regular meetings with the supplements industry to maintain an open dialogue on supplements and health claims, and I urge it to do so on the issue being debated today as well. I have also asked the FSA to obtain a timetable for completion of the work in Jersey and an update on Guernsey's intentions in this regard, and I will forward that information to my hon. Friend as soon as it is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/17">My hon. Friend wanted reassurance that we are aware both of our responsibilities and of the need for action on this matter. I give him that assurance today, and I hope that we will be able to take forward the action that he requires at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	Bus Regulation
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.55.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="55"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0009.htm#0905051000485">
	<p pid="b.55.2/1">Good afternoon, Mr. Wilshire. I am grateful for the chance to raise an issue that has been something of a perennial for me in the 12 years that I have been a Member of Parliament, although it is particularly timely in view of what is happening in my area at the moment, following a local development on bus services which I will describe to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/2">I want to flag up a question and I should be grateful for a response from the Minister. Flagging it at the start may give him the opportunity to seek inspiration, as it were, as I progress. I want to know whether bus companies can subsidise less profitable routes with more profitable ones. The local company, First bus, has withdrawn a service on the grounds that it was not making enough money. My constituents wrote to First, asking, &quot;Why don't you subsidise this service with one of your city centre routes on which you make a lot of money?&quot; and it replied:</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/3" class="indent">&quot;We are not able to cross-subsidise routes. The Transport Act does not allow busy city routes to support less-used routes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/4">It would be helpful if the Minister commented on that response by the bus company and said whether its understanding of the law in this regard is correct, because I think the situation may be slightly more subtle than it says.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/5">Stepping back to give the context for this debate, I represent a part of south Gloucestershire with many small towns and villages where there is heavy car usage and bus services are, on the whole, pretty poor. If people live on one of the main arterial routes into the centre of Bristol, they stand the best chance of getting a bus service, but if they live in a village or if they need to travel in the evening, on a Sunday or out of hours to get to a hospital appointment, for example, they have serious problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/6">One local service, which was an express, or X, service&mdash;the X27&mdash;went down the M32 motorway from Yate in my constituency, past a village called Iron Acton, through Winterbourne and into the city centre. That was a popular local route. Bus changes were announced by First not many months ago. It originally proposed withdrawing its fast bus services down the motorway, but we all thought that that was ludicrous. There has been talk of bus lanes and special methods of getting buses into the city centre quickly, but here the bus was planning to take some of its express routes off the motorway. We fought a campaign and there was an extensive period of public consultation, and, to be fair to First, it revised its plans in light of that consultation and campaign, and we were able to keep some of the express motorway services going.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/7">Given that experience not many months ago, we were all horrified to get a letter in March, telling us that in eight weeks First would stop running the X27 service. There was no consultation and minimal warning. The local authority found out about it pretty much at the same time as the rest of us. The bus company just said, &quot;Things have turned down; we're not making the money we want to on this route. We're pulling out.&quot; An awful lot of people were unhappy about that. This company does not have the best local reputation. We ran an online petition and many of my constituents made comments, saying, for example:</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/8" class="indent">&quot;First buses truly are Worst buses!!!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/9">and</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Shame on you, Justin Davies&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/11">the managing director&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/12" class="indent">&quot;and your company, you have returned us to the dark ages when only those who can drive have the freedom to get around and live their lives!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/13">The Bristol<i> Evening Post</i> regularly gets a front-page story from the latest outrage perpetrated by First bus on the benighted residents of Bristol and south Gloucestershire.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/14">There is a history of poor service and people are unhappy about a lot of things, but First took its performance to a new level by announcing with the minimum possible notice that the X27 route would be taken away. That impacted on a range of people. In the context of social exclusion, some of the comments from my constituents are germane. One lady wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Please do not cut the X27. I will be totally unable to get an alternative bus as I am 84 and this is the only bus which goes from outside where I live...I will be unable to go anywhere, which is very depressing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/16">The elderly, who are heavily dependent on this service, were disappointed. Somebody said:</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/17" class="indent">&quot;Just got my bus pass&mdash;no bus.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/18">Older people were particularly affected by all this, but they were not the only ones. Young people were also affected. One young student responded to a survey we did via Facebook, saying, &quot;I'm doing my A-levels and you're going to cut the bus on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-10">10 May</phrase>. How do you expect me to get to my exams?&quot; Nobody had thought about that. First just said, &quot;We're not making money. We're pulling the plug in eight weeks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/19">I am worried about the structure of our bus services. It is fine to say, &quot;Well, they're just in it to make money. They make money and we subsidise the rest.&quot; But unless there is long-term stability planning&mdash;for example, in this case people know that a service can be cut with eight weeks' notice&mdash;how will there ever be long-term growth in bus usage? People plan their jobs, their studies and their lives around transport arrangements. If bus companies can just pull the plug with eight weeks' notice, that will not give anybody confidence to plan their lives around public transport, and yet another person will assume that the only thing they can do is use the car. If we had not been able to do something about the X27, the young woman doing her A-levels said that she would have had to move out of her home for the period of her exams because there was no other way for her to get to her studies.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/20">One woman wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/21" class="indent">&quot;My daughter...is in her final year of A-levels and works long hours in the library. Getting into college quickly makes her long day much more bearable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/22">Interestingly, she talks about the quality of service offered by the bus company:</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/23" class="indent">&quot;Over two years of poor time-keeping, often rude and aggressive drivers and overcrowding on the X27...A company with such a poor name for service should be doing its utmost to improve customer relations, not anger its client group of travellers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/24">So there is a saga of poor quality of service and unpredictability, and now the company is pulling the rug out from under people at the last minute.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/25">We launched a campaign to get South Gloucestershire council to subsidise the route. That has happened after our successful campaign. The council agreed to step in to provide money for a reduced service once an hour for six months, but, of course, in six months we shall have the whole thing again and people will not know where they stand or whether they can rely on the service beyond the six-month period. I welcome the fact that the council will promote the service, which First should have been doing anyway, because often people stand at a bus stop along that route and do not even find timetable information. For instance, when First announced that it was planning to scrap the service, or prevent it from using various stops, it did not even put information on the bus stops.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/26">That shows the contempt with which First treats its passengers. It can do that because it is a monopoly. In theory, Steve Webb Buses could set up and run along the same route, but we all know that First will be the only one that does so. The irony is that First won the tender for the subsidised service, so it still ends up running it anyway, but is paid by the council to do it. I cannot help feeling that we have got to the worst of all worlds in respect of buses in the last 20 years, because in many places we do not have a public monopoly, which at least could be in the public interest, or vigorous private competition, which might be efficient, but we end up with a private monopoly, which is probably the worst of all worlds.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/27">Stepping back from that local example, where we have a sticking-plaster solution and local council tax payers are now paying to keep the service going once an hour for the next six months, but no long-term solution, what is the long-term prospect for my constituents getting a decent bus service not just on this route, but across the area?</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/28">The context, with which the Minister will be familiar, is that more built-up areas, such as Bristol and the surrounds, have suffered big time since deregulation. With a 94 per cent. rise in the real value of fares and a 46 per cent. fall in patronage, there have been huge hikes in fares and a drop in bus usage in those built-up areas. That contrasts with London. The Minister will be familiar with this, but it is worth putting on the record that in London, where the local authority can essentially dictate and co-ordinate the services, fares and routes, bus usage is growing at its fastest rate since the mid-1940s; buses in London carry the highest number of passengers since 1968; and bus mileage in London is higher than at any time since 1957. I accept that London is different, but a lot of features of the London model could be applied.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/29">What have the Government done? The Minister's response might be that the Local Transport Act 2008 is the way forward. That Act allows more flexible voluntary deals between bus companies and councils, but, frankly, in our area First has got the councils over a barrel, because it is the only provider. I was rather alarmed to discover that, in the passenger transport executive areas, 90 per cent. of the services are run by the big five operators and, in general, they do not fight each other. It feels like a stitch-up.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/30">First runs in Bristol. Do Arriva and all the others compete against First? Mysteriously, it does not seem to happen. The theory of competition is great, but the reality is that we all know that the vast bulk of the services will be run by First. Wessex Connect will pick up the odd one, as will South Gloucestershire Bus &amp; Coach, but we all know that First will be in there as the main provider. We do not have realistic competition. If the bus companies have the councils over a barrel on voluntary partnerships, what about statutory partnerships? They are another option, although they are limited in scope. My preferred model is a franchise or quality contract. The 2008 Act provides for that, which is welcome, but although the Act was passed last year, the regulations and guidance are not yet in force. Will the Minister tell us when they will be?</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/31">In theory, it has been possible for some years for local authorities to franchise services throughout an area, but in reality no one has applied for or been granted permission to do so, because the legislative hurdle has been very high. The 2008 Act relaxes that, and I welcome that relaxation, but I am worried that even when its provisions are in place we may not see franchising and fierce competition between companies in the Greater Bristol area, because many tests will still have to be overcome. The decades of public transport failure in my area should be enough evidence that the alternatives have been tried vigorously. Yes, we will have quality corridors, or whatever the latest jargon is, and yes, there will be new bus lanes and better bus stops, but they will be on the major arterial routes in and out of the city, and people living in villages, young people, elderly people and those who want to travel off peak will receive limited benefit because they do not live where the major routes are.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/32">I do not doubt that the Government want to do something about the problem, and I am sure that the 2008 Act was well intended, but when will we see a difference on the ground? I know that there is already co-operation with bus companies in Bristol and south Gloucestershire and that there will be new bus lanes, but that will not scratch the itch for my constituents who live in villages or areas that are not on major routes. We had a public meeting in Iron Acton, which would have been completely cut off by the changes. Elderly residents said that they would have to move out of the area because, for example, there is no GP in the village so they could not visit their doctor without ringing community transport. People who have appointments at the eye hospital early in the morning could not get there. Losing those services would have killed communities, and I see no evidence that anything other than a radical shake-up will address those concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/33">First is in the business for what it can get out of it, and we should stop pretending otherwise. It makes hefty profits and its bus services are profitable overall. It is not a charity, and we have given it the opportunity to prove that it has a public service ethos, but it has kicked us in the teeth. Let us not pretend that relying on the good will of First or anyone else will get us there. The answer in my area&mdash;it may be different in other areas&mdash;is for local authorities to work together and to franchise a comprehensive network of services that will be stable in the long term and not cut with eight weeks' notice, that will link in with other public service infrastructure, such as main line and suburban railways, and that will provide off-peak and rural services. I know that such services cost money and that the pot is not unlimited, but if First and other companies had to bid for the complete network, they would have to make a choice. They would have to decide whether they were going to be in or out of Bristol. That would force the issue, because it is in their interests to stay in the area, and we could get an awful lot more from them than if we just relied on their good will, which is the model that we have relied on too much in the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/34">I could read out dozens of comments from angry people who want to be bus users and do not want to use their cars. Many of them commented on the website that they are always being told to get out of the car, but bus services are being cut. They are profoundly frustrated, and I hope that the Minister will say that the Government's changes will be implemented quickly and bring about a real change, not just in services, but in fares. I have surveyed young people who say that the cost of fares is their overwhelming problem. We have relied too much on bus companies' good will, but they are not in the business of showing any, so we must be much tougher on behalf of bus users, and I hope that the Minister will assure us that the changes will make a difference on the ground. If not, further powers may be needed to make bus companies provide a public service, which is what should have been provided all along.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> on securing this debate. I know that the matter is close to his heart, and he referred to a similar debate 18 months ago when he concentrated on young people and their travel. My predecessor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, responded to that debate and stated clearly that the Government were working on improving the experience for present bus users and those to come. Our strategy is for a continual increase in bus patronage, and that has started. Bus services are the backbone of transport for the vast majority of people in this country. Some 5 billion journeys are made every year, and we want the number to increase with more quality bus services throughout the country in place of the existing patchwork of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/2">My right hon. Friend talked about the work in developing the then Local Transport Bill, and recorded that the Government were putting some &pound;2.5 billion into funding local bus services each and every year, including the &pound;1 billion-odd for the concessionary scheme for some 11 million older and disabled people, which has come into being since that debate and provides opportunities for many people who might otherwise be isolated. However, I recognise that even with a gold-plated concessionary bus pass there will be issues if there are no buses. The hon. Gentleman said that nothing short of a radical shake-up is required in the bus industry, and the Local Transport Act 2008 provides the tools for that to happen, but leadership is needed at all levels to take forward what is right for a specific area. I shall return to that, and respond to some of the hon. Gentleman's specific points.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/3">As the hon. Gentleman said, most bus services outside London are provided by commercial operators in a deregulated market. Any operator is free to run local bus services, and Steve Webb Enterprises could apply, after gaining an operator's licence and registering the routes and timetables with the local traffic commissioner. That is one right, but it is also within operators' rights to withdraw bus services that are no longer commercially sensible, and operators are required to give 56 days' notice to the traffic commissioner of any service cancellation.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/4">Local authorities have the power to subsidise socially necessary services, as is happening with the X27 service to which the hon. Gentleman referred, that would not otherwise be provided by commercial operators, and about one fifth of bus services throughout the country are provided in that way. However, I readily accept that in the remaining four fifths of services&mdash;the vast majority&mdash;there has been little scope historically for local authorities to influence either the price or the standard of service offered. It has invariably been left to Adam Smith's &quot;invisible hand&quot;&mdash;the working of competition in the free market&mdash;to drive down fares and force up quality. After more than two decades of deregulation, perhaps the fairest thing to say is that the results have been mixed.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/5">As I have gone around the country, I have seen some good examples and spoken to people who use those services and not just to those who have briefed me. There are some good examples of partnerships that have worked and brought together both sides of the table. I say &quot;both sides&quot;, but when it is a genuine partnership that works, we do not end up with people being seen as on different sides of the table, because they are working hand in hand. I am talking about work by local bus service providers going hand in hand with supportive action by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/6">Places such as Telford, Brighton, York and Milton Keynes have had increases in patronage where there has been a genuine desire to go the extra mile, if I may use that term, to provide a service that is responsive and reflective. Those are increases in ridership over and above the extra ridership from the England-wide concessionary fares scheme; I want to make it clear that they are additional increases. However, as I have said, there is far too much of a patchwork of average provision and poor provision, rather than the good services that I could point to. That is what we need to deal with and the 2008 Act provides the ability to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/7">Before responding to an Adjournment debate, I always like to ensure that I know what everyone is talking about, and when I looked at the &quot;Focus on Sodbury, Yate and Dodington&quot; website, I saw that the hon. Gentleman believes that we have only &quot;tweaked the rules&quot; in the Local Transport Act. I hope to prove otherwise. Indeed, I know that he will be deliriously happy when I tell him about the greater powers that councils now have to determine what bus services operate in their area and to cap excessive fares. He is calling for that in this debate, and I am delighted to tell him that we are delivering it through the 2008 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/8">A principal aim of the Act is for local authorities to have a variety of options for exerting greater influence on the standard of bus services in the deregulated market. There is a strong emphasis in the Act on partnership working. Where there are good examples of a strong partnership, there has been the ability to deliver and provide the ingredients for success and an increase in patronage.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/9">The hon. Gentleman referred to previous attempts to secure better bus services, the problems of companies seeming to be working hand in glove and competition not working. One problem with previous legislation was that competition law worked as an obstacle to sensible partnerships. We have been able to work with the Office of Fair Trading to ensure that, under the provisions in the new Act, there is not that obstacle and that we can have a far stronger bus service and provision and negotiation through local authorities and the bus operators to make it a success.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.0/1">As the Minister has mentioned competition law, will he address the question that I asked at the start? Is First Bus correct to say that it could not have subsidised the X27 from the profits on another route? Is it as simple as that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05b.61.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1594" speakername="Paul Clark" colnum="61"  time="013:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0010.htm#0905051000488">
	<p pid="b.61.1/1">Let me answer that at this stage. As far as I am aware, it is not the case that companies cannot cross-subsidise between local routes. Let us think about a process of negotiations that might well happen. &quot;Here is a package of routes that we want to be provided,&quot; says the local transport authority to the bus company. It sets that out as a specification. Some of those routes would undoubtedly be more economically viable than others, so there would be a package and one would assume that any company bidding for that franchise&mdash;that operation&mdash;would take into account the costs involved and the income streams that there would be. Clearly, I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's comments about what First had given as a reason for not being able to follow through on the X27, but my understanding is that there is no reason why it cannot cross-subsidise, unless of course that is an internal rule of its own.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/2">With regard to the 2008 Act, there are quality partnership schemes, although the only successful one that really has flown was the one in north Sheffield. The concept was provided for under the Transport Act 2000. The provisions for quality partnership schemes have been strengthened under the 2008 Act. I am referring to the local transport authority having the strength to be able to negotiate in respect of frequencies, timings and maximum fares as part of that beefed-up role. That is important and helps to meet some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns. He referred to fares rising astronomically, and one of the provisions of the new Act will cover that.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/3">The hon. Gentleman said that his preference would be something along the lines of the quality contracts schemes&mdash;the London style of franchising. That may be a realistic option for given areas, but again it is for local authorities and local transport authorities to decide on what would meet their requirements. We have changed the rules. I think that the hon. Gentleman said that the hurdles that had to be got over were so high as to make that unrealistic. We took the opportunity to examine the provision in relation to the Local Transport Act. The requirement was that a quality contracts scheme must be the &quot;only practicable way&quot; of achieving the local authority's objectives. We have now provided for a much more balanced set of &quot;public interest criteria&quot; that schemes would need to meet. That makes it far more realistic for people to be able to meet the requirements in relation to a quality contracts scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/4">With regard to the timetable for quality contracts schemes, one of the things that I said once we had got the Act through and on the statute book at the end of November last year was that we needed to get on with rolling out the provisions. As hon. Members know, we can pass legislation, but we also need to roll it out and get it going. That is what we have been doing in a range of areas and there is a lot of work to be done. That includes setting up Passenger Focus to have a strong voice now for the travelling public on the buses as well as the railways. That is another provision that came into being in April.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/5">With regard to quality contracts, we will shortly be consulting on the requirement for secondary legislation. I hope to see the quality contracts provision up and running by the end of 2009. Like the hon. Gentleman, I want to see the Act a reality on the ground, making a difference for the people whom he represents here today and for the people whom hon. Members represent throughout the country. I hope that that will be a way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/6">I believe that the 2008 Act can provide the radical change required, but leadership is needed at local level, not only from elected leaders, which is fundamental, but from officials, those working in the industry and those in local bus companies. We all want one thing: more people on the buses and services being provided reliably, efficiently and effectively. I want to see that happen, but it takes two to tango. It certainly needs to happen in this case. When I was in Bristol recently, I met representatives of the West of England partnership. I hope that if one thing comes out of this, it is that the hon. Gentleman and colleagues alike will work with the leadership of the West of England partnership to see what can be taken forward from the 2008 Act to make a real difference for the travelling public, whether in south Gloucestershire, Bristol or the rest of the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/7" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/8" class="italic">Sitting adjourned.</p>
