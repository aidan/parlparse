<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-28.399.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="399"  time="13:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050628/halltext/50628h04.htm#50628h04_spmin0">
	<p pid=".399.0/1">I begin my contribution to this debate by paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1658" name="Stephen Hepburn">my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn)</phrase> for securing this debate and commend him for the concern and interest that he has shown in this matter on behalf of his constituents. The death of two young boys is tragic, wherever it occurs, but when it happens so far from home it is all the harder for the family to come to terms with their grief. They have our sincerest condolences.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/2">It may aid understanding of the role of the Governor and of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in a case such as this if I briefly outline the constitutional status of the British Virgin Islands and thereafter discuss its traditional system. The British Virgin Islands is a British overseas territory with a large measure of internal self-government. The Governor, who is appointed by Her Majesty the Queen, is both her representative in the territory and the constitutional head of the British Virgin Islands Government. He or she has direct responsibility for external affairs, defence and internal security, including the police, the public service and the administration of the courts.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/3">The constitution provides for a ministerial system of government headed by a Chief Minister, an Executive Council chaired by the Governor, and a Legislative Council. The Government of the British Virgin Islands have front-line responsibility for all aspects of life in the territory that do not fall within the Governor's responsibilities. The present constitution came into force in 1977 and has been amended periodically, with the last amendment being effected in 2000. A constitutional review is under way: the constitutional review committee appointed by the British Virgin Islands Government submitted its finding to that Government in April.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/4">The Governor has responsibility for the administration of the courts, but, to guard against possible or perceived claims of interference, the judiciary itself is entirely independent. The British Virgin Islands, like all British overseas territories, has its own separate legal jurisdiction and its own body of civil and criminal law. The judicial system in the British Virgin Islands consists of a local magistrates courts with a single stipendiary magistrate and, above that, the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, which consists of a High Court and Court of Appeal. Two High Court judges, who are appointed by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, reside in the territory, while the Court of Appeal is a circuit court.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/5">The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court covers nine countries and territoriesorder when all its members were still UK-dependent territories. Above the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court is the Privy Council, which is the final court of appeal in both civil and criminal matters for all overseas territories.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/6">One of the issues that my hon. Friend raised was the appointment of judges in the overseas territories and I will say a word or two in response. In most territories other than those covered by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, about which I have just spoken, the Governor appoints judges. As I explained, the Eastern Caribbean territories and states have been within the court's jurisdiction since 1967. The court is widely respected as a judicial body of long standing and has served the relevant independent states of the Caribbean and the three overseas territories well. However, my hon. Friend asked whether it would be possible to register a complaint about the conduct of an individual judge. The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court has no formal complaints procedure although there is a disciplinary process if allegations are made against a judge. That would not apply if it was decided that a judge was simply exercising judicial discretion.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/7">As my hon. Friend said, the sad events that we are discussing took place on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-05">5 August 2004</phrase> and the following morning. At 11 pm a collision occurred between a dinghy holding Luke Noble, Denis Campbell Harty, a United States national, Ian Murray and Stephen Noble and a boat&mdash;a Boston whaler&mdash;operated by Dutch national, Arjaan Hendriksen. At midnight, the Virgin Islands search and rescue service was alerted and joined the search for the boys. Ian Murray and Stephen Noble were found and taken to hospital. A US coastguard helicopter joined the search at first light the following morning with the Royal Virgin Islands police plane. At 8 am, the bodies of Luke Noble and Denis Campbell Harty were recovered. The Governor's office informed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the United States consul in Barbados of the incident.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/8">The case was heard in the High Court of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court and started on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May</phrase> this year. The accused was charged with two counts of manslaughter under section 153 of the British Virgin Islands criminal code of 1997. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>, he was found guilty on both counts and on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-20">20 June</phrase> was sentenced to a fine of US$30,000 on each count. The right of appeal against both verdict and sentence is subject to British Virgin Islands legislation. As the legislation stands, there is no provision for the prosecution to appeal against the sentence. We understand that following the case a review of the situation, which is already under way, will be speeded up. That is the substantive answer that I offer to my hon. Friend's query about the capacity for cases to be reviewed. As I said, in the light of this case, a review is taking place in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/9">The Governor's office provided practical assistance following the accident and took a close interest in the case throughout. Staff maintain contact with the family through Luke's uncle, Tony Noble, who is resident in the British Virgin Islands and seconded to the Royal Virgin Islands police force. The Governor wrote a letter of condolence to Mr. and Mrs. Noble shortly after the accident.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/10">The Governor's office kept the overseas territories department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which is responsible for the British Virgin Islands, fully informed of developments. The officer responsible for the British Virgin Islands in the Department was in contact with a member of Luke's family and wrote a letter of condolence to Mr. and Mrs. Noble. After initial contact with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the family did not request further assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/11">As an overseas territory under British sovereignty, there is no legal framework for the provision of consular services that are normally provided by a state to its nationals in the territory of another state. However, we are well aware that to many UK tourists the overseas territories are as foreign as independent countries. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the staff in the Governors' offices are always ready and have appropriate training to provide assistance informally to visiting British citizens who may require help in an emergency while in an overseas territory.</p>
	<p pid=".399.0/12">In conclusion, I repeat my thanks to my hon. Friend for raising this issue. We all feel sympathy with the Noble family, who have suffered a heart-wrenching loss. The loss of a loved one of such a young age is a tragedy. However, I hope that during this debate I have at least been able to clarify for my hon. Friend exactly how the judicial system in the British Virgin Islands works and where responsibility for decision-taking lies. As I tried to explain, no scope exists for appeal by the prosecution against sentence. Given its responsibility for the criminal justice system within the territory, it is the responsibility of the British Virgin Islands Government to review any change to the system. We understand that they are now doing do.</p>
