	<p pid="a.171.3/1">There are those who have argued for a suspension of the payment levels for council tax. I do not agree with them; I do not think that we need to suspend it&mdash;we just need to get rid of it. In my view, the local income tax mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2035" name="John Mason">the hon. Member for Glasgow, East (John Mason)</phrase> would be the best way of doing so. That would certainly take the majority of pensioners out of the need to claim council tax benefit and help them effectively. It would also have the advantage of taking other people who are on low incomes and those claiming benefits out of the need to claim council tax benefit in an efficient way.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.3/2">The remarkable thing is that, when the Inland Revenue set up its new computer system, it was thinking ahead, and believe it or not, the design of the computer allowed for local income tax to be phased in. The hardware is there, but the software is not yet there and, sadly, neither is the commitment from the Government or the Opposition&mdash;who actually gave us the council tax in the first place&mdash;to change the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.3/3">In conclusion, I am asking the House to consider giving a large sum of money to elderly people, but is it any more than they deserve? Do we really wish to have a system that involves benefit claims here and there, a little gift of a TV licence or whatever and a bit of a heating allowance for the winter? Would it not be better to give all pensioners a decent state pension, and to do so until such time as we can correct the errors unfortunately made by those who established the system and get to a system in which people have their own pensions and are able to make provision for themselves?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-28a.173.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" speakername="Mark Williams" colnum="173"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081028/halltext/81028h0002.htm#08102848000494">
	<p pid="a.173.0/1">My hon. Friend clearly makes a point about the practicalities that many pensioners face. Many people become frustrated as they try to navigate their way through potentially complex forms, and there are also the practical difficulties that he outlined.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/2">I shall reserve most of my remarks for a special group of people: ex-servicemen. It is not a small group&mdash;it represents a significant proportion of the pensioner population in this country. I pay tribute to the Royal British Legion, which is working with Age Concern on the Return to Rationing campaign. The campaign points out that 38 per cent. of ex-service pensioners report an income below the minimum required for healthy living, which is &pound;7,072 per annum or &pound;136 per week for a single person, and &pound;11,200 or &pound;216 for a couple.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/3">The Government have a particular duty of care to ex-servicemen. As the hon. Member for Castle Point said, they made extraordinary sacrifices for their country. The campaign argues, with some justification, that the present tough economic conditions represent a return to rationing. The title of the campaign may well be emotive, but it illustrates some of the frustrations that many pensioners feel. They assert, and I agree with them, that the support given to those who served their country is simply not good enough. I am sure that we will all support the poppy appeal in the next two weeks and beyond, but we should strive to ensure that help for veterans is not confined to two or three weeks each autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/4">The situation is a matter of extreme concern, and I wonder what assessment the Minister has made of the Royal British Legion's proposals. Among other things, it proposes making the 100 per cent. disregard of war pensions for council tax and housing benefit a statutory requirement. I know that local authorities have some discretionary powers, but there is a feeling that the disregard should be a statutory requirement. The proposals also include developing automated payment of council tax benefit to older people, and exempting recipients of war pensions who have a service-related injury or disablement from means-testing for the disabled facilities grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/5">Veterans often find themselves in particular difficulties, and the package that has been proposed by the Royal British Legion goes some way to recognising that fact. The legion carried out a survey of ex-servicemen, and a picture emerged of difficult financial circumstances combined with, as we have already heard, a failure to claim all the benefits to which they are entitled. Some 71 per cent. of respondents said that they did not claim council tax benefit, and, of those, nearly one half said they found paying their council tax bill difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/6">Problems that are apparent elsewhere are all too often magnified for ex-service personnel. A survey carried out by the legion in June found that 15 per cent. of the veterans who they contacted went without full central heating. Rising energy bills are a concern for many pensioners, but the legion's figures are particularly eye-catching. They suggest that more needs to be done to help veterans pay their fuel bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/7">The increase in the winter fuel payment is, of course, welcome, and I thank the Government for making that decision, but we must recognise the limited nature of the benefit. Fifty pounds is a welcome contribution, but, for many, it will make only a small dent in fuel bills this winter. Put crudely, energy prices have risen by 40 per cent. this year but the winter fuel payment has gone up by only 25 per cent. That is without considering the steady increases in fuel bills over the past few years: the winter fuel payment was frozen at &pound;200 from 2000, when it accounted for one half of the average pensioner's fuel bill, until 2007, when it accounted for just one fifth.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/8">The Minister will be aware that many people, particularly those in rural areas such as the one in Wales that I represent, use heating oil or liquefied petroleum gas to heat their homes. They have faced even starker price rises, and although the price of heating oil has started to go down recently, the maximum price remains very high. I have to say that many people in the constituency that I represent do not have the alternative of different fuel suppliers. That is a real problem in rural Wales.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-28a.179.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1564" speakername="Nigel Waterson" colnum="179"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081028/halltext/81028h0003.htm#08102848000506">
	<p pid="a.179.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, but the Government have form. Shortly after they first came to power, they sharply reduced the backdating for some benefits. I believe that bereavement allowance was included, which seemed particularly harsh.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/2">Another issue that came up is the link with average earnings. The Government are committed to that at some point, but are coy about saying when. They said that it might be 2012 or 2015, but that it must be affordable. As we head into choppy economic waters, the word &quot;affordable&quot; may become more significant. We joined some Labour rebels on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April</phrase> in voting for an amendment to the Pensions Bill merely requiring the Government to say precisely when they would restore the link. However, Labour MPs were, of course, whipped to vote the amendment down. It may be that the right hon. Lady, who I welcome to her new role, can enlighten us on that matter today and make a commitment in this debate, before she is too much in the grip of the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/3">As we head into these difficult times, my main point is that older people need reassurance. The briefings from Help the Aged and Age Concern make it clear that we are not only talking about the direct economic affects on pensioners, but their sense of isolation and depression, which we know is much more likely to affect older than younger people. Indeed, that also results in costs to the NHS and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/4">Before we take into account housing costs, we know that 2.5 million pensioners live in poverty, of whom about two thirds are women. That is happening in the 21st century and in the fifth richest country on the planet. The Government have form for trying to define away a problem. Recently, Ministers&mdash;although I hope this Minister will resist the temptation&mdash;have been prone to say that, as a result of their marvellous policies and a successful 11 years in Government, pensioners are now less likely than other members of society to fall into poverty. Of course, that depends on what measurement is used. The House of Commons Library has kindly supplied information for me that shows that if one uses the before housing costs income measure, the equivalent figures for falling into poverty would be 23 per cent. for pensioners and 18 per cent. for the population as a whole&mdash;in others words, pensioners are more likely to fall into poverty than other members of society. As if that were not bad enough, recent Eurostat figures show that only pensioners in Latvia, Spain and Cyprus are more likely to fall into poverty than pensioners in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/5">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> said, much of this issue depends on take-up. It is interesting that when pension credit was originally unveiled, the Treasury assumption was that 1.5 million people would never get around to claiming pension credit. As we have heard, some &pound;5 billion a year of benefit that should be going to older people remains unclaimed. That is a huge amount, which, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said, could take 500,000 pensioners out of poverty at a stroke. That is a very arresting figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/6">The Minister certainly has the time, but I wonder whether she has the inclination to talk about what is called automaticity&mdash;or something like that&mdash;which is the process of making benefit payments automatic. We all know that there is a huge failure to claim some benefits. I forget which hon. Member made this point, but the worst offending benefit is that for the council tax. In my constituency in Eastbourne, a lot of elderly people, particularly widows, own their flat or house. They are very cash poor, but because they are owner-occupiers they are totally convinced that they have no right to claim council tax help. That is precisely why, even among older people where the claim rate is low, owner-occupiers are the lowest category of claimants of council tax benefit. I know that the Government have been trying to look at how to bring in an automatic way to claim and pay benefits. It would be helpful to know what progress they have made so far and what other proposals they have in mind. I suspect that the Treasury is quite smug about the situation because it means that it can carry forward &pound;5 billion from one year to the next.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/7">Finally, I shall touch on what Age Concern has been doing. A while ago, it launched a campaign&mdash;I helped to launch it in my constituency, where we have an active Age Concern branch&mdash;on the subject of advice. One of the first things that local authorities up and down the country tend to do when times are hard and Government money is not available is cut back on advice services. It is painfully obvious to me that, despite our best efforts in advice surgeries, what older people need more than anything is good, reliable, trustworthy advice about what they are entitled to and so on. Coupled with the concerns about budget cuts in the Pension Service expressed in the Help the Aged brief, which was prepared for this debate, that is particularly worrying. The brief states:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/8" class="indent">&quot;We believe this is a serious omission and sends out the wrong signal about the importance of local action on the ground to improve pensioner incomes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/9">By that, it means that the Government are failing to include a local measure of pensioner poverty. None of the 198 indicators set out for local authorities relate to pensioner poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/10">We have talked about the huge problem of fuel poverty. It is estimated that there are 2.5 million pensioner households in fuel poverty already. According to any measurement, that figure must be increasing. We still have a disgraceful record in this country for excess winter deaths: there were some 22,300 last winter. As the recession takes a grip, one can only imagine how bad that situation will be this winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/11">On annuities, I was pleased that yesterday during the debate on the Pensions Bill my colleagues in the Lords proposed that there should be a temporary relaxation of the compulsory annuitisation rule. At the moment, those coming up to 75 are facing huge turmoil in the markets and will be required to set their income for the rest of their lives. I am therefore very annoyed and upset that the Government have set their face against a temporary relaxation of the compulsory annuitisation rule. I am surprised that the Liberal Democrats apparently did not support us in the Lobby in the Lords last night. That is a great shame because, at this stage, we should be doing everything we possibly can to help those who are retired or coming up to retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/12">The Government's priority should not be to help bankers or financiers; our older citizens deserve not to be lost sight of among the present turmoil. Frankly, we need to ensure that we do not have the situation that we have had in my constituency where retired constituents have had to choose between spending their winter fuel allowance on fuel, council tax or grocery bills.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.1/1">I want to come to the take-up of benefits. We have to be careful with the language that we use in this area. The term &quot;handouts&quot; might be a little derogatory when applied to the support that people might be giving to their own family members. It is important to emphasise that people are perfectly entitled to the assistance in the form of pension credit and help with council tax. We have to be careful when using the word &quot;handouts&quot; and others as though implying that somehow people are not deserving of the help. Some families may support their elderly relatives. That should not always be regarded as charity; it is something that families may wish to do. We have to be careful about the language that we use.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/2">I was referring to winter fuel payments. In 1997, &pound;252 million was being spent to support pensioners in cold weather; now, we spend &pound;2.1 billion. There is free off-peak bus travel, to which the hon. Member for Teignbridge referred. There are free eye tests, free TV licences and free swimming. We have tried to provide all those things on a comprehensive, universal basis because we think it important to recognise that the discussion about older people is about quality of life as well. This is not only about benefits and payments. Other things, such as free bus passes, are about recognising the importance of quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/3">There are huge challenges as a result of demographic changes in society. That is why, in the last two pension Bills, we have made a huge change in how we will be helping people to save for their retirement in the future. There has been welcome cross-party agreement on the changes that we wish to bring in. They will make a big difference to women saving for their retirement as well. I join the hon. Member for Teignbridge in paying tribute to Baroness Hollis with regard to the recent changes that she made and pressed for, which the Government have accepted. I am referring to the change in the conditions for voluntary national insurance contributions. We will see a radical shift in how we approach saving for retirement in the future. The changes that we are making constitute recognition of the demographic changes that are coming, but they are also about fairness, equality and justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/4">While on the subject of future changes&mdash;a subject raised by a number of hon. Members&mdash;we have legislated to reintroduce the earnings link for the basic state pension. We are committed to restoring the link with earnings by 2012, or at the latest by the end of the next Parliament. As a result, the basic state pension should double in value by 2050, more than if the current uprating policy is continued. As I say, that is legislated for.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/5">I have spoken about raising the basic state pension to &pound;151 a week&mdash;a sum called for by a number of organisations. The first problem is that many pensioners would be worse off as a result, as it would reduce our ability to target help on those with the lowest incomes. There is no doubt that it would also cost an additional &pound;30 billion a year in the first couple of years. That would be a huge commitment. I do not know whether the Liberal Democrats are making such a commitment today, and I doubt whether the Conservative party has made such a commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/6">We have invested much more money in pensions. We have allocated much more money to support pensioners, but we cannot ignore the fact that the call to raise the basic state pension to &pound;151 a week would carry additional financial burdens. Nowadays, in many ways the pensioner population reflects the wider population. As I have said, pensioners will not necessarily be on relatively lower incomes than those in other parts of society.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/7">One important subject that was raised in the debate is how to encourage the take-up of benefits. It is true to say that people dislike complexity. They crave simplicity, which is why we have made it much easier to calculate pension credit awards. We have also made the system more automatic. With one phone call, people can claim pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit without the need for a signed claim form.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/8">The hon. Members for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) and for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)&mdash;I may need another lesson on pronunciation&mdash;and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> spoke of automaticity. We want to work closely with organisations like Age Concern and Help the Aged to maximise the take-up of benefits. I was in Macduff two weeks ago with Age Concern, considering what more could be done to encourage people to take up pension credit and council tax and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/9">I asked about automaticity when first being briefed on these issues. Some people feel it to be a slight invasion of privacy if their details are seen to be handed over, particularly when they are told that they may be entitled to a benefit. However, we need to balance that against what we do now, which we will continue, with one phone call giving people access to all the benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/10">We make direct contact with people if we feel that they may be entitled to extra help, sometimes just sending letters. However, some people feel that that it is up to them to make a claim, and they do not necessarily want interference. All the time, we are considering what else can be done to ensure that people take up their benefits. All ideas are welcome. Members of Parliament, too, have a role to play in helping people. It is good to see some of the schemes that people have adopted. However, we sometimes need to be careful.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/11">The hon. Member for Ceredigion spoke of veterans. It is absolutely right to say that, for them, we need to take a cross-Government approach, as I know from my work at the Department of Health and the Department for Transport, particularly to ensure that veterans are able to take up their entitlement. We are supporting them in doing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/12">Several hon. Members referred to the Institute for Fiscal Studies report. I recognise what they said about inflation, but the report suggests that, over the long term, average inflation for both pensioners and non-pensioners is almost identical. It shows that pension credit is worth about &pound;430 more a year than if it had been uprated by the inflation index used in the report since 2001, and that the basic state pension is worth about &pound;340 more a year than if it had been uprated since 1987 by the report's inflation figure. We need to look carefully at the statistics to ensure that we target help where it is most needed, as I have suggested, yet at the same time we are investing more in our pensioners, with the &pound;12 billion extra that we are providing.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/13">A number of hon. Members, particularly the hon. Member for Eastbourne, mentioned the current economic climate. It is important to say that pension funds are long-term investment vehicles. Fluctuations in financial markets will affect the value of assets in the short term, but it is the long term that is important. We would certainly encourage people to realise the importance of saving for their pension. It is one of the most effective ways of saving for security in retirement, and I hope that all hon. Members endorse that view.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/14">The hon. Member for Eastbourne also raised the matter of annuities. We have considered the points that he made, but I have to say that the vast majority of people buy annuities well before the age of 75. Only 5 per cent. of people delay until after the age of 70, but it tends to be the wealthier pensioner. We did look at the matter, but the industry indicated that temporary suspension would be particularly unworkable.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/15">It has been an interesting and wide-ranging debate. I hope that I have been able to illustrate that we always do everything that we can to support our pensioners. The Government have a proud record in that respect&mdash;one that I believe is appreciated by pensioners. The changes made since 1997 pay due respect to the important contribution that pensioners make to society. However, we will continue to work with pensioners and pensioner groups to ensure that we are doing all that we can to support them.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.2/1">I am very pleased that so many hon. Members have found the time support the debate and grateful for the opportunity talk about the vital issue of the future restoration of our waterways network. I welcome the Minister to what is his first debate on waterways, and I hope that this is one of many on inland waterways to which he will respond. He has already demonstrated his enthusiasm for canals by booking a holiday in February on the Shropshire Union canal. That shows real enthusiasm, and it should demonstrate to him the work that British Waterways has done on flooding. I hope that his visit is not too interrupted by inclement weather. It is probably just as well that he has recently announced an extra &pound;1 million to help British Waterways, which is welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/2">Britain has a wonderful asset in its inland waterways. Some were built more than 250 years ago, but the canal age was well and truly over by the middle of the last century and the vast majority of freight movements were transferred to rail and road. The network fast became disused and fell into disrepair. However, a small band of dedicated individuals saw a future for our canals and rivers. They formed the Inland Waterways Association. Their drive, vision and enthusiasm ensured a renaissance for the canals and the waterways system. More than 500 miles of waterways have been restored to use, and a further 500 miles are currently under active restoration. Every weekend, groups of volunteers around the country work to restore more of our historic waterways network. IWA volunteers have created a waterway recovery group, which has been actively engaged in restoration since the early 1970s. Indeed, they brought my local canal, the Caldon, back from dereliction in 1974. The IWA provides volunteer working parties for and logistical and expert help to waterway societies up and down the country. More than 31,000 boats travelled on the waterways network last year, and 11 million visitors, including anglers, walkers and cyclists, used the towpaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/3">The Government have played a key role in the waterways for a long time. I should like to remind the Minister that the waterways were first nationalised in 1947&mdash;I can do so now that nationalisation is back in fashion. Unfortunately, those early years of nationalisation did nothing to protect the canals from closure and disrepair. Only in the late 1960s did the Government begin to recognise the recreational value of the waterways. However, the outstanding contribution that waterways can make to both regeneration and the environment was recognised only when the Labour Government launched &quot;Waterways for Tomorrow&quot; in 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.0/1">We all support the use of public and private money for the renovation of waterways. The hon. Lady refers to the events of eight years ago, but I hope that she recognises that in many of our cities&mdash;I speak for London, but the same applies to the centres of cities such as Birmingham and Manchester&mdash;there has been a huge amount of renovation, with the public and private sectors working together, much of which predates the important initiatives that I am sure she will address.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.1/1">The regeneration has been brought about by a huge partnership between the Government, local canal trusts and volunteers, who had the vision to research and create feasibility plans for many of the important developments around the country in past eight years.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.1/1">I should certainly like the money to come forward, but I do not think that the other money that has been invested would be a waste, because local canal trusts and volunteer bodies are determined to get the projects off the ground that we are talking about a delay rather than an end to the prospects for those developments. The schemes are such good value for money that they should be brought forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/2">The money that was invested produced many new developments, such as the Millennium link and the famous Falkirk wheel. Since 2004, grants have been severely reduced. Inevitably, that has impacted on British Waterways's works programme, and it must also have jeopardised its target of a vibrant expanded network by 2012. From wanting to expand the network, British Waterways is now having to retrench and focus only on maintaining the existing network, as hon. Members have said. Without continued improvement, confidence in the future of the network will leach away, thus damaging prospects for private sector investment, particularly in such difficult economic times.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/3">We have already seen the impact of the credit crunch on British Waterways's income. The downturn in the property market has made it impossible for the organisation to sell two very big development sites for about &pound;9.5 million. The BBC recently cited the canal centre of Birmingham as an area that has seen the greatest fall in property values. Such falls must also apply to other city-centre developments around canals, and that is bound to hit British Waterways's income. Even before the credit crunch, British Waterways had pulled out of schemes, such as the Cotswolds canals restoration. Funding is very tight. We risk losing the huge benefits of investment in our canals if maintenance is not sustained.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/4">British Waterways has a long-term aim to become largely self-sufficient. At present, the Government grant still represents some 40 per cent. of BW's income, and achieving its works programme is critical. Any year-on-year underspend will lead to increased costs, because any maintenance that is not undertaken now allows minor problems to deteriorate, so that they require major works in the future. Any cutback is counterproductive, putting at risk the tremendous progress made before 2004. There will always be a need for some Government grant to contribute to British Waterways's income in recognition of the wider public benefits generated by the waterways. In its report in 1989, the Tory-dominated Environment Committee recognised that that was the case. That is why the extra &pound;1 million that was announced for BW this month is so welcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.1/1">Enthusiasm for canals is a cross-party issue. However, the amount of funding that has gone into British Waterways and other authorities has massively increased since we have had a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/2">The Environment Agency, which operates about 20 per cent. of the network, is in a similar position to British Waterways. It is handicapped by a large maintenance and navigational improvement backlog. The Environment Agency currently receives some &pound;14 million in grants, but the estimated cost of completing the backlog of capital work to its waterway structures is said to be &pound;30 million. Therefore, structures, such as lochs and moorings, have not received the routine maintenance that they need to ensure that they remain operational.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/3">In the past four years, there has been a 24 per cent. increase in the number of boats on the network and an 18 per cent. increase in visitors. That is a fantastic achievement, but satisfaction with the waterway network is falling. Only 49 per cent. of boaters say that their experience of the waterway and its upkeep is good or excellent. That is a dramatic drop from the previous year, in which 66 per cent. of boaters held that view. However, boaters are not the whole story. They represent only 3 per cent. of the visitors to the waterways. None the less, without the boats, much of the colour and vibrancy of the waterways is lost. Boats are an essential component of a living waterways network.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/4">My local Inland Waterways Association branch has reported to me that real difficulties are beginning to be encountered by boaters who have to operate a large number of gate paddles on the Cheshire locks. Of course, winding lock gear requires a degree of physical effort, but the problems are well beyond the usual. With so many locks causing problems in the same area, it will not be long before boaters learn to avoid that stretch of the canal.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/5">The canals in my constituency in north Staffordshire represent real opportunities for regeneration. We have seen the successful completion of a four-year project, costing &pound;6 million, to improve the towpaths and access points on to the canals around Stoke-on-Trent. That huge investment was paid for by the regional development agency and by European money, but, sadly, that positive partnership is not so evident elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" name="Joan Walley">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)</phrase> will speak about the Burslem port, but my local Tory council has carried out an in-depth feasibility study to restore, extend and develop the Caldon canal in Leek for more than one and a half years, and nothing has happened. Such restoration work would open up a real opportunity to develop the south side of Leek, especially as the Caldon canal runs side by side with the Churnet Valley heritage steam railway. It could be a real honey pot for visitors and local residents alike, with the towpath used as part of the local &quot;Walking the Way to Health&quot; programme and the Beatrice Charity's trip boat providing children with special needs and wheelchair users the chance to get out on to the water and into the beautiful Staffordshire, Moorlands countryside.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/7">Leek should learn from the experience of Llangollen in Wales, where the development of a mooring basin has massively boosted visitor numbers to the market town. Sadly, local IWA members are still struggling to get the development of the canal into Leek's local development framework. Many people in Leek are unaware that the canal comes into the town, because the canal terminus comes out behind a scrap yard on an industrial estate. There is not even a sign to tell visitors about the delights of Leek a few hundred yards away. Yet, my dedicated IWA volunteers have organised local canal festivals. The place is alive with boats, music, activity and history. There are also plans to bring to life the Uttoxeter canal by opening a 13-mile stretch from Froghall in my constituency to the wharf in Uttoxeter.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.0/1">I would like to thank my constituent Mr. Tony Lenten and the Inland Waterways Association for their briefing for me today. I agree with almost everything that has been said in this debate. We are all here because we have a passion for the waterways of this country, which are part of our heritage and our future.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/2">The Grand Union canal flows through my constituency, which is dominated by a new town, and the canal is the link between the rural community and the urban community. For many people, it is the only piece of countryside that they see. The other day, when I was fishing on the canal, it was a pleasure to see a kingfisher fishing smack bang in the middle of the new town. That is a hallmark of the canal's cleanliness.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/3">However, I have some concerns about the future. Since 1946, some 500 miles of canals have been reopened and I understand, from the briefing that I have had, that another 500 miles are subject to works that may go ahead or that are actually going ahead at the moment. In my constituency, the biggest blight on the Grand Union canal is silt. What worries me is that, as funding gets tighter and tighter for British Waterways, we are not protecting what we already have. If we do not protect the existing canal structure, whatever we do in the future will be cut off by this blight or plague of silt that is going on now.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/4">I have lived in my constituency for seven years and I have fished on the Grand Union canal since I was a young child. In all that time, I have not seen any dredging going on whatsoever. I was fishing on the canal at the weekend and I can tell the Minister that the main Grand Union canal going up through Hertfordshire is only about 18 inches deep. Silt is a major problem. We want more traffic to use the canals and we might want to transport heavy goods to the supermarkets that are situated right by the edge of the canal in my constituency , but the problem is that those goods simply could not get there, because ordinary pleasure craft are bottoming out in the canal on a regular basis. As I say, silt is a major issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/5">Therefore, as we look forward and try to keep our canals as part of our heritage, we must be careful. Funding is tight and British Waterways should look after what it already has before it invests too much in something that we may not be able to hold on to.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-28a.203.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="203"  time="012:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081028/halltext/81028h0007.htm#08102848000547">
	<p pid="a.203.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this debate under your chairmanship, Mrs. Winterton, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on obtaining it. She, among several other hon. Members, has been a champion of this country's canal network, and every hon. Member who has the fortune to lead a debate about canals can be assured of the support of many other hon. Members. That shows throughout the United Kingdom, and in England and Wales in particular, not only the importance of the canal network to industry in the past, but its potential in the future, which has been well demonstrated this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> mentioned several inquiries that the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs undertook recently. I shall not go back over the issues that were raised throughout the report and in its conclusions, but I should tell the Minister that if we are to make the most of the resources that the Government can put into British Waterways, there must be a good relationship between British Waterways and the sponsoring Department. It has improved over the past few years, but it is something that I am sure the Minister will want to work hard at, because the waterways will benefit when the relationship is going well.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/3">The key theme of the debate has been the difficulty in prioritising maintenance or restoration when the amount of money available to the canal network is limited. Several Members have pointed out the importance of ensuring that silt is removed from the waterways, because they become unavailable to, and unsuitable for, boats. Somebody said that only 3 per cent. of canal visitors visit on boats, but they add to the liveliness of the canals, and canals without boats would be only half the facility that they currently are, and present only half the attraction that they currently present.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/4">Another issue that the Minister, whom I welcome to his new post, will take on board is the vast amount of volunteering that goes on for British Waterways. Much of the progress that has been made would not have been made without volunteering, so he must take it on board and ensure that it has the encouragement that it has had in the past and will need to have in the future. One strength of British Waterways has been its ability to bring together partnerships to achieve its objectives. It has worked with public bodies, such as local councils, and with the private sector. Often, when a canal is improved, the value and importance of the land on either side increases, but one problem that has not been properly addressed is how British Waterways can take advantage of the increase in value of the land that borders the canals. The private sector benefits in many instances, but British Waterways has not yet found a way to ensure that at least some of the value of its investment is returned.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/5">Several Members have taken advantage of this opportunity to speak about their local canals, and I must say something about the Mon and Brec canal. The Minister will know that just recently, it suffered a massive breach, and it has taken more than &pound;1 million just to mend it, but a health and safety examination of the canal has shown that other work needs to take place, so we are putting together partnerships to do that. I know that some funds for other developments have been lost to the Mon and Brec canal, but the Minister has been invited to visit many canals, and I guess that it is the nearest one. His predecessor indicated that he was willing to go along, but I should much prefer the present Minister to do so when there is water in the canal, rather than when there is not, so perhaps we can find a time when he might do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/6">There are a number of issues that hon. Members have indicated the Minister should look at. One is whether, at a time when funding will be tight, funds could be made available by other Departments that might have an interest in canals. The Department of Health has been mentioned, but the Departments for Transport and for Culture, Media and Sport also have a real interest in the network, and some money could be found within those Departments and allocated to the canals.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/7">Ongoing maintenance has been mentioned, but I was particularly taken by the reference to involvement in local government planning as regards safeguarding the routes of canals. Many canals are now cut across by developments, which could have been avoided so that those canals could be opened in their fullness. Both rural and urban areas are connected by canals, and the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands made a powerful point about restoration of that part of the waterway network that is still derelict. At worst, a derelict canal is a dirty ditch, but it can be a high quality piece of water that can provide many facilities by promoting biodiversity, stimulating the property market alongside waterways, boosting local tourist industries and making this country a better place to live. The hon. Lady has made a good case for restoration, which will take a relic of the industrial past and turn it into a sustainable feature for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.0/1">May I welcome you, Lady Winterton, and say how fortunate we are to have been so splendidly served by two excellent Chairmen this morning? I welcome the Minister to his new position. Perhaps he will say why it is that after the last reshuffle, apart from the Secretary of Sate, every single one of the ministerial team for his Department was replaced. I wish him well, and I hope that he will stay a while longer than his predecessor.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/2">I warmly congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate. She spoke with great authority, knowledge and eloquence, and identified a number of issues that other hon. Members also rowed into. In particular, she mentioned the multiple roles that British Waterways is expected to play. It is the UK's largest navigation authority, and I think that we forget that it cares for about 3,540 km of historic canals and navigable rivers&mdash;a tall order indeed. It is responsible for navigation, recreation, fundraising, and, in answer to what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> said, I believe that British Waterways has an adaptation role to play in preventing and alleviating flooding, and in adapting to climate change generally. I wonder whether the Minister will respond to my hon. Friend's point about the work of the internal drainage boards. Bedfordshire is exemplary in that regard. Why have the Government cut the Environment Agency's budget for maintenance? That is causing great concern up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/3">The hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands and other hon. Members drew attention to the fact that British Waterways is markedly supported by volunteers. We have heard that demonstrated today, in what has been an interesting Cook's tour of English canals&mdash;we will all be looking to our diaries to see when we should visit. Reference has also been made to the co-operation of district and borough councils, county councils, the Mayor, the Environment Agency and the Inland Waterways Association. In addition, as my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> said, there is a role for the private sector&mdash;notably, in running the local pub. Indeed, British Waterways will increasingly have to rely on the private sector for future financing.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/4">Having come from the European Parliament, one thing that has always struck me is that the inland waterway network of this country is a jewel, but together with coastal shipping, it is frequently overlooked and under-utilised in many ways. If one considers the political lobby of inland waterways in other European countries such as Holland, France and Germany, one realises that our inland waterway network could have a much greater role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/5">The underlying thrust of the debate has been the amount of funding that navigation bodies such as British Waterways have, and how they manage the inland waterways with those limited funds. Will the Minister respond to the fact that in the most recent comprehensive spending review, navigation bodies have been given flat cash for the next three years, and will therefore come under increasing pressure? I would like to quote his predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" name="Jonathan R Shaw">the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw)</phrase>, in the excellent Select Committee report that a number of hon. Members have referred to this morning. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the actual canal restoration is never commercially viable and has to be supported almost entirely by public or volunteer funding. In many cases canal restoration creates increased, albeit marginal, future maintenance costs for British Waterways.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/7">I shall restrict my remarks to three questions, and ask the Minister whether he will re-visit the Government response to that report.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/8">How do the Government intend to implement the recommendations of the report, particularly the fifth and sixth recommendations? The Committee called for</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Defra, in cooperation with British Waterways and other interested government departments....[to] develop a transparent mechanism to score and prioritise public investment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/10">The Government were dismissive and said that they did not agree with that recommendation. The Select Committee went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/11" class="indent">&quot;It is likely that BW will need increasingly to rely on income from canalside developments in the future. A reduction in restoration projects involving BW may therefore in the long term adversely affect BW's move towards achieving an even greater degree of financial self-sufficiency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/12">The Government responded negatively, stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Unlike regeneration projects adjacent to the existing network restoration projects rarely produce new income streams and usually impose additional costs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/14">In summing up, will the Minister answer the conundrum that lies at the heart of the debate called today and previous debates? The conundrum is this: restoring a canal creates spending on restoration in a particular instance, but it creates increased maintenance costs for the future. Maintenance of a newly restored waterway therefore implies increased expenditure, which perhaps the Government or British Waterways do not have access to. If he responds to that point, in what has been one of the best attended debates in my parliamentary career, he will have served the House extremely well this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/15">I would also ask the Minister to say what lessons have been learned from the fact that British Waterways had to withdraw from the Cotswold Canals Partnership, without consultation. Clearly, as was reflected throughout the debate, where we are so heavily reliant on a public-private partnership for investment, British Waterways needs to work more with voluntary and local bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/16">May I end on a positive note? I commend British Waterways in particular for its work on and financing of Prescott lock, which I had occasion to visit recently. I think that it will do a huge amount to prepare London for the Olympics in the construction phase. We all wait with bated breath to hear the Minister respond to those points.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.0/1">I thank you, Mrs. Winterton, and your predecessor, Mr. Bercow, for being excellent stewards of this debate. It is one of the best attended sessions that I have seen in Westminster Hall for quite some time, and that reflects the passion, commitment and knowledge that people have displayed in their contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/2">I shall do my best to deal with as many points as I can, but Members will understand if I do not address them all in the limited time available. I have noted the concerns and will try to return to them, not least the dozen or so invitations that I have had to tour the country and visit all the canals. We have had 12 speeches plus the contributions from the Front-Bench spokesmen. There have been at least half a dozen interventions, and all the concerns have been noted.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/3">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing this excellent and well-timed debate. It is good that I am able, early in my ministerial career and new responsibilities, to address some of these issues. I am aware of her long-standing interest in the subject and that she was named parliamentarian of the year by the Inland Waterways Association earlier this year. Members are sometimes shy when we remind them of such things, but the honour is well deserved in this case. She has brought knowledge and insight to the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/4">I briefly turn to my hon. Friend's contribution. She mentioned nationalisation in 1947, and the pivotal role of collaboration. Regional development agencies, local authorities and others must come together to drive forward investment in waterways, whether for restoration or new developments and so on. That is pivotal, and I shall return to it in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/5">Many Members picked up on the role of volunteers, and the fact that if we did not have them at the instigation of nationalisation many decades ago and also now, we would be in a far worse position. That is worth recording.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/6">I welcome this opportunity to reconfirm the Government's commitment to the inland waterways. It is a commitment that I believe was recognised in the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee's report on British Waterways, which was published in July this year. I do not think that anyone can doubt that we have seen a remarkable renaissance in the fortunes of Britain's waterways over the past decade. My hon. Friend referred to the second canal age. The waterways are in a better state today than they have been since before the second world war.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/7">Government investment in inland waterways has been considerable. Over the past decade, we have invested some &pound;750 million in British Waterways, and the Environment Agency has spent more than &pound;42 million over the past three years in maintenance and capital repairs to the waterways infrastructure. As has been mentioned, the waterways, which include the canals, navigable rivers and the broads, provide a range of economic, social and health benefits and so on. They have a vital role in supporting cross-Government agendas for social inclusion, conservation of heritage, the environment and regeneration. Many excellent examples have been given today of how that is done.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/8">Restoring our canal network enables us to enhance those public benefits in new areas around the country, including, as has been mentioned, adding connectivity in some cases. Let me make it clear that I therefore fully support the concept of further restoration. However&mdash;this is a big &quot;however&quot;&mdash;when it comes to priorities for my Department's funding, we must ensure that the waterways maximise public benefits while delivering an affordable, sustainable network within the total funding available. That involves difficult decisions by the Government and British Waterways on the strategic approach to getting the best benefits from our waterways. Our commitment is clear, but it does not mean that we can avoid difficult decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/9">The recent Select Committee report acknowledged the usefulness of the strategic steer that was agreed with British Waterways to provide it with greater clarity about the Government's priorities for the network. We can divide the priorities for the waterways in England and Wales into three areas. The first is maintaining the existing network in satisfactory order to deliver the range of public benefits. The second is achieving the longer-term vision shared by the Government and British Waterways of moving towards greater self-sufficiency. Members will agree on the need to put the network on a long-term, sustainable footing. The third is delivering the range of additional public benefits, which are not divisible from maintaining the network&mdash;they go hand in hand. The Government place great importance on all those areas, but the first one&mdash;maintaining the existing network in satisfactory order to deliver the range of public benefits associated with it&mdash;must be paramount, not least as we consider the current economic climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/10">We are concerned with all three areas, but we have to maintain and drive forward the existing network. That is reflected in the approach that we take with the Environment Agency, which itself needs to implement a sustainable and affordable strategy for waterways management. In the strategic steer to British Waterways, we also made it clear that the Government remain supportive of its ambition to expand the network. That would make an additional contribution to achieving the public benefits that I have already mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/11">The strategic steer reflects the fact that there is a gap between what British Waterways needs to maintain steady state, and current income from all sources; hence the need for it to concentrate its resources on the existing network. That includes, as has been mentioned, the need quickly to repair breaches such as the one at Stourbridge, where British Waterways will need to spend an additional &pound;1 million on repairs. It must be right that British Waterways prioritise its resources to deal with unpredictable events that can have a significant impact on people's enjoyment of the existing network and on all those whose livelihoods depend on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/12">The EFRA Committee recommended that the Government should develop a mechanism to score and prioritise public investment in canal restoration, taking into account the benefits created and the agreed principles on how financial risks should be borne, and the Government noted that. The Select Committee also raised concerns about British Waterways bearing most of the financial risk for the restoration of canals. It rightly commented that canal restoration can directly bring all the benefits that we have described, and its view was that the risks should be spread more widely among the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/13">The Government agree with part of that recommendation but not the first part. As we said in our response, decisions on restoration projects are best taken at a local or regional level, not least because funding has to be raised at the local or regional level.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-28a.210.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1754" speakername="John Horam" colnum="210"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081028/halltext/81028h0008.htm#08102848000552">
	<p pid="a.210.1/1">As the Minister will be aware, this is the second time that I have asked for and succeeded in getting an Adjournment debate on this issue. I called for this debate, first, because there is still a great deal of concern locally about the problems of Bromley and Orpington hospitals and, secondly, because the Government should be aware of that concern at ministerial level, because they have to play a significant part in the resolution of these problems if they are to be resolved satisfactorily. My colleagues, my hon. Friends the Members for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) and for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) supported me in calling for and getting this Adjournment debate because they, too, are concerned about the situation in our local hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/2">Before I say anything else, I should say that I believe that the Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust is full of dedicated people who are doing fine work. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am glad to see the Minister nodding. My sole concern is to see that they are put in a management framework where they can be as good as they aspire to be, both from their professional point of view and with regard to the interests of the people of Orpington and Bromley.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/3">I am always anxious to help the Minister give satisfactory replies. I want to summarise my five requests at the beginning of my speech rather than at the end, in the hope that this will further help him to come up with satisfactory answers when he replies. First, I want to see the merry-go-round of short-term six-month appointments at the top of the Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust management ended and a proper management team appointed with at least a three to five-year view. I have been saying that for a long time and it is time that the Government took notice of that fundamental point.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/4">Secondly, the question of the treatment centre at Orpington should be considered not solely from a short-term financial point of view, dealing with making short-term financial savings, but from the point of view of clinical requirements, particularly taking into account that the Princess Royal university hospital has for years been working at total capacity&mdash;well above the 85 per cent. capacity that is considered optimal. Orpington treatment centre can make a contribution to achieving that aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/5">Thirdly, the trust should be given challenging, but not impossible, financial targets. In that context, bringing down last year's &pound;18.5 million deficit to zero in one financial year was always unrealistic, although I accept that that was embraced by the interim chief executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/6">Fourthly, providing that the trust makes progress&mdash;I do not want to let it off the hook in making progress on dealing with the operating deficit&mdash;the Government should be prepared to make a financial arrangement that allows it to deal with its &pound;100 million of overhanging debt, and with the structural and financial problems arising from the private finance initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/7">Fifthly, I hope that the Government will be sensible about asking Bromley to meet the national target of 18 weeks for referral to treatment, which all trusts are supposed to meet by December, given that the starting point for Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust at the moment is that that standard is met in only 57 per cent. of cases. It is asking a huge amount of the trust to go to 100 per cent. in the next two or three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/8">Those are my five requests that I want the Minister to focus on in his reply to my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/9">The main hospital in the trust is the Princess Royal university hospital, which was opened seven years ago as one of first PFI hospitals. Also in my constituency is Orpington hospital, which is very much older but which, five years ago, had a treatment centre built for elective orthopaedic surgery: knees, hips, hands and feet, and so on. That treatment centre had an additional theatre built only two years ago, which was opened by the current Secretary of State for Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/10">The Minister was in Orpington yesterday, I think. I do not know whether he had the opportunity to visit the treatment centre at Orpington hospital. <i>[Interruption.]</i> He says not and I understand why; diaries sometimes prevent such things from happening. None the less, that would have been an opportunity for him to see in situ what an excellent facility this is.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/11">Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust has accumulated a deficit of &pound;100 million. Last year it lost &pound;18.5 million as an operating deficit. The trust commissioned a report from an independent expert in financial management, Mr. Michael Taylor, into how it got into this mess. That report, which was published recently, is, I am afraid, damning and spares no one: not the previous management, the board, the primary care trust, the London NHS or the Government. One saving grace was that the previous management's passion for high clinical standards was applauded.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/12">I want to focus on the handling of the proposed closure of the Orpington treatment centre, since that is causing great concern in Orpington and because it is an example of how things are going wrong. As I have said, the Orpington treatment centre was opened five years ago; it has been universally praised and the theatre was expanded two years ago as a consequence of its success. The centre meets all the Darzi requirements for having elective surgery quite separate from acute and emergency services.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/13">As the Minister knows, under an exercise called &quot;A picture of health for south east London&quot;, it is proposed that the centre should, despite its success, be transferred to Queen Mary's hospital, Sidcup, which may be losing its accident and emergency department under that same exercise. It was expected that it would be two or three years until that proposal became operative. In March the Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust said that it would like to keep the treatment centre open in Orpington. However, in July, which is not that long ago, the new interim chief executive said that the Orpington treatment centre should be closed. A press statement said:</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Incoming Chief Executive Michael Marchment has pledged to make savings whilst maintaining high quality patient care: 'We can close operating theatres without having an impact on patient care by improving the way that we work. The most efficient way of doing this is to close three theatres at Orpington Treatment Centre and bringing the staff and equipment to the Princess Royal University Hospital'&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/15">not, it may be noted, at Queen Mary's, Sidcup, but at Princess Royal university hospital. The press statement continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Bromley Hospitals is in discussion with staff about the closures which will be in place by the autumn.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/17">I think that the trust suddenly realised that it was possibly not taking account of the consultations under &quot;A picture of health&quot;, because on the following day a further press notice was issued:</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/18" class="indent">&quot;However, we recognise that such a move will require discussion with staff, and Bromley Council Health Scrutiny Committee, and possibly consultation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/19">I think that there were some quick second thoughts there.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/20">It seemed then that the centre was going to close in the autumn. At that point, one of my constituents, Mrs. Julie Mott, started a petition that has gathered nearly 19,000 signatures, which is a huge number, as the Minister will be aware, give the numbers of signatures gathered in such situations. I have nothing but admiration for Mrs. Mott and her supporters, who have truly performed a public service.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/21">There were second thoughts and we learned that the treatment centre closure was postponed until January 2009. When I rang the chief executive of the primary care trust, not 10 days ago, he still thought that it was closing in January. However, we learned subsequently that the closure was going to be brought forward again, to <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-30">30 November</phrase>. There was consternation about that and, once again, the date was revised. Mr. Marchment has said in a letter to me that the closure would not now take place until well into the early part of next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/22">A press statement yesterday went further and said that the treatment centre will not close until <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase>. Obviously, I wholeheartedly welcome that decision to postpone the precipitate closure, but there have been four decisions in four months on when the centre will close. That smacks of incompetent management that is not in control. One can hardly imagine how the situation could have been handled worse than it has been. It has created uncertainty, and that is bad not only for staff morale but, I am told, for staff retention, which is extremely important. Clearly, people are concerned about the uncertainty and different decisions being made almost from week to week about when the centre will close. What are they expected to do when teams are broken up and people receive offers from elsewhere? Uncertainty is a matter of great concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/23">The reason for the proposed closure is that it is alleged that the treatment centre is losing &pound;1 million a year, and that that will be saved if it is closed. Whenever the suggestion is made to bring the closure forward, the argument is always that closure will save &pound;1 million a year, which would make a contribution to the current year's savings. When it is suggested that closure should be delayed, the argument is that capacity can no longer be met. The original decision was based on the idea that there was enough capacity for the Princess Royal university hospital to meet the needs if the Orpington treatment centre is eliminated.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/24">The capacity point is important. At the last board meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-24">24 October</phrase>, it was said that 350 patients would have to be farmed out to other hospitals, including Hillingdon, which is a long way from Orpington, to Ilford and to various private hospitals, because they could no longer be dealt with if the Orpington centre were closed. However, I have a copy of an internal memo in which those 350 patients suddenly became 700. The memo is dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-23">23 October</phrase>, the day before the board meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-24">24 October</phrase>, and says that</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/25" class="indent">&quot;in order to meet the 18 week target we will need to substantially increase the numbers of patients on the waiting list that we <i>are </i>sending out to the private sector to upwards of 700 patients.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/26">When the board met the day before the memo, it said that only 350 people would be involved. It seems that the board does not know what is going on. The Taylor report accused the board of not knowing what was going on in the hospital, and this seems to be yet another example of that. Things have not improved. Will those &quot;upwards of 700 patients&quot;, in the light of yesterday's decision to postpone closure of the Orpington treatment centre, still be sent out to other private and public hospitals? Perhaps the Minister knows. I certainly do not know, and no one in Orpington seems to know.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/27">Clearly, it is difficult for the Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust to meet the financial target of reducing its operating deficit to zero, and to meet the national waiting list target of reducing referral times for treatment to 18 weeks when that is achieved in only 50 per cent. of cases. That is asking the trust to do the impossible. It is almost asking it to do the splits, because the targets are in opposite directions.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/28">Another reason for the treatment centre to remain is that last night, under the &quot;A picture of health&quot; proposals, the statutory joint committee on health overview and scrutiny referred all matters, under the statutory procedures, to an independent review by the Secretary of State. It called for that at last night's meeting, and I draw the Minister's attention to the statement, which he will receive shortly. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/29" class="indent">&quot;The JHOSC has serious concerns about the recent decision of Bromley Hospitals Trust...to relocate surgical services from the Orpington Treatment Centre to the Princess Royal University Hospital. This option was not included in the consultation document for the A Picture of Health Proposals. BHT took this decision without prior consultation with the public or the local overview and scrutiny committee despite the decision taken by the JCPCT on 21st July 2008 to move these services to Queen Mary's, Sidcup.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/30">There is a clear conflict between the medium-term plan and the trust's immediate decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/31">I want to make a few more points before the Minister responds. First, I mentioned the circus of interim chief executives. We have had four; three were there for less than six months, and one lasted slightly longer. That is deeply unsatisfactory. I am always told that the reason is that there is a proposed merger in the air with another trust, or perhaps two trusts, so contracts cannot be sensibly negotiated. On the other hand, if we had taken the sensible view and put someone in place two years ago, they would at least have gone two years down the track, and if they could turn round the mess that the trust is in, they could cope with an additional trust if that is what happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/32">Secondly, on consultation, section 242(2) of the National Health Service Act 2006 says:</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/33" class="indent">&quot;Each body&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/34">that is, hospital trusts&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/35" class="indent">&quot;to which this section applies must make arrangements with a view to securing, as respects health services for which it is responsible, that persons to whom those services are being or may be provided are, directly or through representatives, involved in and consulted on&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/36">any changes. The minutes of the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-24">24 July</phrase>, immediately after the announcement of the premature closure of the Orpington treatment centre, say:</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/37" class="indent">&quot;The Nominated Representative, Health and Social Care Forum expressed concern that the proposal to close theatres at the&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/38">Orpington treatment centre</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/39" class="indent">&quot;was made without consultation with members of the public.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/40">The minutes also state that the chief executive</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/41" class="indent">&quot;proposed to meet with the Local Overview and Scrutiny Committee to discuss the future of the OTC.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/42">That committee will be the relevant committee of Bromley borough council, but that does not meet the requirements of the Act. The council should have been consulted anyway, but the local scrutiny committee should also have been consulted under the national health service legislation. In any case, that meeting did not take place until September, when he originally wanted the treatment centre to be closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/43">The people of Orpington and Bromley are intelligent, with a close knowledge of their health services. They want them to succeed, and I suggest that the flimsy consultation was a serious mistake and that that course should not have been followed.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/44">On capacity, independent analysis by the Library shows a strong link between hospital ward overcrowding and the spread of deadly hospital infections such as MRSA and Clostridium difficile. Trusts with a bed occupancy rate higher than the Government's recommended optimum level of 85 per cent. had a much higher rate of both C. difficile and MRSA. Research suggests that in 145 NHS organisations the level is more than 85 per cent., and in some it is more than 95 per cent. The Minister is well briefed on the subject, so I am sure that he knows that Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust has had the highest level of overcrowding and capacity. That should be addressed in any action that is taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/45">The latest development is that I and my colleagues received a letter from the primary care trust indicating that the commissioning of acute care is to be merged. It is one of those letters that says that things will substantially change, but that nothing will actually change. One receives those curious bureaucratic letters from time to time, which are profoundly unsatisfactory. Lord Warner will address a meeting on Thursday, which suggests that mergers between local trusts will be proposed. All I can say is that this is the worst possible time for such structural change. People want a calm period and to be allowed to do their jobs properly. In the light of that, I look forward with immense interest, as do the people of Bromley and Orpington, to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1754" name="John Horam">the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase> on securing the debate, and I join him in paying tribute to NHS staff, especially those in Bromley, whose hard work and dedication across the NHS are delivering a better quality health service than there has ever been. That has benefited not only his constituents, but people across England.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/2">Before addressing the specifics of the changes to the hon. Gentleman's local hospitals, I shall set out the context for those changes. During 60 years of the NHS, society, technology and medicine have changed beyond all recognition. It is important that our health service also changes and evolves to meet those challenges. Today, more and more conditions can be treated and cared for at home or closer to where patients live, in their local community. More services are therefore being provided outside the traditional hospital setting. Hospital care itself is also changing. If we go back 20 years, most surgery almost always required days or even weeks in hospital. Today, the majority of surgery is done on an out-patient basis and patients can be at home and in their own bed on the same day.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/3">As medical science has advanced, our doctors and surgeons have become ever more capable of extraordinary feats of clinical care. There is a growing need for that expertise to be located in centres of excellence that bring together specialists from a number of different areas to work together as a single team. Given those wider trends&mdash;more community-based care and the need for greater specialism&mdash;the old way of doing things, which involved a local general hospital providing most of the care for a population, is not necessarily the safest or most medically effective way to treat patients. That is the context against which the reorganisation of health care in outer south-east London is taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/4">The other important thing that I need to make clear is that decisions on how local services are organised are no longer made by Ministers in Whitehall, and rightly so, but by autonomous NHS professionals on the ground&mdash;at least, that is the case in England. I should like to take this opportunity to commend the collaborative approach that has been taken by the primary care trusts and acute hospital trusts involved in the outer south-east London reorganisation. Given the local concerns and in some cases rivalries, it is no mean feat that they have managed to come up with a set of proposals that they believe will not only ensure safe and high quality services for the people of their boroughs, but put the NHS in outer south-east London at long last on a stable financial footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/5">The process of drawing up the proposals, which are called &quot;A picture of health&quot;, has been led by doctors and other health care professionals and, as the hon. Gentleman is well aware, has involved extensive public consultation. The clear view of the clinicians involved is that, although many services can be devolved further out into local communities, the speciality or complexity of other services means that they need to be concentrated on three sites&mdash;rather than the current four sites&mdash;to make the most of available expertise. Under the respected surgeon Professor Sir George Alberti, an independent national medical advisory team reviewed the proposed changes in south-east London and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/6" class="indent">&quot;It is obvious that no change is not an option. This has been stressed particularly by hospital clinicians... We support the view of concentrating acute services on fewer sites as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/7">As I am sure the hon. Gentleman is also aware, in July, the joint committee of the four PCTs involved agreed to recommend a variation of one of the four options that had been considered during the public consultation. The Queen Elizabeth hospital Woolwich and the Princess Royal hospital Bromley&mdash;his own hospital&mdash;will both become major admitting hospitals. University hospital Lewisham will become a medically admitting hospital and Queen Mary's hospital Sidcup will become a borough hospital. That will lead to an enhanced role for his Princess Royal hospital as the major acute hospital that serves the people of Bromley and, more widely, Bexley.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/8">The enhanced services will include improved maternity services, with more options for mothers, such as a midwifery-led maternity unit and the extension of consultant cover for the traditional maternity wards. There will also be an expanded critical care facility, improved specialist rotas for medically ill patients, who will be admitted under a specialist in their condition, and an increase in accident and emergency capacity, including increased numbers of senior medical staff to serve that speciality. The local NHS said that it believed that that solution would deliver the most clinical and non-clinical benefits to local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/9">As the hon. Gentleman has said, and rightly so, the NHS in south-east London has faced serious challenges for a number of years. As he also noted, when we announced last week the early achievement of the historic milestone that, on aggregate across England, 90 per cent. of admitted and 95 per cent. of non-admitted patients receive treatment within 18 weeks, Bromley primary care trust was one of only five PCTs in England performing below 80 per cent.; in fact, it was the worst performing PCT in the country. That trust is receiving a high level of assistance from both the London strategic health authority and my Department's intensive support team to resolve those issues. Urgent recovery action is under way with the trust and the local health community. It will be extremely challenging for the trust to improve performance sufficiently to meet the December targets, and for that reason, the plans to repatriate surgical work from the Orpington site to the Princess Royal university hospital in Farnborough has been deferred to <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/10">I also note, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman did himself, that the Healthcare Commission annual health check, which was published two weeks ago for Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust, rated the trust as only &quot;fair&quot; for the quality of services and &quot;weak&quot; for the use of resources. That is a deterioration in their performance from 2006-07, when it was rated &quot;good&quot; for services and &quot;weak&quot; for the use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/11">The annual health check is an important independent tool for measuring performance across the NHS and identifying areas for improvement. The Department is working with the Healthcare Commission to take action against trusts that have performed badly, such as Bromley. Any trust that scores &quot;weak&quot; in either quality or finance must prepare an action plan that details the steps taken and further plans to address weaknesses. All of those plans will be monitored and trusts will be revisited in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.1/1">It is not for me to second-guess the decisions that are made correctly by commissioners locally. They will be cognisant of me to ensure that his constituents get their treatment within 18 weeks, which is something that they should be able to expect and is something that people in most parts of the country already enjoy. However, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, we must ensure that that treatment is of the highest quality. Many patients already choose alternative providers&mdash;for example, independent treatment sectors, voluntary sector organisations and charitable institutions&mdash;that give high-quality treatment, including some providers in his area. Indeed, sometimes that treatment is of a higher quality than that of local providers. I do not want to be dogmatic about that matter, because it is right that that decision should be left to his local commissioners in the PCT.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/2">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the critical report into financial management and governance at Bromley hospital that was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-25">25 September</phrase>. As he will be aware, the chairman of the board has publicly apologised for the corporate failings outlined in the Taylor report. There is now a new board and none of the executive or non-executive members of the board who were identified in that period of corporate failure remain on the new board. The hon. Gentleman will know that, for some time, his trust has been one of the most financially challenged in the organisation and that south-east London as a whole contains the most financially challenged health economies in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/3">The financial position of all trusts across London, including those in south-east London, continue to be monitored closely by the provider agency in NHS London. That monitoring process includes monthly reporting for each trust and escalation meetings between NHS London and the trust if forecasts change. Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust forecast out-turn position as presented in the 2007-08 final accounts was a deficit of more than &pound;17 million, but the forecast out-turn position as presented in the 2008-09 plans is for a &pound;203,000 surplus. As the hon. Gentleman recognised, that will be a challenge, but NHS London continues to work with the trust to look at further ways to save costs and to ensure that plans can be put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/4">There are many more points to which I need to respond, but in the minute that I have left, the most important thing to say is that the trust's new chief executive has a high reputation across the NHS. I urge the hon. Gentleman to take part in the meeting of chief executives on Thursday&mdash;all MPs in the area have been invited&mdash;and to engage in the discussions taking place about the future organisation of management, which will have a vital impact&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.219.1/1">I sought the debate to draw attention to the restoration of the Newbridge Memo, in my constituency. That extraordinary building, which includes a 1920s art deco cinema, is not a museum as so many other miners institutes have become. It is the living, pumping heart of the town of Newbridge and the surrounding area. It is open seven days a week, and 28 local organisations use it for everything from tea dances to meetings of the Royal British Legion.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/2">The Memo's dance floor is said to be the best in Wales. Over the past eight decades, great names ranging from the Joe Loss orchestra to James Dean Bradfield and Nicky Wire of the Manic Street Preachers have played there&mdash;James Dean Bradfield used to serve behind the bar. Tom Jones had a pretty rough time when he sang there at the start of his career. One of the Memo's bouncers went on to become head of news at ITV. Ricky Valance, the first British singer ever to have a number one in the United States, with &quot;Tell Laura I Love Her&quot;, is a local lad and performed at the Memo only last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/3">The Prince of Wales visited. He asked that his visit be extended to more than two hours and said that he would come back to reopen the Memo when the restoration was complete. The Memo was runner-up in the final of the BBC's &quot;Restoration&quot; programme. Hundreds of Newbridge folk marched behind members of the local colliery band and others to Hampton Court palace for the final. The Memo is no royal palace, but it is the palace of the valleys. Ruth Madoc, the actress, named it that when asked where her palace would be if she were Queen of Wales. She said, &quot;The Newbridge Memo.&quot; The Memo was used as a key location for the shooting of the film &quot;Very Annie Mary&quot;. &quot;Flick&quot;, starring Faye Dunaway, was partly filmed there, and last year it played host for the filming of a full-length episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/4">The Memo or, to give it its full name, the Celynen collieries institute and memorial hall was built and paid for by the pennies of miners and their families. It was built in memory of the boys from Newbridge who went to the great war of 1914 to 1918 and never returned. The names of every serviceman from the town who answered the call to serve our country are listed on the walls of the Memo&mdash;not just those who gave their lives, but everybody who was ever called to the colours from that town. I think that that is probably unique.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/5">After such a build-up, one might ask, &quot;Why this debate?&quot; Well, the answer is simple. The Friends of Newbridge Memo need money to carry on the restoration. They need &pound;4.9 million to start and they have been turned down by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Let me say at this stage that I am very disappointed that no Minister from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which after all is the Department responsible for the HLF, could be bothered to reply to this debate. However, I am hugely encouraged by the presence of my constituency next-door neighbour&mdash;he represents Caerphilly&mdash;and good friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. Although the Wales Office has no direct responsibility for this matter, I know that, with him and the Secretary of State for Wales, my pleading will not fall on deaf ears.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.0/1">I am very glad to be able to pledge my support for the cause. People from throughout Wales took an interest when the Memo was on television. It was an interesting programme and it was very disappointing that the Memo came second. Does the right hon. Gentleman share my disappointment that so much lottery funding is being diverted from Wales? The sums required in this case could easily be met from the &pound;107 million that I understand has been diverted from Wales to the Olympics.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.1/1">I will certainly come to that point shortly. It is a matter that I wish to develop in my argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/2">Both Ministers in the Wales Office come from true working-class stock and know only too well the debt that we owe the mining communities of Wales. Just as the whole community came together to build the Memo in the first place, they now rally behind the Friends of the Memo and their chairman, Howard Stone. The Friends of the Memo are all volunteers. All give endless hours of their time and all make a contribution to the quality of life of the people of Newbridge that is beyond measure. Their last application was turned down by the Heritage Lottery Fund, but they have not been deterred. They have already embarked on a second bid with determination and grit. My worry is whether the pot will be empty when their bid goes in. So much money for good causes has been diverted to the 2012 Olympics&mdash;as I well know as a member of the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;that I fear the cupboard will soon be bare.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/3">The permanent secretary at the DCSF and David Higgins, chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, appeared before the PAC on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November 2007</phrase>. The PAC was told that the national lottery fund would have to contribute &pound;2.17 billion to the Olympics&mdash;an increase of &pound;675 million. Surely that cannot be good news for projects such as the Newbridge Memo, which need lottery funding so badly. We heard in the PAC that a &pound;5 billion error had been made in estimating the true cost of the Olympic games, and the national lottery&mdash;or should I say worthwhile projects such as ours&mdash;will pay the price for that error. I am concerned that the Heritage Lottery Fund will be squeezed, that people who work hard to restore amazing buildings such as the Memo will become discouraged and that those worthwhile projects that celebrate working-class history will be lost for ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/4">The 2012 Olympics will, I am convinced, be a time of great celebration and success for this country, and I want the Olympics to succeed, but I hope that those celebrations will not leave a bitter aftertaste for the Memo if our further bid is to fail. The truth is that funding for causes such as the Memo has been pillaged to help the Olympics and that has to stop now. Today, I am seeking a cast-iron assurance from the Government that no more lottery money will be siphoned off, thus putting projects such as the Memo restoration at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/5">I said earlier that the Memo was the palace of the valleys, and so it is, which makes me wonder: if it were a royal palace or a great family's stately home, would it be treated better by the Heritage Lottery Fund when bidding for money? This palace celebrates the history not of royalty or great families, but of the working class of Britain&mdash;the people who put the word Great into Great Britain. Sadly, many people no longer have an idea of how important coal mining was to the communities that we grew up in. It is important that the restoration of the Memo goes ahead, because for some of us it is our last link to the historic past of the valleys in which we were born.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/6">It is important to support the social and historical heritage of working people embodied in such places as miners institutes. They are fast disappearing from our towns and villages. If we want to prevent that, we must ensure that when restoration projects are proposed, the funding bodies give a fair share to those projects as they do to stately homes, palaces and castles. Many of those institutes have either gone to rack and ruin or become one of the many faceless Wetherspoon's pubs that we see throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/7">I am determined, as are the Friends of the Memo, that we will not let that happen to the Newbridge Memo. Even though the Memo lost out on the &pound;3 million prize from the &quot;Restoration&quot; programme, they made an application for &pound;4.9 million to the Heritage Lottery Fund. Following advice from the officers of the HLF to turn the restoration into a two-phase project, they made an application for &pound;3.2 million, which was turned down by the HLF trustee board.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/8">I met Jennifer Stewart, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Wales, following the failure of the last bid, and I was told that there was nothing wrong with the bid but the Memo lost out because there was just &pound;6.5 million left in the pot because of funding having to go elsewhere. I thank Jennifer Stewart and her team, because they have been very encouraging and supportive to the Friends of the Memo, who, as I said, are all volunteers. I spoke to her only this morning, and she told me how impressed she had been that the Friends of the Memo, having been turned down by the HLF just recently, have come back determined to fight back and make a further bid. They have a very positive approach. Jennifer Stewart is encouraged by that, and so am I. What concerns me, however, is the criteria used by the Heritage Lottery Fund when judging bids. Indeed, when I asked that very question of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, I was told:</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The Heritage Lottery Fund assesses all applications against its strategic aims. In addition, the Heritage Lottery Fund considers project planning and delivery, projects costs and partnership funding, long-term viability and value for money.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-09-15.2024"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 September 2008; Vol. 479, c. 2024W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/10">Does the Newbridge Memo not have long-term viability? Of course it does. Does it not give value for money? Yes, of course it does.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/11">I am sorry, but I still do not understand how the Heritage Lottery Fund can decide that one project should be judged more worthy than another. Perhaps it should apply common sense&mdash;although I remember my mother saying to me as a lad, &quot;Son, in life you'll find that sense isn't that common.&quot; A little common sense should be applied, so that if two projects of equal merit are being considered, preference or added weight ought to be given to projects in county boroughs such as Caerphilly&mdash;I share the borough with my hon. Friend the Minister&mdash;that have not had their fair share of lottery funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/12">The Memo has probably had one of the highest profiles of any heritage project restoration in Wales. I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1469" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase> will confirm that. It is seen in headlines almost every week. However, the popular vote seems to count for nothing for the trustee board of the Heritage Lottery Fund. The borough of Caerphilly has had just 38 Lottery awards, totalling &pound;566,000. It is the second lowest supported area of Wales. We have been let down. All we want is a fair share so that that wonderful project can go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/13">In a couple of weeks, we will be marking the 90th anniversary of the end of first world war. The historical importance of the Memo needs to be recognised, of course it does; but more important is the fact that the Memo is no museum. It is the very heart of a very special town. The people of Newbridge and the Memo deserve better treatment with the new bid. I hope my that my hon. Friend will have something encouraging to say. I invite him and the Wales Office to stand shoulder to shoulder with me and the community of Newbridge as we make a renewed bid for funding to restore the Memo. It is a palace for the valleys&mdash;a palace for working people to enjoy and celebrate. It deserves a great future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-28a.222.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1470" speakername="Wayne David" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales"  colnum="222"  time="013:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081028/halltext/81028h0010.htm#08102848000562">
	<p pid="a.222.0/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" name="Don Touhig">the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his tireless campaigning for the restoration of the Newbridge memorial hall.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/2">On Friday evening, I chaired a public meeting in my constituency of Caerphilly&mdash;as my right hon. Friend said, I am a neighbour of his&mdash;the purpose of which was to encourage members of the public to join together to save the Caerphilly workingmen's hall. In giving guidance to the meeting, a speaker from the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation went out of his way to pay tribute to what had happened in Newbridge. He said that it was a good example to follow and a model of good practice. That is certainly true: the community as a whole pulled together in support of the Memo. We should all take note of the fact. It is something of which to be proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/3">The Newbridge memorial hall and institute&mdash;the Memo as its affectionately known locally&mdash;is an historic expression of the collectivism that made the south Wales valleys truly special. It was paid for by the local miners; and it was, and remains, one of the finest statements of south Wales when coal was truly king. Not only did it have a fine library and reading rooms, there was also a superb cinema decorated in the art deco style, a large dance hall and four billiard rooms.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/4">On the demise of the coal industry, the memorial hall and institute went into decline. However, because of the vision and hard work of local people, working alongside my right hon. Friend, their local MP, enormous progress has been made in making the Memo the focal point of community life in Newbridge. It is heartening and inspiring to see people in the community working so hard for such a good cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/5">I am pleased to say that the hall is once again returning to its former glory&mdash;its former central community position. My right hon. Friend referred to the large number of organisations that now make use of the hall's facilities. A good example is that family events are now taking place there. A Halloween party is due to take place this weekend, and a ghost-hunting event is taking place in November for those of a more open and inquiring mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/6">We should not forget the passion and hard work that went into the campaign that saw the Memo winning a place in the final of BBC's &quot;Restoration&quot; programme in 2004. With real dedication and sheer hard work, the Memo saw off some strong Welsh competition from Llanfyllin union workhouse and Cardigan castle, and it came close to winning the final prize. Although it lost in the final to the Old Grammar School and Saracen's Head, a 15th century school building and tavern, in Kings Norton, Birmingham, the Memo nevertheless captured the interest of the nation&mdash;including the Prince of Wales. I am pleased to be able to say that members of my family, many of my constituents and I all cast votes with enthusiasm. As my right hon. Friend would say, they voted early and often.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/7">Programmes like &quot;Restoration&quot; have renewed interest and pride in our communities and their history. We only have to think of the time, effort and determination of the campaigns, whether successful or not, to see the pride and dedication that people put into them. Who could not agree that it re-instilled co-operation and hard work across the community? History is made real once again by that collective effort. That is not happening only in Newbridge; it is happening elsewhere in Wales and throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. Indeed, I venture to suggest that the Memo has reinstated the values that had originally paid for and built the hall and institute. In an age when there is always some trouble or story of woe on the news, it is extremely heartening to hear the value of community shining through.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/8">The Memo's importance as a historic structure has been recognised through all that hard work. Cadw, the Welsh Assembly's historic monuments body, has funded the first phase of repair, focusing on the roof and associated works&mdash;lead work and water-proofing against the elements. I am told that major restoration works to secure the building and make it the focus of the community will cost in the region of &pound;3 million. The Heritage Lottery Fund has also provided funds through the project planning grant scheme to support the cost of developing specialist reports to help the conservation repair works. Owing to the nature of demand-led funding such as that of the Heritage Lottery Fund and because other projects also required similar sums, it was not possible to fund the Memo project during that funding round.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/9">The Olympic Games have been mentioned. I emphasise that they are not the London Olympics or the English Olympics: they are the United Kingdom Olympics. It is only reasonable to expect all members of the UK, in one way or another, to make a contribution to ensuring that the 2012 Olympics are successful for the whole country.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/10">Whenever we mention the Heritage Lottery Fund, we are talking about intense competition. For example, during the last funding period bids were made that amounted to more than five times the available resources; it is not simply that support is not being given by the lottery. The fact is that such competition is a good thing. People who are enormously enthusiastic are trying to tap into the Heritage Lottery Fund to ensure that their bids are successful. However, in January, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, when he was at the relevant Ministry, gave a cast-iron commitment that no further lottery resources would be going to support the Olympics. We should take note of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/11">Although the Memo's bid was not successful in June, it is important that we recognise that all hope is not lost&mdash;far from it. I understand that the Heritage Lottery Fund has discussed the application with the Memo's trustees and the reasons why the bid was not initially successful. The trustees will be submitting a second bid next month for consideration in early 2009. I also understand that an important meeting of the Heritage Lottery Fund board of trustees will be taking place in November and that due consideration will be given to the bid then and afterwards.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.2/1">I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Lady Winterton, and to have the opportunity to raise this important issue in Westminster Hall.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="1989-06-04">4 June 1989</phrase>, the tanks of the People's Liberation Army rolled into Tiananmen square. The massacre that followed, according to official Chinese figures, resulted in 241 dead and some 7,000 injured. However, the BBC and students say that there were in the region of some 3,000 dead. At the time, the west was shocked; indeed, Lord Kinnock said that it was a crime against humanity. Ever since, there have been serious question marks against China and its human rights record. Today, China supports arms sales to the Zimbabwe regime of Robert Mugabe, and there was recently an attempt to move arms on to the African continent. It is involved in supplying Iran&mdash;up to $7 billion-worth of arms in 2004. More recently, close to the time of the Olympics, we saw a brutal suppression of the peoples of Tibet, and continued persecution of Christians and Muslims in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/3">What did the European Union and the United Kingdom do at the time of Tiananmen Square, and what have they done subsequently? At the time, EU member states got together and passed the Madrid declaration of 1989. The declaration has some important points, which I would like to place on the record. It involved a breaking of diplomatic relations and, effectively, a stronger form of trade sanctions. Included in the declaration was a clear and separate measure, which referred to</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/4" class="indent">&quot;interruption by the Member States of the Community&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/5">the European Community&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/6" class="indent">&quot;of military co-operation and an embargo on trade and arms with China.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/7">It could not be said clearer than that. In addition to that, continued resolutions of the European Council&mdash;as recently as 2006&mdash;has kept in place those measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/8">At the conclusion of the EU Council meeting in December 2006, the council reaffirmed its willingness to continue working towards lifting the arms embargo on the basis of the European Council conclusions of December 2004. However, the council continues to have serious concerns about the human rights situation in China and deeply regrets that there has been little progress in a number of areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/9">I spoke to an official from the European Commission a couple of hours ago. He agrees that the measure is still in place. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/10" class="indent">&quot;The measure of interruption of military co-operation and the embargo on sale of arms are part of the same thing. It remains resolutely in place.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/11">For some reason, the United Kingdom has chosen unilaterally to break the embargo. In August, a member of the People's Liberation Army passed out of Sandhurst. That is the same People's Liberation Army that was involved in the massacre at Tiananmen square, and has been involved in suppressing the Tibetan movement. The embargo was apparently broken in response to parliamentary questions without the knowledge of Ministers in the Ministry of Defence or the Foreign Office. According to written answers, the MOD officials did not even consult UKRep in Brussels or the Foreign Office. Apparently, the embargo was broken as part of the wider Whitehall initiative to encourage better relations with China.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/12">In order to break the embargo and to allow members of the People's Liberation Army to attend Sandhurst, a safeguard was put in place which said that the training will be kept under review</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/13" class="indent">&quot;and these limited engagements will stop if there is firm evidence that any skills or knowledge we provide have been misused.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-09-17.2250"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 September 2008; Vol. 479, c. 2250W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/14">How they will find the individual officer cadets from Sandhurst in the huge People's Liberation Army, in a huge country that is not renowned for its freedom of information and freedom of movement is beyond me.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/15">After a series of parliamentary questions about what the bilateral programme was, I finally received an answer. The programme will include</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/16" class="indent">&quot;senior leadership engagement, high-level command and staff training...disaster management training, peace and support operations.&quot; &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-10-23.474"><i>Official Report</i>, 23 October 2008; Vol. 481, c. 474W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/17">The total amount of funding allocated in support of the programme for financial year 2008-09 is &pound;465,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/18">I cannot understand what the Chinese People's Liberation Army is going to teach us&mdash;or what we are going to teach them&mdash;on command and staff training. Perhaps we will teach it how to invade an island off its coast that it wants back. When we talk about &quot;junior leadership training&quot; or &quot;peace and support operations&quot;, perhaps we will be assisting it in dealing with its troublesome groups in Tibet that it finds so easy to put down. I found that objectionable. At the bottom of that answer, the Minister says:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/19" class="indent">&quot;I am withholding a copy of the bilateral programme agreement as its release would, or would be likely, to prejudice international relations.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-10-23.474"><i>Official Report</i>, 23 October 2008; Vol. 481, c. 474W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/20">First, we have a right to know what has been signed, especially when it is in contravention of the EU arms embargo. Secondly, we have to ask, &quot;Whose relations could be under threat?&quot; We do not have to look far to realise that our relations with the United States, our closest military ally and trading partner when it comes to military and aerospace equipment, will come under stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/21">In a number of speeches dating back to 2005, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political and Military Affairs, John Hillen, cautioned that any action by the EU to lift its embargo on arms to China would</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/22" class="indent">&quot;raise a major obstacle to future US defense cooperation with Europe...I think we can count on it: should the EU lift its embargo, the US Congress will legislate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/23">I know from representing many thousands of workers in British Aerospace, from travelling to Washington and from my previous life in the aerospace industry that the United States is serious about the steps that it would take should Britain, or the European Union, decide to engage in arms sales and military co-operation that would threaten the important relationship of trust between the United Kingdom and the United States. I have to ask why the Government are following such a line. What are they playing at? We have established through written answers that officials in the MOD did not check with the Ministers. Having spoken to a number of previous Secretaries of State for Defence, they find such an answer to be rather odd because in their experience any agreement to send personnel to military training establishments in the UK with the remotest hint of controversy would usually go via a Minister for approval. I find it incredible that the MOD did not check, or engage in discussions, with the Foreign Office&mdash;the very body of this Government that is charged with representing us in Europe and at European Council discussions. What we have done is dangerous because a number of countries in Europe have less moral regard and would be very keen to sell arms to China. Therefore, it weakens our case in the European Council that we should not engage in arms sales to China.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/24">I suspect that the Government have been caught with their pants down. Effectively, they were not aware of the details of the Madrid declaration and were happy to play around at the edges. However, that is a dangerous game to play. It is a very silly game to play if we think that we can tinker at the edges with a country such as China. As we speak, it has intelligence operatives in this country trying to spy on our defence industry. On a number of occasions, it has successfully penetrated the US military programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/25">Why will the Minister not publish the bilateral agreement and place it in the library? Why is it that no one in his Ministry knew what was going on at the time and left it to officials? Perhaps he can tell us why he thinks that it is better to upset some of our US allies on this issue? We have a long history of trust in the intelligence and defence communities in the US. At this very moment, US officials are trying to agree a trade treaty to allow British defence firms better and preferential access to the US market at the cost of our European allies. Why pursue this silly measure that will only antagonise our relationship and do no good at all?</p>
