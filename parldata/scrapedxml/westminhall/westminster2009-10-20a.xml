</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.179.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" speakername="Geoffrey Cox" colnum="179"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0001.htm#09102038000278">
	<p pid="a.179.2/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner, and to have secured this debate on a subject of increasing importance throughout the country. I should say that I speak with a degree of personal interest because I have relatives in sheltered housing who have experienced the benefit of that form of care for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/2">It is an amazing fact, when one first reads it, that just over 7 per cent. of the retired population are in some form of sheltered or extra-care housing, and about 500,000 people are affected by the issues that we are to debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/3">Let me say right at the outset what I am not here to do&mdash;perhaps I can address the Minister directly. I am not here to say that any particular local authority is uniquely bad or uniquely good. I am not here to argue that the growing orthodoxy of floating support is always wrong. I am not here to argue that floating support does not have significant benefits or that it ought not to be developed throughout the country. I am here to argue that something is going wrong with the process being followed in Supporting People administering authorities throughout the country, with the manner in which changes are being implemented and with the view that they are always right in all circumstances. Most particularly, there has plainly been a failure to make the elderly and the residents of sheltered housing feel that they have truly been consulted.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/4">The Minister will have read the excellent report called &quot;Nobody's listening&mdash;The impact of floating support on older people living in sheltered housing&quot; from Help the Aged and the Housing and Support Partnership, and I make no bones about saying that I am particularly indebted to those organisations. The report reflects many of the concerns that I intend to air this morning, but they are also reflected in the worried letters that Members throughout the country are receiving&mdash;my constituency is no exception&mdash;about the changes to the delivery of sheltered housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/5">It is important to reflect on what sheltered housing with resident wardens provides for those who experience it. First, most residents speak of the sense of security, companionship and collective community in which they reside. At Glebe Court in Northam in my constituency, the proposed changes will have distressing consequences and are causing residents enormous anxiety. Like other residents of sheltered housing, they speak of the warden as the life and soul of their little community.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/6">Invariably, wardens go well beyond the call of duty. They organise social activities. They often preside over fish and chip suppers or sausage and mash. They arrange bingo and outings. They call on residents in the mornings. They are always around to convey a sense of warmth and to provide a listening ear when one or other of the residents experiences trouble or ill health.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.0/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman has brought an important matter to the House and he has started in a very sound manner. He was right to make avoiding generalisations a premise of his remarks, but he is equally right to generalise about one thing&mdash;that wardens are real heroes. They go the extra mile and they are extremely valuable. Will he therefore join me in deploring the fact that some councils have told wardens that they could be sacked or disciplined if they speak to anyone at all about changes to the warden system? Gagging wardens is not the way to run a reasonable democracy or local government.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.180.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" speakername="Geoffrey Cox" colnum="180"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0001.htm#09102038000280">
	<p pid="a.180.1/1">I would agree with the hon. Gentleman on the general principle, although it is difficult to know about the individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/2">Although this is sometimes difficult in the House, I want to avoid the tit-for-tat mudslinging that the debate could descend into. I want to invite hon. Members to embark on a real review and analysis of the changes taking place throughout the country. The Government seem not to have evaluated those changes or even always to have a coherent picture of what is happening, and we need to consider whether they should be getting a grip on the process and offering some clear leadership. As I said, I do not suggest that any particular local authority is uniquely bad or uniquely good, but the Government have a role in the process. They should offer leadership and set out clear guidelines and good practice. If changes are to be implemented, the Government should take the initiative in setting out how they should be implemented in general terms, leaving it to the Supporting People administering authorities to devise the specifics and take the decisions that best suit them.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/3">The Help the Aged report predicts that although about 5 per cent. of provision is floating support, the figure will rise to nearer 40 per cent. in just two or three years. A fundamental, albeit silent and invisible, change is taking place across the country in the provision offered to tens of thousands of elderly people.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/4">I was speaking of the value of wardens. In many cases, wardens are the life support for very frail, vulnerable and elderly people. Often, such people are newly widowed. Sometimes, they have no experience of carrying out small housing maintenance tasks or looking after the plumbing, the kitchen or the bathroom. A supportive environment with a single point of contact&mdash;the warden&mdash;on hand to help therefore provides intensely valuable care and support.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.2/1">I am grateful to my Select Committee colleague for giving way. Like him, I regret the passing of resident wardens, although I do not believe that could have been the intention of the Supporting People changes. In my authority, there are 14 schemes and 333 places, 20 per cent. of which are vacant. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman agree that the problem is that some schemes can reach a tipping point, with vacant property accentuating and accelerating the feeling of vulnerability, such that the rest of the residents eventually leave? They will be decanted by the local authority, which will then flog the property off for other purposes, and that would be a tragedy. Like the hon. and learned Gentleman, I believe that floating wardens have a role to play, but they should not de facto be the only means of providing support? Does he agree?</p>

	<p pid="a.181.0/1">Yes. I agree also that vacancies have driven change; the hon. Gentleman might suggest&mdash;I would not necessarily demur if he did&mdash;that they are often manipulated and engineered to produce a situation in which the home or the development is essentially changed in nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/2">Today, however, I wish to place the spotlight firmly on the changes going forward under the aegis of the Supporting People programme. Having looked into the subject, it seems to me that it is happening at a much accelerated rate, and that it is happening as a result of a growing orthodoxy about how such care and support ought to be delivered.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.181.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" speakername="Greg Mulholland" colnum="181"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0001.htm#09102038000283">
	<p pid="a.181.1/1">I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for laying out the argument as he has. I am sure that we all have had people raising concerns with us about the changes, such as those recently raised with me about the Rosemont flats in Bramhope in my constituency. We have touched upon the question of costs. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman agree that there is a glaring gap in the debate? Getting rid of wardens is used as an argument for lowering costs, yet we are not dealing with the cost of not having wardens to look after the vulnerable people that he so eloquently describes.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.181.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" speakername="Geoffrey Cox" colnum="181"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0001.htm#09102038000284">
	<p pid="a.181.2/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. There is no doubt that the kind of environment that a warden can create will prevent the decline among elderly people that can often lead to knock-on and consequential costs of a much higher order.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/2">However, I can see the other side of the argument, which has been expressed to me by the county council in my area. It is that floating support allows the release of resources to cover a wider range of people in a wider range of settings. I realise that floating support has such a benefit. One can reach people with the current accommodation-based support and tailor it to individual need. However, the argument runs that accommodation-based support does not do that, often delivering support to people who do not need it and sometimes do not even want it&mdash;although people can opt out. The release of resources enables people's needs to be met in their own homes and in other types of housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/3">I fully accept the virtues of taking that approach. I fully understand that with floating support, the use of scare resources is vital&mdash;even more so at present. I fully agree that the practice being developed in many Supporting People administering authorities&mdash;SPAAs&mdash;can often deliver considerable benefits. However, I am concerned that one increasingly meets a kind of intransigence over the idea that floating support is always considered better. The consultation resulting from that sense of righteousness over the delivery of floating support&mdash;if it is held&mdash;does not attract the confidence of those who are consulted, and it is frequently not held at the appropriate time.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/4">I shall tell the Minister of a startling statistic given in the Help the Aged report. It found that something like 67 per cent.&mdash;it was certainly two thirds&mdash;of SPAAs whose consultation processes were considered had consulted residents only after the critical decisions had been made. That simply cannot be right. If one cry is coming from coastal regions such as the one that I represent and from the urban centres represented by other Members in the Chamber today, it is that elderly people feel utterly disempowered by the process. They feel helpless, believing that their voice is not heard. They feel that they are not consulted, and that if they are it is nothing more than a sham.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/5">If it is true, as the report tells us, that 66 or 67 per cent. of authorities have already taken their decisions and only then condescended to consult those most deeply affected, it is a disgrace. The Government have a responsibility; I urge the Minister to take hold of the matter and to say to local authorities, &quot;This is the way you should consult. You should not take decisions before you talk to the residents that are affected, just because they are elderly and frail and preoccupied with the complexities of life.&quot; Such actions are disgraceful. They are exactly replicated in the experience of those at Glebe Court, at Northam in my constituency. There, I was confronted with residents who were distressed and anxious, some tearful, and who were in a state of uncertainty and suspense.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/6">When implementing change of so fundamental a character to the welfare of elderly people, it cannot be right to catapult them into such a state of mind in the twilight of their years, when they are entitled to peace and security. The change is being implemented in a way that does no credit to our Government. I do not mean to make a party political point; I mean that it does no credit to the systems that we have put in place. We need clear leadership from the Government. At the very least, we need clear principles of good practice that local authorities and SPAAs are required, or at least encouraged by the Government, to follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/7">Those principles of good practice should make it clear that the wishes and desires of elderly residents, and their expressions of preference, are important factors when considering a move to floating support. It is a clear symptom of the failure of consultation that elderly people do not feel that they are participating in the change for which their assent is being sought. They should be persuaded by the arguments for floating support.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/8">Such symptoms suggest that we face yet another judicial review. I understand that yet more local authorities are being taken to the High Court to challenge the changes that they are bringing forward. It is a great pity that we should have to rely upon the judges, although I declare an interest in that the law is my profession. I suppose that I should rejoice in the opportunity for lawyers to make more money, but I do not.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.1/1">I do not, because if it is done at the expense of the insecurity of mind of a single elderly person&mdash;the House will recall that even as I speak I am reflecting upon the faces of loved ones&mdash;if it is done at the expense of a single trace of anxiety in them, I deplore it. If they and others like them have to go to the High Court of England and Wales to seek consultation and democratic participation over things that affect their circumstances and their lives, I would deplore it. I hope that the House would deplore it. I hope the House will send the Minister the clearest expression of its wish that the Government should offer leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/2">Help the Aged, in &quot;Nobody's listening&quot;, says of the Government's current approach:</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/3" class="indent">&quot;There has been a serious&mdash;and surprising&mdash;lack of leadership from the Department of Communities and local Government (CLG) and the Housing Corporation (HC), which are allowing retirement housing to wither away without proper debate or discussion. This is disgraceful, and a continued lack of engagement and leadership is likely to have further negative impact on existing and future residents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/4">Those are striking words. They are stark in their warning of the abdication of responsibility that the Government are choosing to adopt. I fully understand that the decisions are for the SPAAs and the local authorities, but that does not mean that the Government should not take a role in leading the right approach in implementing the changes. For when a warden is removed, it affects an elderly person in the most acute way. It removes the single most important thing to them&mdash;the symbol and substance of their peace of mind and security.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/5">What I find particularly distressing and troubling is that there are cases in which the situation is even graver. I am talking about real cases. Elderly people may have taken big decisions in their lives based on the understanding that a warden would be present in the development into which they move. They have sold their houses and made family decisions. They have chosen not to live with their daughter who was going to create an annexe for them. They have chosen to sell their house and have made financial allocations to their children, yet they find, having been in the sheltered housing development for a number of years, that the warden upon whom they have placed their reliance is removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/6">Some 67 per cent. of SPAAs acknowledged that elderly people in a warden-resident housing development regarded the warden as integral to their welfare but, perhaps significantly, a far lower proportion of those SPAAs agreed that wardens were in fact integral to their welfare. I ask the House to reflect for a moment on what that means. It is as if the SPAAs who filled in the questionnaires for Help the Aged said, &quot;We accept that the overwhelming majority of elderly people regard wardens as integral to their welfare, but we don't accept it. We, the SPAAs, think we know better. We, the SPAAs, say that they are not really very integral and residents would not be lost without them.&quot; That permutation of answers to the Help the Aged researchers shows that an orthodoxy, or ideology, is developing about the way in which care should be delivered. My request to the Minister is that the Government should not only take hold of the process of change by delivering and setting down clear guidelines of good practice, but they should reject the idea&mdash;as I hope the Minister will say that he does&mdash;that the orthodoxy of floating support is, in all cases and circumstances, the only way in which extra-care housing should be delivered.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.0/1">The Minister is a decent man of integrity and I guess we shall hear him say that the floating warden scheme, together with the emergency call system and other means, will provide&mdash;and does provide&mdash;an equivalent level of security for the people who live in sheltered schemes. But does the hon. and learned Gentleman agree that there must be recognition that a good proportion of the half million people who live in sheltered accommodation need the sense of community and security that can only be provided by someone on site? I know that it is accepted that 24/7 cover has always been an illusory ideal.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.0/1">I accept that. It is the burden of my submission to the Chamber this morning. There are cases when nothing but a resident warden will do. If we are to make residents feel that they have been consulted, there are times when, if the majority of residents in a particular housing development vote or express the clear wish that they do not want their resident warden to go, it would be wrong to remove him or her. I do not accept the point&mdash;although the hon. Gentleman was well intentioned&mdash;that 24-hour care is an illusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.2/1">I still do not accept the point. In the sheltered housing schemes that I have seen, the wardens may not be around all day, but they are known to be somewhere they can easily be reached. That sense of permanent presence conveys confidence and security to the frail and vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/2">I was speaking about a situation where individuals have made important decisions to their detriment, based on the understanding that 24-hour wardens would be present, and then they find that those wardens are removed. That cannot be right. In particular, it cannot be right when written or oral representations have been made to residents saying that the 24-hour warden will be there and that there is no risk of them being removed from that particular housing development. How can it be right then to break those representations? It cannot be right, and I apprehend that the legitimate expectations to which such situations have given rise are the basis of some of the cases before the High Court now.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/3">We as a House of Commons should not leave it to the judges to sort out the problem. There is a developing picture of incoherence in the way in which such changes are being implemented throughout the country, and it is up to the Government, as the Help the Aged report says so plainly and eloquently, to take hold of the situation and to offer leadership. There should be no prescription for floating support. There should be no presumption that floating support always yields the better benefits. The system adopted must take account of residents' views, and when elderly people have made decisions based on the understanding that a resident warden will be present, it is not right for an authority to withdraw that warden contrary to the wishes of the majority of the residents in that development, and no authority ought to do so. Only if we offer that safeguard&mdash;only if we offer not just consultation but the knowledge that their wishes will be a critical factor in any decision that is taken&mdash;will we restore to tens of thousands of elderly people throughout the country the confidence that the Government and the House are listening, and that individual Members are willing to stand up and fight for them, as we are here to do this morning. They must have confidence that the system does not have to be a juggernaut that rides roughshod and tramples over the interests of individual elderly people. The Government must understand that elderly people are a critical and precious responsibility of this House. I urge them to get a grip on the situation as soon as possible and to offer moral and political leadership as a Government should.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.1/1">Before I call the next speaker, let me say that three Members have written in to say that they wish to contribute to the debate, and I want to bring them all in. However, I advise some self-discipline because I intend to call the winding-up speeches just before 10.30 am.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.185.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="185"  time="009:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0002.htm#09102038000293">
	<p pid="a.185.2/1">I am delighted to take part in this debate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase> on choosing this topic. I know his part of the world rather well, but I will not talk about specific areas. However, I should like to put it on record that I was in one of my sheltered units in Sherborne under the tutelage of a scheme manager. I have to say at this point that it has taken me nearly 10 years to use that title rather than &quot;warden&quot;. If I get it wrong, I apologise because I am always being told that wardens are now called scheme managers. The unit to which I refer is under the scheme managership of Marilyn Wood. It is an excellent unit that has become a very sheltered scheme. I want to say a few things about that, given the way in which the arrangements have moved on from the days of the traditional sheltered unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/2">Stroud is very good in this field, as we have 29 units, which are enormously varied. In many respects, however, my message to my hon. Friend the Minister about the current system is that if it ain't broke, why are we trying to fix it? However, we must also recognise that sheltered accommodation has to move on, and one of the ways in which it should do so is in building more units, which are needed. Recently, the only units that have been provided are either in what I call the not-for-profit sector or, more particularly, in the private sector, whereas to me sheltered accommodation is a function of local authorities and one that they fulfil very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/3">I pay due regard to Pauline Simpson, who chairs the United Sheltered Accommodation Panel in Stroud. Somewhat contrary to what the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon said, it is interesting that in Stroud, people have organised terribly effectively, to the extent that they are pushing the boundaries of participation and consultation. It is certainly not uncommon for 28, even on occasion 29, of the units in Stroud to be represented at that panel. It is a fairly fierce body for anybody going before it, because the people on it do not hold back in saying what they think and they are very clear in their thinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/4">The starting point, or backdrop, to this discussion is that Stroud, perhaps like the rest of the country, has been reviewing the role of sheltered accommodation for some considerable time. The current review started in March 2007, which is more than two years ago, and that review was itself conducted on the back of earlier reviews. I think that we need to reach a conclusion about what we want to do. Much of the review process is about establishing where Supporting People fits in the context of sheltered accommodation. I must say absolutely clearly that Supporting People was a good concept. I say so, because Gloucestershire did peculiarly well out of the early budgetary arrangements for Supporting People. The difficulty was that it was not at all clear how the money would be divvied out, and as the money has been reduced, the allocations have definitely become much more tense and controversial, to the extent that Gloucestershire has had to pay back money, relatively speaking, and it has certainly been capped, which is very unhelpful. This debate is highly pertinent, because in April 2009, we lost the ring fence, which has brought this issue to a head and led a lot of tenants to question how sheltered accommodation will continue to function in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/5">I take it as read that sheltered accommodation is appropriate for those who choose it. I deliberately use those words, because sheltered accommodation is not suitable for everyone. However, I become very annoyed when people see it as a historic form of institutional provision, because that is not what it is. It is very good at what it does, and the key to that success is not the buildings but the people involved. The most important person involved is the warden or scheme manager, and if a unit gets a good one, it functions very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/6">One of the things that was drawn to my attention by Pauline Simpson of USAP was a report on this subject. The hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon talked about a report by Help the Aged, but the report to which Pauline Simpson referred me was by Pascalle van Bilsen and others. It looks at sheltered housing, and compares it with independent housing, and the discussion section begins:</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/7" class="indent">&quot;The most prominent finding of this study is that two comparable groups of frail elderly people in two different housing conditions differed in perceived quality of life, autonomy and feelings of insecurity; respondents living in sheltered housing evaluated their quality of life more favourably and experienced greater autonomy and fewer feelings of insecurity than respondents living independently in the community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/8">That sums up the situation. Why do people want to go into sheltered housing? It is not to lose their independence but to protect it, because they get the best of both worlds; they have someone just keeping an eye on them, but they can keep their own room and their own way of living, despite the fact that they are living communally, which I think has an enormous amount to be said for it in older life.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/9">The problem is that much of the accommodation has aged and we must recognise that it is necessary to invest in sheltered units, just as it is necessary to invest in every other unit of accommodation. If Stroud is taken as an exemplar, which I think it can be, many sheltered units are bedsits, which in this day and age are not popular, because of the lack of space. Moreover, there are always issues related to pets and the way in which people think that their home is really a home, rather than something else.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/10">There is also the issue of the age at which people can go into sheltered accommodation&mdash;I am always wrestling with that issue. Notionally, people can go in, from the age of 60 onwards and I think that that is quite important. For some people, their situation is such that they need to enter into this type of sheltered living at a relatively young age, normally because they have a disability or because they are vulnerable in some way or other. However, that causes some tensions, because there may be a huge age range of people in sheltered accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/11">We must also consider the suitability of some of the accommodation for people as they become frailer. We need to talk about wet floors and how people can be bathed. All of the facilities, for bathing and for other activities, need to be made fit for purpose, if someone's quality of life is to be kept at such a standard that they want to live in sheltered accommodation rather than seeing it as a trap. There are also issues related to things such as mobility scooters, which in many respects are a pain, but they are absolutely vital for the people who use them. In the area where I live&mdash;Sherborne is in Stonehouse, where I reside&mdash;mobility scooters are very attractive, as it is a flat part of Stroud. However, if people are not careful, there are mobility scooter motorway wars, with scooters buzzing around. That is great, but each scooter needs to be powered up and kept in an appropriate place, which is not always easy in some of our older buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/12">Turning to the subject of resident scheme managers, there is always tension about availability. It is important to lay down standards that are fair to the scheme managers, but of course back-up is required. My father, who recently passed away, relied on an alarm system in the community, and that system is crucial. What happens when someone falls over? Who picks them up? There are some real tension points in that situation. Is it the ambulance service that picks them up? Is it a requirement that the scheme manager should do so, or is there some other way to deal with that situation? It is a perennial debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/13">I am aware that other Members want to speak in the debate, so I will bring my remarks to a fairly speedy conclusion. We have spent long enough reviewing sheltered accommodation, which has a part to play. I certainly welcome some of the material from ERoSH&mdash;a consortium on the essential role of sheltered housing&mdash;which examines the role of sheltered accommodation in the round. ERoSH is not against floating support per se. There is a gentleman in my constituency called Ron Birch who provides floating support and he himself is quite critical about some of the ways in which we are going, because he believes that floating support is seen as a cheaper option and as a way in which people can try to pretend that they are providing quality support when in reality nobody is providing such support.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.187.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" speakername="Bob Spink" colnum="187"  time="009:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0002.htm#09102038000294">
	<p pid="a.187.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman think that it would help to inform and improve decisions about sheltered accommodation if there was some more reliable research into the overall total cost of this decision to remove wardens? Establishing that overall total cost would take into account contingent expenses in the national health service and in social services when wardens are withdrawn and floating support is provided, because there is a cost differential in the longer term.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.187.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="187"  time="009:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0002.htm#09102038000295">
	<p pid="a.187.1/1">Yes, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. As much as I do not want to see death by review, there is a lack of good qualitative research that looks at costs and some of the reasons why people go into sheltered accommodation. The point that I was going on to make was about how we manage the way in which people exit&mdash;I do not mean &quot;exit&quot; in the worst possible way, but literally the way in which people need to move into residential care because they are no longer capable of being nursed. That is why I liked the concept of very sheltered accommodation, as it was a stepping stone. However, the issues are not easy, and they must be coped with at an individual level.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/2">We need to get out there and proclaim the value of sheltered accommodation. It must change and updated, and it certainly needs investment, but the benefits are there for all to see. I congratulate the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon, who spelled out those benefits much more fluently than I have done, but consultation with those in sheltered accommodation must be a real exercise. It must involve participation, and it certainly must give people&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.188.1/1">I will bring my remarks to a close, Mr. Olner. We need definitive support from Government and local authorities, and we certainly need the support of those whom we would like to live in sheltered accommodation. That is where we should be going. Let us make sure that we put it on the record, along with the support that exists for it, because it is very appropriate for many of our older people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.188.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="188"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0002.htm#09102038000298">
	<p pid="a.188.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase> on how thoroughly and exhaustively he introduced this topic. I will explain briefly, widening the debate a little, why I am here.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/2">I picked up a lot of additional casework recently relating to tenancy and leasehold issues, many of which centred on service charges and quite a few of which concerned the role of scheme managers. There were complaints and discussions about their availability, the change in service and the cost&mdash;in many cases, the increased cost&mdash;of the service. It seemed to affect a wide variety of accommodation in my constituency, with a wide variety of clients and providers, ranging from the more traditional model of low-cost sheltered housing to high-cost bespoke luxury developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/3">Generally, the picture was fairly simple. It was generally agreed that less was being provided for more. That is annoying, as the hon. and learned Gentleman explained in his initial remarks, to anybody on a fixed budget trying to manage their finances who does not anticipate those finances growing to any extent. If one talks to residents, they often put the cause down to something relatively simple: they blame either the parsimony or the profiteering of the organisation in putting up the charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/4">However, when one talks to the organisations themselves&mdash;the various housing associations and companies that provide sheltered housing&mdash;it gets a little more complex. They talk about tax changes and the changing treatment by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs of benefits in kind. Some&mdash;I must be careful with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> here&mdash;talk about the effect of the EU working time directive on the number of hours that wardens in sheltered housing can work. Many, of course, talk about the change in the Supporting People budget, the separation of housing and care costs and the end of local authority ring-fencing.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/5">All those issues are, frankly, out of the range of ordinary tenants and leaseholders. They are simply confronted with the effects. A particularly acute case in my constituency occurred in a housing development run by Anchor housing, a reputable sheltered housing provider, and involved a tenant who was locked out. She happened to be locked out after the on-site warden had finished her hours. Other tenants visited the on-site warden on the tenant's behalf, trying to get her to open up the house, but the warden refused, saying that it was beyond her role at the moment. The tenants went one step further and asked for a key, which was not provided either. In the end, a locksmith had to come all the way from Bolton&mdash;that was how the Anchor scheme was supposed to run&mdash;to let in the old lady who had waited two hours in the cold to get into her accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/6">That is not the nature of sheltered housing, which is why the incident attracted a degree of media attention in the national press. I suppose that the case could be seen as the extreme tip of quite a large iceberg. Generally speaking, the pattern is fairly clear. The warden service is changing, sometimes in good ways&mdash;wardens now are probably better trained now than they have been hitherto&mdash;but generally, there is a switch away from the beck and call model, which had its limitations and sometimes imposed on wardens in ways that were inappropriate, to the less popular remote model. That raises three key issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/7">The first is a straightforward consumer protection issue. People choose and budget for a particular care package when they go into care housing, as the hon. and learned Gentleman explained clearly in his initial remarks. They pay for a warden service that is then reduced, or they pay for an on-site service that is then removed, seemingly with limited redress. The possibilities for redress must be explored. Warden service is not the only area in which that can happen. I do not want to make Anchor housing the villain of the piece, but the organisation also goes to residents and says, &quot;You've got a bath now. We are replacing it with a shower whether you like it or not, unless you have a doctor's note.&quot; That does not strike me as being in the spirit of sheltered housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/8">That brings me to the second issue. Sheltered housing providers need to think hard about their mission. They are identified with a particular product and a particular kind of client relationship. I know that some of the larger ones want to change the nature of that relationship, and are more attracted to the provision of peripatetic care packages than to the traditional role of providing sheltered housing in the understood sense. However, such providers risk becoming more business-like and losing some of their original sense of mission or soul. One thing weighing heavily on people who complain about what sheltered housing provides is the very high salaries paid by some of the bigger housing associations to their chief executives.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/9">The third issue is public accountability. If providers have access to the public purse, how can they account for that better? Ironically, it is the bigger providers that sometimes find it easier to fill in all the forms and assessments for which they are asked. I have Abbeyfield homes in my constituency, as well as a number of smaller providers. They genuinely struggle to deal with the documentation loaded on them by the local authority, which goes as far as to ask individual clients, including 90-year-old ladies with dementia, what they think of procurement strategies. I have seen the documents; they are wholly inappropriate and make it difficult for smaller providers to prove they are doing a really good job, as is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/10">More bureaucracy is not the solution to any of those problems. The solution, which has been well mapped out in this debate, is to empower the vulnerable citizens who end up in sheltered housing. That might require considering arrangements for advocacy on their behalf, as some of them are not particularly capable of doing so themselves. As was also illustrated by the hon. and learned Gentleman in his opening remarks, we as policy makers must decide what should be provided, or we will simply end up with what we get, not having planned for it. That throws the ball back into the Minister's court, because the call for clear leadership is well supported.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.190.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="190"  time="010:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0002.htm#09102038000299">
	<p pid="a.190.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase>, as well as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>, on not only the content of this debate but the tone in which it has been carried out. It is absolutely right that we seek a consensus on this issue, which affects our constituents, rather than indulging in party political debate. It is not a party political issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">I am particularly indebted to the hon. and learned Gentleman for securing this debate. Had he not done so, I would have had to, in order to meet my commitments on the matter to the residents of Elizabeth court in Martock, whom I met only last week. I said, &quot;Of course I will try to secure a debate early in the next parliamentary Session.&quot; The hon. and learned Gentleman has done me a great service.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">The residents of Elizabeth court have a particular concern. They are losing their part-time warden, having lost their full-time warden some time ago. That is not a local government housing scheme, but a housing association scheme that did not derive from council housing. That widens the context of the debate slightly from the traditional question of what a council provides, because the issue concerns all providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">While talking about my constituency, I ought to mention a case that was well publicised in the national newspapers over the summer. A gentleman in his 80s fell in his home in Holcombe and broke his hip. He was left for some time before being discovered by a neighbour. There was no easy recourse to deal with his problems. That illustrates the exposure of many elderly people. They are anxious, correctly, that if there is an emergency they will no longer have the support they used to have. Four years ago there was an on-site warden who would have dealt with that gentleman's issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">In 2003, there was a court case in which 20 wardens from Harrow borough council claimed that their conditions fell foul of the European working time directive because they were contracted to work 37 hours per week, whereas they were working for more than 100 hours per week. The court found in their favour and awarded substantial compensation. As a result, concern spread quickly among housing managers that they could no longer have on-site sheltered accommodation wardens. That is still used as the reason for many of the changes we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">The changes have now gone well beyond that, because it is often not on-site wardens but part-time non-residential wardens who are being withdrawn in favour of the model described in this debate. Far from the amount of sheltered accommodation being increased, as the hon. Member for Stroud urged, 50,000 sheltered housing units have been lost over the last five years. It is estimated that there are 470,000 units in the country, compared with 520,000 units five years ago. When I say those units have been lost, I do not mean they have been bulldozed, but that the support for residents that provided them with sheltered accommodation is no longer provided. As the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon said, it is estimated that within three years, 40 per cent. of schemes will have floating support.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7">Like other hon. Members, I am not critical of local authorities or housing associations that are putting the greatest possible effort into providing support for their residents. There are some for whom floating support is the right answer; I simply argue that it is not right for all residents. For many residents, it creates a high level of anxiety. Like the rest of the population, residents of sheltered housing schemes as a demographic are becoming older and frailer. They are now more likely to lack comparatively young, good neighbours who can come to their aid and support them in difficult times. That is why wardens are valuable. As is so often the case with people who work in social support systems, wardens have sometimes been exploited because they provide added value. They often go beyond the strict terms of their remit. However, that provides not only support, but vital reassurance for residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/8">Moving wardens away appears to provide a cost saving for the housing association. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> said, the costs are often simply transferred elsewhere in the system, making the cost saving only an illusion. We have adduced similar arguments in debates on the value of community beat officers. Such officers were never cost-effective in terms of fighting crime, but they are desirable because they provide intangibles such as reassurance for the community. In the same way, rural post offices have high unit costs and cannot be justified by looking just at the bottom line on the balance sheet. However, they provide enormous value to a community that goes well beyond the strict terms of the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/9">I have mentioned that we are discussing not just local authority housing but housing associations. The current judicial review is against the withdrawa l of warden facilities in non-municipal housing associations. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southport suggested, it is reasonable for residents to expect warden support after they decide to enter such housing. It is a contractual issue because when the housing is bought, the advertisements say that it is sheltered housing with warden support. I have seen such advertisements. The contract they sign is therefore for sheltered housing with warden support. Residents are now being told that the support is being withdrawn unilaterally, without a consequent amendment of contract. We must wait and see what the judicial review says, but I think there is a reasonable expectation.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/10">We have very few minutes at our disposal, so I will close to allow others to speak. I say simply that there must be alternative ways of delivering a better service for those who wish to see a physical presence. I will not prescribe the alternatives, but one that comes readily to mind was instituted many years ago when I was the leader of Somerset county council. Then, there was a movement from institutional care to so-called care in the community. We developed core and cluster systems that provided a resource to a group of people living in houses. That is not quite the same as sheltered housing, but perhaps such a system could be provided by long-term care establishments under contract, to give at least part-time warden support for sheltered housing schemes that goes beyond the simple emergency response and call-up systems being proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/11">We need to look at the consultation process and the kind of executive decisions that are too often being taken for the good of the residents, but without their agreement.</p>

This issue is of extreme interest to many people up and down the country. I congratulate him on the tone with which he opened the debate.

Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, who is no longer in the Chamber, pointed out that the cheaper option might not always be cheaper in the long term. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> spoke about changes in the models for warden schemes, even where they continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> spoke about what happens when wardens are not in place; for example, people might fall and be unable to access support. That reminded me of what happened to my grandmother 20 years ago. She was living in sheltered accommodation that had wardens when she fainted and broke her shoulder. Unfortunately, she lay on the floor for the best part of eight hours, so it is not always the case that, where wardens are in place, people are prevented from being left in a vulnerable position for an extended period.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/5">As I listened to the opening remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon, I was reminded of a consultation meeting with Age Concern that I attended just last week. Age Concern has been running a series of focus groups with elderly people to look at the Government's Green Paper, &quot;Shaping the Future of Care Together.&quot; It wants to make sure that local politicians understand what older people think about the questions posed in the Green Paper and that we understand what older people feel most strongly about.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/6">What struck me most particularly about the comments of the people on the group in Brent was what was said about their complex needs and how meeting those needs allows them to remain independent. The issue is not always about practical elements of support, for example, meals on wheels or adaptations to homes; it is often about emotional support. People on the group in Brent spoke about the extent to which depression is under-reported and under-diagnosed in older people and how daily emotional contact is essential if they are to remain independent. Once depression sets in, it often has a knock-on effect on many other aspects of physical well-being and someone's ability to remain in their own home.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">My hon. Friend is making an excellent point about the specific nature of consultation and how it can be tailored to individual circumstances. One consultation pattern is for large housing associations to consult at national level and ignore the variants in establishments across the country. In such a situation, consultation has taken place, but it is not the right kind of consultation&mdash;with the residents on site.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.193.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" speakername="Sarah Teather" colnum="193"  time="010:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0003.htm#09102038000304">
	<p pid="a.193.1/1">I agree. My hon. Friend makes an excellent point&mdash;I was actually going to make it myself&mdash;about the nature of consultation and the importance of good practice. I am always a little cynical when central Government lecture either local councils or housing associations on what qualifies as good-quality consultation because they are often just as poor at producing decent consultation, and they almost inevitably fall into the trap that national consultations bear no relationship to local needs, as my hon. Friend has just mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/2">By highlighting the issues that the Brent Age Concern group raised with me last week I was making the point that consultation needs to be sensitive, because to get at the issues relating to personal contact, and the kind of personal contact people need, requires sensitively framed questions. The questions in consultations are often framed in such a way that people feel unable to give the answers that they want to give, and they feel unable to express their needs. In terms of the support that they would like, even in relation to one-on-one support from a particular support worker, local residents have said to me that day centres and group activities can often be as important as practical issues. All those matters are part of the mix that needs to go into any kind of funding to support people in sheltered accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/3">I accept the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon, which other hon. Members also mentioned, that elderly people have often made decisions about their life on the basis that support and a live-in warden is provided&mdash;for example, they may have decided not to live with their family. That is why the type of consultation I have mentioned is absolutely vital. The Help the Aged report that the hon. and learned Gentleman cited in his opening remarks suggested that before a decision is made to remove a warden, it should be put to a vote of local residents. That seems to be an example of good practice, which I hope housing associations and councils will consider following. It is perhaps most important that any changes introduced are given time and are not brought in overnight. All too often there is a three-month consultation and a month later, the warden is removed. Someone who is vulnerable needs longer to adapt, even if the proposed changes might be better in the long run.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/4">I strongly encourage the Local Government Association, and perhaps also the Department for Communities and Local Government, to produce a piece of research on good practice in consultations. In addition, I strongly encourage all housing associations and councils to get involved with their local organisations, whether Help the Aged, Age Concern or older people's forums, to ensure that any questions asked in a consultation are properly framed around local need.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/5">The Help the Aged report also suggested that the Tenant Services Authority should have a role to play. I think that it has a role in holding local providers to account if they fail to live up to good standards of consultation. I hope that it will set up a clear independent complaints procedure for tenants who are unhappy with their support services, rather than just for those who are unhappy with their housing management.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/6">On consultation, it is undoubtedly the case that because housing management and social care are provided by different packages, it can be confusing for elderly residents to work out exactly what is on offer. The Help the Aged report recommended that the Government should consider providing retirement housing as a coherent package, and I hope that the Minister will respond to that point in his closing remarks as I would be interested to know whether the DCLG has any plans to provide housing in a more coherent way.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/7">Ultimately, the question is whether it was the right decision for the Government to end the ring-fencing of funding for the Supporting People initiative. Unfortunately, when people are unhappy with what is happening on the ground, it is easy for the immediate knee-jerk reaction to be to bring back ring-fencing for a particular funding scheme. However, that is not the answer. I am no more confident that central Government will provide the right kind of care for people in a particular area than I am that local government will. In fact, local government is more likely to be held to account by local residents when it gets things wrong&mdash;it is far more difficult for people in a residential or sheltered care scheme to hold the Minister to account if he decides that a particular care package is appropriate for a residential home than it is for people to bang down the doors of their local council.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/8">We know that we face great financial difficulty over the next five or possibly even 10 years in relation to public spending, but it is important that ending ring-fencing does not become an excuse for phasing out funding or squeezing budgets, and that local councils do not end up getting the blame for what is, in essence, the removal of money by central Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Olner. This has been an expert and calm debate that has been mercifully free of the party political rancour that sometimes disfigures these occasions. The reason for that lies in the contributions of all hon. Members to date, and in the fact that the tone was set from the start by my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase>. I congratulate him on securing the debate, during which he reminded us that we all have sheltered housing schemes in our constituencies. I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> said that he had an Abbeyfield scheme; I have one in my constituency, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/2">At the start of the debate, my hon. and learned Friend acutely and sensitively tried to focus the minds of hon. Members on the psychology of the older people who use sheltered housing. In some cases, the older people concerned will have perhaps recently lost a relative, be separated by a long distance from their children if they have any&mdash;their children may work elsewhere&mdash;and may not have easy access to their grandchildren. They may therefore suffer from the loneliness and depression to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> referred. Of course, the warden is important in such situations because, in many cases, they can take the place of a family member. Because wardens fulfil that function, they sometimes&mdash;perhaps often&mdash;work well above the literal demands made on the time for which they are paid, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> reminded us. It is quite right for hon. Members to highlight the role of wardens.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/3">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon said that he was not here to defend, per se, the application of any particular system. I have read both the Help the Aged report and the remarks of Imogen Parry of ERoSH&mdash;the Essential Role of Sheltered Housing, which is the national consortium of sheltered and retirement housing. It is worth noting an important point that she made in that organisation's assessment of what is taking place. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Many residents are pleased with changes that have been made to their support services, including a move away from resident warden services, particularly&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/5">this is the key point&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/6" class="indent">&quot;when they have been fully involved in the process.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/7">If there is a single word that sums up this debate, it is &quot;consultation&quot;. As the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, the hon. Member for Brent, East, has just reminded us, consultation should be carried out in the right way, sensitively and with face-to-face contact whenever possible. Imogen Parry has said that the Help the Aged report, &quot;Nobody's listening&quot;, which I have seen,</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/8" class="indent">&quot;noted a link between satisfied tenants and good communication and engagement by landlords or support providers...We promote better understanding of the reasons for the withdrawal of resident wardens, meaningful engagement with residents, better use of assistive technology...and a strategic approach to sheltered housing allocations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/9">Members have mentioned the legal challenge involving more than 40 authorities that is being carried out by the solicitor, Yvonne Hossack. My hon. and learned Friend indicated that a key issue relates to arrangements entered into by older people, perhaps including the older people to whom he directly referred, and the feeling that the arrangements were later altered arbitrarily and unfairly. As a distinguished lawyer, he knows that will be a matter for the courts, so I shall not go any further down that road. Instead, I shall ask the Minister a few questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/10">As the Liberal Democrat spokesman indicated in her remarks on ring-fencing, with which we agree, it is important to strike the right balance between localism and what national Government should properly do. My hon. and learned Friend painted a picture of huge social change, with the move towards floating wardens, without the Government having any grip on the matter at the centre or providing adequate guidance. I have three quick questions for the Minister. First, are the Government making any central assessment of the great social change to which my hon. and learned Friend referred? Obviously, we do not want what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> rightly called death by review, but we want to be sure that the Government have a grip on the issue, including a grip of costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/11">Secondly&mdash;this question arises directly from the Help the Aged report&mdash;what could the Government do to tackle complaints? What guidance could they give local authorities? As the report has made clear, older people in sheltered accommodation, who have not necessarily been consulted about change, are vulnerable and there is a question about where they should go if they have a complaint. Should they go to the local government ombudsman or to the housing ombudsman? What is the Minister doing to ensure that the complaint process is more streamlined? What are the Government doing to ensure that the local government and housing ombudsmen in particular work together better on the issue, just as the local government and health ombudsmen are being encouraged to do by the Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/12">Finally, I have a brief question about advocacy, which has been raised by the hon. Member for Southport and others. What plans do the Government have to make recommendations to local authorities regarding advocacy services, or to put such services in place themselves, to allow older people who may not have been properly consulted to make their case to the housing association or the local authority?</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/13">I congratulate my hon. and learned Friend again on having secured this important debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner. I know what a great interest you have taken in these matters, both as an MP since 1992, and prior to that as a local councillor.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/2">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase> on securing the debate. He is well known for his expertise on this issue and for his commitment and dedication to campaigning for better services for older people, not only in his constituency but across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/3">I echo what several hon. Members have said about the tone of this debate. They have raised a series of important issues that I shall try to address. I hope that they understand how seriously the Government take the housing and support needs of all elderly and vulnerable people, whether they live in their own homes, with family or in supported housing such as sheltered or extra care schemes. I want to pay tribute to all those who provide care for older people, whether in sheltered schemes or in their own homes. I echo what hon. Members have said about wardens and the heroic work that they do, and I pay tribute to all those who provide floating support in the community, thereby enabling people to stay in their own homes, as many wish to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/4">The Government's aim is to ensure that our vulnerable and older citizens get the best housing and support services that can be made available locally in the most effective way. In February 2008, my Department published &quot;Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods: A National Strategy for Housing in an Ageing Society&quot;, in which we set out how sheltered housing is often a positive choice for older people who want to remain independent, but who value that little bit of support or shelter and the sense of security and community that such a scheme can provide. We said in that document that</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/5" class="indent">&quot;extra care and care homes at their best can be vibrant community hubs, tackling exclusion and promoting active ageing, even if the accommodation itself is dated.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/6">As the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon has pointed out, it is for local authorities to decide how best to design and commission such services. We all agree that local authorities are best placed to identify the services that are required to meet the needs of their local areas and to balance local priorities. We are not in the business of dictating to local authorities or service providers the detail of what local services they should provide and how to do so, or in micro-managing the delivery of those services. However, we are equally clear that in developing and commissioning local services, local authorities should take into account the views and experiences of local service providers, local people and especially of service users.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/7">Consultation and needs assessment are critical, both to ensure that any changes in services are effectively managed and reflect the wishes of service users, and to enable local authorities to meet the needs of all service users. That was emphasised in the Supporting People strategy paper, &quot;Independence and Opportunity&quot;, which the Department published in 2007. One of the strategy's most important features is the emphasis that it places on keeping service users at the heart of the delivery of housing support.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/8">The importance of needs assessment and consultation with service users is also enshrined in the quality assessment framework for the Supporting People programme, which was introduced in 2003 and sets out the standards expected in the delivery of Supporting People services. One of its five core principles is client involvement and empowerment, which demonstrates the importance the Government place on that issue. It also identified methods of evidencing achievement and has been a successful practical tool for ensuring continuous improvement in services delivering housing and related support over the past five years. It was reviewed last year to bring it up to date and further emphasise the need for high-quality, individually focused services that aim to improve outcomes for service users. The majority of administering authorities continue to use the QAF, and there is evidence that other services across authorities, such as adult social care, are adopting it as a standard tool to measure the quality of services provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/9">Hon. Members have set out cases in which residents of sheltered housing schemes across the country are concerned about changes to resident warden schemes, especially how those changes are being implemented. I want to spend some time addressing that important and complex matter. It is fair to say that changes in support services for sheltered housing and the replacement of resident wardens by alternative service models are not a new phenomenon. Those changes has been taking place for two decades, as was acknowledged in the campaign report by Help the Aged entitled &quot;Nobody's listening&quot;, to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/10">There are several reasons for those changes. An independent review of floating support services conducted for the Department last year identified a range of factors. It found that there was less demand for sheltered housing, as people tend to move into sheltered housing later in life; that a large number of sheltered housing schemes are not up to modern standards, perhaps providing only bedsit accommodation; and that a significant number of sheltered housing residents do not require support services and are defined as the &quot;active elderly&quot;. That is also reflected in the correspondence we have received from residents of sheltered housing, as they complain that they are sometimes required to pay for services that they do not want. As a result, some administering authorities are commissioning flexible, mobile support to sheltered housing tenants, based on an assessment of support needs, and they are extending that mobile support to older people in other types of accommodation. That is a key benefit of the Supporting People programme, which makes housing-related support services accessible to all vulnerable people, regardless of where they live or their type of tenure.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/11">Other factors driving those changes include problems recruiting resident wardens, which have arisen in several areas, as sheltered housing is not immune to the wider demographic, technological and economic challenges and changes that society faces. We need to encourage innovative ways of caring for and supporting people to provide a more personalised service and make the most of emerging technology. For example, greater use of telecare can bring substantial benefits, including assisting people to remain in their own homes. It can reduce inappropriate admissions to hospitals, facilitate discharge from hospital more quickly and provide advance warning if someone's condition deteriorates.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/12">The &quot;Shaping the Future of Care Together&quot; Green Paper, published earlier this year, sets out the Government ambition for a national care service in England. It recognises that Supporting People put in place structures that enabled partnerships of local authorities, health services and probation services to make decisions about improvements and local investment in housing for vulnerable people. It demonstrates the opportunities for increased innovation in the joint commissioning of those services. Supporting People contributes to the developing work on the national care service, as it shares the same aims of improving service user choice and control and keeping service users at the heart of the programme and its local implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/13">Hon. Members will be aware that my ministerial colleague, Lord McKenzie, is chairing a working group on sheltered housing, providing precisely the sort of leadership that has been called for in the debate, and I will take this opportunity to update hon. Members on that work. The group was established in April by Baroness Andrews, and brings together a range of interested organisations, including representatives of service commissioners, providers and residents, to consider how best to support good local decision making and practice. It is taking forward several projects on resident engagement and consultation and on service models, and that addresses the second and third questions asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/14">The National Housing Federation is leading work on good practice guidance in the implementation of any changes to current support services, including case studies on a variety of successful models for support services for older people, whether flexible community-based support, a scheme management service, the innovative use of technology or a hub-and-spoke model. That work will look at the costs and benefits of the various models&mdash;not just the financial costs, but the psychological costs to residents as well. By identifying value for money and overall benefits for older people, the case studies will present providers and commissioners with a sound evidence base for commissioning support services for older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/15">Consultation is an absolutely vital part of any service, and that cannot be emphasised too strongly. I do not condone the examples of bad practice that the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon gave. As the report &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; points out, if an organisation has really involved and consulted its service users, often change might not be such a contentious or frightening issue, and that is why consultation should happen before those decisions are made, rather than after.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/16">Consultation should also be a proper two-way process, ensuring that the provider is able to portray the situation it faces and offering the opportunity to discuss why those changes are being considered and all the options available. It is for those reasons that consultation and engagement with residents is a critical issue for the ministerial working group, which is doing precisely the sort of work that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> called for. The Centre for Housing Support is leading work on a good practice guide for providers and commissioners of services on how to engage and consult residents. The guide will improve providers' ability to consult meaningfully and engage people. It will help service users to understand what they can expect of consultation, and it will provide a bench mark so that they can make comparisons with what happens in their own organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/17">The ministerial working group is also looking at a key concern raised by Help the Aged: the lack of clarity over the complaints procedures for residents of sheltered housing. The Chartered Institute of Housing is leading work to produce a guide providing clear and concise information about the roles and responsibilities of the different regulatory agencies; when, how and by whom those services can be used; how the agencies relate to each other; and the type of information they require to act. The complaints guide will enable tenants and residents in sheltered housing and their families and carers to judge who to complain to and how to do so if they have exhausted the landlord's internal complaints processes. Those three guides will be published early in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/18">This debate has raised several serious issues about the way in which residents in supported housing schemes are treated, as well as their concerns about the changes that they face. I thank the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon again for securing the debate, which has provided me with an opportunity to show how seriously the Government take those concerns and our determination to ensure that older people can live safely and independently in their own homes, wherever they may be. As I have explained, the key decisions on the provision of services such as warden support must be a matter for local authorities, but we have always made it clear that any changes to the way in which services are provided should be designed to meet the needs of residents and take account of their views through proper engagement and consultation.</p>

	Prisoner Release Decisions

	<p pid="a.201.1/1">This Adjournment debate is something of an experiment. Traditionally in Adjournment debates, as colleagues know, Members seek to press a particular viewpoint and persuade colleagues and the Government to change policy in the direction that they favour. What I shall try to do with this debate is discuss a process that the political system as a whole demonstrably does not handle very well. I apologise to those who may have come here on the assumption that I would speak about prisoner release in general. The specific issue that I wish to deal with is the release of prisoners who have developed serious illnesses, in particular fatal illnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/2">Hon. Members will be familiar with the cases that arose in the summer of the Libyan bomber Megrahi and Ronnie Biggs. Both attracted considerable controversy, and I do not think they showed any of the parties in an ideal light. Rather than a serious and compassionate analysis of the situation as it affected the prisoners and the victims of their crimes, what we got was a good deal of manoeuvring for position between political parties, a good deal of feverish media speculation on what the real motives were and all the usual stuff that we associate with everyday party politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/3">That situation seems unfortunate, not just in those cases but more generally. If someone has committed a serious crime and been convicted&mdash;we have to work on the assumption that they were guilty&mdash;we owe it to the victims, the justice system and the individuals concerned to treat their case rationally and to try to apply consistent principles that stand up in difficult cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/4">One of the fundamental questions I would like to raise is whether it is appropriate that such decisions be taken by a politician in the first place. In many other sensitive areas, Parliament sets up guidelines for how a decision ought to be taken, but the final decision does not actually rest with the senior Minister responsible, whether in Westminster or a devolved Government. We are all familiar with cases where a constituent wants treatment that has not yet been authorised by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and which is remarkably expensive. It might extend their lives&mdash;such cases are very emotional. They are not decided by the Secretary of State for Health but by the primary care trust, occasionally with the involvement of the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/5">I would like to put forward for consideration the proposal that such decisions should ultimately be made by a High Court judge. They should be based on criteria set down by Parliament but should not involve ultimate referral either to the Home Secretary, in the case of Westminster, or to his counterparts in the devolved Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/6">What might such criteria look like? I consulted constituents on that last week and heard a wide range of views. A significant minority simply say that if somebody has been sentenced to life imprisonment, it needs to mean life, and, if they are dying, that is part of life. Basically, prisoners should be kept in prison until they are dead. The argument is that life imprisonment itself is a compromise, that we have abolished hanging for the reasons that we all know but if, in addition, we were to water down life imprisonment so that it did not really mean life, we would send a signal to potential offenders that they will not actually face the threat that they would appear on paper to face. However, if, even in hard cases, we say that a prisoner has to stay in prison for the rest of their days, that sends a strong message.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/7">The counter to that, which, again, a significant minority of my constituents argued, is that no useful purpose is served by keeping somebody in prison at considerable public expense&mdash;the average prison place costs around &pound;36,000 a year&mdash;when they obviously pose no further threat to society. We can think of cases where that was provable beyond reasonable doubt. There has been some discussion in the cases of Megrahi and Biggs about how firm the medical opinions were and so on, but I do not want to get bogged down in those cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/8">Let us assume that we have a case involving a serious offence, and the perpetrator is now bedridden with cancer and expected to die within weeks. It is obvious that if we release him he will not start rushing around and committing more crimes, so the immediate concern is probably not applicable, and few people would think of his position as enviable. Very few would say &quot;Life imprisonment is not really for life&quot; if a prisoner who is bedridden and about to die is let out. They would not feel that that was so bad.</p>

The case of Ernest Saunders is not directly parallel, but all those years ago he was supposed to be suffering from dementia but suddenly recovered as soon as he was released from the court process.

	<p pid="a.202.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question. It anticipates another point, which several of my constituents made, about the possibility of recall. We do not want to swarm like vultures around someone who is released on the basis that he or she is fatally ill, checking every moment that they are really dying, but there is appropriate public outrage if there is a miraculous recovery. An argument that several constituents made, with which I agree, is that if we are going to do this, one of the conditions should be that the person remain in the jurisdiction of the British Government, or whichever Government have made the decision, so that if they prove not to be nearly as ill as they appeared to be, they can be returned to prison. In effect, the reason for their release would have been proved to be invalid.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/2">The parallel is people who are released on probation on the basis that they are thought no longer to be a threat. As my hon. Friend knows, if they were to commit a further crime, they would be sent back to prison to serve not only the sentence for the new crime but the rest of the sentence for the old crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.0/1">My hon. Friend has not as yet mentioned the victim or the victim's family. I always think that the greatest hurt when early release takes place is caused by a lack of communication with those affected. If that were got right, matters would become much easier. Too often, the last people to hear about what is happening are the victim or their family. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a great weakness of the present scheme?</p>

	<p pid="a.203.1/1">Yes, I strongly agree. I, too, have come across cases where the victim of individual violence&mdash;not in high-profile cases like Megrahi&mdash;has only been informed at the very last moment, if at all, and then feels under immediate threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/2">More generally, the feelings of the victims are clearly relevant. A number of judicial authorities have said that the judicial process is not about the victim but fair justice. However, when we talk about compassion we are talking about representing the feelings of the general public and the values of society. It is appropriate for the victims of the crime to be consulted before the decision. It was noticeable that, in the Megrahi case, victims' families had mixed feelings. Some felt strongly that he ought to continue to be detained; some felt that, yes, it was reasonable to release him to show that our values were better than his; and some said that they wanted to move on and did not want to express an opinion either way. In such cases, before making a decision it is appropriate for the victims, in so far as they can be identified, and their families to be informed that the matter is under consideration, so they have the opportunity to make representations.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.2/1">I commend the hon. Gentleman for the thoughtful, measured way in which he is approaching this matter. He has spoken about compassion and justice. May I put it to him that compassion is just one element in justice? If justice serves any purpose, it is surely about the reconciliation of offenders and victims. Does he not think that that is the yardstick we should use when measuring the impact of these decisions and deciding whether what we have got, at the end of the day, is justice?</p>

	<p pid="a.203.3/1">Ideally, yes, there would be reconciliation. Realistically, there will be cases where that is not going to be practical. If someone blew up a relative of mine, I might, if they were dying in prison, say, &quot;Yeah, okay. I won't insist that they stay in prison till their dying day.&quot; But I would not want to meet them and make friends. We cannot make the process entirely contingent on that. If we can do it in a way that encourages that, that would be great. If, as in the Megrahi case, some of the victims' families are in favour of a release, and if the offender is willing to acknowledge that and express some gratitude for it, we have made a step forward in terms of civilization.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/2">There is a parallel here with the Brighton bombing, where the perpetrator has, as I understand it, expressed regret for what he did. He is now a free man. Some of the victims feel that they accept the process and some, perfectly understandably, do not. But the fact that we get such a dialogue going is a step forward. I agree with the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/3">I should like colleagues to consider a number of criteria that we might use for such cases. The first is the gravity of the offence. If somebody is in prison for burglary and dying of cancer, for example, it is probably inappropriate, even if they have a relatively short sentence, that we keep them in prison till their dying day. In a serious case, we are more likely to feel that, at least for the deterrent effect, we will want to keep them in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/4">We should consider the question of how long the prisoner has already served. We are all aware of cases where apparently pretty serious offenders have been released after 10 or 15 years on the basis that they are no longer a threat to the public, and that would apply with additional force if the person concerned is dying.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/5">Another point, which relates to what my hon. Friends have said today, is that we should consider how soon a prisoner is expected to die. Medical science is not exact, so a doctor will never say, &quot;He's going to die in two months and seven days&quot;, although they may say, &quot;He's not going to last more than another 48 hours.&quot; However, if we are talking about three months, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> mentioned, we have to allow for the possibility that it is going to be three months and three days or slightly less. We do not need be too finicky about the precise number of days, but we need to be clear that the position is as described, which means that in any such case at least two doctors with absolutely no connection to the prisoner need to give a concurring opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/6">How confident can we be that the offender will not offend again? Someone's having a fatal illness does not necessarily prevent them from committing certain types of crime. For instance, a gang leader who is resentful about the person who got them into prison might feel that revenge should be one of their dying acts&mdash;one of their last acts on earth. They might feel that they could do that better outside prison. Issues such as that need to be considered. We need to consider whether a person is safe to be released, regardless of the other considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/7">Does the prisoner show remorse? There is a general problem in the justice system that hon. Members will be familiar with, which is that if someone denies that they committed an offence they are treated as not showing remorse, because they say they have not done it. There will be cases, given that everything is fallible, including the justice system, where people really have not committed an offence. We probably do not want to make a decision dependent entirely on the prisoner's confessing and showing remorse, but it is obviously helpful if the person involved says, &quot;Yes, I did it. It was right that I was imprisoned for it. I'm grateful for any compassion shown, but I appreciate that it was right to sentence me.&quot; Personally, I would be inclined to count that in his favour, without completely ruling out a release if he says, &quot;No, it's all unfair. I didn't do it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/8">We need to consider whether the prisoner has family nearby who are able to take care of him. There is a simple cost issue, which I mentioned briefly earlier&mdash;keeping someone in a high-security prison is expensive&mdash;but I am not sure that releasing him from prison straight into hospital, especially if there is no family to look after him, would achieve a great deal. It is more helpful if family are available and it somewhat strengthens the case, because the family are not guilty parties, generally speaking, and they might feel that, whatever the prisoner has done, they would like to spend a little time with him before he dies. That is a relevant consideration and something to think about.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/9">The issue underlying all this is the difficult question of what the justice system is for. I mention this because I am a member of the Justice Committee, and we grapple with this issue when considering alternative forms of punishment. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> said that reconciliation is an important objective. Many of our constituents believe that retribution is part of prison's purpose, and that to some extent society is entitled to believe that if someone commits a terrible crime they will face a penalty. That penalty need not be sadistic, but it should be a penalty nevertheless so that as we go through life we are aware that if we do something wrong, there will be consequences. Rehabilitation in the context that I am discussing is relatively irrelevant if the offender is about to die, although it is obviously relevant in a wider sphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/10">More broadly, society's values are reflected by the judicial system. We tend to believe that whatever our current values, they are superior to any others. We express abhorrence at the practice in some countries of cutting off the hand of people who have committed theft, which slightly skates over the fact that we used to hang people for stealing horses. We should not assume that our system reflects the ideal society. One may be too misty-eyed about such matters, because we are generally dealing with people who are not deserving of great sympathy, although elements of their background may have made them what they are today. Nevertheless, there is something to be said for a judicial system that reflects a humanitarian ethos&mdash;I am not suggesting a Christian ethos, although it could include that&mdash;and that anyone may be forgiven at some point, such as at the end of their life.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/11">The issue is difficult, and the political system does not handle it very well. I hope that my debate has encouraged sensible and non-partisan discussion that might move matters forward.</p>

I am immensely proud of how Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish Justice Secretary, made that difficult decision.

	<p pid="a.207.1/1">I was just coming to that point. I noted that the hon. Gentleman said in his speech that such decisions should be taken out of the hands of politicians. We all have a certain sympathy with that position, but that is not where we were when the decision was made. It was solely and exclusively for the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in the Scottish Parliament, as laid down in statute. It was his decision alone, and he made it not on economic, diplomatic or trade issues, but solely in the interests of Scots law and the best values of Scottish compassion.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/2">When an approach is made for a release on compassionate grounds, regardless of where that is in the UK and regardless of which case it is, the Justice Secretary in Scotland or the Cabinet Secretary in this House has no option but to consider that request and to make a decision based on all the available evidence presented by the statutory bodies involved.

	<p pid="a.208.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner; I obviously take your remarks very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/2">Any Minister, when they make decisions regarding a compassionate release, whether in the UK or in Scotland, has to consider all the available evidence. The Scottish Government have to follow a particular Act, and I hope that this will answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, if that is allowed, Mr. Olner. The Scottish Justice Secretary has the power to make decisions on a compassionate basis because of section 3 of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993. That Act requires that there be solid evidence that a compassionate release should be made. The grounds for compassionate release are given in the Scottish Prison Service guidance about how such releases should be made. I am sure that the situation is very much the same for UK Ministers in this House and that they must consider all the available evidence when they come to make releases on compassionate grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/3">Consideration has to be given to the recommendations from the prison governor and the Parole Board, and all the medical evidence that is provided to support any compassionate release has to be considered. In terms of the guidance in the UK but particularly in Scotland, there are no fixed time limits, but life expectancy of about three months may be considered an appropriate period. The guidance makes it clear that all prisoners, irrespective of sentence length, are eligible to be considered for compassionate release.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/4">In all the cases in which there has been compassionate release, but particularly in the case of the most important prisoner release decision that we have had, all the necessary criteria for consideration of release were met. It is also important to say that very few appeals for compassionate release are turned down. Most are fulfilled. According to the figures that are available, since 1999-2000 all the applications for compassionate release in Scotland have been met. It would have been extraordinary, therefore&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.208.5/1">I am grateful to learn that particular fact from the Minister. In Scotland, all applications that have met the criteria have been fulfilled, so it would have been an astonishing precedent for the Scottish Secretary to refuse the application in the case that we have been discussing, given that the criteria were met. He could have been accused of making a political decision, given that the criteria were met on all those considerations and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.5/2">The decision was taken because of the best interests of Scots law. Due process was absolutely followed in the release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. No political factors influenced it. No decisions about trade or whatever influenced the decision by the Scottish Justice Secretary. The other point is that it was made possible because Scots law is different from that in the rest of the UK, and it is right that it is different. Our Justice Secretary made the right decision for the right reasons to release Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, and Scotland has been shown in a good light in terms of the way in which we have been able to respond to that issue and the actions that we took.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.0/1">I do not intend to make a long contribution&mdash;although it seems to get longer every time I write a note. First, I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> on securing this important debate. Anybody who knows me knows that in all my time in Parliament and before that, I have always tried to voice my backing for the victim of any form of injury and for the family of any victim who is killed. I was sorry that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> spent so long talking about the Megrahi case. Suffice it to say that I disagree with everything that he said. I feel that the 270 people who were killed on that day and their families deserve a bit more than somebody being released.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/2">Part of the criteria&mdash;this applies on both sides of the border&mdash;is that the person who is released can receive better treatment somewhere else. I would argue that the treatment in Scotland would be a lot better than the treatment that Megrahi would receive in Libya. Therefore, under that criterion alone, he should not have been released. I had the pleasure of meeting some of the families in America and I can assure hon. Members that their feelings are completely different from those expressed by Mr. MacAskill when he made his decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one difficulty about the decision was that Mr. Megrahi was released outside Scottish jurisdiction and the miraculous recovery scenario worries people? If he proves to be in better health than was thought, there will be absolutely nothing that the Scottish Government can do about that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.209.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="209"  time="011:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0005.htm#09102038000335">
	<p pid="a.209.2/1">My hon. Friend is right. We are two months down the line of what was basically a three-month death sentence, according to the medical expertise. That said, the medical expertise was given before <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-20">20 August</phrase>, when Megrahi was released, so we are not quite sure how far down the road we are in terms of the three months. However, whether he dies before three months have elapsed or after, that is not really the argument. I believe that he should not have been released. That is a personal belief. It is not a political belief. I have just always felt that victims and victims' families must be protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/2">Let me talk about compassionate release in general. I do have some figures and they disagree with those given by both my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire. According to my figures, in Scotland there have been 31 applications since 2000, from which 24 prisoners have been released on medical grounds, with seven requests denied&mdash;only one of those involved a murder. In England and Wales, 48 people have been granted permanent early release in the past five years, but there are no figures for the number of applications rejected, so I shall have to accept my hon. Friend's 28 per cent. Of those 48 people, 14 were serving life sentences, so I have to ask my hon. Friend what about their victims' families? Who was thinking of them when those people were being released?</p>

	<p pid="a.210.0/1">It is fascinating that we are kicking around these figures once again, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman can tell us something for the sake of clarity. Of the seven applications that were rejected in Scotland, how many did not meet the full criteria?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.210.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="210"  time="011:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0005.htm#09102038000337">
	<p pid="a.210.1/1">The hon. Gentleman talks about full criteria, and of course the full criteria would apply to anybody who was released. If somebody was not released&mdash;I talked about whether somebody would receive better medical attention within the prison system or without it&mdash;he would say that they did not meet the criteria. I would be more inclined to ask whether they had the criteria to make the application. If that were the case, my figures would be right and his figures would be wrong. It is an argument that we could go to and fro with, which in the end would mean absolutely nothing.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.3/1">I apologise, Mr. Olner, and will continue with my figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.3/2">In Northern Ireland 248 prisoners have to date been released under the Good Friday agreement. Of those, 78 were convicted of murder, 76 received life sentences and two were detained at the pleasure of the Secretary of State. None was held solely on a discretionary life sentence, and eight were serving sentences for offences that they had committed in England. I wonder who talked to the victims' families about why those people should be released.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.3/3">Could what I am concerned about happen more often? The Prison Reform Trust warns that the number of prisoners over the age of 60 tripled between 1996 and 2008, to make up about 4,000 of the 84,150 people in prison in England and Wales. The trust states that that is due to harsher sentencing, and to DNA testing enabling convictions to be obtained years after crimes. Well, well. Now we are complaining about how many people are to be sentenced for crimes. I do not have a problem with 84,150 people being in prison. If they have been convicted of crimes they should be in prison. If we must build more prisons I do not have a problem with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.3/4">We talked about the al-Megrahi case, but I shall pass over it as I know, Mr. Olner, that you do not like us to talk about it; it does not really matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.4/1">Order. It is not a matter of my not wanting to hear the case discussed; I said only that it should be put in perspective. It was not in the jurisdiction of this Parliament, and the Scottish Executive made the decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.0/1">I apologise, Mr. Olner. I was totally in error in what I said, but people will get the gist of what I am trying to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/2">A constituent of mine has a daughter who is in prison abroad, who is not, unfortunately, being dealt with using the same criteria as we use in this country. She has been convicted on the ground not of having committed a crime, but of being associated with the person who committed a crime. We have seen how in this country&mdash;I am referring to the al-Megrahi case because it is the one that has had all the coverage&mdash;someone receives the best of attention and help from solicitors and advocates, and generally from the Scottish judicial system. It would have been the same if the crime had been committed in England or Wales. Unfortunately, I cannot get the same treatment for the daughter of my constituent, who is in prison in the Dominican Republic.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/3">We must look at such things in the round. We are in effect releasing people who have committed murder&mdash;in one case 270 murders&mdash;but my constituent's daughter is guilty only by association. I say that not because I know the judicial system in the Dominican Republic but because it was written on the court record when she was sentenced to eight years. I do not think that is fair, but we are more than a little fair to people in this country&mdash;we allow them to be released if they are not well and are going to die.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/4">I worry that if, as the Prison Reform Trust have said, more and more people are living longer and getting to an age where they have no quality of life, we shall allow them to go free. If my wife had been in the aeroplane in question and had been killed I should be very unhappy if a prisoner were to be released because he was going to die in a certain space of time, and was in effect to be given some luxury and help. We saw the television scenes when Mr. al-Megrahi arrived in Libya, and that was probably what got the Scottish public going. I do not think that it was really the fact that he was let loose; it was more to do with the way it was portrayed in the media. It was a disgraceful situation, and we need to examine that.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/5">I have said what I wanted to say. It is important that Members of Parliament should understand what is going on. I agree to some extent with my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe that we must consider the question of who makes the decisions. He seemed to think that judges could do it, but the judges are the problem in some cases, not the solution. I hope that I do not come before one now that I have said that, but I have never had great faith in our judicial system, and what I have seen recently backs up my feelings. I do not think that the decision should be down to one individual. Kenny MacAskill has been vilified, rightly or wrongly, depending on what side of the political divide we are on. He had to make the decision, but it was not fair that he should do so. There must be a better way to ensure that victims' families are listened to, and are part of the process. If someone has been found guilty and granted an appeal, and is still found guilty, I believe that he probably is guilty. If his case goes to another appeal we should not drag it out, but should allow it to happen quickly. Perhaps that was the problem with the al-Megrahi case. If the second appeal had happened more quickly perhaps we would not be having this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/6">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe for securing the debate, and I thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Olner.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">I commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> for bringing the debate, and for the way he framed its terms. Some massive issues are involved. People who have spent their whole lives as jurists have struggled with the question of the purpose of the criminal justice system, so to expect a handful of MPs to come up with the answer after a 90-minute debate is a tall order; but it is a worthy debate, none the less.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">The matter is of some public interest at the moment, as a consequence of the decision to release Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and, earlier in the year, Ronnie Biggs. We can tease issues from those cases that are of broader application and might assist us in establishing the criteria that the hon. Member for Broxtowe rightly said were needed. I shall from time to time refer to those cases, but in a way that I hope does not fall foul of your earlier stricture, Mr. Olner. It is helpful to take lessons from the practical for more general application.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">The debate is timely because the consequence of the Biggs and al-Megrahi cases is that there is now a lively public debate. It is of supreme importance that there should be public confidence in the justice system. The maintenance and restoration of public confidence requires a clear set of guidelines&mdash;protocol, perhaps&mdash;for Ministers to apply when considering such cases. It also requires that any such guidelines and protocols should be put in the public domain. It is important that the public should see that there is a robust procedure that balances the often competing and occasionally contradictory interests that the Minister must take into account when making the relevant decisions. The public should have confidence that that is done in a proper manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4">When I intervened on the hon. Member for Broxtowe to say that the purpose of justice is to effect reconciliation, I should have explained a little more. That purpose is the nirvana, which we may never reach, but we should still have it very much in mind when we approach the entire subject. It is not relevant just in questions of early release. The interest of the victims, about which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> spoke, should be uppermost for every party in the criminal justice system, whether police, prosecutor, Minister, defence solicitor or advocate, or even the prison authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">We are not concerned only about difficult early release cases, there are many routine early release cases. We do not, in any jurisdiction in this country, impose life without parole. Therefore we accept in principle that no matter what a person has done, at some point the day can come when someone will turn the key in the door and they will walk free.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/6">As a former criminal justice practitioner, my concern is that we do not deal well with the victims, whose interests are not always easy to identify and certainly not easy to pursue. We should not&mdash;I offer this as a gentle stricture to the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West&mdash;confuse pursuing victims' interests with giving victims everything that they want. The symbol of justice is the set of scales held up by Justicia, and she is blindfolded because justice, we are told, is blind. That is an important metaphor for us to bear in mind, because justice often requires us not fully to meet the different competing interests.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">The issue is complicated enough, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is also the possibility of collective reconciliation, as we have seen in Northern Ireland. The figures that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West gave for the number of convicted murderers who have been released in Northern Ireland would be pretty unthinkable had it not been for the Northern Ireland peace process. There will be situations where a collective decision is made to move forward, and the victims might have greater understanding for the releases that take place than they would if an individual murderer were released.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.213.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="213"  time="011:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0006.htm#09102038000344">
	<p pid="a.213.1/1">The question of collective reconciliation is very interesting and runs to the heart of much of what criminal justice is about. However, we can achieve collective reconciliation only if the public have confidence in the criminal justice system. For whatever reason&mdash;there is no single reason, but a whole amalgam of them&mdash;too many of our constituents do not have confidence in the system as it operates today.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/2">The hon. Member for Broxtowe outlined a number of criteria, and I want briefly to explore a few of them. One was the possibility of recall, which is important. With respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase>, the issue was not fully taken into account in the decision on Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. If any of the outlandish possibilities that have been discussed ever became a reality, that man would be completely outwith the jurisdiction of the Scottish Justice Minister. One option that could have been considered, and which should perhaps have been considered with more care and force, was release, but not release from Scotland. That is important because we are talking about release from prison, not the end of the criminal justice process, and that is as true for people who are released on compassionate grounds as it is for those who are released on licence in the normal course of things&mdash;it is not the end of the story, as the hon. Member for Broxtowe said.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.213.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" speakername="Pete Wishart" colnum="213"  time="011:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0006.htm#09102038000345">
	<p pid="a.213.2/1">I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comment about someone from a third-party country remaining in the home country. Is he aware that in response to the suggestion that al-Megrahi could have been placed in a hospice or in his former home at Newton Mearns, the deputy chief constable of Strathclyde police said that the burden on the police would have been disproportionate and that 48 police officers would have been required just to police that one man in that one setting?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.213.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="213"  time="011:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0006.htm#09102038000346">
	<p pid="a.213.3/1">Again, we are in the realms of competing interests. Many people might feel that would have been a price worth paying, given the damage to Scotland's reputation when people saw flags flying on the tarmac in Libya when al-Megrahi was returned. Although the people we are talking about should be released from prison, it is important that there is no question of their being at the end of their involvement with the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.3/2">The hon. Member for Broxtowe suggested that the gravity of the offence and the length of time that has been served should be taken into account. Although those are clearly considerations, I must gently tell him that I am not persuaded that they should be primary considerations. I come back to the first principle that I elucidated&mdash;that we accept that everybody who is to be imprisoned can be released at some point. Our focus should be on the substance of the application for early release. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, we should consider whether we have robust, independently obtained medical evidence about the prisoner's condition. Thereafter, we should consider how we give effect to any decision, while respecting the feelings of the victims and families.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">Just to test what the hon. Gentleman has said, does he agree that the length of sentence is pretty important, certainly in extreme cases? Let us imagine that I was suffering from terminal cancer and assassinated Mr. Olner. If I then applied for immediate release on compassionate grounds, would there not be something a bit inappropriate about it?</p>

	<p pid="a.214.1/1">The assassination of our Chairman would certainly be a lot more than inappropriate. Evidence that pre-existing illness was a determining factor in the commission of the crime and, in fact, part of the mens rea would be a highly relevant consideration. However, I come back to the point that we cannot go beyond the general principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/2">My other point, to return to something that I said earlier, is that it is not just the decision that is important, but how we reach it. My concern about the al-Megrahi decision is that it has left a significant number of the Lockerbie families feeling more alienated than ever from the justice system. In that sense, the decision is regrettable. I have many friends in Lockerbie. In fact, I have friends who were living in a house on Sherwood crescent when Pan Am flight 103 came down. It had a severe impact on their lives, the lives of their children and the lives of people in the surrounding area. Many of the victims have been left feeling alienated.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/3">My concern, which I would like to be central in any protocol that is constructed, is that the decisions that we are discussing, being quasi-judicial, should be taken in a quasi-judicial way, by which I mean that they should be taken beyond the public gaze. Judges do not send out press officers to address the press when they make their decisions. We do not see pictures of judges' cars going into Barlinnie prison when judges go to interview prisoners. It was wrong and inappropriate that others should have done such things. If the Minister is to construct a protocol, that is the sort of thing that she should be at pains to exclude. Such exclusions are necessary here and in Edinburgh to restore public confidence in our system.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.2/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this timely debate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> on introducing this issue, which it is important for Parliament to deal with. I also congratulate him on not being unduly drawn into the high-profile al-Megrahi case, which is plainly not within the jurisdiction of this Parliament or the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/2">It is important to focus, as the hon. Gentleman did, on early release on compassionate grounds, and that is what I shall do.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/3">[Mr. Eric Illsley <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/4">Given the title of the debate, however, it is important to make some general comments about Government policy on prisoner release, which needs to be criticised. It is important, although it has not yet been done, to clarify the position in relation to release on compassionate grounds, because that can easily be distorted in debate, although I do not accuse the hon. Member for Broxtowe of doing so. However, because it often comes to light in the public domain in relation to high-profile cases, whether Ronnie Biggs or, in another jurisdiction, al-Megrahi, it is easy to lose sight of the reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/5">We have already heard that 48 prisoners have been released on compassionate grounds over five years, and that only 28 per cent. of applications have been granted. As for the timing of those releases, I understand that those prisoners who are terminally ill are likely to be released with no more than a day or two to live, unlike those high-profile cases of which we heard. We should recognise that the context is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/6">Compassion was mentioned throughout the debate, and it is a key element of the criminal justice system. However, it is important that it is applied properly, given the other factors and principles of the system that need to be taken into account. We must also consider the fact that the concerns of administration and cost can in many ways replace that important principle. In the debate arising from the high-profile cases, one concern is that many of those 48 prisoners were released ultimately for the benefit of administration, given the cost of keeping them in prison with a terminal illness, as opposed to the cost of their being released and dying in a hospice or somewhere else with their families, a factor that the hon. Member for Broxtowe prayed in aid. It is important to know whether those decisions were based primarily on compassion.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/7">We must also consider the criteria that are used. The hon. Gentleman sought to submit new criteria, but the present criteria seem to be little different. I shall briefly go through the criteria in Prison Service Order 6000, to which reference has already been made. It outlines the circumstances in which, in cases where the prisoner is terminally ill, bedridden or severely incapacitated, early release on compassionate grounds may be appropriate. In instances of terminal illness, there are no specified time scales, something to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but the PSO suggests that release may be appropriate where life expectancy is three months or less. It specifically states:</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Early release may be considered where a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur soon. There are no set time limits, but three months may be considered to be an appropriate period. It is therefore essential to try to obtain a clear medical opinion on the likely life expectancy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/9">I note the hon. Gentleman's reference to the fact that there should be two opinions; will the Minister confirm whether, to accord with the PSO guidelines, such a medical opinion would require two medical reports?</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/10">The PSO continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/11" class="indent">&quot;The Secretary of State will also need to be satisfied that the risk of re-offending is past and that there are adequate arrangements for the prisoner's care and treatment outside prison. Early release may also be considered where the prisoner is bedridden or severely incapacitated. This might include those confined to wheelchairs, paralysed or severe stroke victims. Applications may also be considered if further imprisonment would endanger the prisoner's life or reduce his or her life expectancy. Conditions which are self-induced, for example following a hunger strike, would not normally qualify a prisoner for release.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/12">Further detailed criteria are given in the appendix to the PSO. Reference is made to various factors, including the prisoner's health, the benefits or hardships to him and his family, the risk of reoffending, the length of the sentence remaining&mdash;a point that was made during the debate&mdash;and any remarks made by the trial judge.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.2/13">Another factor mentioned by the hon. Member for Broxtowe and by others is the views of the victim of the crime for which the prisoner is serving a sentence. However, the criteria make no specific reference to that factor. The Minister may wish to comment on that aspect of the criteria, which it could be argued is missing, and say whether it should be included.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.0/1">Would the hon. Gentleman agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> that it is important that the victims are informed at least that the process is under way? It does not always happen, with the result that those who might be perceived as a threat by the victim, regardless of whether it is an accurate perception, are released at what the victim will see as fairly short notice.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.1/1">That is a good point, particularly in connection with early release on compassionate grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/2">In relation to the Parole Board's consideration of such matters, I understand that a protocol was published last month specifically to clarify victim participation in hearings. The victims can thus be clear about their expectations, knowing that their voice can be heard through statements to be considered by the panel. It also clarifies their ability to apply to attend and present their statement in person. The protocol is welcome; it has been a long time coming, but it clarifies matters and provides a greater opportunity for the victim's voice to be heard. So far, whether in parole hearings or elsewhere in the criminal justice system, the victim's voice has not been heard properly; indeed, they are often the last to hear information that they should be the first to hear. That needs to change, so the protocol is welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/3">My party has yet to be convinced that change is needed. We recognise the significant role of the Parole Board, and it is important that its recommendations are respected. However, in exceptional cases&mdash;those that involve the most serious of crimes&mdash;the Secretary of State should have discretion, and there should be proper accountability so that he can make difficult decisions on individual cases. I disagree with the hon. Member for Broxtowe on the question of equating decisions by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence on health matters with those that involve serious crime. It is surely for the Secretary of State to take the onerous decision on whether to release someone early.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the parallel that I made was not between general sickness and crime, but between the political process that we all accept is associated with jockeying for position, point scoring and so on, and the rational process that we hope is made in all such situations? Does he not agree that the furore about the Megrahi case was slightly unedifying, and that few felt that the outcome was entirely unrelated to political considerations?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.217.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" speakername="David Burrowes" colnum="217"  time="011:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0007.htm#09102038000353">
	<p pid="a.217.0/1">I hear the point that is being made&mdash;that we can characterise the political process as jockeying and point scoring. It does happen, but one cannot apply that caricature wholly to political decisions made about release on compassionate grounds. I agree that such things must be dealt with in a clear and rational manner. I would want to scrutinise those decisions to ensure that they had been made rationally and clearly, particularly in high-profile cases, and not as a result of pressure from the media. They should be decided on the compassionate grounds and the other factors given in the PSO. However, as I said earlier, I do not wish to be drawn into the al-Megrahi case, as it does not come within the provenance of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/2">The Secretary of State's decisions and the principles behind them must be governed and prescribed by case law, including recent judgments by the House of Lords and by the European Court of Human Rights, which restrict his decisions to being proportional, reasonable and fair. Therefore, taking all those factors into account, I suggest that the discretion of the Secretary of State should remain. However, it must be applied properly in all cases&mdash;high profile or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/3">I wish to make some more general comments about the issue of prisoner release in relation to Government policy on prisons. I am sure that we all agree that when a decision is made to release a prisoner, public safety must be the primary consideration. However, prison overcrowding has reached a crisis point. The number of prisoners has reached an all-time high of 84,702, which is an increase of 25,000 since 1997, and is a problem of the Government's own making. Prison releases, beyond the specific case of compassionate release, are too often motivated by consideration of prison capacity, rather than a prisoner's capacity not to reoffend. As I said in my opening comments, it is important that we do not simply deal with principles of administration, cost and capacity and lose sight of the principles of compassion and, more fundamentally, of justice. Concern was also expressed about prisoners being released early without the victims knowing about it, which leads to a loss of confidence in the whole system.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/4">It is important that we restore honesty to sentencing and that offenders are properly punished for their crimes. Moreover, sentencing must be properly understandable, both to the victims and to the public, and must ensure that reparation and rehabilitation take place properly as well as fulfilling the important need for the prisoner to serve their crime. The Labour Government's failure properly to plan and provide sufficient prison places has forced them into a policy of releasing prisoners early and inappropriately. If we look at the current estate, which is at about 112 per cent. of capacity, with some prisons at as much as 150 per cent., with 25 per cent. of prisoners doubled or trebled up in cells, we can see that decisions are increasingly based on capacity and administration rather than on justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/5">Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, we have seen an estimated 20,000 prisoners released automatically halfway through their sentence. Some 70,000 prisoners have been released early on home detention curfews, 4,000 of whom have gone on to reoffend. In the press, we have seen magistrates' concerns about short sentences. Someone in Essex could be sentenced to 42 days on a Friday, but after the sentence is automatically halved with the provisions for home detention curfew and the problems of housing a prisoner over a weekend, they end up being released, turned round and given a grant for good measure, which undermines the confidence of both the magistrates and the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.0/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, and I do not necessarily disagree with him, but such a problem has happened to successive Governments. Is it not a fact that we are convicting more people because we are catching them? Nowadays with the use of DNA testing, it is easier to catch people. Is the hon. Gentleman against that? Does he feel that people who are convicted should go to prison or be let out?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.218.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" speakername="David Burrowes" colnum="218"  time="011:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0007.htm#09102038000355">
	<p pid="a.218.1/1">As time is running short, I do not want to get into a long debate about the Government's policy in relation to DNA and such like. There are more prisoners on the imprisonment for public protection level who are serving sentences, thus putting pressure on the estate. The Government could have planned for that. The Prime Minister was given the information back in 2002 and could have signed the cheque for more prison places. He took the decision not to do so, and now we are all regretting it.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.1/2">Finally, let me briefly mention the Parole Board, which has not been given enough attention in this debate. It plays a key role, but it, too, has suffered from the Government's failed policy on prisons. Capacity challenges affect it, and as a result, its case load has almost doubled since 2002. In March, the National Audit Office reported problems of hearings being delayed and prisoner risk assessments arriving late. It is important to take note of the concerns of the Parole Board's chief executive. The board has been concerned for some time about the timing and quality of the information on which it has to base its decisions and about the rate of deferrals in some cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.1/3">As the Parole Board makes important decisions on prisoner releases, it must have the proper information. As I mentioned earlier, it is important, too, to inform the victims and involve them in appropriate representations, so we must address the issue of capacity. We must ensure that we have enough prison places to deal with those who commit crime. It is important to have honesty in sentencing and a system of minimum and maximum sentencing. The courts must know the minimum time that will be served up to the maximum time, and the effect of earned release with appropriate conditions. We must ensure that prison governors have the powers to make those initial decisions on prisoner suitability for earned release. Finally, we want to see prisons that have the purpose of real work and rehabilitation so that prisoners are ready to lead constructive, law-abiding lives and not reoffend. It is important that when prisoners are released, they have not been set up to fail so that they end up coming back, having created more victims of crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> on securing this important debate. He said at the beginning of his remarks that it was an experimental debate. His own speech was extremely thoughtful and non-partisan, which is what he said he wanted the debate to be. I have listened with interest to the contributions from hon. Members. It comes as no surprise that there are strong views about early release of whatever kind. As various hon. Members have said, there have been some controversial cases recently in various jurisdictions of early release on compassionate grounds, and which led people to consider the issue of when and under what circumstances that should be done. My hon. Friend discovered as much when he consulted his own constituents and set out his suggestions for criteria upon which such releases should be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/2">Let me assist the Chamber by explaining the legislation under which prisoners may be released on compassionate grounds. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase>, in the less partisan first half of his speech, which I enjoyed a great deal&mdash;I did not think much of the second half of his speech&mdash;said that there is a Prison Service Order and that there are criteria, which is correct. There is also legislation. It might help the debate if I set out what that is. My remarks relate purely and simply to the jurisdiction for which I speak, which is England and Wales, but not Scotland. There are some similarities with the rules and practice in Scotland, but they are not identical and I do not purport to speak for the Scottish Justice Minister in any way.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/3">Moreover, I will address some of the points that have been made and describe how the power has been used in practice. As a general principle, it is right that there should be a power to enable the release of certain prisoners in the most exceptional and compassionate circumstances, such as if a prisoner is about to die. A number of Members have read out the existing criteria. It should be possible for that person to be released early to be with his family and to receive the appropriate care at home or in a hospital or hospice during his final days. In practice, that often relates to removing the handcuffs and taking away the guards from the hospital room in which the individual is going through the final part of his life. That is what that kind of release often means. The statutory authority itself is broad and simply provides that the Secretary of State may, at any time, release a prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist that justify the prisoner's release on compassionate grounds. However, for prisoners serving a determinate sentence, the power is contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 or in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, depending on the dates of their offences and which of those Acts govern their release. For prisoners serving life or other indeterminate sentences, the power is provided by section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. I can assure hon. Members that a great deal of care is taken with every application for compassionate release. However, the primary consideration is, and will always be&mdash;and this comes on to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made about the criteria&mdash;that it will not put the public at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/4">The authority in this area is conferred on the Secretary of State by Parliament, and therefore it is the Secretary of State who determines the policy and criteria that should be adopted as to how they will exercise that power in practice. There has been a bit of a debate about whether or not politicians should do that; there has been a suggestion that it might be better if judges did it, but there has been some disagreement with that suggestion. I do not think that there is any obvious or easy answer. However, on the question of specific prisoner releases on compassionate grounds, which are sometimes controversial, as the debate today has indicated, there is an argument that the Secretary of State, who is accountable to the House and responsible for taking these decisions, should do so in a quasi-judicial way.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/5">Generally, that system has worked well, although I accept the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe has made about the recent controversial cases. Most releases on compassionate grounds are not as controversial as those recent cases that have appeared in the newspapers. Of course, such releases can be upsetting to victims, which was the point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> made. Even release at the end of sentence, which is not made on compassionate grounds, can be very difficult, both for victims who have suffered at the hands of particular individuals and for those victims' families. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> that, although the views and sensitivities of victims must be taken into account and must be in the mix, they cannot be an overriding consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.0/1">I am very grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for her thoughtful response to the debate. On the issue of reoffending, one problem, which was not raised with me during my preparation for this debate, is that people released on compassionate grounds commonly go on to commit other offences. Does she agree that, in practice, it is very rare that such reoffending happens, because we are talking about people who are probably staying in hospital or who are too ill even to contemplate carrying out other offences?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.220.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" colnum="220"  time="012:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0007.htm#09102038000358">
	<p pid="a.220.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. I think that the existing criteria are applied properly, and I know that a great deal of care is taken to ensure that they are being properly applied in our jurisdiction. Many applications that are made for release on compassionate grounds do not meet the criteria sufficiently and are not granted; only 28 per cent. of such applications are granted in England and Wales. Furthermore, prisoners who are released on compassionate grounds go on to die; that is what they go on to do, generally. So, as I have said, my hon. Friend is correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/2">There is a further back-up, to which the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland made reference. Even when prisoners are released on compassionate grounds, they are released on licence, so that if there is any subsequent doubt or concern about them they can be recalled. To respond to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, they cannot be recalled if their medical condition improves suddenly; that is not a reason for recall. In practice, however, that does not occur in respect of this type of cases; it has certainly not occurred in the past few years. Nevertheless, if such prisoners present any risk to the public or if it starts to become clear that they are doing some of the things that my hon. Friend suggested as examples of what they might do&mdash;plotting a revenge killing, or harassing a victim&mdash;they can be recalled. There is absolutely no reason why, in those circumstances, they cannot be recalled to prison, because they are out on licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/3">Reference has already been made to the strict criteria that we have adopted in medical cases. In such cases, the criteria are that the prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and that death is likely to occur soon, which is normally taken to be within three months, although, in respect of the cases that I have dealt with in the Department, death is likely to be much sooner than that. Alternatively, the prisoner is bedridden or severely incapacitated, for example by a severe stroke.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/4">For prisoners serving a determinate sentence, the policy allows for compassionate release where there are tragic family circumstances. In practice, however, such a release hardly ever happens. Only 10 per cent. of applications for release on compassionate grounds are made on the basis of tragic family circumstances. Release in those circumstances would be granted only in extremely rare situations, which do not apply in the type of cases that we have been discussing. Furthermore, the Secretary of State would have to be satisfied that any such release would not put the public at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/5">Prisoners serving an indeterminate sentence may be released on compassionate grounds only for medical reasons. They may not be released for tragic family reasons. For such prisoners, in addition to meeting the criteria of being terminally ill, bed ridden or incapacitated, it is also necessary to establish that the risk of their reoffending is minimal, that there are adequate arrangements for their care and treatment outside prison and that their early release will bring some significant benefit to themselves or to their family. The figures for recent years for such releases were correctly referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West in his remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/6">For prisoners serving an indeterminate sentence, the Secretary of State is required by the relevant legislation to consult the Parole Board, unless circumstances make that impractical. The Parole Board is usually asked to provide a risk assessment before the Secretary of State makes a decision on release. That assessment will be taken into account, along with all the other relevant material and reports from medical practitioners, and from prison and probation staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/7">There has been some discussion today about whether or not one doctor's opinion is enough. It is usually the treating physician, who is in a good position to know what the situation is, who gives an opinion. In addition, there are often prison physicians, as well as physicians from outside the prison who give an opinion. Without conducting some kind of investigation, I could not tell my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe whether one or two medical opinions are usually given, but my suspicion is that there is usually more than one opinion that is given; the report that is issued is usually the product of more than one doctor's opinion. Having said that, however, the opinion of more than one doctor is not required under the existing criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/8">There are also general principles that must be satisfied by any application for release on compassionate grounds. No prisoner may be released early if that would put the public at risk. Furthermore, a decision to release would not normally be made on the basis of facts of which the sentencing court was aware at the time of sentencing. There has to be a development after sentencing that leads to a subsequent illness. If the sentencing court was aware of a person's medical condition, it is fair to assume that that condition was taken into account in the original sentencing. Therefore, that condition is not something that can be considered later, by way of some type of pseudo-appeal to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/9">I therefore say to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe that there are criteria that must be met for release on compassionate grounds. It may be the case that they are not generally known to the public; there is certainly some truth to that. It may well be that, in the party political furore and game that occasionally accompanies one or two of these types of decisions, the criteria upon which the relevant justice Minister makes their decision are not at the forefront of the headlines that one reads in the ravenous media that report these things. However, that is not to say that justice Ministers in whatever jurisdiction they are responsible for do not follow those criteria very carefully. The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate said very clearly&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;that there are other arrangements that bind the decisions that Ministers make, which are there to check that Ministers are making those decisions in a rational way and according to the criteria that are set out and according to the statute as it is set out. Of course, those decisions, like any other decision that a Minister makes, are bound by those general considerations of rationality and fairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/10">Generally speaking, we have had an excellent debate. I do not know if my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe considers that his experiment with regard to this debate has succeeded. Nevertheless, I think that all the criteria that he has set out for considering release on compassionate grounds have something to be said for them. Some of them are already part of the current criteria that must be met for compassionate release. I think that those criteria can be established if anyone seeks to do so. Individual cases are assessed according to those criteria, and in my experience those criteria are assessed very carefully and on a case-by-case basis; there can be no general arrangement that would meet all situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/11">I shall end by expressing some regret about the contribution by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase>, which I thought was an unfortunate and partisan rant that sought to score political points. It did not really succeed in its aim, because my impression, as I sat and listened to it, was that he was protesting a little bit too much. He is not himself the Justice Minister of Scotland. It is my observation that Mr. MacAskill, who is the Justice Minister of Scotland, made it clear that he made the decision about al-Megrahi himself and did so alone. Mr. MacAskill can defend himself, and has done so in the relevant parts of his jurisdiction where he needs to do so&mdash;in the Scottish Parliament and in the court of Scottish public opinion. Mr. MacAskill hardly needs what I consider to be the somewhat dubious assistance of the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire, which, on the basis of his speech today, has not exactly been helpful to Mr. MacAskill's cause.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.1/1">Speaking in debates in the House of Commons is always a slightly tense occupation, but Westminster Hall is normally a more relaxed environment. Today, however, for the first time in Westminster Hall, I feel nervous. I know that on the outcome of this debate depends the future and fate of some of the most vulnerable members of my community.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/2">I am pleased that my colleagues, my hon. Friends the Members for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) and for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker), both of whom have an interest in the subject of mental health, have taken the unusual step of coming along to such a short debate. It is a measure of the concern felt in the community about the closure&mdash;allegedly a temporary one, for four months&mdash;of a psychiatric intensive care unit, or PICU, at Woodhaven hospital in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/3">This is not the first time I have operated outside my comfort zone of defence and security concerns. Back in 1997, when I was a brand-new Member of the House, I came second in the private Member's Bill ballot. We all know what happened to the person who came first: he chose the important subject of banning fox hunting, a decision with which I happen to disagree. On the Friday when that important Bill was debated, the Chamber was packed. A week or two later came my Bill, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill, to improve conditions for people suffering catastrophic mental breakdown and needing a safe and secure in-patient environment in which to recover. Needless to say, because the debate concerned desperately ill people rather than foxes, attendance was down to the usual dozen or two hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/4">One person who gave me invaluable support in preparing for that debate, which involved an issue in which I have no specialist expertise, was Dr. Adrian Yonace, an independent consultant psychiatrist and fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Since then, he has become a personal friend. He is well acquainted with Woodhaven, the marvellous modern mental hospital built and opened in my constituency, much to my delight, only five years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/5">Woodhaven has two wards: a 24-bed acute ward, containing a mixture of people who have voluntarily admitted themselves and people who have been sectioned; and a six-bed PICU where the most seriously ill, difficult and challenging people are confined in a locked and regimented environment. Dr. Yonace describes Woodhaven as an excellent local psychiatric service, with a PICU alongside the acute ward so there is always the potential for interchange between the two units. I will have more to say about that later if I have time.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/6">Dr. Yonace says that the closure of the psychiatric intensive care unit will put great pressure on other PICUs, which are already bulging at the seams. He describes the intensive care ward team under Dr. Guy Powell as widely known for its excellence in the care of the most acutely mentally ill, particularly helping those who live in close proximity and their relatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.2/1">My hon. Friend will know that mental illness is no respecter of parliamentary divisions and that the unit serves my constituents as well as his. I hope that the NHS trust does not underestimate the huge anxiety being caused to relatives who know the needs of the loved ones who habitually come and go from the units.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.0/1">That point about the revolving-door nature of the service offered is crucial; I thank my hon. Friend for making it. I was about to say that Dr. Yonace describes the closure of Ellingham ward as a potentially catastrophic development if it becomes permanent and the great team that runs it is broken up. That is not some politician sounding off; that is an extremely senior professional who is intimately personally acquainted with the hospital concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/2">The people who run the Hampshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust&mdash;these organisations are customarily honoured with such short and snappy titles&mdash;are not monsters. They are dedicated and civilised people. I have spent time with Mr. Nick Yeo, the chief executive, and I find him an empathetic character. What he says relates not only to the Ellingham ward closure but to the potential closure of a place called Crowlin house, again in my constituency. Indeed, I believe I was involved in the opening ceremony only eight years ago. It is another effectively brand-new establishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/3">Crowlin house has had a reprieve for the moment, but Mr. Yeo says that places such as Crowlin house were opened initially to process people from the old long-stay mental hospitals that closed in the 1960s and 1970s. I find that hard to understand, as there is rather a long gap between the closure of those hospitals and the opening of Crowlin house as a halfway house in the community in 2000, but the idea is that such units are meant to look after people who are, hopefully, in transition back to society but who have been institutionalised by having been too long in in-patient facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/4">Mr. Yeo says that it is not the intention or the objective that people should stay in PICUs for very long. He says that the national guideline for the average stay is 26 days, and that people have been staying as long as 40 days, or even 90 in a couple of cases. Mr. Yeo has considered the overall figures for the four PICUs in the trust. The unit at Basingstoke has eight beds, the unit at Southampton has nine, ours at Woodhaven has six and one at Havant has eight. That makes 31 beds in all.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. We do not want to lock people away in institutions. However, there will always be a need for acute beds. The problem is that if we get rid of acute beds, the threshold for admission rises, and all too often very sick people are left out in the community, which is not in a position to support them.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.224.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" speakername="Julian Lewis" colnum="224"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0008.htm#09102040000144">
	<p pid="a.224.2/1">Indeed. It is supposed to be the case that people from PICUs are not discharged except to another ward. After intensive care, they should be discharged to an acute ward and then, hopefully, back into society, perhaps via some sort of halfway house. If they do not get better, they should go to a low or medium-secure unit for a long-term stay.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/2">The problem is that although there is a guideline of 26 days and the trust therefore proposes to get by with 25 PICU beds rather than 31 by losing the six at Woodhaven, the fact is that there is a long waiting list for the low-secure unit at Southfields, in my constituency, which has 18 beds, and people cannot be shifted in the way that theory dictates. That is why Dr. Yonace said that the system is bulging at the seams.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/3">I have been contacted by Rethink, which used to be called the National Schizophrenia Fellowship. It is concerned that during the recession, mental health services will come under much greater strain:</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Rethink expects that different elements of the current crisis&mdash;home repossession, debt and unemployment&mdash;will all take their toll.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/5">It is concerned because:</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Users of Rethink services appear to be experiencing greater financial difficulties and associated stress, which can trigger relapses&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/7">Another concern is that:</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Mental health services in general face increased caseloads as a result of individuals experiencing mental health problems triggered or worsened by straitened economic circumstances&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/9">I have spoken to professionals from Ellingham ward and Crowlin house, and to the relatives of people who have used those services. Crowlin house, which has had a temporary reprieve, is a small unit in my constituency where people with long-term problems are held in a kind of halfway house in the community with round-the-clock support. I have been told that such places are not just for a transitory group, but are vital in caring for people at different points on a spectrum that extends from the most grievously and dangerously ill, through those who can go to acute wards, to those who are not ready to go back home but who need an environment that will help them to reintegrate into the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/10">As my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne said, no matter how far care in the community is taken, there will always be some people who need in-patient care or at least to be surrounded constantly by specialised support. Outreach teams usually visit somebody at home twice a week for 30 minutes. When a person at home is seriously ill, the teams visit them once a day for 30 minutes. That means that the person has 23.5 hours of every day in which to cope by themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/11">When Ellingham ward was closed temporarily, there were five people for the six beds. One of the patients went straight home. He was ready for an acute ward but a bed could not be found, so, reluctantly, he was allowed to go home. Windsor ward, the 24-bed acute ward in Woodhaven, was chock-a-block. The second patient went to another PICU in Basingstoke. His parents live locally and are worried about the distance and disruption. The third patient, who also went to Basingstoke, was so distressed that he had to be manhandled to the car. His normal home is in the west of the New Forest and his elderly mother now has no way of seeing him unless the trust arranges it. The fourth patient went to Havant and the fifth to Southampton. There are lulls in the occupation of beds, but it is not true that there are always several empty beds among the 31 PICU beds in the area. This jewelled operation in our community is being smashed.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/12">The PICU in Woodhaven was closed to new admissions on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-06">Tuesday 6 October</phrase>, although some patients were still there. By <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-09">Friday 9 October</phrase>, the PICU network in the trust was completely full. All acute beds in the trust were taken up and the system was in crisis. At 6 pm on the Friday, a patient on Windsor ward&mdash;the acute ward&mdash;became very disturbed and had to be found a PICU bed. None were free, so Ellingham ward's admissions policy had to be reversed so that the patient could be admitted. If that had happened a week later, the situation would have been impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/13">Any bed that is freed up by somebody going to the PICU enables somebody in the community who is in serious need of a bed on the acute ward to have it. I said earlier that I would refer to such interchange. When a crisis emerged in the acute ward, the staff and capacity of the PICU were available to meet it. The reverse is true: when someone was ready to come out of the PICU, but not ready to go home, they could go straight into the adjacent acute ward. However, even the future of the acute ward is under threat, because who can say what will happen to it when it is a small stand-alone hospital, albeit a brand new one?</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/14">On the night when the Ellingham ward PICU was closed and everyone was shifted out, there was only one free acute bed and one free PICU bed in the trust's institutions, hospitals and organisations. That was at the start of the weekend, when admissions are usually higher. A small, windowless meeting room on Windsor ward has been used recently to accommodate patients on a put-you-up bed. In the two weeks since Ellingham ward was closed, that box room with no toilet or wash basin has been in constant use.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/15">Helen Barnett, whose brother was one of the five patients who were forced to leave Ellingham ward, has met me and written to me. She has given me permission to mention the case. She wrote that her brother was</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/16" class="indent">&quot;a patient on Ellingham Ward at Woodhaven Hospital until...he was suddenly transferred to...Royal South Hants Hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/17">She was</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/18" class="indent">&quot;horrified to read of the proposed closure of Ellingham Ward due to the under-utilisation of the beds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/19">I do not accept that and nor do the professional medical staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/20">She went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/21" class="indent">&quot;He regularly requires the specific secure environment and treatment that Ellingham provides. When he is acutely unwell in a heightened elated presentation he can and has previously required several months of a strict monitored regime that can only be offered on an intensive care ward.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/22">She says that it is now more likely that he and other service users</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/23" class="indent">&quot;will be admitted to units that are not local to their existing care team and where the nursing team will not have the personal knowledge of the patient that currently exists and which is invaluable in the treatment of those with mental health conditions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/24">It is not as though extra resources are being found for the active outreach teams. We have the strange situation in which figures are being presented that are supposed to show that there is spare capacity in the PICUs. That is the basis on which these half a dozen beds can go. In fact, over the last two months, if those half a dozen beds had not existed, there would not have been enough PICU beds in the trust area for 80 per cent. of the time and we would have been struggling and in great difficulty.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. In this case, an inadequate capacity is being built in. I am concerned that the system we are so fortunate to have in the New Forest area is being dismantled on the same basis as the mass closures of the '60s and '70s, even though the units we are discussing were designed for the people who were not catered for by those mass closures. As for the highly specialist prize-winning team at Ellingham, it is being sent off to an adolescent unit, to a forensic unit and to other places where its skills will not be properly used. Those staff are just being used to replace other staff who will now not have to be recruited.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/2">I will conclude by saying that this is not a cheap shot, but it is worrying to have been presented with a long list of non-clinical posts that have been advertised by the trust. In terms of annual salaries, the posts total more than &pound;1.25 million a year and include jobs such as: head of consumer experience at &pound;42,000, chief operating officer at &pound;90,000, project manager at &pound;39,000, interim deputy director of operations at &pound;59,000, graphic designer at &pound;28,000, associate director of contracting and commercial development at &pound;59,000, assistant communications manager at &pound;28,000, human resources principal workforce information data analyst at &pound;34,000, and so on. It has also been reported&mdash;this has been taken badly by the community and I give credit to the <i>Southern Daily Echo </i>for exposing it&mdash;that, while all these closures have been going on, part-time health chiefs in the trust have had some very nice pay rises indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/3">I think it obvious from my remarks that I have had information from people who are directly involved in working for the trust on the clinical side&mdash;not the administrative side. I hope that there will be no question of any form of recrimination, victimisation or career disadvantage against those people who have spoken out. I was absolutely thrilled when Woodhaven opened in my constituency. The problem is being driven by cuts, but it is being dressed up as the dogma of being the means of coming into the modern world and bringing people into the community more. We have done all that and we were right to do it; but even then, it was recognised that the pendulum could have swung too far. The wonderful system we have, of which we are so proud in the New Forest, must not be dismantled. I look to the Minister to reassure me; but, more importantly, to reassure my severely ill constituents and their extremely worried families.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.1/1">Indeed. The trust has decided to close that ward and unit for four months. Given the brief time I have left to reply and the local responsibility for the decisions, I should say that I hope the hon. Gentleman's concerns will be read and heard by the trust, which will want to respond to the specific points he has made. I understand that he met the chief executive of the trust just last Friday, when he raised some of his concerns about access to psychiatric intensive care units. I think he was assured by the trust that there are no plans to change the clinical thresholds for access to the units and that, indeed, the trust's clinicians were confident that they would continue to ensure high-quality care. I know he has been invited to meet those senior clinicians and tour some of the trust's services to see for himself how things are run. I hope that he will take further opportunities, apart from the one he had last Friday, to meet the trust and present the points he is making.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/2">Let me make it clear, and in so doing reassure all hon. Members who have contributed to this short debate, that these temporary closures will not jeopardise the recovery of existing patients and will not lead to a bed crisis or a drop in the quality of care, as the hon. Gentleman fears. The temporary closure of the two units is in line with wider plans to transform mental health care in Hampshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/3">In keeping with many trusts across the country, Hampshire has been on a journey in relation to mental health services and the trust deserves credit, not criticism, for thinking progressively about how mental health can be improved across the region. In particular, it has recognised that some patients in Hampshire have spent more time in in-patient rehabilitation units and psychiatric intensive care beds than is recommended. For example, an audit taken this September found that the average length of stay in psychiatric intensive care units in the trust was 40 days, compared with a national average of just 26 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/4">The temporary closure also reflects the wider successes of Hampshire NHS in re-evaluating the way mental health services are delivered locally, and shifting away from a ward-centred, in-patient-focused model of mental health care. Opposition Members know that that is the right direction of travel. We must get it right, but such a model of mental health care is the right direction of travel as it means reassessing how services are used.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/5">On the specifics of the PICU on the Ellingham ward, from April to June 2009 the average bed occupancy was 94 per cent., and from July to September occupancy dropped to just 74 per cent. The need for a level of flexibility in the system was mentioned, and if we consider Rivendale, from April to June 2009 its occupancy was 70 per cent., after which occupancy dropped to just 54 per cent.

	<p pid="a.228.2/1">I am sorry to cut into the short time I have allowed the Minister, but I have heard those statistics before and I am assured that there will always be lulls at some point. This was an atypical couple of weeks and for 80 per cent. of the time, if there had not been those six beds, the system would have been in crisis. He must not rely on those figures.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.0/1">Those are the figures I have but as I said, the hon. Gentleman has the opportunity to challenge the trust in more detail in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/2">On the reduction in demand for beds, there may be fluctuations because of changes that have nothing to do with how the health service is managed. However, such fluctuations are partly due to changes in the way acute and community services manage patients. For example, changes in clinical practice mean that people spend less time in psychiatric intensive care units before being discharged into more appropriate clinical settings. In line with the principles of the national service framework for mental health, the trust and the primary care trust have been looking carefully at how they can move care out of in-patient wards while crucially ensuring patient, staff and public safety. And they have been successful. The growth in community-based services is helping to reduce the number of patients needing to be admitted and maintained as in-patients for extended periods. As a result, demand is falling for in-patient services and increasing for community services such as assertive outreach, crisis resolution and home treatment. That is in line with the Government's vision for mental health.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/3">However, the trust did not take the decision to close the beds lightly and it will review the situation in January 2010. The closures were necessary to maintain the quality and safety of services for patients and to ensure sustainable working conditions for staff. I would like to take this opportunity to assure the hon. Gentleman that these moves are part of the patients' care plans, which are developed and agreed with patients and/or their carers. The decision was taken on the basis of patient and staff safety and was supported by senior clinicians and service directors across the trust, including medical and nurse directors. There has been no suggestion that patient, staff or public safety will be compromised.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/4">Hon. Members have talked about the pressure on other psychiatric intensive care units, but there are local PICUs that have enough capacity, and there has been a growing number of PICU bed vacancies across the trust. However, I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concerns about these matters, which he and his colleagues have had a good opportunity to articulate. I hope that he takes future opportunities to address these issues with the trust directly, so that he and his colleagues, his constituents who use these services, their families, carers and the wider community can be assured that patient and community safety and patient care always come first.</p>

	Free School Meals
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.230.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="230"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0009.htm#09102040000152">
	<p pid="a.230.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak about this subject, which is very close to my heart. From the start, I want to pay tribute to the Minister, who has played an important part in the campaign to highlight the importance of universal free school meals. She hosted a visit to Hull so that we could learn more about people's experiences of the school meals pilot there, which was prematurely and abruptly ended by the Liberal Democrats when they took over the council.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/2">I am especially pleased that after much lobbying, it has to be said, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase>, agreed to fund a free school meals pilot in three areas: Newham, Wolverhampton and County Durham. I thank also my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1592" name="Sharon Hodgson">the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Mrs. Hodgson)</phrase> for the role that she played in getting that free school meals pilot. Our campaign was also helpfully supported by the GMB union, Unison and the End Child Poverty alliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/3">My mother was a school cook, so I have always believed that the quality of what children eat at school is extremely important. I have watched, however, as over the decades, particularly the 1980s and 1990s, successive cuts have led to more and more school kitchens closing and to a complete withdrawal of hot school meals in many areas. I instinctively thought that Britain was not doing enough to support school meals, but I got the jolt to do something about it in Parliament after I went to Sweden in 2006 and visited schools in which school meal provision was good quality, universal and free. It was after I returned from that trip that the serious lobbying for something similar to happen here began. That experience in Sweden was quite extraordinary. Teachers there were rather bemused that we were so interested in their free school meals, because they took them for granted. They said, &quot;When children go to school, we provide a desk for them, somewhere to sit, a chair, books and stationery, so why wouldn't we provide food as well? They need that to learn just as much as they need a desk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/4">Those of us who have been pressing the case for free school meals have been helped enormously by Jamie Oliver's school dinners campaign. His expos&eacute; of how little we spent on school meals, the variation in quality and the lack of nutrition in some packed lunches helped to raise the issue hugely and led to an increased investment in school meals and to new nutritional guidelines. The Government's response to Jamie Oliver's campaign was very welcome, but it was not enough. In most schools, including primary schools, only about half the children take school lunches. If Jamie Oliver is listening and if he would like to help us to extend the free school meals programme, his help would be very welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/5">Other factors have also helped to raise the profile of this issue. We know that when many children start school, they have not learned at home the social skill of eating a meal around a table or the practical skill of using a knife and fork. Childhood obesity is an increasing problem, so it is important that healthy eating be not only promoted but experienced at school. I was pleased when the Government announced the pilots, and simply delighted when Durham county council submitted a bid to be a pilot authority. David Williams, the director of children's services at Durham county council, and Councillor Claire Vasey, who is the portfolio holder for children's services, and their team, deserve much praise for putting the successful bid together and, more significantly perhaps, for identifying the resources to implement the project in Durham. I congratulate them on the successful celebration event that they held with Steve Cram this morning. But Phil Barclay, head of finance, deserves particular praise for the way in which the pilot has been implemented, so that a free school meal that meets high nutritional standards has been offered to each primary school child in the county since September, when the pilot began.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/6">In the few weeks since the pilot began, the results have already been staggering. After the bid's success was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-01">1 May</phrase>, the county had only four months to get kitchens ready to extend capacity in the system. That was achieved using a Department for Children, Schools and Families grant, money from the primary care trust and big contributions from schools, and in some cases dioceses, all of which were put together in a fund of &pound;3 million to upgrade school kitchens. The lasting outcome has been that most schools now have modern, high-quality catering facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/7">What has been truly amazing about the pilot, however, is the take-up figures. Currently, 86 per cent. of children take up a school meal in the schools covered by the main county council contract, and the figure is 90 per cent. for those schools operating outside the contract, whereas last year, take-up was just 50 per cent. The county council is confident that even the current high figures will rise further. I am extremely fortunate because some schools in my constituency are operating at 100 per cent. take-up, which is truly extraordinary. Credit must be paid to Taylor Shaw, the main contractor, which has done well to concentrate mostly on the quality of the food being produced, and has also risen to the challenge of taking on more staff at very short notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/8">For those who are not yet convinced of the benefits of free school meals&mdash;I am sure there are not many out there&mdash;I shall highlight a few of them. Throughout the pilot areas, children in our primary schools are receiving a hot, nutritious, free school meal at lunch time. Take-up is high. In addition to the nutritional benefits, and there are many, there is no longer any stigma in taking a free school meal, because all children have them. Even though the pilot has been running for only a few weeks, teachers are already reporting better concentration levels among pupils in the afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/9">The economic benefits of free school meals are substantial for parents. That has been particularly important because the project has been launched in a period of economic downturn. Not having to pay for their children's school meals saves parents &pound;8.50 a week per child. Many local parents have told me that the pilot has made all the difference to their family weathering the recession. Many families with two children in primary school are saving &pound;633 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/10">Much of the food is sourced locally, so local businesses and farmers are also benefiting from the programme and, as I said, additional jobs have been created. We are all terribly concerned about climate change, so we should note that food miles are also being cut, with enormous environmental benefits. Lastly, children are learning social skills and how to eat healthily, which will hopefully help us to tackle obesity in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/11">I want to take a minute or two to mention some recent statements from head teachers in the schools where the pilots are running. Pauline Warren is the head teacher at Sacriston junior school, which has 175 children on roll, 154 of whom are having free school meals. Before the pilot was introduced they served only 58 hot meals. She has said that everyone at the school is very enthusiastic and positive; they all think it is a wonderful idea. She said that it is good that children can try the food to see whether they like it before asking for a full helping, and that lunch times are now a more sociable event, with the children all having the same meals and sitting down together.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/12">Judith Hodgson, the head teacher of Witton Gilbert primary school, said her school has 100 per cent. take-up and no packed lunches coming in. Interestingly, they have clean plate awards, and because there is a competition, children encourage each other to eat up all their dinner because tables can also get prizes. That is a really good addition to the pilot, and one that we had not thought of before. Judith Hodgson reports very positive comments from the children and their parents. The children say they very much enjoy the meals, and the school says that the cook is absolutely fabulous and has coped extremely well in getting to grips with the new kitchen, and that everything is working smoothly. Everyone from lunch time supervisors to staff and pupils are now converts. They very much like the new system. She says that the really good thing is that children are eating a healthy meal at lunch time, and many teachers are doing so too.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/13">We need the scheme to continue. I know that some people will say we need to wait for the results of the evaluation. It is a great pity that we did not get the Hull evaluation before the Liberal Democrats cut the scheme there. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will join me, even at this early stage, in pressing the Chancellor to make money available so that local authorities that wish to bid into a fund to extend and continue that programme can do so. I know that this is not a good time to be asking for more money, with expected savings on the way or savage cuts, depending on whom one talks to. It is probably too much to ask for the &pound;1 billion needed to extend the programme to all local authorities, but at least having a fund that would allow local authorities to bid for some money would be a start.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/14">We know that the Government must do more to tackle child poverty, and I know that Ministers are committed to that, but I think they have overlooked to a large extent the role that free school meals could play in an anti-poverty programme. They could be a very effective measure in helping to tackle child poverty. Extending free school meals is supported by the End Child Poverty alliance, and I am pleased about its support. In particular, it backed the case for extending the programme to those in receipt of child tax credits. That might be a start, so I would like the Government to look at that. However, the universality of the system as it operates in the pilot areas is the key to its success, and I hope the Minister agrees. I hope she will join me in pressing the Chancellor to extend the programme to other local authorities and beyond the time frame currently allowed in the pilot areas, so that all the parents in my constituency, and in others, who have so warmly welcomed the programme will know that it has a sound future.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> on securing the debate. She mentioned that she visited my constituency a while ago to look at the experience in Hull after a far-sighted Labour council decided to have free school meals in its primary schools and special schools for three years, to be evaluated by Professor Colquhoun of Hull university. Unfortunately, as my hon. Friend mentioned, the pilot was cut short because of the short-sightedness of the Liberal Democrat council that came in and abandoned the project. It is unfortunate that we do not have that evidence to look at, but I will talk a little about the pilots we do have now, and hopefully we can draw evidence from their experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/2">I, too, visited Sweden last month and spoke to school students about school meals. I concur with my hon. Friend's comments about school meals there&mdash;all children take them and the meal is a very natural part of the school day.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/3">One of the most important lessons we can teach our young people is how to look after themselves and maintain a healthy lifestyle. A large part of that depends on eating a healthy diet, and the consequences of not having a healthy diet are evident. We know that an unbalanced diet directly affects not only children's school work, but their behaviour in the classroom and at home. Currently, 1.5 million children in the UK are overweight or obese, which means they are in danger of developing serious medical conditions later in life, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. We must ensure that our young people know the value of eating healthy food and choose to eat a sensible and balanced diet. My Department is taking steps to ensure that healthy school lunches are a cornerstone of our education system.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/4">Generally, the Labour Government have recognised the importance of improving school food. That is why we have backed significant investment&mdash;&pound;650 million between 2005 and 2011&mdash;to help support the cost of healthy school lunches, to help build or refurbish kitchens and dining facilities for the excellent catering staff around the country and to better support the development of training centres for the school food work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/5">We recently introduced tougher nutritional standards for school food, which will ensure that all primary, secondary and special school pupils have access to a balanced meal, including lots of vegetables, salad and fruit. It is also worth mentioning that my Department, working with the Department of Health, has schemes to ensure that at key stage 1 we have fresh fruit in our primary schools, and many schools also operate breakfast clubs to help give children access to good, healthy food throughout the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/6">With regard to the free school meals pilots, as my hon. Friend will know, this September my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families launched our two-year free school meals pilots in Durham, Wolverhampton and Newham. Those pilots, backed up by &pound;20 million of funding from my Department and the Department of Health, offer free, nutritionally balanced meals to all primary students in Durham and Newham. In Wolverhampton we are testing extending the eligibility rules for pupils whose parents receive working tax credits and have an annual income of up to &pound;16,040. I recognise what my hon. Friend says about the tax credit system, and I hope that the experience in Wolverhampton will let us make a decision at the end of the pilot to see whether there has been an effect on take-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/7">When I visited the launch of the pilot in Newham with the Secretary of State in early September, it was clear what an impact the meals were already having on the children and their parents. Just yesterday, I was in Wolverhampton to see for myself a pilot scheme in a secondary school, and take-up there was increasing.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/8">In both Newham and Wolverhampton, there are positive attitudes to the pilots and a keen interest in them. That interest is shared by many local authorities who applied to take part in the pilot projects, and it is important to note that local authorities already have the power to innovate and introduce free school meals in their area, if they so wish. I understand that under pressure from a Labour budget motion, Islington council is about to do that. I am extremely pleased that my hon. Friend's constituency of City of Durham is taking part, and I ask her to pass on my congratulations to everyone who has been involved in ensuring that the pilot started on time.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.0/1">Would my hon. Friend find it helpful to visit my constituency, in particular some of the schools that have 100 per cent. take-up, to see how effective free school meals are locally?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.234.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" speakername="Diana Johnson" colnum="234"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0009.htm#09102040000155">
	<p pid="a.234.1/1">I am delighted to receive that invitation. Actually, I was about to say that having visited Newham and Wolverhampton, I would be pleased to go and see for myself some of the primary schools in Durham and talk to the teachers and pupils to find out what they think about the meals.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/2">We started the pilots because we wanted a robust and independent evaluation of the benefits to children of eating free school meals. We wanted to see whether having a free healthy meal would reduce childhood obesity and change eating habits at home, and whether school standards would rise. That information will lead us to a decision about the value for money in extending the project. The design of the pilots focuses on encouraging healthy eating habits in children from a young age&mdash;in primary school&mdash;and throughout their time at school, so that they are not tempted to eat junk food by the time they reach secondary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/3">I want to speak generally about the uptake of free school meals. As my hon. Friend knows, the key is that children and parents are fully behind the meals, and that the school is actively promoting healthy food and the benefits of a school lunch. There is clear evidence that although most children who are eligible for free school meals take school lunch, there are still too many who do not. Figures from the January 2009 annual schools census show that 16 per cent. of nursery and primary school pupils are known to be eligible for the meals but only 13.6 per cent. take them up, and 13.4 per cent. of secondary school pupils are known to be eligible but only 10.3 per cent. take them up. It is vital that schools work with their local authorities and the School Food Trust to ensure that those who are eligible for free school meals know that they are.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.235.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="235"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0009.htm#09102040000156">
	<p pid="a.235.0/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that one of the reasons why children do not take up free school meals is that they feel there is a stigma attached to them? Unfortunately, too many schools still single out in some way those who are having free school meals as different from the others. What is so important about the pilots is that free school meals are universal&mdash;everybody has them&mdash;and that is why we have seen such an extraordinary rise in the take-up figures.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.235.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" speakername="Diana Johnson" colnum="235"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0009.htm#09102040000157">
	<p pid="a.235.1/1">That was clear from my experience in my constituency of Kingston upon Hull, North. When there were free school meals in primary schools, that was exactly what parents and teachers were saying to me. The stigma attached to them in the past had gone, and that will be an important part of our evaluation of the success of the pilots in Durham and Newham.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/2">In the pilots, we obviously focused on areas of the country with deprivation and low incomes, because we felt that those areas were most likely to benefit from the extension of free school meals. As my hon. Friend said, they are a great way of putting money back into the pockets of the hardest hit in the current recession and of improving children's health and fitness. However, we recognise that not all children in the pilots will be from low-income families. We want to improve the health and educational benefits for all children, not just those from a low-income background. Not all children who can afford school meals eat them, so it is right that the pilots test to see whether offering free school meals helps children across a spectrum of families.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/3">On the early evidence about the uptake of meals, as my hon. Friend said, the pilots have been in operation only since September, but already positive feedback is being received in local areas. As she explained, average school lunch take-up is estimated to be about 80 per cent. in Durham, and I understand that around 10 schools are achieving take-up of 100 per cent., compared with around 49 per cent. before the pilot started.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/4">Opposition Members raised objections at the start of the pilots that many of the areas would not be ready for them because of the lack of kitchens. It is clear to me, from my hon. Friend's experience in Durham and from the statistics, that those objections were unjustified.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.0/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that my local authority did an amazing job in getting a partnership together to put money into school kitchens? It was far-sighted of the authority to involve the primary care trust, the schools themselves and the diocese, because they all have an interest in children's health.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.1/1">That is absolutely right, and I pay tribute to the local authority, the diocese and the PCT. They are all key players in ensuring that we can deliver healthy school meals for our pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/2">There are excellent signs that children and families think that the meals are worth having. My hon. Friend should take credit for that, as she fought hard to get a free school meals pilot. I am pleased indeed that one of them is in Durham. As I said earlier, I am very much looking forward to visiting Durham, hopefully later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/3">I shall turn to the issues my hon. Friend outlined on the next steps for the pilots. I would like to be clear at this stage that we are not making any decisions about future roll-out. We shall test each pilot throughout its two-year process and a full evaluation will be carried out by the National Centre for Social Research. The evaluation will determine whether the additional benefits resulting from the pilot offer value for money in terms of costs to schools, and it will also determine whether the current eligibility rules are right.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/4">In closing, I again congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. I believe that we can all agree that the health of our students is of the utmost importance. I am glad that we are taking steps towards a healthier lifestyle for all our pupils and students&mdash;steps that are already getting a positive reaction. It is important to monitor the pilots closely and to ensure that a full evaluation is made at the end of the two years. We need to keep good food for our children and young people high up on the agenda.</p>

	Electoral Register
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.237.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" speakername="Simon Burns" colnum="237"  time="013:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0010.htm#09102040000162">
	<p pid="a.237.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the crucial issue of ensuring that the electoral register, which is one of the engines that drives our democracy, is accurate and honest and works in the way in which it was designed to work. There is a problem in the country with regard to the integrity of parts of the electoral register, partly caused through ill-information and by deliberate abuse of the system. I accept that this is a tricky and difficult subject that has to be treated with sensitivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/2">During the 2005 general election, one afternoon as I was canvassing in Waveney drive in my constituency in Chelmsford, a lady aged about 55 opened her door and told me that she would not be able to vote for me, even if she wanted to&mdash;although she did not express whether she wanted to&mdash;because she could not vote in a British general election. It came as a surprise to me. When I asked her about that, she said that, notwithstanding the fact that she had lived in Chelmsford for 25 years and had been married for 25 years to a Chelmsford man, she was a Swedish citizen, so she was not legally entitled to vote in a British general election, because she did not have British citizenship. I accept that that is right, because if she is not a British citizen she does not fit into the rules and she will not be able to vote in a British general election. However, I am concerned that there are numbers of people in Chelmsford&mdash;it is not restricted simply to Chelmsford; I suspect that in certain parts of the country it is far more extensive&mdash;are putting themselves on to the electoral register who have no right to do so, because they are asylum seekers or economic migrants whose status in this country has not been determined. Even though they may have come from a Commonwealth country, they are not entitled to go on to the electoral register.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/3">The rules for those people qualifying to go on the electoral register say:</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Commonwealth citizens who are resident in the UK qualify to be registered if they do not require leave to remain in the UK, or if they do require leave and this has been granted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/5">Unfortunately, there are individuals who have come to this country seeking indefinite leave to remain who have not yet had that leave granted or may have been refused it and are appealing against the procedure. They may even have a deportation order issued against them, against which they are appealing. Such people may have placed themselves on the electoral register and I have no doubt that in some cases they have exercised their right to vote. I know of one definite case in my constituency a few years ago, in which someone with a deportation order was not only on the electoral register but voted in the last election. This is wrong, because these individuals are not entitled to vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/6">People who play by the rules&mdash;that is, my constituent who is a Swedish national&mdash;do not vote in a general election. This matter should be looked into and sorted out, so that people who should not be on the register are removed and denied the right to vote until their status in this country has been regularised so that they comply with the law. I suspect that individuals sometimes put themselves on the register through ignorance. This is the first issue that I would like to raise with the Minister. On the forms going through letterboxes in recent weeks, throughout Chelmsford and the rest of the country, people are invited to renew their registration on the electoral register. The form asks people for their surname, first name and nationality, with the text in brackets stating that this should be</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/7" class="indent">&quot;as shown on your passport if you have one&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/8">which suggests that if they do not have one they do not have to complete that part. I also suspect that, if they do have a passport and forget to complete that part of the form, it will make no difference to their registration. The notes on the reverse of that form say:</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Who should be included on the form? Include the following people: All residents from Great Britain and qualifying citizens of the Commonwealth, the Republic of Ireland and the European Union...who will be living at your address on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-15">15 October 2009</phrase>.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/10">That is fine. However, it does not say that qualifying citizens of the Commonwealth should put their names on the register or renew their entry only if their status to remain and live in this country has been regularised and approved by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/11">There is a similar situation in respect of the registration forms that people use to register in the first place. The form mentions Commonwealth citizens and lists the relevant Commonwealth countries in great detail, but nowhere does it say, &quot;but only if your residency in the United Kingdom is regularised within the immigration law.&quot; Anyone who is not that familiar with our system will see that they come from a Commonwealth country&mdash;the form says that people &quot;may register&quot; if they come from a Commonwealth country&mdash;and will register, even if, at that moment in time, they have no legal status to live in this country or are fighting hard to get a decision on their remaining here reversed. More guidance should be provided on both those forms, so that people cannot use ignorance as an excuse or claim that they misunderstood the notes accompanying the forms and, in that way, not comply with the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/12">If someone puts themselves on the register and they should not be there, it is remarkably difficult to get them off. There are a number of ways in which such a person can be discovered: just by talking with neighbours, and so on, for example, although it would be incredibly embarrassing for a neighbour or someone who knows the person to report them. Members of Parliament can find out relatively easily whether someone should legally be on the electoral register, but it is rather tricky to do so, because of the mechanisms by which one identifies individuals and the procedures that have to be adopted to determine whether they should be, or remain, on the register.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/13">The electoral officer can look into the matter, as hon. Members will know. Chelmsford is no exception in having an excellent electoral registration officer, whose team works hard. Those officers will be less than likely to know if someone has registered themselves but is not entitled to do so. I suspect that in most parts of the country, few electoral registration officers find many cases where someone has put themselves wrongly on the electoral register. They do not have the time to find out: it is a rather complicated issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/14">If an individual finds out about someone who should not be on the register, they have to go through a set procedure to notify the electoral registration officer. They must make an objection to someone's being on the register in writing. The letter has to be signed and dated by the elector making the complaint and has to include the name, address and electoral number of the objector, as well as the qualifying address, and everything, of the person they are complaining about. That letter is, of course, in the public domain, which does not encourage people to draw to the attention of the authorities a situation where an error, deliberate or not deliberate, has been caused. That is a failing.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/15">If an individual in Chelmsford, Swindon or wherever were to complain that their neighbour's hedge was going on to the public footpath too much and needed cutting back and trimming, the local authority would write to the owner of the property where the hedge was causing the problem and ask them to take that course of action. If the homeowner then telephoned to ask who had made the complaint, the complainant would be guaranteed anonymity and the local authority would not disclose the complainant's name.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/16">The Government have a social security benefit fraud hotline, and openly advertise the fact that confidentiality is guaranteed. If an individual suspects that someone is defrauding the benefits system, all they have to do is ring the hotline, provide the information and the grounds on which they believe that someone is defrauding the system, and it will be investigated with anonymity guaranteed. In electoral fraud, which may often be deliberate, why is anonymity not guaranteed? I suggest that it should be guaranteed for a complainant, because that might help to achieve an electoral register that is more accurate, fair and honest.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/17">If someone goes through those hoops, what is the procedure for trying to remove someone from the electoral register if they should not legally be on it? The electoral registration officer must determine whether that person is on it illegally, and if their status in this country is involved, the UK Border Agency should be contacted. A few years ago, a local authority asked the Home Office, which then had responsibility for such matters, to check on someone who was on the electoral register and voting in elections when they should not have been because they were fighting a deportation order. The local authority wrote to the Home Office, but after six months it had not even received an acknowledgement of its request for information. It then stopped pursuing the matter, because October came along and the individual concerned did not re-register. If that is UKBA's record in responding to an electoral registration officer's request for information on an individual, it is pitiful.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/18">Secondly, if the electoral registration officer receives such information, they must inform the person who allegedly should not be on the register, who may call for a hearing to argue that they should remain on it, even if the electoral registration officer has a piece of paper from the UK Border Agency stating that, for example, they have been refused indefinite leave to remain and should not be in this country because they are an economic migrant, or whatever the reason. Imagine the legal fandango if people who were the subject of complaints called for a hearing and lawyers became involved. It would spin out the whole process, which would become immensely costly, and I suspect that it would be months, if not years, in cases in which the lawyers were determined to string things out, before a decision was made.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/19">Something must be done to improve procedures. Natural justice should not be denied, but if a decision on whether someone should remain on an electoral register boils down to someone's immigration status, that must be fairly clear when the UK Border Agency informs the electoral registration officer of their current status, and I do not understand why it is necessary to go through that costly and time-consuming effort for a matter that is relatively simple. Does the Minister have any ideas for improving and tightening the system without denying people natural justice? I have a proposal to put to him. I think that I am right in saying that until changes were made, if a complaint was made against an individual on the electoral register and it was not obviously a vexatious complaint, that person was automatically removed from the register until they could prove that they should be on it. I am not a lawyer, but that seems a sensible way to proceed. If someone should be on the register and wants to be on it, it is not difficult to prove their legal status in this country, and that would speed things up.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/20">The final thing I should like to raise is a little more complex and grey. What happens to Commonwealth citizens of states that have been suspended from the Commonwealth? Are they allowed to be on the electoral register? Under immigration rules, a Zimbabwean may not be allowed indefinite leave to remain in the UK, but they may not returned to Zimbabwe for very good and correct reasons, given the situation in that country. However, the Government's responsible attitude to that appalling situation should not mean that Zimbabweans may vote in a general election in this country. I suspect that the Minister will say that if a country is suspended, and its citizens, who would not normally be allowed to remain in the UK, may stay here because of the situation in that country. He will say that until it improves and it is safe for them to return, they will be allowed to appear on the electoral register. That is illogical, and I hope that he will reconsider the issue. I am sure that the Minister agrees that it is crucial that the system is not abused, and that measures should be taken to tighten the system and to minimise the opportunity for abuse. I hope that my modest suggestions are both logical and acceptable, and I look forward to his response.</p>

	<p pid="a.240.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" name="Simon Burns">the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase> on securing this debate. That is the usual courtesy, but I mean it because the subject is enormously important, and it is to his credit that he has gone into it in such detail and so thoroughly. I hope that I can provide some reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/2">The hon. Gentleman and I agree, as does every sensible person in this country, that the integrity of the electoral register is fundamental to our democracy. Everyone in this country must have faith in the processes, so the register must be comprehensive and accurate; otherwise its integrity is flawed. The Government have made huge efforts to ensure both. We have introduced measures for individual registration, which place those two requirements&mdash;comprehensiveness and accuracy&mdash;at the forefront of the electoral registration system.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/3">It is worth noting in passing that the Electoral Commission estimates that 3 million to 3.5 million people who are eligible to vote cannot do so because they are not on the register. That is a huge problem, and a flaw in our democracy. We must do more to tackle it. We have taken measures, and we intend to ramp them up in the months and years ahead. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that that is fundamentally important. With every measure involving the register it is important to ensure that everyone who is properly eligible to vote should be able to do so. Equally, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the register is flawed if people on it are not entitled to be on it. He raised a number of issues that I want to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/4">I assure the hon. Gentleman that the matter is extremely serious. We have introduced a range of measures to protect the integrity of the postal vote, and the introduction of a system of individual registration will make fraud more difficult. It is also worth pointing out that recent studies by the Electoral Commission and the Association of Chief Police Officers suggest that the incidence of fraud is declining. It is mutating, but it is declining. I do not want to sound complacent for one moment. Even a single incidence of fraud is one too many, and even being on the register inadvertently, without out-and-out fraud, but perhaps because of a mistake in the process, is unacceptable for all the reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave. We accept that. Therefore we are never complacent and are always looking for new ways in which to improve the system. That is why I am so grateful to the hon. Gentleman for initiating the debate: we will be able to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/5">Before dealing with specific points, I shall make some general observations about the process. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that under the Representation of the People Act 1983, there is a duty on electoral registration officers to maintain the register. That means that they must be responsible for its integrity. They must ensure that everyone who should be on it is on it, but also that people who are not entitled to be on it are not on it. The vast majority of electoral registration officers are extremely diligent in discharging that duty. We have given electoral registration officers increasing powers to ensure that they can do the job properly. It is not just a question of the will; it is also the means to discharge it. In 2006 we placed a statutory duty on electoral registration officers to take all necessary steps, which include sending the annual canvass form more than once, making house-to-house visits and inspecting records.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/6">The hon. Gentleman is particularly concerned with a specific area, and I will come to that. He has raised the question of illegal immigrants&mdash;people who are here illegally&mdash;people who are facing deportation and people whose cases may not have been decided yet. None of them is entitled to be on the register. There is no doubt about that. If they are on the register, that is wrong. It may be a case of fraud or inadvertent error, but they are not entitled to be on the register and there should be no doubt whatever about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/7">If such people are on the register, they are committing an offence, almost certainly. We have given electoral registration officers guidance&mdash;they are regularly issued with guidance&mdash;on how to identify fraud. They have the power to investigate any registration at any time, and they have the power to remove individuals from the register and report them to the police if they suspect them of supplying false information, which, as the hon. Gentleman will know, is an offence. As we move over the next four or five years to a system of full compulsory individual voter registration, that existing programme of work will be further enhanced and electoral registration officers will have a further range of mechanisms at their disposal.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.0/1">The trouble is, though, that electoral registration officers in most areas will not know that someone is on the register who should not be unless someone tells them. There is a problem with that. For example, Members of Parliament are probably one of the groups of people who will be most likely to know, because of their dealings with those individuals and the UK Border Agency. However, given that people have to write to the registration officer to make the complaint, which Member of Parliament is going to do that, given that it might then get into the public domain that if someone goes to see an MP on an immigration case, the electoral registration officer might get in touch with them because they have wrongly put themselves on the register?</p>

	<p pid="a.242.1/1">I was coming to the hon. Gentleman's point about the ability to report possible abuses anonymously. I see some merit in that; it is a perfectly reasonable point of view. I can say straight away to him that we will look into it, but in doing so we must be careful to strike a balance. We must be careful to protect against malicious, vexatious complaints. They could be made because of neighbour disputes; they could be made for all sorts of malign reasons. I do not think at all that the idea is without merit. I want to look into it and I want to say some other things in a moment that will give comfort to the hon. Gentleman in this context.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.242.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" speakername="Simon Burns" colnum="242"  time="013:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0010.htm#09102040000166">
	<p pid="a.242.2/1">I understand the point about balance, but that principle does not guide the Government's own social security benefit fraud hotline.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-10-20a.242.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" speakername="Michael Wills" colnum="242"  time="013:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091020/halltext/91020h0010.htm#09102040000167">
	<p pid="a.242.3/1">I was coming to that. I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that these are categorically different issues. Both relate to fraud and are extremely serious, and of course, there could be malign intent and vexatious issues in relation to social security as well. However, I hope he will accept that there is something else at play regarding the electoral register, which is politics. This is a difficult issue and we must be careful that we do not open up our electoral system to being the plaything of party politics. That is all I shall say to him on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.3/2">This is not an open-and-shut case. As I said at the beginning, we must be vigilant all the time. We must never be complacent, and I give the hon. Gentleman my assurance that we will consider the matter that he has raised. I will come back to him on that and some of the other issues that he raised. I still have a few more minutes to address them, but just in case I run out of time, let me say straight away that we will take up all those issues with his local electoral registration officer. We want to get to their experience of what has been going on in Chelmsford. As a result of that, we shall come to a view about what needs to change, if anything. If he would like me to do so, I will then meet him to go through what we have found and the reasons why we have come to the decisions. That will be the start of a dialogue if he so wishes. It will not be just me telling him what we think. I will still be open to further representations from him privately. Perhaps it will not be in Westminster Hall, but I am very anxious to pursue that issue and every other concern. I suspect that other MPs have similar concerns, and I hope that they will all come to me as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.3/3">The hon. Gentleman referred to a local authority&mdash;he did not name it&mdash;not getting a response from a Government Department. That is unacceptable in all circumstances; there is no defence for it whatever. It sounds as though it is a historical case and it may not be worth pursuing. If the authority wants to come to me, I will take the matter up. Generally, it is worth sending a message to all local authorities that they should expect to get replies from Departments, as every citizen should, but if they do not get them&mdash;sometimes Departments are not as deft at dealing with their correspondence as they should be&mdash;they do have local Members of Parliament, who should be able to get such responses and whom they can approach, so I would urge all of them to do just that. The situation is unacceptable and should not have arisen.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.3/4">It is worth saying a little more about the powers that electoral registration officers have, because they are considerable and the hon. Gentleman, in his understandable concern about the issue, may have not quite registered just what powers are available to them. It is an offence to give false information to an electoral registration officer, and the penalty is six months in prison. It is not a slap on the wrist; it is a serious punishment for something the Government take very seriously. Officers can investigate any registration at any time. The Electoral Commission's guidance to electoral registration officers makes it clear that if they have any doubts about the eligibility of any applicant, they have the power to require any person to provide information relating to the eligibility of that applicant: age, nationality, residence and whether or not they are disqualified in any way. If the officer has any doubts about that, they can also require the person to provide evidence demonstrating that they meet the requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.3/5">Regulation 24 of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 provides that if the electoral registration officer is not satisfied about an applicant's nationality, they have the power to require the applicant or the elector to provide specified documentary evidence confirming it. As we move to a system of individual registration, clearly much of that information will have to be provided anyway, which is why it is such an important guarantor against fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.3/6">I shall touch briefly on the question of the Swedish citizen who could not vote. I know that the hon. Gentleman was not raising that particularly, but it is worth saying that we keep these things under constant review. Parliament has regularly expressed views on which foreign nationals should be eligible to vote. It is always worth reminding constituents&mdash;we all have constituents in the situation of that Swedish citizen&mdash;that in the circumstances described, they would almost certainly be eligible for dual nationality, depending on the regulations in their country of origin. That would enable them to vote in this country. I would have thought that if they wish to take a stake in this country by voting in it, the acquisition of nationality would be appropriate in those circumstances. It is always worth responding to people such as that, because it is a frequent cause of complaint that I have; I see frequently as a Minister that people who have contributed a lot and pay taxes in this country wonder why they cannot vote in general elections. There are avenues open to them to vote, should they choose to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.3/7">I hope I have given the hon. Gentleman enough comfort so far. This is not the end of the story. He has raised serious concerns and we will pursue them with the electoral registration officer in Chelmsford. I will come back to the hon. Gentleman on this issue as soon as possible&mdash;I am talking about weeks, not months&mdash;so he will get a reply from me and then, if he so wishes, I will be happy to meet him and discuss any remaining concerns that he has.</p>
