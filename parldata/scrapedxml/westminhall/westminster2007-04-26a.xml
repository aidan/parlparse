<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-26a.345.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" speakername="Gwyneth Dunwoody" colnum="345"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070426/halltext/70426h0001.htm#07042644000217">
	<p pid="a.345.2/1">It is always a delight to see you in the Chair, Mr. Jones, particularly when we are discussing a subject such as this, which is of such great concern to everyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/2">It is extraordinary that the House of Commons sometimes seems to be remarkably ambivalent, even about its own programmes. For example, I think we all agree that in the interests of the environment it would be sensible if more people travelled by train, and that we should modernise the system, some of which is120 years old. Yet when it comes to the means by which we encourage people to take the train&mdash;the prices that we charge for that service&mdash;we get ourselves into an interesting and esoteric argument, which is, frankly, not entirely supportable, about taxpayers already paying so much for the railway system that we must ensure that the fare box is responsible for the cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/3">In theory, that is right, but the reality is that people will not travel by train in large numbers if fares consistently rise beyond the rate of inflation or the sum that they believe is acceptable, not least because at a certain point they begin to think that almost any other way of getting to work is cheaper than using the railway system.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/4">The Select Committee decided that it should investigate train fares. We wanted to know how fair the fare system is, and whether it is acceptable that the price of train travel per mile varies enormously in this country, depending on route and train operator, whereas in many similar countries, not just in Europe, estimates are made on a totally different basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/5">The travelling public are not entirely convinced by the argument that cheaper rail fares are available. It is true that in theory computer whiz kids with a lot of time available who are prepared to spend it surfing the websites of various companies may be able to find a fare that is cheaper than those that British Rail charged&mdash;not cheaper than all its fares, but cheaper than some. However, there is clear evidence that, unlike other sections of the transport industry, the railways are not too anxious that their websites clearly and simply enable people not only to know where the cheap fares are, but how to book them. The railway companies assure me that they will do something energetic about that, and that the fact that they have not done so so far is not to be taken as an estimate of the way in which they regard their customers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-26a.349.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" speakername="Gwyneth Dunwoody" colnum="349"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070426/halltext/70426h0001.htm#07042644000223">
	<p pid="a.349.0/1">At a certain point, commuters will become so irritated by the provision of insufficient accommodation&mdash;travelling on crowded trains, in unacceptable discomfort&mdash;and by having to pay enormous amounts of money that we will see the equivalent of the national fares strike that is suggested every time fares increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/2">The Government must take action to ensure that there is a simple framework of three ticket types. The situation really is unacceptable. Under British Rail, people had a clear idea about the type and class of ticket that was available; under the current regime, they have no idea. The so-called flexibility increases neither capacity, comfort nor even utility. All it does is increase the amount of money that is paid to various large banks, which do not seem to be doing too badly anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/3">We asked the Government to look closely at regulatory complexity and weakness. The rail fares system is complex, and complaints about unregulated fares are difficult to deal with when the Office of the Rail Regulator and the Office of Fair Trading share powers to make judgments and enforce decisions. The framework does not work, and it is time that somebody analysed the system, simplified and improved it and made it possible for people to complain easily and effectively. The Government should be prepared to look again at the system's structure, but we have not received any explanation or indication that they believe that the complexity of the system makes complaining difficult for passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/4">Although the Government did not accept our recommendations, they must know that the Committee feels that it is an important subject. It is clear that more and more people are using the railways, and that is in everyone's interest as long as they arrive safely, comfortably and for a reasonable fare. It is exactly the way in which people ought to be encouraged to travel throughout the United Kingdom. A burgeoning economy, which ours has been over the past 10 years, inevitably means that more people want to travel, and it certainly means that more people will want to go by rail. The need for extra capacity therefore ought to be of comfort to the Government, and they ought to be able to say plainly and as a matter of policy, &quot;We are looking at the relationship between the cost of rail fares and the environmental and commercial benefits of carrying people easily.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/5">I can provide the Chamber with a simple example. I shall be travelling to west Wales to support in the Assembly elections a candidate who is also called Dunwoody. After a great deal of work, and with the assistance of some very talented people in the House, it has become clear that travelling from Crewe to west Wales is cheaper by chauffeur-driven car than by public transport. I do not think that I am alone in thinking that that is probably not a very sensible way of behaving.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/6">Although I fully understand the difficulties that the railway systems face, the Government will have to take some tough policy decisions and look clearly at what we pay for our railway journeys. They are going to have to grasp the nettle. It is really no longer acceptable for them to say to the House of Commons, &quot;Well, the money comes either from the fare box or from the taxpayer, and we therefore can't do anything about it&mdash;the fare box is going to be allowed to rise.&quot; The reality, however, is that the whole system is supported by the taxpayer. It does not matter which way we look at the issue, taxpayers pay, because they need a good railway system that can carry large numbers of people who could not be carried efficiently and safely in any other way. Taxpayers pay because they understand the relationship between railways and the economy, if nothing else.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/7">At some point, the Government will have to come clean and say, &quot;This is an extraordinarily difficult situation&quot;. However, we cannot continue with the outlook that says that more and more train operating companies will be operating on the basis of management contracts, for which they are handsomely paid, while taking no responsibility for the track, the rolling stock, the stations or anything else, and the individual passenger is going to be told, &quot;You must pay an economic price&quot;. By all means, let us have an economic railway, if that is what the people of Britain want, but let us ensure that the cost is equally divided.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-26a.351.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="351"  time="014:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070426/halltext/70426h0002.htm#07042644000225">
	<p pid="a.351.0/1">I am delighted to say a few words. I had no intention of doing so until I came into the Chamber, but given that there are not a great number of Back-Bench Members present, I thought that I might as well add my three pennyworth. I apologise to the Minister for missing his discussions on First Great Western earlier this week, but no doubt I will hear in due course about some of the problems in the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/2">The report is useful and I want to make a few points, one of which I have already raised in my intervention on the Chairman of the Committee. I am genuinely confused&mdash;perhaps the Minister would clarify matters for me&mdash;about what are peak times, as they cause all manner of problems and change the nature of people's travelling times. With price discrimination, I accept that there is a reason to take more from those who travel when the trains are at their busiest&mdash;clearly that is during the commuter times&mdash;but there are now some bizarre applications of that. The obverse is that if an operator can take more at certain times, there must be a reason for providing cheaper saver tickets; otherwise, there would just be a standard ticket price and when people travelled would be irrelevant.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/3">My second point is important and has been touched on, but I will put it bluntly. Travelling by train must not be seen as a rich person's form of transport. Sadly, however, that is somewhat the case now. I am not saying that rail transport has ever been able to compare favourably with the car on a purely price-based comparison, even in the good old days of British Rail, which some of us still look back on fondly. The reality is that if the full costs of the car are taken into account, including environmental costs, the train must come into its own.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/4">However, it can be forgotten that, because of the pricing structure, a family travelling by train does not pay once, but as many times as there are members of the family travelling, which can be prohibitive. For young families who might not have a car or who might be being very thoughtful in taking the train, some of the costs can mean that travelling by train is still prohibitive, even with the cheaper fares, discounts and special arrangements. That can be a reason why people do not travel at all or why they use the coach. We must not see the issue as the train versus the car. One of the reasons why coach travel is so attractive in this country is that it is by far the cheapest form of transport. However, coaches do not get vehicles off our roads. That is something that we need to take account of.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/5">My third point is to do with something that affects both the lines in my area&mdash;the Cheltenham-Paddington line and the Bristol-Gloucester line&mdash;and which is long overdue: the installation of automatic ticket machines. At one level, that is to be greatly welcomed. I get really fed up when I know that there are certain points in a journey between which people can travel and never pay a cent. If they sit in the right part of a long train, the chances of the guard&mdash;or ticket inspector, manager or whatever we call them now&mdash;finding them out are quite small. Even when the guard does find them, the experience can sometimes be quite unpleasant, because they never seem to have any money and things can get difficult. Again, that puts a lot of stress on the staff. It is galling when people regularly travel for free, because the burden is paid by those who pay. It is good that we have a system under which people can pay before they get on the train, even if they board from&mdash;this phrase is not politically correct&mdash;an unmanned station.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-26a.353.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="353"  time="015:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070426/halltext/70426h0002.htm#07042644000228">
	<p pid="a.353.0/1">I congratulate the Chair of the Transport Committee on her excellent report and apologise for having missed the start of her speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/2">As I said, the report is excellent. It puts on the line some of the dissatisfactions of rail users in recent years about the cost and complexity of rail travel. We all now accept that UK train travel is the most expensive in Europe. The system is complex and bureaucratic and it is not obvious to anyone why certain prices are charged. We have to set that in the context of the rail White Paper that will be released next year, the continued growth of the railways, how we will deal with prices, the availability of seats, public subsidies and the distinction between regulated and unregulated rail fares.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/3">The report makes public dissatisfaction clear: value for money is the biggest single issue for regular rail users at present. The hon. Lady cited her example of travelling down from Crewe; my example comes from travelling regularly from Manchester. If it is cheaper for me to fly than to take a first-class train journey or go further down the list of fare options, we have not got things right.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/4">I accept that 43 per cent. of all rail income comes from subsidies and that 57 per cent. comes from fares. In the long term, we shall not be able to increase the amount of money from the public purse to pay for all we want on our railways. The first point made by the report is about the strategic importance of the railways in underpinning much of what we as a Parliament, and the Government, want to achieve for economic development, social cohesion and inclusivity. The Government response does not address the broader context. The Climate Change Bill is coming through Parliament and there is an ongoing debate about congestion charging. We should be considering those broad policy objectives. We know that cars are far and away the largest producers of carbon dioxide emissions. What needs to happen to enable people to move freely on our railways? There has to be a price&mdash;not necessarily one paid by subsidies&mdash;put on the value of being able to encourage more people to travel on the railways at a much better cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/5">The Committee's report is clear and correct to say that we need a simplified, unified fare structure that is understandable to all. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1651" name="Lee Scott">the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott)</phrase> said, one can ring up and get three different prices for the same journey&mdash;that really shows what a nonsense the present fare structure is. The Government talk about discussions taking place with rail operating companies, but as a start, the first thing that has to happen is an agreed fare price structure. They apply to other forms of transport&mdash;aeroplanes and so on. There are agreed classes of travel. If we travel business class or standard class or whatever, we know what we are getting. However, when we buy a rail ticket, it is not clear what we will get. The structure needs to be simplified.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-26a.356.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" speakername="Stephen Hammond" colnum="356"  time="015:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070426/halltext/70426h0002.htm#07042644000233">
	<p pid="a.356.1/1">I was not attacking the Government for the length of the delay, but citing it in the context of the actions that they said they would take in their response.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/2">I was about to quote the most recent research from Passenger Focus, which found that seven out of10 leisure passengers decided not to travel because of the cost of the ticket, with 44 per cent. using the car instead. It also found that three out of five commuter and business passengers disagreed with the contention that tickets were generally fairly priced&mdash;I suppose that one could say that people will always disagree with that contention, but it is worth pointing out that finding in the interests of fairness. The research also found that four out of five leisure travellers and seven out of10 business travellers agreed that they would travel more on trains if the fare were a bit cheaper. The Passenger Focus report commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the public perception is that buying a ticket can be a minefield of confusion. That's why Passenger Focus is working with the Association of Train Operating Companies to find ways of simplifying the way fares are presented.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/4">The point is simple. The TOCs and the Government can say for as long as they like that the fare structure is simple and that good value can be found on the network, but if that is not the passengers' perception, people simply will not travel by train. The Committee's report dealt excellently with that point, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The persistently poor levels of passenger satisfaction with the value for money of rail travel are important. If passengers perceive rail travel to be too expensive, then in some senses it is too expensive, and it may reasonably be assumed that they will try to avoid paying the set price&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/6">That is a crucial point. Whatever we think about the fares, there is a perception that they are to high, and the modal shift will not go in the direction that we want.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/7">It is worth mentioning one important point about fares and pricing that the report did not look at. There is now a move to smartcards and new ticketing technology across the networks, and anyone who travels on the London network will know that increases in cash fares have encouraged people to switch to Oyster cards. That is hitting some of the those on the lowest incomes hardest, although I accept that London is a devolved matter and that we are concentrating on train fares. None the less, the single minimum cash fare on the London underground is &pound;4, but it is &pound;1.50 if one uses an Oyster card. There is clear evidence from a recent Greater London authority report that the take-up of Oyster cards among the lowest-income groups is lower than it is among higher-income groups. One needs to be mindful of that, particularly as we move to introduce ITSO's technology across the network. If we do that, I hope that we will do so in a way that does not penalise those who most need access to affordable public transport, and I would be interested to hear what the manager has to say about that&mdash;sorry, the Minister. He is the manager of the railways; I get confused.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/8">I want to talk about ways of finding the cheapest fare. In autumn 2006, the Passenger Focus group carried out the mystery shopping exercise that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1651" name="Lee Scott">the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott)</phrase> tried, and I have a sample of the results. During the off-peak period, almost 48 per cent. of passengers at the largest stations have to queue longer than the industry guideline of three minutes. During peak hours, 11 per cent. queue longer than the industry guideline of five minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/9">Passenger Focus also did a shopping exercise to test what sort of information can be obtained by telephone. Of the companies that it tested in autumn 2006, only GNER telesales was able to provide information to every caller; 40 per cent. of the callers to GNER, 32 per cent. of those to South West Trains, 28 per cent. of callers to Virgin Trains and 22 per cent. of callers to First Great Western waited more than 10 minutes to speak to an operator. As the group rightly commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/10" class="indent">&quot;What a strange way to treat potential customers. People keen to pay up and use the railways are either being left standing in queues or are locked into listening to endless 'muzak'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/11">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> has pointed out, at some stations there are no ticketing facilities, and some passengers have to pay fares on board. Research shows that in a number of cases, because of overcrowding, revenue cannot be collected. I believe that the technical term these days for the personnel involved is not train manager or ticket inspector, but probably revenue protection officer, but none the less Passenger Focus found that on the routes that it examined 23 per cent. of its researchers were unable to buy a ticket at all. Over the weekend that figure rose to 58 per cent. That highlights the importance of the need for train operating companies to ensure that, before considering revenue increases, they collect the revenue that is already due to them. If the Government are to allow the rail companies to put through above-inflation fares, they should surely be establishing better mechanisms for collecting fares from existing customers with the TOCs within the franchise. For some people paying on the train seems to equate to free travel, and it cannot be acceptable to penalise travellers and passengers who are honest. A factor involved in the inability to collect revenue on trains is the fact that on the majority of routes trains are too overcrowded to enable rail staff to do their job properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/12">That brings me to a central point about rail fare levels and value for money. More passengers are travelling on our networks now than there were before Beeching. That is a matter of fact. However, record patronage should not be an excuse for ignoring the problems of overcrowding. The Select Committee, in the report, accused the then rail Minister, now the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" name="Derek Twigg">the hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)</phrase>, of &quot;breathtaking complacency&quot; for saying in evidence that he believed passenger satisfaction with the railways would go up. He was of course ignoring&mdash;I think that the report made this clear&mdash;the two sources of passenger dissatisfaction&mdash;overcrowding and the consequent perception of the fare's value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/13">In its most recent publication on national rail trends, the Office of the Rail Regulator said that passengers are less satisfied with the level of overcrowding as demand continues to increase. That is something of an understatement. In recent months there have been protests and boycotts, as has been mentioned, about overcrowding and above-inflation fare increases. There is no official train capacity limit nationally, and there are specific targets only for peak commuter traffic into London and the south-east. That measurement is carried out, as I understand it, only once a year. The Government have set acceptable levels, but there is no current enforcement and no penalties if limits are broken.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/14">Half the operating companies, however, are at the moment breaching the capacity limits on journeys into London during the London peak. South West Trains is now reaching a level 30 per cent. higher than what is suggested as the acceptable peak in the morning. In the afternoon, half the TOCs break the overall capacity limits, although they do so to a lesser extent than inthe morning. Network Rail estimates that 70,000 passengers travelling into London must stand during what is now classified as the three-hour morning peak. However, things are somewhat worse when one looks behind those figures. Of those 70,000 people, 50,000 travel in the peak period between 8 and 9 am. There is a clear pattern of overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/15">Overcrowding is a problem across the railways, and research carried out four or five years ago showed that six out of the 10 most overcrowded routes are in the north. Indeed, there is a risk that current levels of crowding could reverse some of the improvements that have been made as a result of investment through Network Rail. The necessity for trains to wait longer at stations may lead to journeys being rescheduled to take longer. A key point, of course, is that, with overcrowding now a serious and endemic fault of our railways, it is hardly surprising that people are dissatisfied with the value that they get from the increasing train fares. The Passenger Focus survey showed that less than half of the people involved are satisfied that they are getting value for money on their routes. Complaints about fares come second only to complaints about train service performance, and the gap between the two has closed dramatically over the past year.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/16">The railways have undergone record growth, but if there are more and more passengers on the railway, more and more capacity will be needed. Overcrowding has risen to unacceptable levels, and it is the fault of the Government that there has been a failure to meet the capacity challenge. The Government have recognised that challenge, but much of what will be put in place will not happen until 2014.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-26a.359.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" speakername="Stephen Hammond" colnum="359"  time="015:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070426/halltext/70426h0003.htm#07042644000237">
	<p pid="a.359.3/1">I am interested to hear what the hon. Lady has to say. Indeed, a great amount of rolling stock has been mothballed or has not been brought back in. If the Government were to allow the TOCs to do so, and if they had not specified that in some of their franchise processes, the stock could have been brought back in. That is the reality of life and why I cannot agree with all that is in the report. The report should recognise the role that the Government play, and not only that which they play in respect of capacity. Within their role in respect of capacity comes a role in fares, and it is hugely important that that should be accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/2">There is a view that the Government are using fares to attempt to deal with overcrowding. Last summer, <i>The Times</i> talked about the new deal that was being put forward between the Department for Transport and First Group on a number of the commuter routes north of London. At the time, <i>The Times </i>accused the Government of striking a secret deal with the biggest rail company to double fares on that route as a way of solving overcrowding. Restrictions on fares were certainly placed on people travelling between London and dozens of stations to the north of the capital. Cheap day fares were no longer valid at times when they had normally been valid. That was part of the franchise specification and is why more people were forced to buy more expensive standard returns. That was exactly the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> was making about the length of the peak period and the shortening of the off-peak periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/3">The Government's decision to award the Thameslink/Great Northern franchise to First Group, would, they said,</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/4" class="indent">&quot;deliver better services to passengers. There will be increased capacity into London during peak times, enhanced facilities for passengers on board trains and at stations &quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/5">However, the Government made no mention of the fare increase, even though First Group had made it clear to the Department at the time that the &pound;800 million that would be paid over the nine years to run the franchise, as the franchise had specified, would depend on restricting cheap tickets and increasing fares. That is the essence of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/6">The Select Committee report rightly commented that the TOCs have operated a complex fare structure, but the root cause for a number of the fare increases is the Government. At the moment, the Government seem to be saying, &quot;It's nothing to do with me, guv&quot;, when they are talking about deregulated fares, yet the franchising system that they have imposed is causing fares to rise. Part of that is to do with the length of the franchises, but in the recent tendering period it has been due to the ever-increasing desire of the Government to recoup some of the subsidies that they are paying to Network Rail through the premiums that they are imposing, which are getting the bids up. The vast sums of money that they have spent though Network Rail&mdash;we all accept that such sums have been spent&mdash;since the demise of Railtrack are being recouped through the franchises. The TOCs are ratcheting up their bids inthe knowledge that the overriding point of interest to the DFT and the Treasury is the size of the premium that they are prepared to pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/7">Christopher Garnett, the former chief executive of GNER, made the well-publicised comment that it was better to drastically overbid for a new franchise than to underbid and lose it. When those bids are accepted, as the DFT is accepting them, that extra revenue can come only from one source, which is the passenger. That is why fares have risen, why they are rising and why they will continue to rise. The TOCs are a symptom of the fare increases. In almost all cases, the cause of the fare increases is the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/8">Comments have been made about the length of the franchises. The franchises have been re-awarded so that they are tightly specified and the TOCs are left with little room to innovate or to invest. It is clear that the franchising process is part of the reason why we are seeing large fare increases and why the problems in capacity are not being dealt with. Brian Cooke, the chairman of London TravelWatch, talking about that first bid for the franchise, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/9" class="indent">&quot;It was devious of the Government not to make clear what had been agreed in First's bid. Ministers wanted First to do their own dirty work. When a franchise is agreed, the Government should immediately publish all of the terms, not just the attractive bits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/10">Mr. Cooke said that it would have been far better to deal with the overcrowding by adding extra carriages rather than pricing people off the afternoon and evening services, and we agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/11">In January this year, regulated fares went up by the maximum of RPI plus 1, which is 4.3 per cent. The highest unregulated fare increase that I have seen, part of which was the harmonisation in London, was 56 per cent. in my constituency for people who wished to travel from South Merton into London. The report advocates greater involvement in the setting of fares through greater regulation. I contend that we need almost diametrically the opposite. There is too much intervention by Government in the setting of franchises and timetables and the micro-managing our railway system. In many cases, the franchising process is driving the fares so high.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/12">In their response to the Select Committee, the Government cite one of the benefits of not increasing regulation, stating that competition encourages innovation in the railways. I agree, but another Select Committee report on rail franchising states that the Government's drive to extract higher premiums and their strict specification of franchises has hampered any efforts by the TOCs to innovate.</p>

	<p pid="a.363.2/1">I am corrected. That is not usually the situation in Westminster Hall. I am usually left with about 10 minutes to sum up during debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/2">Before speaking from my prepared notes, I shall comment on some of the contributions, starting with those of my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich. She made an excellent contribution. It was clear to see that her knowledge and devotion to the railway industry was shining through. I guess that her experience and knowledge of the industry are second to none. She will not expect me to agree with everything that she said; I think that she would be very surprised if I were to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/3">I take issue with a couple of my hon. Friend's points. When saying that rail travel was becoming more expensive than travel by coach or car, its two main rivals, she suggested that fare increases were a decoy to distract attention from the fares that people actually pay. That is not a direct quote, but she said that she was worried that fares were rising much more quickly than those for alternative transport. I am sure that she is familiar with the piece of information that I am going to quote. It comes from page 5 of the Government's response to her report.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Although...revenue per passenger km has increased by 2.4% over the last decade, other data published by ORR shows a real increase in ticket prices of 9.3% (over 11 years). The difference between the two figures can be explained by the fact that the 9.3% reflects the price of all fares offered whereas the 2.4% reflects what passengers have actually bought...passengers are becoming more selective in their purchasing and keener to take advantage of the cheaper products.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/5">I understand my hon. Friend's point. It is valid, and I shall talk later about what the Government are doing to facilitate simplification of the fare structure in the rail industry. However, it is simply not the case that passengers are being priced off the railways. Although fares in general have gone up by 9.3 per cent. over 11 years, that does not reflect what people are actually paying. Passengers, especially regular passengers&mdash;I accept that the weakness of this argument is that people who are not regular travellers do not have that expertise&mdash;have become expert over the past decade and a half at identifying the cheapest fares and exploiting the system, exactly as they should be doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/6">However, I accept the criticism that not everyone is capable of doing so. I have discussed with my hon. Friend the challenges that the internet presents when one is trying to buy tickets for particular journeys. I am no more an internet expert than she is, and I dread the day when I will have to do it myself instead of having staff book travel for me. Her point is well made, but I cannot accept that the amount paid by passengers is anything like the increase that we have seen. For example, in relation to running private cars, to quote again from page 5 of the Government's response,</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/7" class="indent">&quot;revenue increases have broadly matched volume growth with the cost of travel (in pence/km) rising slightly. The AA Motoring Trust suggests car running costs (2006) are about 22p/km, even for a relatively cheap car.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/8">That is taking all the costs into account, not just the cost of petrol. I do not think that the case can be made that travelling by car is always significantly cheaper than travelling by rail.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/9">My hon. Friend asked whether any level of rise in the price of open fares would encourage the Government to cap them. That opens up the argument about regulated and unregulated fares. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" name="Stephen Hammond">The hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase> was quick to dismiss the distinction between them, but it is crucial. If the Government were significantly to increase the range of tickets that come under regulation, there would be a cost to the Exchequer. My hon. Friend suggested in her comments that that should not always be used as an excuse to do nothing. I understand, but on the other hand, given the Government's huge and record levels of investment in the rail industry, the argument for extending regulation to other fares that are not currently regulated is not strong.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/10">My hon. Friend mentioned saver fares, and I will talk a bit more about them in my main comments. Interestingly&mdash;this point was also made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1651" name="Lee Scott">the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>&mdash;she said that the industry was trying to price customers off trains. If that is the case&mdash;if it is a strategy of the train operating companies to alleviate capacity problems&mdash;it is hard to imagine a strategy that has had less success.</p>

	<p pid="a.364.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a salient point. If it is indeed a strategy, it is not being implemented particularly efficiently, given that patronage has grown, as she knows well, by 40 per cent. during the past10 years. There is absolutely no evidence of it that I am aware of. If hon. Members present would like to offer me any, I would be interested to consider it, but I am not aware of examples on any route of a significant decrease in the number of passengers as a result of rail fare increases.</p>

	<p pid="a.364.2/1">We ought to accept one or two things. The reality is that most TOCs do not innovate. We are always hearing about their initiatives, but, frankly, they do not provide imaginative schemes to attract people. At present, they are quite happy, at best, to rest on their laurels and at worst, to try to make things so complicated that people can never get cheap tickets. Try to get a cheap ticket on any of the companies that you normally have to deal with, Mr. Jones, and you will find that the number of cheap tickets is infinitesimal, and that somehow they always seem to have disappeared when you want to buy one.</p>

	<p pid="a.365.0/1">That was an extremely robust intervention. I disagree with my hon. Friend about the ability of private TOCs to innovate. However, I agree with her that the fare and ticketing structure in the British railway industry is far too complicated. It was not acceptable that the hon. Members for Ilford, North and for Wimbledon were, as so-called mystery shoppers, given a range of varying fares for the same journey. That does not make any sense, and it is unacceptable. That is why the Government are working with the TOCs and the wider industry to develop a simplified structure. I shall say more about that when I go through my prepared comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.0/2">Sadly, the hon. Member for Ilford, North has departed&mdash;from the Chamber, that is. He spoke about complexity, which I shall say more on later, and capacity and reliability. He was the first to mention his unfortunate experience as a mystery shopper, and he agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich that it was in fact a deliberate strategy of the rail operating companies to get rid of their passengers by pricing them off the carriages. As I said, I profoundly disagree with that. There is very little evidence for it.</p>

	<p pid="a.370.1/1">Seat removal was in fact undertaken before the commencement of the new franchise. However, I understand the franchise commitment by South West Trains to mean that there should be a 20 per cent. capacity increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/2">Whatever the other issues with which it might currently be dealing, First Great Western is committed to increase the number of seats on the network by 35,000 by means of the refurbishment of its high speed trains, which will be completed by the end of the year. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-02">2 April 2007</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Transport announced a plan for 12,000 additional commuter seats on daily train services into London, to be accomplished through the Brighton main line route utilisation strategy and purchase of new rolling stock. We should not forget the west coast main line modernisation, which has already increased the capacity of that route and will provide even more capacity by next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/3">The hon. Member for Wimbledon said that it was a reality of life that the Department for Transport specifies the number of carriages on franchises. That is not a reality of life; it is wishful thinking. I am disappointed that he wants to repeat the nonsense that was put about when the controversy about First Great Western's new timetable really started to hit the headlines in January&mdash;I assume it is that to which he was referring. A myth started to emerge&mdash;I kid you not, Mr. Jones&mdash;to the effect that the DFT had contacted First Great Western and asked it to remove carriages, presumably on the basis that there was insufficient overcrowding. It was a fascinating idea, and no matter how often I said that it was nonsense, there were those who insisted on repeating it. I trust that the hon. Gentleman is not about to do that again.</p>

	<p pid="a.371.5/1">That is a fascinating insight. The hon. Gentleman says that premiums are the cause of fare increases, but he is not prepared to say whether that is good or bad. That is a remarkable admission from the Conservative Front Bench. It is interesting thathis right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> proposed a startlingly innovative policy on premiums just last week. He did not suggest that they should not be paid, even though he has obviously been told by the hon. Gentleman that premiums are the cause of fare increases. He ignored that, and suggested to the Government that, instead of the premiums going to the Treasury&mdash;into the pot of money that the Government spend on all sorts of things&mdash;they should go to the DFT so that they could be spent on rail.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.5/2">That was real blue skies thinking by the right hon. Member for Witney. Given that we have been doing that very thing with premiums for many years already, and that the premiums have never gone to the Treasury, I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not been called into his leader's office to explain why he did not brief him on what already happens in the DFT budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.5/3">The right hon. Member for Witney once again finished with a punchline: he said that there was too much Government intervention in relation to railway industry specification. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Wimbledon is aware that, since I was appointed, I have had meetings in my office with a steady stream of Conservative Back Benchers, who were not there to tell me that we specify too much, but invariably to tell me that they want me to interfere more in the railway network and in the workings of train operating companies, and to try to ensure that I use my influence to instruct those companies to provide more services in their constituencies. We have all heard of joined-up government, but I want to see some joined-up opposition.</p>

	<p pid="a.372.2/1">The right hon. Lady says, &quot;As they all do.&quot; That has not always been my recollection, nor indeed is it necessarily what the voting record indicates. Not all the Back Benchers who go to the Minister represent official party policy, therefore, whereas it is official party policy that has been stated today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-26a.372.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" speakername="Tom Harris" colnum="372"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070426/halltext/70426h0005.htm#07042644000282">
	<p pid="a.372.3/1">I do not wish to contravene either the rules of ministerial office or the conventions of the House by naming any of the people who have come to see me; I simply observe that they were not all Back Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/2">I shall use the short time available between now and the end of the debate to make my prepared comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/3">The Government recognise the importance of the rail network to the social, economic and environmental well-being of this country, and we intend to make sure that the network plays a full and increasingly important part within an integrated national transport system. We are working with the train operators and with Network Rail to tackle the various issues that need to be addressed: capacity and overcrowding, service quality and on-time performance, and other issues, including matters of fares and ticketing.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/4">Our efforts, and those of the men and women who work for Britain's railways, are showing results. On-time performance across the network has reached 88 per cent. and is still climbing, passenger numbers have increased by more than 40 per cent. since 1995, and the number of passenger kilometres is currently higher than at any time since 1946. Slam-door trains south of the Thames have been consigned to history, and service frequency on many routes across the country has been increased or even doubled.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/5">Modernisation of the southern part of the west coast main line has been completed, and the new service is steadily drawing passengers away from planes and motorways and on to the trains. The final section of the channel tunnel rail link&mdash;now, I believe, to be called, High Speed 1 and High Speed 2&mdash;will open, on time and on budget, in November, further speeding up Eurostar and ready for high speed trains to start running into Kent on domestic services in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/6">I do not want to be accused of pretending that the railway industry in Britain is a perfect model, that nothing ever goes wrong, and that the Government are 100 per cent. satisfied with it. Sadly, however long I am in this job, I suspect that I will never be able to utter those words in honesty. However, I believe that the progress we have made has been significant and should be welcomed by the House. There is still much more to do, of course, especially if we are to meet the challenge of the further growth in passenger numbers that is predicted for the next decade. However, if all that I have mentioned is, as the media would have us believe, some sort of failure, then perhaps the country could do with some more such failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/7">Having said that, this debate is about fares and ticketing, and I welcome the chance to explain what the Government are doing to address those issues. Let me say at the start that the Government do not agree with every opinion expressed in the Committee's report, but many of its recommendations are well thought out and well made.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/8">My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich has rightly pointed out just how complex fares can be and has suggested that a unified fares structure should be introduced throughout the country. I agree, and we are working with train operators to see whether we can do just that. We are discussing a simple, logical fare structure, with a straightforward choice of three or four fares on each route, with consistent terms and conditions and easily understandable ticket names that, to quote from a well known advertising campaign, &quot;do exactly what they say on the tin&quot;. Work is still in hand and I am confident that ongoing discussions with the industry will bear fruit sooner than most of us expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/9">There has been speculation about the future of Saver fares, which my hon. Friend raised. All options for the national fares structure currently under discussion include retaining and, in some cases, expanding the role of flexible walk-up Saver-type fares at affordable prices. Those tickets are extremely popular, and the flexibility that they provide gives rail a significant commercial advantage over air travel and allows it to compete effectively with the private car. It is in both passengers' and railway companies' commercial interests to keep such fares.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/10">The new national fares structure will build on several initiatives that have already been implemented to make rail fares simpler. In March this year, National Rail Enquiries revised its website to simplify the way in which fares are presented online, so instead of a confusing list of every possible fare, only the cheapest fare in each of three categories&mdash;fully flexible, flexible with restrictions, and advance purchase&mdash;is shown. The new ticket names to be adopted under the proposed national fares structure will slot neatly into those three categories. The passenger retains a choice of fares, but that choice is now presented in a way that, I hope, they will understand easily.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/11">In January this year, we simplified rail fares throughout London: 97,000 separate sets of station-to-station fares were replaced with one simple set of zonal rail fares, and the same price now applies between any two stations in given zones, whatever the route and whatever the operator. At this point, I ask the hon. Member for Rochdale whether he agrees with his hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>, who, during a debate in this place on Waterloo International, opposed that change. As the hon. Member for Rochdale has said in this debate that his party favours moving to smart ticketing forms of paying fares&mdash;I am delighted that he is on board on that one&mdash;I wonder whether he agrees with his hon. Friend on whether it was a good or a bad move to go from the 97,000 fares that were available before <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase> this year to the 21 that there are now. He might want to discuss that with his hon. Friend the next time he sees him in the Tea Room.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/12">The new fares in London use exactly the same familiar zones used by London buses, London Underground and the successful multi-modal Travelcard fares. Those new London zonal rail fares not only simplify rail pricing in London, but will pave the way for smartcards to be extended to national rail services in London over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/13">London will not be the only city benefiting from the introduction of smartcards. We have specified the introduction of modern smartcard ticketing systems on five new franchises: the South Western, East Coast, Cross Country, West Midlands and East Midlands franchises. Specifying the standard smartcard format produced by the Integrated Transport Smartcard Organisation, or ITSO, means that those smartcard systems will be compatible with one another and can form the foundation of a truly national integrated ticketing system. As with the successful London Oyster smartcard, instead of queuing at the ticket office, passengers can touch in and out, saving time and adding convenience. The same smartcard may also work on connecting buses, trams or underground trains. I understand that it is a foul calumny to suggest as a national newspaper did that the right hon. Member for Witney is so posh that he thought the Oyster card was a luncheon voucher.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.3/14">Our vision is a railway with simple, understandable ticketing, making use of the potential that modern technology offers, and integrated not only across the rail network, but with other forms of transport. If I have addressed ticketing, I will say something about fares.</p>

	<p pid="a.374.1/1">I may have to write to the hon. Gentleman about that. My understanding is that that would not be the case, but I am happy to write to him if that is acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/2">UK rail fares are often compared unfavourably with those in Europe. However, in many cases, the old adage applies: &quot;Never let the facts spoil a good story.&quot; Reports typically compare only the most expensive UK open fares, aimed at business travellers and bought by just 10 to 15 percent. of passengers on a route such as London to Manchester, with the regular fare paid by the majority of passengers in European countries. In fact, 85 percent. of passengers on a route such as London to Manchester pay reduced fares, at prices broadly comparable with the fares charged for a similar distance in France or Germany, only a few pounds more than is charged for travel on fast trains in Italy, and significantly less than is typically charged in Switzerland. If the hon. Member for Rochdale wants a copy of the information that formed the basis of those remarks, I would be happy to provide him with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/3">We have also had to put up with reports that suggest that it is cheaper to fly within the UK than take a train. The hitherto well respected <i>Which?</i> magazine ran a report that purported to show that. The small print reveals that it failed to include air passenger duty in its flight costs. Simply adding that to the cost of the flight reverses the conclusions of the report and the message of the resulting news headlines. <i>Which? </i>magazine's own figures show that taking the train from Birmingham to Edinburgh or from Exeter to Manchester was actually cheaper than flying on four or five of the seven occasions that it checked. From London to Glasgow, taking the train was cheaper than flying on every occasion that it checked&mdash;after air passenger duty and the cost of travelling to Luton or Stansted airports were added to the air fare. On some occasions, taking the train was not only cheaper but substantially cheaper.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/4">I must make it clear, however, that the Government do not set rail fares or, for that matter, coach or air fares. We must remember that all of those are private sector industries. Rail accounts for 6 per cent. of passenger miles nationwide&mdash;a figure that most people would not consider a monopoly share. As a result, the majority of rail fares are unregulated and set on the same commercial and competitive basis that determines fares charged by airlines or coach companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/5">However, we recognise that, in certain areas, train operators have a degree of market power that justifies Government intervention. That includes commuter transport into London and other big cities, where there are few practical alternatives to rail. The Department for Transport regulates most fares used by commuters. That is a not insignificant proportion: more than 40 per cent. of fares revenue comes from regulated fares. Since 2004, we have permitted an annual average increase in those regulated fares of no more than 1 per cent. above inflation. That followed several years of limiting commuter fares to increases below inflation. As a result of our fares regulation, commuter fares remain more than 2 per cent. lower in real terms today than they were in 1996. I would not expect to read that in the newspapers, of course.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/6">Over the same period, the earnings of the average commuter using those fares have risen well ahead of inflation, along with the general prosperity of the nation. In addition, we must never forget the big picture. In 2005-06, the railways earned approximately &pound;4.4 billion in fare revenue from passengers. That was not sufficient to cover the full cost of the network. To cover the remaining cost of operating and investing in our railways, the taxpayer contributed &pound;4.6 billion in subsidy.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/7">It is easy to assume, as the media and public often seem to, that fares can simply be legislated downwards, with the money coming from private operators' &quot;profits&quot;. The reality, unfortunately, is very different. The simple truth is that, if fares go down, the &pound;4.4 billion in revenue reduces and the &pound;4.6 billion in subsidy must go up by an equivalent amount to make up for the revenue that has been lost. That unfortunate law of railway finance&mdash;of finance in general, I would suggest&mdash;applies equally well whether we are making franchise payments to a privatised train company or subsidising a nationalised rail operator. Setting regulated fares therefore involves a balance between safeguarding the interests of passengers and looking after the interests of taxpayers. We believe that, in our approach to UK rail fares, we have looked after the interests of both, and we will continue to do so.</p>
