<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" speakername="Nicholas Winterton" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0063.htm#06050963000504">
	<p pid="c.1.2/1">I am delighted to have obtained this debate on maternity services. Perhaps I should first declare a non-pecuniary interest, in that I am an honorary vice-president ofthe Royal College of Midwives. It awarded me that position, which I am honoured to hold, after theSelect Committee on Health, which I chaired in the early 1990s, produced what I would describe as a groundbreaking report on maternity services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/2">My purpose in calling for this debate is fourfold. First, I want to mention the &quot;Making it Better, Making it Real&quot; consultation on health care services for children, young people, parents and babies in Greater Manchester, east Cheshire, High Peak and Rossendale. However, I want to make particular reference to in-patient services at East Cheshire NHS Trust's Macclesfield district general hospital. Secondly, I want to draw attention to the continuing staff shortages affecting maternity units, of which I know the Minister is aware. Those shortages are exacerbated by the current funding deficits in the health service. Thirdly, I want to question this Government's commitment to making good their manifesto pledges on maternity services. Finally, I want to propose the implementation of measures designed to arrest the current shortage of midwives and deliver high-quality maternity services for all women.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/3">However, I begin by focusing at constituency level and on the consultation on the reconfiguration of service provision. Some may consider the recruitment of staff to small units a problem that affects the quality of and generates risks to continued service provision. In addition, questions have been raised about the financial viability of smaller units. I say to the Minister that those issues do not exist at the East Cheshire NHS Trust, where a vibrant facility is continually providing high-quality care within the income calculated under payment by results&mdash;a policy introduced by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/4">The services provided by the East Cheshire NHS Trust are needed by the population of eastern Cheshire, which, by the way, includes the constituency represented by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase>. The trust also serves the population of High Peak, the Buxton area, and north-west Staffordshire, represented by the towns of Leek and Biddulph.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/5">The maternity and children's services at the Macclesfield district general hospital are sustainable, affordable, efficient, safe, highly regarded and recommended, and those facts are known to the strategic health authority. Those facilities are integral to the delivery of district general hospital services on the Macclesfield hospital site. They are responding to increased demand, and are providing a local service to a geographically large and isolated part of Cheshire, Derbyshire and north Staffordshire. I remind the Minister that the Government believe that services should be provided to people as locally as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/6">Both children's and maternity services have sustainable models for the delivery of the European working time directive. The proposed model for paediatric services is innovative and approved by national and local training organisations. I emphasise to the Minister that services such as paediatrics, obstetrics and maternity have no vacancies at Macclesfield district general hospital and are rarely closed to admissions. If they are closed, it is never due to lack of staffing, but due to excess demand. Does that mean that there is a danger that such in-patient services will be removed to a hospital much further from the community that they serve? I hope not.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/7">The service is sustainable under the new financial rules. Financial analysis across all specialties shows that income for obstetrics and paediatrics under payment by results covers expenditure. The payment by results rules expect the non-activity-driven paediatric services&mdash;that is, the community-based services&mdash;to be paid for at cost by the commissioners. The service does not requireany capital development to provide future services.The hospital and community service is provided by the integrated paediatric consultant team, reducing the infrastructure costs involved with separate teams.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/8">All services have undergone a Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection review. Regular visits from the training organisations have resulted in praise for the service and an increased demand to manage more junior doctors&mdash;not fewer&mdash;at Macclesfield district general hospital. The most recent quote from the Mersey deanery, following the annual assessment visit last October, stated: &quot;Best hospital so far&quot;. That recommendation came from a teaching hospital. The demand on services has increased against a background of a changing age profile, about which we all know. Women are choosing to deliver their babies at the East Cheshire NHS Trust. Parents and, yes, general practitioners are choosing to bring ill children to that trust.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/9">Only last week, a mother of three from the Buxton area, whose family are patients at Macclesfield district general hospital, spoke at a public meeting of herfear that her son, who has asthma, would lose open access to the children's ward. When she was 38 weeks pregnant, she transferred from Stepping Hill hospital, Stockport, to Macclesfield district general hospital because, &quot;Bigger hospitals forget about people; we need smaller units.&quot; Stepping Hill is the hospital to which people would be directed if the in-patient services were transferred from Macclesfield district general hospital. That is an example of the people who use the service speaking, and that is what is critical about the consultation, which ends in a day or two's time and which I hope will be noted by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/10">Some 96 per cent. of those questioned in the 2004 national young people's patient survey rated the overall care at Macclesfield district general hospital as excellent, very good or good. Of that 96 per cent., 33 per cent. said that it was excellent. That is a high degree of approval.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.3.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09d.3.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.3.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" speakername="Nicholas Winterton" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0063.htm#06050963000506">
	<p pid="c.3.0/1">My hon. Friend raises important issues, some of which I shall touch on in a moment.She refers particularly to transport. Transport from the Congleton area&mdash;and from Macclesfield, for that matter&mdash;to Leighton hospital is not only fairly limited in its frequency, but expensive and inconvenient. How would the House like to see a mother perhaps with two other young children going from Macclesfield, Congleton or many of the rural villages that surround those towns all the way to Stepping Hill in Stockport, or to Leighton hospital near Crewe? My hon. Friend raises important issues, and I intend to come on to one or two of them later.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/2">Eastern Cheshire primary care trust's demographic assumptions indicate a reduction in the number of children between the ages of nought to five of about10 to 15 per cent. Over the past four years there has been a reduction in the number of children born but an increased demand on the services of Macclesfield district general hospital. The influences on the level of demand are, of course, wider than the total number and relate to morbidity, expectation of the users and the services available. East Cheshire NHS trust is working with the Eastern Cheshire primary care trust to develop appropriate in-patient and community services.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/3">To pick up on what my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton said, the impact of the removal of in-patient children's services and consultant-led births would be disproportionate in a hospital the size of Macclesfield district general hospital. The immediate impact would be to remove all children's planned and emergency surgery, which would result in the removal of all adult ear, nose and throat provision, because 44 per cent. of ENT provision at the hospital is for children. Another department would therefore be made vulnerable and would inevitably close.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/4">Gynaecology emergencies would be redirected to surrounding hospitals. It has been estimated that midwife-led births are appropriate for approximately 350 women, representing only 18 per cent. of deliveries. The loss of activity would have a significant adverse impact on the financial viability of the remaining services provided by the Macclesfield district general hospital.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/5">The loss of income is assessed at about &pound;8 million. I know that money is important to the Minister, but although the loss of income is assessed at &pound;8 million, expenditure reductions are anticipated to be onlyabout &pound;5 million. That creates a 4 per cent. additional recurrent financial pressure on the East Cheshire NHS trust if paediatric, maternity and obstetric in-patient services are removed. The risk to recruitment and retention of all other specialties would be high indeed. That has been highlighted to me by one of the consultants at the hospital, Dr. Mark Nicol, who is an accident and emergency consultant and lead clinician in strategy at the district general hospital.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/6">Services are provided to the whole of eastern Cheshire; the High Peak, in particular Buxton; and the north Staffordshire area&mdash;the townships of Leek and Biddulph. Some women from Stockport choose to give birth at Macclesfield district general hospital because it is a delightful hospital with a super reputation.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/7">I now come again to a matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton. Public transport in a rural area, such as Macclesfield, Buxton and north Staffordshire, is in short supply. I refer in particular to my hon. Friend's constituency. There are no direct bus routes from Congleton, or Knutsford for that matter, to Stepping Hill in Stockport. The last bus from Stockport to Macclesfield is at 5.10 pm. I remind the Minister that one in six people in rural areas do not possess a car; how are they going to get to the hospital? The Minister might say that the ambulance servicewill take them, but it is already inadequate and does not meet any of its attendance targets now, let alone with the huge additional burden that would be imposed on it if in-patient facilities were removed from Macclesfield to other hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/8">The paediatrics and maternity service is staffed by seven full-time equivalent consultants, and the team covers acute and community paediatrics. There are close links with the Eastern Cheshire primary care trust, which provides services such as school nursing, child health surveillance, immunisation and vaccination.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/9">Sadly, in the consultation, Macclesfield district general hospital appears in option D, which is not the preferred option. So far, however, option D has been supported by 70,000 people who have signed a petition and 25,000 people who have completed and sent in cards to the authorities. It is supported by people in east Derbyshire and north Staffordshire, by all the consultants and clinicians at the district general hospital and by all the general practitioners. It is supported by Macclesfield borough council, Congleton borough council, Cheshire county council and the Macclesfield branch of the Royal College of Midwives. That shows the support for Macclesfield district general hospital and the in-patient services that it provides, and if the consultation is to be meaningful, to be taken seriously and to be trusted, the overwhelming evidence in support of option D will, I hope, carry weight with the authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/10">I now move on to maternity services more generally. Sadly, the maternity care that women and their families receive continues to be adversely affected by a long-standing shortage of midwives in large parts of the country. I pay tribute to the Royal College of Midwives, which, from time to time, provides information to Members and to me, as one of its honorary vice-presidents. In 2005, the number of NHS midwives fell for the first time in five years. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, the head count stood at 24,808 midwives, down by 36 on the previous year&mdash;yes, that is only a small number, but it is down. Although there is better news on full-time equivalents&mdash;the Government's preferred work force measure&mdash;the figure edged up by only 95 in the same period. Between 1997 and 2005, the number of full-time equivalent midwives in the NHS in England rose by 896, from 18,053 to 18,949&mdash;a rise of just 5 per cent. over eight years. As the Minister will be aware, that compares somewhat poorly with full-time equivalent figures for the overall nursing, midwifery and health visitor work force, which increased by 23 per cent. over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/11">Sadly, the midwifery work force is ageing. Analysis conducted by the Health and Social Care Information Centre reveals that the average age of a midwife increased from 33 in 1997 to 40 in 2004, that the age profile for midwives is much older than that for all NHS staff and that nearly half the midwifery work force in some strategic health authorities is in the 46-69 age group. In addition to the NHS work force statistics, the Royal College of Midwives produces an annual staffing survey. The most recent figures&mdash;as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase>&mdash;show that 78 per cent. of maternity units had vacant midwifery posts. That is the situation nationally, although not, I am pleased to say, in Macclesfield. Some 59 per cent. of vacancies were unfilled for more than three months. Vacancies represented 5 per cent. of the establishment, rising to 9 per cent. in south-east England and 12 per cent. in London.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/12">Although Government vacancy statistics for midwifery are lower than the RCM's figures, there is good reason to suggest that the Government have understated the extent of the shortage of midwives. In an answer to a parliamentary question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, the then Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, stated that the Government counted only vacancies</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/13" class="indent">&quot;that trusts are actively trying to fill that have lasted three months or more&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-04-18.242"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 April 2006; Vol. 445,c. 242W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/14">Even so, if a midwife leaves her job, the vacancy is not a vacancy unless it has lasted for three months and the trust is genuinely trying to replace her. A declining number of midwives could be left to staff a unit, but according to the Government there would not officially be any vacancies in that unit.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/15">I move to the issue of work force pressures. Midwives are the primary carers for women experiencing normal pregnancies and births. That essential role has beena constant since legislation for the regulation of midwifery was introduced in 1902. The pivotal role of midwives was highlighted by the Health Committee in its report in the early 1990s in which we emphasised the importance of the continuity of care; of an identified midwife dealing with a pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy and delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/16">Over the years, midwives have adapted to the changing NHS environment. As the Minister knows, every midwife is responsible for maintaining her existing skills and ensuring that she becomes competent in any new skills required for practice. In short, midwives have been required to adapt and extend their role, and increase their work load in response to a series of policy and socio-economic drivers. The national service framework for children, young people and maternity services compels every NHS trust to meet certain commitments regarding minimum levels and standards of care in maternity services. I repeat, from personal knowledge, that the district general hospital in Macclesfield well meets all those standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/17">The Government's manifesto promises:</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/18" class="indent">&quot;By 2009 all women will have choice over where and how they have their baby and what pain relief to use.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/19">It goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/20" class="indent">&quot;We want every woman to be supported by the same midwife throughout her pregnancy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/21">That was one of the major recommendations of the Health Committee report on maternity services.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/22">Childbirth has become an increasingly interventionist and medicalised practice. Increased intervention in childbirth increases the demands placed on the midwifery work force. The length of post-natal stays has increased in line with rising intervention rates, and that places an additional call on midwifery time. Moreover, the additional requirements resulting from increased intervention rates come at a time when the overall number of births is also on the rise. There was a 5 per cent. increase in the number of births in England in 2003-04 compared to the previous year. That places yet more demands on midwives, as does the increase in the number of women experiencing childbirth both later and earlier in their lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/23">The proportion of pregnant women who are teenagers or women aged 40 years and over is growing. Between 1991 and 2003, the number of women in Englandaged 40 or over conceiving almost doubled from 11,497 to 20,128. In the same period, conceptions in women under 20 also rose. Older and younger women who are pregnant tend to be at greater medical and social risk than pregnant women aged 20-39. Consequently, their care needs tend to be more complex and intensive.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/24">I return to an issue that I mentioned at the beginning&mdash;NHS funding deficits. The current funding difficulties in the NHS in England have exacerbated midwifery shortages and the various pressures on the midwifery work force. The Royal College of Midwives has undertaken what it would describe as a snapshot survey of heads of midwifery in England, in order to assess the impact of funding deficits on midwifery services. According to the RCM survey, more than one in three managers reported that their maternity services budget had been cut&mdash;that is serious&mdash;and morethan one in four that their training services budget had been cut.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/25">More than one in four respondents reported that their midwifery staffing establishment had been reduced. Half of all trusts had been operating a recruitment freeze. One in four managers reported that their trust had been replacing senior midwives with more junior colleagues, and a similar number said that support staff had been substituting for midwives. I am sure that the Minister will take that information very seriously. One in four respondents report that they have reduced the number of home visits by midwives. At a time of urgent need for more midwives, not fewer, the RCM has received reports that a number of strategic health authorities are set to cut the number of midwifery training places. Again, that bodes badly for the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/26">Of particular concern is mounting evidence that post-registration midwifery training will no longer be financially supported and that, for example, the 18-month conversion programme in Oxford for nurses wishing to train as midwives will be stopped &quot;for this year only&quot;. The arguments for cutting 18-month training places are clearly financial and the move is a short-term knee-jerk reaction that will have long-term ramifications for the midwifery profession.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/27">It is also a matter of grave concern that a number of birth centres throughout the country have closed or are under the threat of closure. Birth centres can play a significant part in increasing choice for women during pregnancy and childbirth and in ensuring that maternity services are delivered in what we would all describe as a more home-like setting. Closing birth centres will therefore make it harder to implement the Government's own policies on maternity services.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/28">Although midwives have embraced changes in accordance with Government policy, such as shifting services closer to where people live and providing more diverse services, the funding deficits, allied to continuing staff shortages, are making it harder for midwives to implement those policies in practice. That much has already been acknowledged by the Government, and I give them credit for that. In recent oral evidence on NHS charges given to the Health Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, who sadly resigned recently as a Minister, had to concede that staffing shortages affected delivery of quality maternity care, saying that</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/29" class="indent">&quot;one-to-one midwifery support is part of the National Service Framework, it is a commitment we made in our manifesto. The brake on us delivering that is the lack of midwives and we are working hard, as in other areas, to increase the numbers of people in that area. I think it has increased by 2,200. Progress is being made on that score but it is slow.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/30">She went on to say that the only reason why women did not receive one-to-one care was because there were not</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/31" class="indent">&quot;enough midwives to be able to provide it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/32">The Government are aware of some of the problems facing maternity and midwifery, but inertia on their part has also contributed to a lack of progress in implementing the manifesto and other policies affecting maternity care. The national service framework was published more than 18 months ago, yet there is still no sign of an action plan for the implementation of its maternity standard element, nor is there any evidence that the Government have properly and fully costed it. While the Government could have taken forward the implementation of their own manifesto commitment, they have instead&mdash;I regret to say&mdash;indulged their obsession with tinkering with structures, while services are being cut. That is proving to be a very expensive distraction.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/33">It is as yet unclear whether payment by results will ensure a fair and consistent basis for funding maternity care. When the crunch point comes for maternity services, will the result be a fair, accurate and fully funded tariff, or will commissioners conclude that there are insufficient funds for maternity care, and so opt to pay for a reduced quality service? I hope that that will not be the case. The wider question is: how can anyone be sure that payment by results will result in</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/34" class="indent">&quot;payment being linked to activity and adjusted for casemix&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/35">rather than in perpetuating existing inadequacies in the system for funding maternity care? When asked by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> what assessment had been made of the likely impact of payment by results on the number of home births and caesarean sections, the then Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, replied that no such assessment had been made and gave no date or time frame for when this work was likely to take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/36">It is not clear whether the tariff used for applying payment by results will reflect social as well as medical costs. Coming from Macclesfield, I am well aware that there are not only medical costs but in some areas also social costs. Pregnant women and new mothers from socially disadvantaged groups tend to require greater support in respect of advocacy. In some areas, translation and interpreting services are required, as well as closer liaison between midwives and other health and social care professionals. Will the Government guarantee that the tariff will reflect the different costs incurred by women with different medical and social needs?</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/37">When will the Government be able to say how maternity services will be commissioned in the future? While practice-based commissioning is central to the Government's reforms, it does not follow that this will be the most appropriate level at which maternity services will be commissioned. Clearly, different commissioning functions will need to be delivered at different levels, according to factors such as population size, purpose and strategic significance, and the interrelationship between these factors will vary between services in the same locality. Thus, the integrated nature of maternity services implies that commissioning will need to take place at a different level than, for example, the commissioning of elective hospital services. Furthermore, midwifery services have increasingly engaged with the wider public health agenda and have played a significant role in working collaboratively with commissioners&mdash;a bigger-picture role that must not be lost as a result of the new commissioning proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/38">Finally, let me explain the way ahead as I see it. The Government have a major job to do in order to get maternity services back on track and to rebuild trust with women who use maternity services and all those clinicians and others who work in the services, particularly the midwives who care for women. Current NHS deficits should not be addressed by cutting maternity services budgets or cutting the number of training places for student midwives; they should be increased because there is a proven need for them. Increasing the number of student midwives would also help to address the growing age profile imbalance in the midwifery service work force. The NHS cannot afford to lose any midwifery posts through redundancy. To help stabilise the situation facing maternity units in England, the Government should give trusts a more realistic time scale in which to address their deficits. They must address them, but they must be given time to do so. In addition, the Government must fully fund pay modernisation, as there is evidence that trusts are using the funding crisis to try to avoid their obligations under the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; agreement. Moreover, three Secretaries of State are on record as stating that &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; is fully costed. Is it fully costed? To reduce the excessive demands on an already overstretched work force, the Department of Health must urgently address continuing midwife staff shortages. If the Government do not attract and retain significantly greater numbers of midwives, they will sadly fail to meet their manifesto commitments.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/39">The Department of Health should publish without delay the plan of how it will implement not only the maternity standard of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services, but all other relevant commitments made in this important area, including the manifesto commitments. It is unacceptable that 18 months after the publication of the national service framework so little has been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/40">The national tariffs relating to maternity services must be developed in a way that reflects all the costs associated in providing care to women and babies with diverse clinical and social needs. Commissioners should explore the potential for contracting midwifery group practices to provide antenatal and post-natal care services in deprived areas. I am not just concerned about my own area, where the need is great; there are many more deprived areas of the country where such services are important. The midwifery group practices must provide antenatal and post-natal care services in deprived areas in the event of a GP opting out of providing such services. The midwifery group practices are important.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/41">I pay tribute to those who played such a major role in the Health Committee when I chaired it and when it produced the report on maternity services to which I have referred. That was during the period 1990 to 1992, which is a long time ago. I still greatly respect the help given to me by the late Mrs. Audrey Wise, who was as emotionally involved and committed to the report as I was, Mrs. Alice Mahon, who stepped down from Parliament recently, David Hinchliffe, the Labour Member who chaired the Health Committee with such distinction until the end of the previous Parliament, Rev. Martin Smyth from Northern Ireland and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. This House remains concerned about these important services.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.0/42">I have tackled both the national and local aspects of the issue. I hope that the Minister will appreciate that I am committed to saving the in-patient paediatric, maternity and obstetric services at Macclesfield district general hospital, and that I am strongly supported by Dr. Ian Spillman, the leading paediatric clinician, Dr. Val Lether, the lead obstetrician in Macclesfield, and all the other clinicians and consultants, who unanimously believe that it would be wrong to remove the in-patient services. The situation facing maternity services and the midwifery profession nationally also requires Government attention.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.9.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="9"  time="010:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0063.htm#06050963000507">
	<p pid="c.9.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his excellent tour de force. One of my predecessors, Sir Cyril Smith, speaks highly of his work, which has taken place over 35 years, andI am privileged to follow his remarks. The hon. Gentleman spoke about maternity services in general and how NHS policy can impact on those services in his local hospital in Macclesfield. I echo and support his general remarks. He is far more knowledgeable than I am on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/2">I wish to concentrate on the &quot;Making it Better, Making it Real&quot; consultation, which, as the hon. Gentleman said, covers not only the Cheshire PCTs, but much of Greater Manchester, and which has an effect on my constituency. The proposals are currently out for consultation, and the consultation period ends this Friday. The recommendation in the report is to cut the number of maternity units and child care services from 13 to eight or nine.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/3">I am not opposed to change&mdash;indeed, I accept that some reconfiguration is needed&mdash;but like the hon. Gentleman I am very concerned about the proposals. Not one of the options given includes providing maternity, child care or obstetric services at Rochdale infirmary. With Bury excluded and Burnley general hospital also set to lose its maternity services, a large part of Greater Manchester and Lancashire will be left without easy access to child care and maternity services. Not only that, but for many reasons&mdash;whether lack of transport, poor public transport or high levels of deprivation&mdash;those areas need such services.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/4">The proposals do not make economic sense. The unit at Rochdale infirmary is purpose-built and was opened in January 2001. By contrast to at least one of the strategic health authority's preferred options, no new investment will be needed to keep the unit open. It is very popular. The number of deliveries at the unit has risen since it opened from 1,776 to 2,270 last year. It is the only one of the four hospitals in the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust to have admissions rising year on year. The background against which that is happening is one in which the population of Rochdale is set to rise by 6.7 per cent. by 2028, whereas that of the other towns in the area, such as Oldham and Bury, is set to fall.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/5">There are some specific facilities and practices at Rochdale infirmary that are worthy of special mention and should be retained. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the importance of antenatal services in deprived areas, and the antenatal ward is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Referrals are made by professionals, but also by the women themselves, and since opening the number who attend for antenatal services has risen from just over 3,000 in 2002 to nearly 6,000 last year. If the strategic health authority proposes to close Rochdale's maternity and antenatal services, which are unique in the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust in that they are the only ones to be open 24 hours a day, thought needs to be given to how that facility will be provided.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/6">There are many examples in the post-natal ward at Rochdale infirmary of care being given to babies that is only provided in other areas by special care baby units. That includes the care of pre-term babies as young as 34 weeks gestation, and low-weight babies, weighing as little as 1.8 kg. The staff have real expertise that is not recognised in the title they are given. It is incorrect and controversial to say that staff become deskilled insmall units because they do not care often enough for the more unusual cases. The example of Rochdale infirmary shows that that is not so.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/7">As I said, the Rochdale infirmary unit is the only one in the trust with a rising admission rate, and it has a large number of admissions from outside the Rochdale area. Last year's figures, for example, included 45 babies from Bacup, nine from Rossendale, 61 from Whitworth, 26 from Todmorden and 87 from Oldham. More than half of the 87 women from Oldham made a definite choice of Rochdale rather than Oldham. The other half went there because the unit at Oldham was closed. In fact, the unit at Rochdale was closed 16 times last year, not because of lack of staff&mdash;the hon. Gentleman referred to that&mdash;but because it was full and could take no more people. As he said, the national service framework states clearly that it should be a priority</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/8" class="indent">&quot;to deliver easy access to supportive, high quality maternity services designed around the needs of women and their babies&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/9">Given the popularity of the Rochdale infirmary unit, I believe that it could and should be maintained.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/10">The consultation document gives four criteria for choosing the options, none of which includes Rochdale. The main criterion is safety. The document states:</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/11" class="indent">&quot;there needs to be sufficiently large critical mass of patients in order to maintain the skills of the staff.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/12">No figure is given, but it has been stated that 4,000 deliveries could be a safe figure. I dispute that.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/13">A report by Reform, an independent, non-party organisation, gives evidence that larger units do not automatically provide better quality care or a safer environment for maternity and neonatal care. The report states that larger units are less likely to be able to provide high-quality care because they are more difficult to manage efficiently. It states:</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/14" class="indent">&quot;there must be an end to the drive towards larger, more centralised delivery units across the UK. The current trend to merge medium size 2,000-3,000 delivery maternity units into giant 5,000-6,000 plus delivery units is not evidence based. Competition between such medium sized units should be the driver for higher standards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/15">I believe that the report describes what is happening in Rochdale, and it would be a travesty if the unit were to close.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/16">The second criterion is equity. The consultation document states that disadvantaged and vulnerable groups will be able to access health services easily. It adds that the services will need to reflect the geographical spread of the population, reasonable travelling times, choice and type of service, and choice of location for service users. However, that is not addressed in the current options. If we look at a mapof the review area and include Rossendale and Todmorden, we see that a huge geographical area will be left without maternity and paediatric in-patient services if the proposals are accepted.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/17">Rochdale experiences a higher level of ill health than the national average. In September 2004, it had more than 400 families living in accommodation supported by the National Asylum Support Service. The teenage pregnancy rate in Rochdale is greater than the national average. It is one of the areas worst affected by deprivation. All those factors point to the need to retain a locally based service.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/18">The hon. Gentleman referred to recruitment and retention of midwives&mdash;a key point. I said that the closures in Rochdale were because the unit was full, not because of a lack of staff. The number of midwives leaving Rochdale has remained low for many years, and the usual reason for leaving is retirement. There are no problems with recruiting staff to Rochdale infirmary's maternity suite, in contrast with the situation in both Bury and Oldham, where there have been problems with recruiting and retaining staff. In my view, if something works well, we should not change it.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/19">On patient satisfaction, there has been a huge campaign in Rochdale, similar to the one described by the hon. Gentleman, by people supporting the efforts to keep the maternity and paediatric unit open. More than 37,000 signatures were collected for a petition saying that the unit should be maintained, and during the Easter recess more than 80 people travelled from Rochdale to Westminster to present the petition to the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/20">I shall quote some of the comments from the customer satisfaction questionnaire that were given to me by the midwives. They include:</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/21" class="indent">&quot;the maternity unit can't close, it would be a waste of a very good unit...the service I received from everyone was first class and very professional...this department is a credit to the hospital...this hospital has a maternity unit to be really proud of.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/22">Those are examples of people's satisfaction with the unit.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.0/23">Before the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust was created, Rochdale infirmary had a three-star rating. It was the first hospital in the country to be awarded magnet accreditation. It is already a centre of excellence in the fields of midwifery, obstetrics and paediatrics. The care given is exemplary and second to none, and the population of Rochdale are speaking out strongly against closure. When the consultation finishes on Friday, I hope that there will be another look at the proposals, that some sense will be applied and that there will be a move to ensure that a maternity service is retained in that part of the conurbation of Greater Manchester.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" speakername="Martin Horwood" colnum="13"  time="010:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0064.htm#06050963000514">
	<p pid="c.13.1/1">I agree entirely. The hon. Gentleman, who represents a neighbouring constituency, faces a direct threat to the maternity services in his constituency, as I do in mine, where the context is a financialcrisis caused not by financial deficits in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury but by deficits elsewhere in Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, particularly in the neighbouring Cotswold and Vale PCT. Those deficits are leading to a huge range of closures and cuts in services, from health visitors to adult mental health services, from community nursing to overnight care for children in Cheltenham, from cuts in access to acute care to the closure of the Delancy rehabilitation hospital in Cheltenham.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.1/2">Of course, added to that list is the euphemistically named &quot;rationalisation&quot;, which, over time, will put obstetrics and gynaecology services on one site. My neighbour in Stroud and I are under no illusions as to what that means. The inevitable site for the rationalisation is Gloucestershire Royal hospital in Gloucester, which means that there is a direct threat to the Stroud maternity services and to St. Paul's maternity unit in Cheltenham, despite the fact that it is an excellent purpose-built facility like the one in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>. My children were born at St. Paul's, and my family can bear personal witness to the excellent care and first-class facilities that it offers.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.1/3">The closure of the maternity unit would strike at the heart of our town. Without it, there will be no more Cheltonians, in the old-fashioned sense of the word, because almost no one will be born in the town. Only about 1 per cent. of Cheltenham people are born at home so almost no one will be a Cheltonian ever again if this unit closes. Instead, people will have to face a dangerous extension in drive time, during a very stressful period, through an unfamiliar urban landscape in Gloucester city, which could add dangerous minutes.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.1/4">I put the example of my son, Sami, who was born within minutes of getting through the door of St. Paul's maternity unit, to the chief executive of the foundation trust and asked what would have happened if we had had to add another 20 minutes to our journey. Would he have been born on the Golden Valley bypass between Cheltenham and Gloucester? The chief executive's reassuring reply was, &quot;Nature would have taken its course.&quot; That will not be of much reassurance to my constituents. Inevitably, they will suffer the injustice of losing a service that is much valued and supported, despite the fact that there has been no financial crisis in our primary care trust area.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.1/5">We are promised a consultation period, but we had a consultation period on children's services last year, which revealed overwhelming public opposition to the closure of overnight care at Battledown children's ward in Cheltenham, and 27,000 people signed a petition against that closure. All three primary care trustsand the local NHS foundation trust categorically agreed that a nurse-led unit, at least, would survive and that 350 children a year would not be transferred to Gloucester from Cheltenham under a pilot scheme. Despite all of that however, those proposals were discarded at a few weeks' notice due to the pressure of the current financial crisis. Little wonder, then, that13 local NHS trust governors described the process of public consultation on significant change as having been reduced to &quot;absolute farce&quot;. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale mentioned, the fact that there is only one local service left reduces to nonsense the concept of patient choice between different local services. Sadly, I fear that maternity services will go down the same path.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.15.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="15"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0064.htm#06050963000516">
	<p pid="c.15.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> on initiating this debate. It is an important subject, and I pay tribute to the Select Committee report of years ago, which was followed by the Cumberlege report &quot;Changing Childbirth&quot;. The hon. Gentleman did not mention that in 2002 the Health Committee decided to set up a sub-committee to review what progress had been made since those days. The work goes on, and he got us off to a good start.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/2">I was interested to hear what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> said. I got quite nostalgic, because my two babies were born inSt. Paul's, which was an excellent and popular unit. I did not live in Cheltenham, I lived in Tewkesbury, but Tewkesbury mothers chose to go there, and it would be a real loss to the local community were it to close. I do not understand the reasons for it, and I wish him success in keeping it open.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/3">The hon. Member for Macclesfield raised many points that I would have raised myself had I had full rein. I agree wholeheartedly with everything that he said, and he provided a comprehensive analysis of the subject. The underlying factor in maternity services is the shortage of midwives and the inability to increase their numbers. The Select Committee report in 2002 raised concerns about retention rates, high drop-out rates, and thehigh drop-out rates on some midwifery courses. The Government's response was to commission Professor Mavis Kirkham and team at a cost of &pound;70,000 to carry out a study called, &quot;Why do Midwives Stay and Why do Midwives Return?&quot;, stating that the results would inform future midwifery recruitment and retention policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/4">It will be helpful if the Minister tells us whether the report has been produced, what assessment has been made of it, and what future plans there are to increase the number of midwives. As the hon. Member for Macclesfield pointed out, there has been an abject failure in the Department. One can in no way saythat there has been success, when in 2005 the head count fell by 36. We all know that the head count is the Government's preferred way of accounting, and the Minister please should not insult us by returning to whole-time equivalents just because it happens to suit the occasion.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/5">It is easy to bandy figures about, but the availability of midwives underpins so much more. Some services have suffered, and poorly staffed units are leading in some cases to closures. The 2002 report received considerable evidence to show that poorly staffed units often have an increased rate of caesarean sections. That procedure is more expensive and places a greater demand on national health service resources. It has not been mentioned much today, but we should try to tackle it. The rate of caesarean sections in this country is about 24 per cent, and the World Health Organisation says that it should be about 14 per cent., so there seems to be a problem with the way in which we are managing things.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/6">Hon. Members have illustrated today that if units close, choice decreases. Often, the midwife-led units suffer. Other impacts include a lack of time to devote to the detection of domestic violence, which often starts during pregnancy. Our report highlighted that midwives are ideally placed to identify domestic violence and link up with other health workers. However, many midwives simply do not have time for that, nor do they have any extra time to give to ethnic minority women and to public health matters such as encouraging pregnant women to give up smoking, which I am sure the Minister is keen to encourage. A recent local development that has worried me greatly is that antenatal classes have been axed. I shall cover some of those matters inmore detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/7">The cuts in antenatal classes are particularly worrying because that is where many women obtain information about where to give birth and what will happen when they do, and about post-natal support such as for breast feeding. That service has been cut ostensibly because of lack of numbers, but it is clear that no attempt has been made to commission services from elsewhere and organisations such as the National Childbirth Trust and even independent midwives would be keen to step into the breach.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/8">What is even more worrying is that many women decide at antenatal classes where to give birth. Until that point, they may not have been aware of a local birthing or midwifery unit and it is insidious to reduce demand for a birthing unit so that in future years, or even months, NHS managers will be able to turn round and say that there is no demand for such services.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/9">It is extremely worrying that women will not receive information about giving birth because if they know what is going on they are more likely to have a pleasant experience. Some people would say that childbirth is never a pleasant experience, but there are differences in how people feel about giving birth and how they cope with it. Antenatal education can help with that. Women are left to obtain information from a variety of sources, which is okay if they are educated and can afford to buy books and magazines, but more difficult for those who are struggling on a budget and do not know where to go for help.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/10">It is more common for a woman to arrive at hospital feeling frightened and vulnerable, which can lead to her not having a good birth experience. That brings me to one-to-one midwifery care. Much is made of that and most midwives would say that one-to-one midwifery care enables a midwife to stay with a woman and to provide support from the onset of labour and probably even before that, during pregnancy, and to be present during the birth, but one-to-one care is shown in the figures if the midwife is simply present at the end to deliver the baby. The reality is that in busy obstetrics units many midwives look after more than one woman during labour. That is a disaster waiting to happen.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/11">I tabled some parliamentary questions to try to obtain a definition of one-to-one midwifery care and had a spectacular lack of success. A certain Mrs. Blair opened the new Royal College of Nursing building and happened to mention that she had had two midwives. She was lucky, but she did not seem to think that it was unusual. It might help if someone made it clear that Members of Parliament and their wives should have the same treatment as other people.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/12">One-to-one care is more likely to be achieved in a birthing centre. Other advantages of midwife-led units are that care is provided by midwives who can specialise in supporting women through normal births with a minimum of intervention and an explicit philosophy to provide a friendly, individualised, women-centred and family-focused service which can deliver high-quality care. The problem seems to be that on paper the costs are a bit higher. What often happens is that the wider picture is not taken into account and there is evidence to show that women delivering in birthing units have a lower rate of intervention and less need for aftercare. That is not factored into the equation, but it should be.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/13">I have talked a little about the rates for caesarean births. The Government have decided to publish success rates for certain cardiac surgeons, but when the Health Committee suggested that they should publish obstetricians' success rates for caesarean sections, we were told that there were no plans to do so. Now that we have more openness in other areas, it would be useful to develop that idea.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.0/14">I am rapidly running out of time. I end by saying that the lack of midwives means that there is little time to devote to breastfeeding. Next week is national breastfeeding awareness week. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us when the breastfeeding co-ordinator will be replaced&mdash;the post has been unfilled since February. Perhaps we shall hear some good news next week.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.20.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="20"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0065.htm#06050963000518">
	<p pid="c.20.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on his role as an honorary vice-president of the Royal College of Midwives. My namesake Caroline Flint was once president of the RCM, and during my political activities since I was a student we have sometimes been mixed up with each other. Being approached as an expert in this area is something that I have experienced on a couple of occasions, and I have had to correct people by pointing out that I am not that Caroline Flint. However, I have met her, and she has done a fantastic job in representing midwives, as well as in her professional work.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.0/2">I should also say that I am covering this Adjournment debate for the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>, who will take on his new ministerial responsibilities for maternity services and children's services from the former Health Minister who is now the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety. However, obviously I am interested in this area, and I am happy to listen to the discussion.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.0/3">I am pleased to be able to say that, although there is room for improvement&mdash;that is why the national service framework was initiated&mdash;80 per cent. of women in a survey last summer said that they were happy with maternity services. We have invested &pound;1.4 billion per year in maternity services, and in 2001 we made a capital investment of &pound;100 million to modernise facilities and improve the environment in which maternity care is delivered. I understand that East Cheshire NHS Trust's share of that investment was approximately &pound;1.3 million, which was used to build a state-of-the-art antenatal centre.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.0/4">We are committed to trying to improve choice for women&mdash;and for fathers and families&mdash;and to meet the needs of future generations. Several hon. Membershave raised the fact that more women are having babieslater in their lives, but there is also the fact that younger women are having babies. I have a particularconcern about that, because as public health Minister I am responsible for health inequalities, and about60 per cent. of infant mortalities are linked to young women&mdash;I would describe some of them as young girls&mdash;who have babies perhaps too early in their lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.0/5">However, there are also issues to do with other women who, because of technology and other changes, are able to have babies when they might not have been able to have had them in the past; in vitro fertilisation treatment is one example. Also, because of new technologies and better services some women with different types of disabilities are now able to give birth to their own children, which 10 or 20 years ago might not have been possible. We are dealing with a changing landscape. Ten or 20 years ago, some services in relation to children required longer stays in hospital. My youngest child was 18 yesterday; 18 years ago new mothers might have been expected to stay in hospital for three or four days. These days, mothers can be out of hospital within hours of having had their child, if everything has gone well. The diseases and conditions that children faced 30 years or more ago are also, thank goodness, no longer as prevalent. We have to address this changing landscape.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.0/6">The number of midwives has increased over the past few years. The number of training students is up 44 per cent. since 1997, and there is good news in other areas such as obstetrics and gynaecology. However, the Department is aware that there are concerns in this area, and I will take back to it some of the points made about shortages and other worries. That is one reason for our considering what better support we can give midwives. Through the 57 trusts, we have piloted midwife support workers as possible members of the team, to carry out some of the activities for which a qualified midwife is not needed but which are important aspects of the experience for women, thus freeing midwives for the aspects of supporting women in childbirth for which only they are qualified.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.0/7">I take on board the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Macclesfield about changes concerning payment by results; such concerns are one reason why we are proceeding with it only for some of the key acute services and why we are still considering, and discussing with many organisations, how payment by results would link to maternity services. I am pleased to tell him that the working group on developing models of payment by results is attending to issues of social complexity, and I assume that some of the issues that he raised will be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.0/8">We have established the maternity standard implementation advisory group, which represents stakeholders that include the royal colleges, service providers and the voluntary sector. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> mentioned a role for the voluntary sector in antenatal classes. I am somewhat surprised to hear about the cutting of antenatal classes and will be happy to pursue that and write to her further, because they are important in the process of ensuring that all women have as healthy a delivery as is practicable. Importantly, as she said, the opportunity to explore issues such as smoking and weight and how to look after the baby once it is born has a huge public health impact. Those services are very important to some women. That is a reason for my being keen that health, and questions of how such services are provided, should be a part of the development of children's centres.</p>

	<p pid="c.24.3/1">That is a good point. I do not want to start sounding like the Jeremy Clarkson of the cycling fraternity, but we could all think of examples where a badly designed cycle path, one that is badly maintained or one that is blocked by traffic is more dangerous to use than not. All cyclists are aware of the position described by my hon. Friend. It is important not to effectively encourage the idea that cyclists should be corralled into a small, often badly-maintained section at the edge of the side of the road, and that they should not be entitled to use the rest of the road, like other road users, if they consider it appropriate to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.26.2/1">Is not one of the problems&mdash;and perhaps one of the reasons for that trend&mdash;the fact that not everyone has the joined-up thinking of organisations such as Sustrans? As the same time that Sustrans is planning its safe routes to schools and safe routes to work campaigns, thereare proposals for out-of-town railway stations, for example, which would encourage everybody to travel to the station by car, unlike in Cheltenham Spa, where I have regularly cycled to the railway station. Such counter-trends might be responsible for the figures to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.39.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" speakername="John Leech" colnum="39"  time="011:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0067.htm#06050963000556">
	<p pid="c.39.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing what has turned out to be a very interesting debate on cycling. I confess that I had hoped that my first transport debate would be on something very specific, so I was alarmed when I saw the title &quot;Cycling&quot;, and I thank him for giving me some idea of the issues he wanted to raise.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.0/2">I would like to comment on a few issues. Thehon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Stafford Mr. Kidney) raised concerns about proposed changes to the highway code. I add my support to the campaign to avoid those changes, which could discourage people from cycling. The hon. Members for Stafford and for Stroud (Mr. Drew) raised important points about the compulsory wearing of cycle helmets. In the short term, making helmets compulsory would probably reduce the number of people cycling, although a debate is needed on whether such a move would improve the safety of cyclists in the long term. That is an important question.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.0/3">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith made a good suggestion about forcing local authorities to audit their cycle facilities, but if there are no additional resources, we might find that although local authorities recognise that cycling facilities seriously need to be installed, they might not be able to install them.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.0/4">On the point about resources, the hon. Gentleman raised concerns over funding cuts for cycling in Scotland and made special mention of the Liberal Democrat Minister for Transport and Telecommunications. However, I should point out that, thanks to the Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment of 2003, the new ScotRail franchise has been negotiated so that bikes can be carried on trains, which will encourage the use of bikes.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.0/5">Similarly, under that Liberal Democrat Minister, spending on public transport as a proportion of overall transport spending will rise by 70 per cent. between 2003 and 2007, compared with an increase of less than 50 per cent. under Labour's stewardship. Perhaps the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith ought to speak to his colleagues in Scotland as well as preaching to the Liberal Democrats about their commitment to cycling.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.0/6">No one will dispute that we should encourage more people to cycle. The benefits are clear: cycling keeps people fit and healthy&mdash;it is nice to see so many fit and healthy Members here today, who are all committed to cycling&mdash;cuts congestion, reduces pollution and makes our streets safer because there are fewer cars out there. Unfortunately, cycling has been in decline since Labour came to power. During the first two terms of the Labour Government, bicycle trips fell by 22 per cent. Equally worryingly, the length of the trips that people make has gone down. According to figures produced by the CTC, which were mentioned by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith, only 2 per cent. of road trips in Britain are made by bicycle. We all agree that that must change.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.0/7">To be fair to the Government&mdash;no one has mentioned this&mdash;one of the main reasons for cycling rates not being as good as they are elsewhere is our pretty poor weather. According to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase>, the sun is always shining in Stafford.</p>

	<p pid="c.40.7/1">I apologise, Mr. Hancock.</p>
	<p pid="c.40.7/2">I accept that this is not just a question of the weather, which is why the Liberal Democrats have a five-point plan for cycling. First, we need to create an environment that accommodates and supports cycling. Most roads are less than inviting for cyclists. Even where cycle lanes have been introduced, they are often too short, or only advisory. I am sure that other hon. Members will have been as frustrated me at seeing cars constantly parked in the green cycle area, forcing bikes on to the main part of the road. More and better consultation on cycle lanes is needed to ensure that they are put in the right place and that they suit cyclists' needs. I am sure that there are cycle lanes in the constituencies of other hon. Members, as there are in my constituency, that are rarely used because they are in the wrong place and inconvenient.</p>
	<p pid="c.40.7/3">We need to ensure that there are adequate facilities for the safe storage of bikes. I recently received a complaint from a constituent who told me that there was not a single cycle rack within a half-mile radius of his office, and that the council had told him that there was nowhere suitable in the area for a bike rack. Remarkably, there appear to be plenty of metered car parking spaces, but there is nothing suitable for a bike rack.</p>
	<p pid="c.40.7/4">We need to be smarter when using the planning process to encourage cycling to work. It is all very well forcing developers to put bike sheds in their new developments, but how many members of staff will use them unless there are adequate changing facilities in those developments? Surely we should ensure that such facilities are included, as part of encouraging the use of bikes.</p>
	<p pid="c.40.7/5">Perhaps Members of Parliament need to do a little more. Rather than give 20p a mile for cycling and 40p a mile for cars, perhaps we should turn that round and give 40p a mile for cycling and 20p a mile for cars.</p>

	<p pid="c.45.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing this interesting debate. I also congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) and for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) on their contributions. My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands did a lot of work when she was a Minister in the Department and I should like to recognise that. I also recognise the tremendous work that the all-party cycling group does to promote cycling and address the issues that relate to it.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/2">Many people have an interest in cycling, whether they cycle or not&mdash;although I suspect that we have all been cyclists at some stage. The Government want to encourage more people to cycle; the basic advantages of cycling are convenience, health, cost, environment and enjoyment, as hon. Members have mentioned. To put it simply, cycling contributes to a better quality of health. As some hon. Members pointed out, there has been a decline in cycling, and people continue to use their cars even for short journeys. Between 1999 and 2001, one quarter of all car trips covered less than two miles. In many cases, those journeys could have been made by cycle and we want to promote that.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/3">The Government are committed to reversing the decline in the number of cycling trips. If we are to attract people out of their cars and on to two wheels, we have to make cycling safe, easy and as convenient as possible. That means seeing cycling as a solution to problems of accessibility, health, affordability andthe environment. That is why Cycling England, our advisory body on cycling, reports not only to my Department but to others with an interest in cycling, such as the Department of Health, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Education and Skills. That is also why I will host a meeting of Ministers next week to discuss how cycling can help to deliver a range of Government targets across Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/4">Encouraging cycling means having the right facilities at schools and places of work, and training youngsters to enjoy riding a bike. There are many good examples of improvements and good practice in cycling. For example, as one of my hon. Friends made clear, there has been a considerable increase in cycling to work in London thanks to investment and commitment from Transport for London and the development of the London cycle network. I cannot recall seeing as many cyclists on the roads in recent months as I saw this morning on the way in. Perhaps that has something to do with the good weather, but there are tremendous numbers of cyclists on the road.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/5">The Mayor announced last year that the number of recorded cycle journeys on London's key roads had doubled in the previous five years, from 59,000 in 2000 to 119,000 in 2005. Even more impressively, London has experienced a reduction in casualties among cyclists, as other road users have become more aware of their presence. Transport for London reports that since 1990 there has been a 35 per cent. reduction in cycling casualties. That shows that, with the right support and infrastructure, casualties will not necessarily rise if cycling increases.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/6">As has been mentioned, there are also good examples of increases in cycling in rest of the country, such as in Hull and York, where the national trends have been bucked and a successful cycling programme has been implemented. We undertook a review of the national cycling strategy in 2004, which led to the appointment of Cycling England, the new advisory body made up of experts from the main cycling organisations. Cycling England has been given an annual budget of &pound;5 million, which is in addition to nearly &pound;55 million that has been provided for cycling through local transport plans and Transport for London. Outside London, there has been an increase from &pound;29.5 million in 2001-02 to &pound;36 million in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/7">One of the key elements of Cycling England's work plan is six cycle demonstration towns. Cycling England is investing in some &pound;8.4 million in Aylesbury, Brighton, Darlington, Derby, Exeter and Lancaster over the next three years. I return to an earlier point about incorporating cycling into the design of new housing developments and towns. One reason why we picked Aylesbury was the expansion in housing that will take place there soon and the opportunity to incorporate cycling into the design of the new housing development and expansion there.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/8">Work has already begun to showcase best practice in design and planning in relation to the promotion of cycling. The aim is to test the hypothesis that if we spend levels per head of the population equal to the levels spent in European cities where there has been a significant increase in cycling, we can achieve similar increases here. I assure hon. Members that I take a personal interest in those developments, and I will visit each of the cycling demonstration towns. We have already had a meeting in London to discuss their progress, which will be regularly monitored.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/9">Journeys to school were mentioned. Only 2 per cent. of children cycle to school. Increasing that figure is important not only to increase cycling but to reduce obesity levels and generally invest in healthier future generations. Some &pound;2 million was invested in 2005-06 to extend the links to schools programme, which several hon. Members mentioned, on top of &pound;10 million of Government investment in the previous year. That money has drawn in additional funds, so that &pound;31 million has been spent on the project. So far, more than 300 schools have been linked to the national cycle network by more than 230 km of new routes, of which about 70 per cent. are traffic-free.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/10">Cycling England has a number of other initiatives under way, and is developing and promoting a new national cycle training standard to replace the old cycle proficiency test&mdash;I took that test in a previous life, as other hon. Members might have done&mdash;so as to better equip children with the skills they need to ride safely on today's roads. Cycling England is also working with health authorities, improving the skills of local authority practitioners through a free advisory service backed up by training programmes and improving the marketing of cycling schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/11">Tomorrow I shall attend Cycling England's first annual forum. I am looking forward to discussing its achievements to date and meeting many of the partners who are helping to deliver new initiatives on cycling.</p>

	<p pid="c.47.1/1">I will not give way, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind, as we are short of time and I want to get some comments on the record.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.1/2">Although local authorities are the key to unlocking increases in cycling, we have also enlisted the help of a wide range of cycling organisations and NGOs to work with us. The CTC is helping to deliver improved cycle training by leading a project to provide grants and bursaries to help build the capacity to roll out the new national cycle training standards. Sustrans is delivering the very successful links to school programme, British Cycling is helping us and the cycle industry is contributing to the &quot;Bike It&quot; project, which my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands mentioned. I congratulate Cycling England on bringing together so many experts, and I am very much enthused and impressed by the way in which all the organisations are working together and by the amount of work and commitment that they are putting in.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.1/3">I reiterate that local authorities are the main key to unlocking increases in cycling. Many are already doing a fine job and have been boosted by increased funding. We now need the rest to follow. Cycling England is in a good position to help authorities to spend their money effectively and efficiently, as it is about to launch a free expert advisory service. I encourage authorities to seek such help if they need it. Cycling England is also well placed to promote co-operation between several Departments, of which I hope to see more.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.1/4">Alongside authorities, we need more employers to adopt cycle-friendly policies and introduce cycle-friendly facilities for their workers. Pioneering work has been done on that issue by GlaxoSmithKline, the BBC and the London cycling campaign to promote cycling to work. In Glaxo's case, the impact has been impressive, with the number of registered cyclists rising from 50 to more than 300. The BBC has also achieved high levels of people cycling to work. The Department has played its part in that, having negotiated with the Office of Fair Trading to implement a cycle-to-work tax benefit scheme that allows employers who purchase cycles for employees who commute to work to save the VAT on the cost of the bicycles and to make other tax savings. Cycling England aims to promote the scheme more widely in 2006, and the cycle scheme providers estimate that 100,000 cyclists might participate and benefit from it this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.1/5">Research shows that many cyclists are prevented from cycling to work or hampered by the fact that their employers are less than cycle-friendly. We have to show more companies that a healthier, fitter work force are more productive and profitable. Many cycle commuters use their bikes for only part of their journey to work, combining cycling with public transport&mdash;mostly rail. Such journeys are important because they allow bikes to be used as part of a longer journey. As Minister with responsibility for both bike and rail, I am keen to encourage such journeys wherever possible. We will continue to encourage all train operating companies to provide facilities at stations to help facilitate more bike-and-rail journeys. We also recognise that there are pressures&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.49.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" speakername="Mark Lancaster" colnum="49"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0068.htm#06050963000579">
	<p pid="c.49.1/1">I welcome the Minister to her new appointment. I congratulate her and promise not to be too harsh on her today. If I am remembered for one thing during my time as Member of Parliament for North-East Milton Keynes, I hope it is my campaign for &quot;i before e&quot;&mdash;infrastructure before expansion. That is the key to the future expansion of Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/2">The phrase &quot;i before e&quot; tells people two things. The first is obvious: that the infrastructure must be in place before the city expands. It also says that I am not opposed to the expansion per se of Milton Keynes. It is vital that our young people have somewhere to live and that they have houses that they can afford. As an aside, while I am on affordable housing, the &pound;60,000 house, which has been much publicised by the Minister, is misleading. People think that they can buy a house for that sum; they do not realise that it represents the building cost and not the purchase cost. In Milton Keynes, a &pound;60,000 house is more likely to cost &pound;130,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/3">While I assume that the Minister will not disagree with my &quot;i before e&quot; campaign, I sense that we differ. She wants Milton Keynes to expand on her terms, with or without the consent of local people, while I am determined that local residents should have the final say on how, and at what rate, it should grow. With that in mind, she may be interested to know that last week I presented a petition to the House signed by more than 4,000 residents. It is relevant, and it declared</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/4" class="indent">&quot;that for any community to be 'sustainable' the plans for its expansion must be supported by existing residents and that Milton Keynes Partnerships' 'Public Consultation' process was not long enough to fully involve the Citizens of Milton Keynes in the decision making process regarding the 2031 Milton Keynes expansion plans. The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urge the Government to set up a local referendum to decide:</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/5" class="indent">If the expansion planning and delivery should be returned to those who are democratically elected to represent and service the people of Milton Keynes and the surrounding area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/6">The petition sums up my view exactly. Without genuine local support, the Government's sustainable communities plan is destined to fail in Milton Keynes. I am not calling for a referendum on every decision, but the local authority, which is democratically elected by local people, should be allowed a genuine say on how the city will grow. According to a recent survey, that is a view shared by 88 per cent. of local residents.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/7">In simple terms, I believe in a bottom-up approach, but the Government prefer the top-down approach. If the Minister does not want to take my word for it, she need only consider last week's local elections in Milton Keynes. Just over a year ago, my constituency was represented by a Labour Member of Parliament, yet last week Labour polled less than 15 per cent. of the vote there. I am convinced that one of the reasons for the Conservative revival in my constituency is that we are the only major party promoting the active involvement of local people in deciding how the city will expand.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/8">The Government's approach is rather different. I sense that the Minister and her colleagues are rather nervous about what might happen if, God forbid, local residents have some form of control over their future. The Government prefer the autocratic approach via unelected and unaccountable quangos. In Milton Keynes, we are talking about English Partnerships and its local delivery vehicle, Milton Keynes Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/9">The Government occasionally, via the Milton Keynes Partnership, like to give the impression of local involvement. After all, there are three elected members of the local authority on its board, complete with a generous salary, but they have no authority. While I accept that such a situation is becoming the norm for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, it is not the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/10">The Milton Keynes Partnership recently consulted the local population about its six options for growth for the city. Even though, according to the survey that I mentioned, 78 per cent. of people in the city had no idea that the consultation had taken place&mdash;either because it was so poorly advertised or so short&mdash;the residents who did respond flatly rejected all six options. Presumably, it is a case of going back to the drawing board. Of course, the advantage of being an unelected, unaccountable quango is that one can press on regardless of local views.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/11">Milton Keynes cannot just do its own thing, and there must be co-ordination with other regional organisations. To be fair, I should say to the Minister that Jane Hamilton and her staff at English Partnerships are very professional, but often their hands are tied as they cannot serve two masters and, however sympathetic they are to the needs of Milton Keynes, they know that their principal loyalty is to central Government, not the city. Let me give the Minister just one example of what I mean. Between 2004 and 2008, via English Partnerships the Government will rob Milton Keynes of &pound;494 million by selling off the city's land bank, and put back just &pound;201 million. Therefore, there will be a net outflow of nearly &pound;300 million, stolen from the city by Government via an unelected, unaccountable quango.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/12">Assuming that the Minister supports my &quot;i before e&quot; campaign, I am sure she will share my concern at the detrimental effect that this drive to squeeze every penny out of the city is having on the local community. For example, numerous green reserved sites across the city are now being considered for sale for residential development. Walton high school in my constituency&mdash;an excellent school that both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor visited in the run-up to the general election, presumably to bask in its reflected glory&mdash;recently wanted to expand its sixth form on to a reserved site next to the school owned by English Partnerships. The site was originally valued at &pound;12,000, but the school found that English Partnerships had revalued the site at its residential value of &pound;234,000, thus making it unobtainable by the school. I am pleased that, having raised the matter in the House, that decision has been reversed. However,it is a classic example of &quot;e before i&quot;&mdash;of expansion before infrastructure&mdash;rather than of &quot;i before e&quot;, which is what I am calling for.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/13">I shall address the financing of the expansion shortly. I acknowledge that some infrastructure improvements have been promised&mdash;for example, the upgrading of central Milton Keynes railway station and the improvements to junction 14 of the M1, both of which are due for completion in the next few years.</p>

	<p pid="c.51.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way, and I echo his call for infrastructure before expansion in Milton Keynes, asI issue a similar call in respect of neighbouring Aylesbury vale.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.0/2">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is particularly perverse and objectionable that a quango in the form of Milton Keynes Partnership should propose a whole series of options upon which it fails to consult and among which there is not numbered an option which would allow for expansion east of the M1? Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a lacuna which ought to be put right?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.64.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="64"  time="013:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0070.htm#06050963000599">
	<p pid="c.64.1/1">It is good to see you in the Chair, Mr. Hancock, and I am grateful for the opportunity to start the debate three or four minutes early&mdash;and I thank the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, as well for his help in that.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/2">Of course, this subject is very important to my constituents. The Minister&mdash;I am glad to see that she is still with us after the reshuffle&mdash;will know that when opinion polls are taken, people say that the quality of the health service is at the top of their list of priorities. To be fair, the Government have put money into the health service over the years, and they have also managed to cut waiting lists; I want to recognise the good before turning to what may be a problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/3">This is a time of uncertainty. We are seeing reorganisation in the health service in East Sussex that may be necessary to some extent&mdash;for instance, there is tremendous pressure on accident and emergency departments&mdash;but I hope that the Minister recognises that it can create uncertainty and divert people's efforts away from delivering front-line services to considering bureaucratic structures. For example, she will know of moves to change the structure of the strategic health authority to make it a south-east authority, and of the proposal to merge primary care trusts in my patch. The mental health trust is coming together, and the ambulance service looks as if it will be larger than Sussex. All those trusts&mdash;only the acute trust will be left untouched&mdash;will be going through yet another cycle of reorganisation. I wonder how many more there will be. I have been an MP for only nine years, but the health service seems to have been in permanent revolution during that time. That is not sensible for the people involved in the health service or for my constituents or patients generally. We will also have payment by results, which will have interesting consequences.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/4">Let me refer in parenthesis to the economic position of Lewes. The town is at the centre of my constituency; it is a relatively small town, but it benefits from a large degree of white-collar work, which allows it to continue to prosper. Much of that work is based on the health service. The town houses the headquarters of the local PCT and the ambulance trust, other health bodies have links with it and the county council is based there. It would be most unfortunate if, as a consequence of reorganisation, health service jobs were lost to the town. I hope that when the Minister is considering such reorganisations and possible changes to the location of headquarters, she will bear in mind the importance of maintaining a white-collar base in Lewes.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/5">In particular, I want to talk about the impact of the job cuts in Sussex that are fast coming down the track. I said at the start of my speech that I recognise that the Government have put more money into the health service&mdash;they have&mdash;and the Chancellor has put in more money than ever before. It is therefore difficult to understand the reason for the headlines in my local papers. One headline in <i>The Argus</i> says &quot;200 jobs cut to save the NHS &pound;8 million&quot;, and another says, &quot;NHS in jobs crisis&quot;. One in the <i>Mid Sussex Times</i> says, &quot;325 jobs to go at hospitals&quot;. Across the acute trusts in particular, we are seeing large-scale redundancies. For instance, the 325 redundancies at the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals trust comprise 7 per cent. of the work force. The 250 jobs that are to go in Eastbourne at the East Sussex Hospitals trust form 5 per cent. of the work force.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/6">By any standard, those are huge cuts. More than that, they will be random cuts, because the trusts are sensibly working on the basis of trying to avoid redundancies and allowing for natural wastage. Of course, that means that the cuts will come in haphazard fashion according to when people happen to leave&mdash;they may, in fact, be in the wrong places. There is no guarantee of a straightforward, sensible and clinical&mdash;in both senses of the word&mdash;approach to what happens. Instead, the job cuts will fall rather randomly. That will have an effect on front-line services.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/7">It is not difficult to gainsay the suggestion that with7 per cent. of the work force going within a year, there will be no impact on front-line services. Clearly there will be an impact. Will the Minister explain how&mdash;I genuinely do not understand&mdash;when the health service has more money than ever, job cuts of such a magnitude are being made in our trusts? It is not a matter of one trust that has been badly managed. Trusts across Sussex, as referred to in my local paper, are affected.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/8">The cuts are having other unwelcome consequences. I spoke last night to Dr. Andrews, the chairman ofthe East Sussex Hospitals trust local negotiating committee. He told me that things are moving to a stage at which even the most basic drugs are running out in hospitals, including antibiotics. Those are not expensive drugs, but basic drugs. He tells me that hospital doctors scout around for alternatives that can be used to treat patients, but which are often not the most desirable in clinical terms, and are often more expensive; they are just what happens to be there. The cash-flow problems of the hospital are now leading to wastage, with secondary clinical decisions sometimes being made which, although I am not saying that they are wrong, are not necessarily the doctors' first choice. More money is spent in an attempt to save money, which is counterproductive.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/9">Experienced staff are being replaced with less experienced staff&mdash;we have of course seen that happen in schools&mdash;because they come cheaper, being further down the grading scale. However, by definition they do not have the knowledge and detailed experience that is necessary for our hospitals. The consequence is that we have less experienced staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/10">All those developments are very worrying to people in my constituency. With respect to the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals trust&mdash;the one with the biggest deficit and the biggest problem&mdash;I am happy to concede that a part of the process may have been limitations in previous management decision making. I am happy to accept that that has been a part of the process if the Minister wants to argue the point. However, now that a turnaround team has been sent in by the Department, the trust's historic debt, which is significant at &pound;10 million, should be wiped off, provided that the trust can agree with the Department of Health and the turnaround team a process for going forward that will prevent further debt from mounting up.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/11">That seems to me to be a compromise. If the trust is expected to deal with the historic debt as well as with the accumulating debt, the consequences for patients will be severe. Wiping out the old debt seems a way to bring some intellectual and financial rigour into the process while recognising that there will be a significant downside for patients if things are allowed to continue as they are.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/12">That is not to say that money is not wasted in the health service. I particularly object to large pay-offs being made to individuals for reasons that are not entirely clear. I draw to the Minister's attention the case of the former chief executive of the East Sussex Hospitals trust, Annette Sergeant, who was given special leave on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-21">21 June 2005</phrase>. She left the trust on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-16">16 October 2005</phrase>, officially</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/13" class="indent">&quot;to pursue new career opportunities&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/14">in the health service. I do not know the ins and outs of that decision, but if Annette Sergeant was doing a good job why was she elbowed out of the trust? If she was not doing a good job, why was she given a big pay-off and found another job in the NHS? Neither outcome seems to make sense. She was either up to the job or she was not. Will the Minister confirm that Annette Sergeant received a pay-off in excess of &pound;250,000 to leave the trust before taking up another job in the health service? How can that decision be justified in relation to public expenditure?</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/15">I mentioned that there is no reconfiguration of the acute trusts in the sense of changes to boundaries, but the Minister will know about the document produced by the Surrey and Sussex strategic health authority, &quot;Creating an NHS fit for the future&quot;. That document sets out some sensible analysis; by the way, Candy Morris is a very competent person to lead that organisation; I am impressed by her. However, the consequences of some decisions may well be very unwelcome for local communities. The decisions cannot simply be rushed through. In particular, there is a suggestion, as the Minister will be aware, that the hospitals in Sussex and Surrey, which by and large are all equal acute trusts with equal A and E facilities, will in effect become part of a two-tier system, with some hospitals having more A and E facilities than others.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/16">There is particular concern in the eastern part of my constituency that Eastbourne district general hospital will be downgraded, may lose some of its A and E facilities and will probably lose its maternity unit. There is concern that because the East Sussex Hospitals trust runs both Eastbourne and Hastings, some procedures will be delivered in Eastbourne and some in Hastings. That is not satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/17">As local GPs have said, the key issue about core services is that they want key emergency cover, both medical and surgical, at both hospitals, not at one site. I do not believe that surgical emergencies should go to Hastings if they arise in Seaford or Polegate in my constituency. There is also a question about whether that saves any money. I am not sure that it does and it certainly creates problems of its own. The transport implications are significant. I understand that the ambulance trust has written to express concern about the idea that people from, say, Seaford, Polegate or Eastbourne will have to travel to the hospital in Hastings for a particular sort of care. The distance between Eastbourne and Hastings is significant and the road system will not impress the ambulance service trying to get there. It is a single-carriageway road with many bottlenecks along it. The idea that because a trust happens to cover a particular geographical area, its services can be spread out so that only one centre deals with a particular function, seems to me to be inherently flawed, but it appears central to the logic of the strategic health authority paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/18">We have already had some indication that services will be reduced at Eastbourne. My colleague in Eastbourne, Stephen Lloyd, who stood as a candidate at the last general election, fought to prevent cuts in children's services when they were first mooted. The instinct of the trust throughout has been to deny that services are about to be cut or removed, only for that to be confirmed subsequently. It now seems likely that the maternity department at Eastbourne will be removed and that mothers will be expected to go to Hastings. Almost 4,000 children were born in the trust area last year, so assuming that it is a case of half each, 2,000 people will be expected to go from Eastbourne or, even worse, from Seaford or Polegate&mdash;even further away&mdash;to Hastings to give birth. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/19"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1564" name="Nigel Waterson">The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson)</phrase>, who cannot be here today, is also concerned about the matter. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the concern is shared by all East Sussex MPs, including&mdash;I do not want to misrepresent him&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" name="Michael Jabez Foster">the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster)</phrase>, who is one of the Minister's colleagues. I think that he, too, is concerned about some of the proposals. It would therefore be helpful if the Minister gave precise details of the timetable for any proposed changes, where they are in the system at the moment and what form of consultation will take place on them, with specific reference to the East Sussex Hospitals trust and how those issues dovetail with the strategic health authority document.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/20">May I remind the Minister that there is an issue about patient transport, particularly from rural areas such as Seaford in my constituency, if people are to be expected to get to Hastings? In a written answer from one of her colleagues on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-08">8 November 2004</phrase> to a question that I asked, the Government stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/21" class="indent">&quot;The principle which should apply is that each patient should be able to reach hospital in a reasonable time and in reasonable comfort, without detriment to their medical condition&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/22">However, the answer also stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/23" class="indent">&quot;A clinical need for treatment does not imply a medical need for transport.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-11-08.543"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 November 2004; Vol. 426,c. 543W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/24">I accept that as a statement of fact. However, I am concerned&mdash;I hope that the Minister will recognise this point&mdash;that as facilities move further and further away from patients in particular cases, the distance, time taken to travel, need for transport and cost all become greater. All those are downsides in terms of patient care that I am sure the Minister does not want.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/25">There is concern that despite the Government's stated policy&mdash;and perhaps even intentions&mdash;the NHS is becoming more centralised. I have given examples of how trusts are reconfiguring services within their boundaries, and I have suggested that the reorganisations in place will create bigger units rather than smaller units, but the situation is even worse than that. In my patch, there are two primary care trusts&mdash;they will probably shortly become one&mdash;both of which have financial problems. The Eastbourne Downs PCT anticipates an overspend of &pound;7 million this year. What is the consequence of that &pound;7 million overspend? The consequence is that it is delaying references to the acute trust for work to be done in hospital. It is keeping within the Government's maximum times for operations, but delaying them for as long as possible within the Government's framework. That is not sensible for patients. The other consequence is pulling services out of communities, rather than diversifying them out to communities, which is what the Government say they want, and I share that view. Instead, services are being pulled in. The consequence in Seaford, for example, which is a town of almost 25,000 people, is that there are virtually no services in the town, all the immediate care beds have long gone and people who want intermediate care are now referred to Firwood house, north of Eastbourne. That is a long way away, and quite impossible to get to by public transport. Put simply, the NHS service in Seaford is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/26">As I said, there are 25,000 people in Seaford; it is the largest town in my constituency. All we have in terms of NHS delivery is a GP centre with few facilities and a so-called day hospital which seems to me to provide peculiarly few facilities. In September 2005, I wrote to East Sussex County Healthcare NHS trust, as it then was, about this matter and pointed out that in my view the hospital was underused. In response, the chief executive Lisa Rodrigues pointed out how it was used, which was as a base for a community mental health team, and said that there were a number of out-patient clinics&mdash;that number is reducing, by the way&mdash;and some use of the building by older people's mental health services. That is not a great deal for a town of 25,000 people, is it? I have long believed that building to be horrendously underused, and in need of reconfiguration. It could be the basis of a good community use that would take the pressure off the NHS and the acute trusts in Eastbourne&mdash;and indeed Brighton.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/27">I wrote to Candy Morris of the strategic health authority about the matter, and she quite properly took it up with Lisa Rodrigues. I am afraid that Lisa Rodrigues said in her reply that she did not know what the building was, which does not exactly give confidence that the trust knows what it is doing with its buildings. I have asked Candy Morris to look further into the matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/28">What Seaford needs is a new hospital. We need a hospital to deal with minor injuries, as Lewes has; Lewes Victoria hospital has a well-respected unit. We need a hospital in Seaford that can carry out minor operations. We need a focus for the community teams, such as chiropodists, to operate from. The Minister may say that that would involve a spending commitment and that the money would need to be found from somewhere. Of course that is the case, but my argument is that, with A and E admissions going up by 11 per cent. a year and services being withdrawn from communities, that would be a good investment, and it would take pressure off the health service. The Minister's own policy is to have more localised delivery of services, more community facilities and more walk-in centres. I agree with all those things. Seaford is a case in point, as there is a huge gap. A hospital dealing with minor injuries and minor operations would be an important facility for the town and a good use of NHS public money. The PCT has done some work on the matter, but it has a &pound;7 million overspend and is now up to its neck in reorganisation, so unfortunately that work has all gone on hold and nothing much is happening. We are not making as much progress as we should with that.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/29">There is also a problem with boundary disputes between the county council and the acute trust in terms of bed blocking. I have raised that issue in previous debates, as have other Members, including the hon. Member for Eastbourne. There are still 74 people on average in hospitals held by the East Sussex Hospitals trust&mdash;that is 9 per cent. of beds or two wards&mdash;who no longer require acute care and who are there largely because the county council has not taken responsibility for them and found residential care home places for them. The Minister and her predecessors have looked at that issue, but nothing much seems to be happening. For that situation to continue would be a terrible waste of NHS money, so it would be useful if it were sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/30">The other boundary dispute is between different PCTs. Newhaven Downs, which is the rehabilitation centre in my constituency, has been mothballed since last November. It is an upgraded facility that cannot be used, so people are expected to go much further away for intermediate care. The move is simply a cost-cutting measure. The Minister's boss, the Secretary of State for Health, said recently that community hospitals should not be closed for financial reasons. She is absolutely right, but that is, in effect, what has happened at Newhaven Downs. Will the Minister look into the position there and put pressure on the PCT to reopen that facility? Seaford people have lost facilities at the All Saints centre in Eastbourne. They have also lost Homefield cottages and are expected to go to Firwood house, having also lost Newhaven Downs. That is simply not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/31">I have raised a number of issues to which I hope the Minister can respond. The picture is not all doom and gloom, but there are a number of serious problems that need to be addressed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09c.71.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="71"  time="013:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h0070.htm#06050963000602">
	<p pid="c.71.1/1">I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says, but the funding formula takes into account geographical issues and age of population. In many respects, the age of the population in his area, and that part of the south of England, is taken into account. That is reflected in the funding. We consider other health needs as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/2">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not disagree that the average life expectancy of someone in Doncaster&mdash;without being too partisan in referring to my own area&mdash;is considerably less than that of someone in parts of Sussex. We have to address those health inequalities. He makes a very good point, which shows why we have to consider what other services we need in his area to meet people's needs. As we are all living longer, there will be more 75-year-olds in the future. How can we help them stay fit and healthy as long as possible? If I were in that position, my desired option would be to look after myself in my home.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/3">I want to touch on the issues relating to jobs. The hon. Gentleman highlighted stories from his local newspapers in relation to this subject. It is true that the hospital and the trusts in question are considering cutting some posts. The Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust has said that it is looking to reduce the 5,000 jobs at the trust by 325. I understand that it thinks that it can make up a huge number of posts by introducing a vacancy freeze and through the reduction of agency and bank spend and the better use of technology.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/4">The East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust, which also employs about 5,000 staff, is looking to restrict filling around 250 vacancies. I am told that in an average year, 500 posts fall vacant through natural staff movement and retirements, so we hope that the situation can be managed as fairly as possible and without compulsory redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/5">This issue raises questions about how those hospitals are going to provide services, given that they may not fill posts or use agency staff as much as they have in the past. There are good examples of other trusts reducing their reliance on agency staff and better managing their permanent staff teams to achieve good results for patients. Seeing a different face every day because the trust overuses agency and temporary staff is not good for patients, particularly older patients, or for their sense of continuity of care. Of course, there is also an important safety issue there.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/6">The changes to the structure of the SHA and PCTs are meant to help to create a stronger framework for the area and improve commissioning. We are looking at making savings by reducing the number of organisations, and putting the money back into front-line services so that funds can be better spent on the services that people most want. Alongside that, we must discuss what services people want in their local communities. That will be addressed in the consultation later this year&mdash;I understand that there will be discussions on contributions to the document for the end of May, to be published in the autumn&mdash;which should take into account many of the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/7">The hon. Gentleman talked about Seaford day hospital; I am sorry that the person whom he mentioned did not recognise the name of the hospital. It provides mental health services and older people's mental health services, providing three&mdash;sometimes four&mdash;clinics a week. It also provides working age adult services, providing five&mdash;sometimes six&mdash;clinics a week. I understand that the hospital is also used as a base by staff who come into the town to treat Seaford residents. That demonstrates another way in which services can be provided without a permanent base. Those staff use the hospital to support people, but most of the treatment takes place in people's homes, which is a good idea. It is also used by the Eastbourne Downs PCT physiotherapy service, which runs clinics every weekday.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/8">So, I understand that the building is used by three services, involving two NHS organisations, to deal with a wide range of mental and physical health needs. That is a good idea and is to be welcomed. I understand, from the Sussex Partnership NHS Trust that it will continue to use the building in that way and that there are no plans to reduce capacity there. The trust believes that the building is well utilised. I will ensure that the hon. Gentleman's view that it could be used more isfed back; he should contribute to discussions about planning local services.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/9">The work being led by the SHA in partnership with the four local health communities, including the one for east Sussex, is about trying to ensure that local people and stakeholders have the opportunity to get involved in developing the plan. As I said, that will be supported by a discussion document to be published by the SHA towards the end of May. I understand that it is also working on settings for care options, and will consider access and travel issues as well as clinical and economic viability. The SHA expects to begin the full public consultation on the developed options in the autumn. I hope that that gives some clarification regarding the timetable.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/10">The hon. Gentleman made some important and constructive points. Part of the debate that we must have is about raising people's expectations of their health service in the future, as well as what they are used to. Sometimes people defend what they are used to partly out of affection for a service that they have used and partly because it is the only thing that they see in town and they are fearful of what will happen if it goes. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be a constructive and critical friend to his local health services, and a leader in developing discussions about the sort of health services that we could have.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/11" class="italic">It being Two o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
