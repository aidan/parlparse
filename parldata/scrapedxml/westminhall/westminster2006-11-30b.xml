<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.143.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="143"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000251">
	<p pid="b.143.3/1">I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak&mdash;not too long, I hope&mdash;about the report that the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs produced in July on organised crime in Northern Ireland. I am glad to see several members of the Committee present, and glad, too, that the Under-Secretary of State for Nor<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" name="Paul Goggins">thern Ireland, the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins)</phrase> is present to respond. He and I have had several amicable conversations since he assumed his new duties earlier this year, and he is a man who has dedicated himself in that short time to the affairs of the province of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/2">As I said in the House last week when we were debating Northern Ireland matters, the future is not what it used to be in Northern Ireland. Things really have changed a lot, even since we produced the report in July. In July, there was a general air of pessimism about the prospects for the talks succeeding and the devolved institutions being restored. Although it would be a rash man who put money on all going smoothly between now and March, nevertheless, the prospects are better than they were, and it is important to put that on record.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/3">I should also like to put it on record that the report was unanimous. There was not a single Division in the Committee as we discussed the report. We had long discussions as it was drafted and re-drafted, but in the end, it represented the unanimous view of a Committee of 13 members, all of whom attended some or all deliberative sessions. I am particularly glad to see present <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>, who has played a most important and constructive part in the affairs of the Committee for a long time. I hope that later in the debate, he has the good fortune to catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/4">I also pay tribute to the Committee members from Northern Ireland, two of whom are present. The other two, the hon. Members for North Down (Lady Hermon) and for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell), have sent their apologies. They are unable to attend because of unavoidable engagements in Northern Ireland. All four Committee members from Northern Ireland played a constructive part in our deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/5">We launched the report at a press conference that was deliberately held in Armagh because it has much symbolic significance. It is the city of the two cathedrals and the ecclesiastical capital of the island of Ireland, and when we launched the report in July, representatives from all three Northern Ireland parties that play their full part in this Parliament were present on the platform.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/6">The Committee decided to consider the issue of organised crime, because when we began our deliberations after the last general election, it became apparent to all that it was the most important social issue in Northern Ireland. Organised crime in the Province, as I shall seek to describe, is different from crime in the rest of the United Kingdom. In compiling our report, we took evidence publicly from a number of people, and we are grateful to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Assets Recovery Agency, HM Revenue and Customs and others who gave evidence to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/7">If not uniquely, then most unusually for a Select Committee, we were also obliged to take much of our evidence in private&mdash;either in private session or in informal meetings. As the report makes claim, we are utterly convinced of the bona fides of all who met us on whatever basis, but it was significant that many people did not feel able to give either all or some of their evidence in public, so worried were they about the consequences of doing so. The Minister recognised that we had to take evidence in private, much as we regretted it. To all of those who talked to us, we are grateful.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/8">We are grateful, too, for the co-operation that we received in the Republic of Ireland. We went to Dublin and met&mdash;within the walls of the British embassy&mdash;leaders of the Garda Siochana, the Criminal Assets Bureau and others, who were frank and helpful with what they told us, and we were grateful for that. One thing that I shall do this afternoon is to respect the confidentiality of the information that we received during our inquiry. I know that all Committee colleagues who take part in the debate will do the same. It is absolutely crucial.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/9">Crime throughout the United Kingdom is a worry. It is a worry in your constituency, Madam Deputy Speaker, and it is a worry in mine. However, in Ireland, it has another dimension: paramilitaries from both sides of the divide are behind organised crime. I hate using &quot;loyalist&quot; in this context, because to engage in the activities that paramilitaries engage in, seems the reverse of loyalism to me; however, one has to use the shorthand. From the loyalist side and the nationalist side, paramilitaries or former paramilitaries continue to play a part in organised crime, to intimidate individuals and to exert a malign influence over communities. When one delves into the subject, it is noticeable just how far-reaching the effect is. Without breaking any confidence, we saw the nature of counterfeit goods and how skilfully many of them were counterfeited. We met people whose lives had been made a misery by the intimidatory tactics of those who sought, under various guises, to extort money from them.</p>

	<p pid="b.144.0/1">I am very interested in what the right hon. Gentleman says. Does he feel that organised crime in Northern Ireland is a direct consequence of the redeployment of paramilitary forces that were formerly engaged in political crime, but now regard themselves as money-making organisations with precious little political aspiration, even by way of their own defence? Is that one reason why Northern Ireland has particular problems at this time?</p>

	<p pid="b.145.0/1">It is a worry. One witness&mdash;his evidence is on the public record&mdash;from the Federation of Small Businesses, if I remember rightly, said that he was worried that in place of terrorist organisations, two &quot;mini mafias&quot;, as he called them, were developing.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.145.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="145"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000254">
	<p pid="b.145.1/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman accept the evidence provided to the Committee, that we were moving from paramilitary terrorism to paramilitary crime, with the same networks and anti-surveillance tactics and the same personnel, and with expertise in terrorist activity being transferred to criminal activity?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.145.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="145"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000255">
	<p pid="b.145.2/1">Indeed. The hon. Gentleman, who attended almost all the Committee's sessions and met almost all our witnesses, can doubtless expand on that. The description was absolutely right, and it is a great worry. We met people in Belfast and some came over to see us in London. For every reason, some people were not prepared to have their identities revealed. We respected that, and I shall not provide even any geographical indicator. We refer in the report to people who had had vast sums of money extorted from them&mdash;in one case, a six-figure sum over a period of little more than a year and in another, a large five-figure sum over a similar period. In some cases the villains were from the nationalist and republican side, and another case involved the loyalist side.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.145.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="145"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000257">
	<p pid="b.145.4/1">Of course. Then it will be a dialogue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.145.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="145"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000258">
	<p pid="b.145.5/1">Is it not significant that the six-figure sum that was reported to the Committee was a sum that was demanded from someone in the construction industry by the Provisional IRA, and that that was within the last year? It happened at a time when the Government had been trying to paint Sinn Fein-IRA as moving away from criminal activity.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.145.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="145"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000259">
	<p pid="b.145.6/1">I shall again be careful, because I do not want to do anything that could reveal the identity of the person concerned. However, it is quite clear from what we were told that the people who extorted that sum were indeed, at the very least, former Provisional IRA members. One does not necessarily know their current commitment, but that was where they came from, and they certainly used all the tactics to which reference was made by both <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.6/2">In the summary to our report, we said:</p>
	<p pid="b.145.6/3" class="indent">&quot;We are concerned by the control which paramilitaries or former paramilitaries continue to exercise over communities; the fear that this creates, and the consequent under-reporting of crimes in which there is a paramilitary involvement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.145.6/4">That was something else that concerned the Committee. It was clear&mdash;we heard it from some of those whom we met&mdash;that some crimes went unreported because people were fearful of the consequences of reporting them.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.146.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" speakername="Stephen Pound" colnum="146"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000260">
	<p pid="b.146.0/1">May I in passing endorse the comments that the Chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee made about the Committee being utterly leak-proof? It has been remarkable how much confidentiality has been preserved during the investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.0/2">Does the hon. Gentleman feel that there are some grounds for optimism, in that the political and paramilitary criminality to which he refers, which was previously so institutionalised that people even claimed tax exemption for kickbacks, is slightly less awful than it was, because the police are able to concentrate more resources on it? I am not asking him to sing a song, but does he not admit to a little bit of optimism in the current Northern Ireland context?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.146.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="146"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000261">
	<p pid="b.146.1/1">I should not wish to sing a song. That would empty the Chamber pretty quickly. Yes, there is some cause for optimism, and it would be extremely blinkered to say that no progress had been made. The very opening sentence of our report says:</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Although our inquiry was conducted against a background of a Northern Ireland that has seen significant and far-reaching changes for the better in the last decade, it nevertheless demonstrated the damaging effect that organised crime continues to have&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/3">Of course, there is cause for optimism, though I shall return to the reasons why I have worries as well as hopes. I hope, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman does, that devolved institutions will be restored within the next few months. I pay tribute to all those who have been constructive in their dialogue over recent weeks and months, including the hon. Members from Northern Ireland who are sitting here this afternoon. I believe that we have a lot to be thankful for, and to admire, in the conduct of all those who have played throughout by the democratic rules. I have considerable respect both for the Unionist and for the nationalist politicians, as represented in this House by the SDLP, who have played by those rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/4">We should remember that the debate this afternoon would be very different if five Members who were elected to this place were here and were playing a full part in the dialogue. If they were, my optimism would be unbounded. The hon. Member for Ealing, North nods assent to that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.146.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" speakername="Christopher Fraser" colnum="146"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000262">
	<p pid="b.146.2/1">May I take my hon. Friend back to the point that was made about gaining the support of communities? Does he agree that support for the police in every aspect of the work that they undertake is one of the most important aspects of the report and of the current dialogue in Northern Ireland? I refer to paragraph 146 of our report, which says:</p>
	<p pid="b.146.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Comprehensive and thoroughly effective policing requires the recognition and support of all communities and particularly of the leaders of those communities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.146.2/3">The report goes on to say in effect that giving support to those communities, and letting them go forward in the knowledge that when they report something it will be taken seriously, requires full backing from all parties.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.146.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="146"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000263">
	<p pid="b.146.3/1">Of course it does. I have said that many times on the Floor of the House and elsewhere, and I shall refer to that before I conclude. My hon. Friend just leaps ahead a little.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/2">I draw the Committee's attention to another point made in our summary, which encapsulates the sort of crimes that we are discussing. It says that</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/3" class="indent">&quot;Excise and tax frauds (including oils fraud and cigarette smuggling), intellectual property crime, extortion (intimidation and blackmail), drugs, armed robbery and cash in transit attacks, money laundering and illegal dumping have been identified as the major areas of organised criminal activity in Northern Ireland. There is also disturbing evidence that human trafficking is an emerging problem.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/4">In other words, the tentacles of the organised criminal stretch into almost every aspect of criminal activity. That is deeply worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> made a fundamental point. In any country, the rule of law depends on a number of elements. First, it depends on widespread community support. One wants a population that recognises that the rule of law is essential for the proper functioning of a normal and civilised society. Vast numbers of people in Northern Ireland&mdash;the overwhelming majority&mdash;would subscribe to that without any reservation. Unfortunately, however, there are in both communities&mdash;especially in a number of republican and nationalist communities in the south&mdash;those who have not demonstrated that support. Why have those communities not demonstrated that support? Because their leaders have not done so. Community support needs proper leadership.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/6">There is no doubt in my mind that had all the communities and political parties in Northern Ireland signed up to supporting the PSNI&mdash;a remarkable organisation that is probably the most supervised police force in the civilised world&mdash;we should not have needed to conduct our investigation and there would be absolutely no doubt about the outcome of current talks. The biggest stumbling block, to which we refer in the report and to which reference has been made many times on the Floor of the House, is that there is in Northern Ireland a powerful political party, with five Members elected to this House and a considerable number of Assembly Members, that has not yet fully signed up to the rule of law and recognised the police.</p>

	<p pid="b.147.0/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and I do not wish to lead him into a thorny thicket of controversy, bearing in mind that we have avoided that in the inquiry, but if the criterion that he has outlined were the sole one, the inescapable logic of his argument would be that absolutely no crime is committed by loyalists or Unionists, who do indeed support the police. By implying that it is only the absence of a specific form of stated support for the police that enables republican and loyalist criminals to continue their criminality, he is making a point that does not stand up to much scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="b.147.3/1">He could never be mischievous. We know him too well. However, he is seeking to put words into my mouth that I did not utter. The fact of the matter is that of course there is crime&mdash;even, no doubt, in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. There will be crime in Northern Ireland until the end of time, as there will be in other parts of the United Kingdom and throughout the world, because human beings are not perfect. We are all, as the hon. Gentleman knows, miserable sinners and we have in our midst people who commit crimes. The difference that became increasingly apparent during our inquiry is the organised crime and the organisation that is largely, if not entirely, controlled by those who were involved in paramilitary terrorist activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.3/2">If all the parties in Northern Ireland signed up to the rule of law and recognised the legitimacy of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, of course crime would not vanish. No one would be so fatuous as to suggest that. However, it would create a wholly different climate. We saw that and we continue to see it. Even during the Committee's current inquiry into community restorative justice schemes one sees&mdash;we had evidence of this only last week&mdash;that some schemes are marvellous and beyond reproach, but others are worrying, because they are seen as an alternative to policing and control is in the hands of people with dubious credentials. I circulated to the Committee, so that we would all have the benefit of reading it, an extremely penetrating but worrying article by Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a former Taoiseach, in which he made those points. I hope that the Committee will have the opportunity before long of meeting Dr. FitzGerald and discussing some of the issues with him. We need a total commitment and the report points to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.3/3">I shall deal briefly with some specific issues and some of the points in the Government's response. The Government's response is positive and for that we are grateful. However, if I have a criticism&mdash;the Minister knows that it is a constructive criticism&mdash;it is that the Government do not view some of the issues with quite the sense of urgency that we would like. For example, I know that the Government hoped to table a measure on charity law by the end of November, but I do not believe that anything has been tabled and today is the last day of November. It is monstrous that in Northern Ireland the word &quot;charity&quot; is abused and that so many spurious charities have been used as a cover for collecting money that has been extorted by intimidation. That is a real worry.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.3/4">In our report we pointed to the fact that there is a need to license taxis in Northern Ireland as they are licensed elsewhere in the United Kingdom. We have been told that they will be licensed by March next year, and perhaps the Minister will tell us whether there is any slippage on that. It is also a pity that it has taken so long for the road haulage industry to be properly organised in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.3/5">The Government gave a wholly inadequate response to our recommendations on fuel, and they dismissed our constructive and sensible proposals. We acknowledged in the report that if we are to tackle fuel laundering and so on, it would be sensible if Ministers looked again at the harmonisation of tax rates. We said in paragraph 103:</p>
	<p pid="b.147.3/6" class="indent">&quot;We recognise that levels of taxation are not within the remit of this Committee, and we understand that the harmonisation of tax rates between one region of a Member State and another Member of the European Union is no easy matter. However, we must put it on record that it was a widely shared opinion of witnesses in public sessions, and amongst those we met informally, that if the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland could agree a common regime for fuel duty in Northern Ireland and the Republic, they would deliver a fatal blow to those involved in this area of organised crime.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.147.3/7">We urge the Government to give further, urgent consideration to the desirability of introducing a differential rate of fuel duty in Northern Ireland. I know that that would not be easy, but it could be done. I was disappointed and the Committee was disappointed that the Government dismissed that proposal out of hand.</p>

	<p pid="b.149.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is being extremely generous, as ever, and I am grateful to him. I shall not seek again to put words into his mouth, but I am sure that he, like me, is a passionate pro-European who looks forward to monetary and fiscal harmonisation throughout the whole of Europe, as we all do. Is he aware that at an earlier inquiry into the aggregates levy in Northern Ireland we took a great deal of evidence from quarrying interests and, as a result, were able to obtain an arrangement with Her Majesty's Treasury whereby the aggregates levy was not enforced? The difficulty with fuel and fuel oils is the scale of the problem, not a lack of willingness on the part of the Government in these dark days before full fiscal harmonisation throughout Europe. The sheer scale is so large that the Government would find it almost impossible to enter into an arrangement that pertains in some other European countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.149.1/1">Spoken like a true Parliamentary Private Secretary, but the hon. Gentleman signed up to that recommendation in our report&mdash;he agreed with it. We were unanimous and there was no vote on it, so he is committed to it. I have made the point and he has underlined it in his own inimitable way. He is a PPS, but on the Committee he must speak with that fearless objectivity demanded of every member of every Select Committee, and he is very capable of doing so. I do not want to make fun at his expense, but he intervened.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.1/2">The issue is important and I am sorry that the Government did not recognise the importance that the Committee invested in it. However, we are grateful for their general response. For many years, there has been a broadly bipartisan policy on the issue. The very processes that we hope are coming to a successful conclusion were begun during the premierships of Mrs. Thatcher and John Major and were developed by the present Prime Minister. We wish them success. Success will not bring an end to crime; it will not even end organised crime, but it will bring a real reduction in organised crime. If there is true success, we will create in Northern Ireland communities in which the rule of law is accepted, the police have a writ that runs throughout the whole of the Province, and all politicians are committed to upholding the rule of law and supporting the police. I very much hope that that happens during the next few months, and if our report makes some small contribution to that I shall be well satisfied.</p>

	<p pid="b.149.2/1">I thank you for calling me, Madam Deputy Speaker. I congratulate the Chairman of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the Committee, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase>, on how he presented the case this afternoon and on how he steered the ship throughout the inquiry&mdash;with a light hand on the tiller but a full press of sail at all times. We made quite good progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.2/2">I shall respond to a couple of minor points, although, to be honest, most of the report speaks for itself. The key aspects for many of us fell into two categories. The first was a feeling of absolute amazement at the deeply institutional and entrenched nature of gangsterism in so many aspects of life in Northern Ireland. Many of us will have read the letter that Her Majesty's Paymaster General sent to the Committee in March 2006. It referred to payoffs being deducted when computing the profits of a trade, and actually admitted that protection money could be tax-deductible. My hon. Friend the Minister looks as amazed as I was at the fact that it could qualify as a deduction for tax purposes to pay graft to a bunch of gangsters who have threatened to blow up one's building site. That that should happen in the United Kingdom or in any civilised society is extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.2/3">We discovered over and over again that there was an institutional depth to the sort of commercial gangsterism&mdash;it is almost terrorism by another name&mdash;that was taking place. We were led down some strange byways as we realised the extent of the criminality. The hon. Member for South Staffordshire referred to intellectual copyright. Many of us viewed with horror not just the contents of many of the illegal videos on sale throughout Northern Ireland but the increasing extent of such dangerous and lethal objects as cigarettes that appeared to have been rolled from the sweepings of a factory floor in Riga or Vilnius, drenched in mercury and sulphuric acid, packed into a container, sent halfway around the world and then flogged on the back streets of Belfast.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.2/4">As an ex-smoker, I am completely objective about such things. That anyone would buy a cigarette is fairly amazing; that anyone would buy a cigarette of such dubious provenance is even more horrific. But the fact is that people do. It is so institutionalised that I could go into many shops, as I did in those carefree libertarian days when I was a slave to the weed, to buy a few cigarettes and be asked if I wanted any cheapies. It took me a while to understand. I thought it was a form of parrot food, but it turned out to be reduced-rate cigarettes sold from behind the counter. That practice is widely institutionalised. Our recommendations speak for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.2/5">At the core of the matter is the role of paramilitary organisations in criminality. The key question is whether some are pursuing their previous activities&mdash;we can dignify them by calling them a struggle; we can call them any name at all&mdash;under another flag, by another name and for another purpose, using the structures and organisations that they built up during the 30 years of the troubles to enrich themselves and fill their boots now, in a time of comparative peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.2/6">Many of us went to Northern Ireland, visited many people and looked into the eyes of the victims of such heinous crime and trade. What we realised quickly was that for organised crime to exist, not just in Northern Ireland but in parts of this capital city and in many countries, there are certain prerequisites. When a gang preys on people with such a degree of success, certain common factors come into it. Very often, there is a political, ethnic or religious linkage between such groups. One need only look at the north London Kurdish-Turkish heroin smuggling gangs recently exposed in the papers, whose godfathers received two huge prison sentences. That is a group of people with an ethnic, religious and political linkage. In Northern Ireland, for a range of reasons&mdash;we can go back centuries if necessary&mdash;some people perceive themselves as belonging to a particular group or organisation. The fight&mdash;the struggle, as some would call it&mdash;between those opposing groups has taken place over many years and in many different forms.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.2/7">I did not see a continuity of the struggle between Unionism and republicanism in the open-air markets, the back streets, the shebeens and the hucksters' stalls that we visited. What I saw was a business that cannot be dignified by association with a political ideal. Some would say that some of the activities of paramilitary groups during the past 30 years should not be dignified by reference to political idealism. I happen to believe that for all the manifold faults and criminality of many people, there was in many cases an element of political idealism. We can argue about wrong and right later, but it was there.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.2/8">The report spells out graphically what is going on in Northern Ireland. I believe that it will be seen in years and possibly decades to come as the last word on the reality&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.151.1/1">May I, on recommencing, Mrs. Anderson, abase myself before the House and grovel in the most obsequious way, as only a new Labour PPS can manage? I unfortunately misheard a statement earlier with a reference to you as Madam Deputy Speaker. As far I am concerned that nomenclature is entirely appropriate, if a trifle modest for one of your skills and talents, but I was incorrect when I referred to you in that way, and I apologise. I apologise, too&mdash;it is a strange sort of apology, but it will have to be so&mdash;for references to the hon. Member for South Staffordshire as if he were a member of the Privy Council. Many of us feel that his membership of the Privy Council is long overdue. However, having consulted the list today I see that although the Economic Secretary to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase>&mdash;or, as we must now call him, the right hon.

	<p pid="b.151.2/1">That is a point; it has taken 36 years, which is quite a long time. I should like briefly to add my apologies to those of the hon. Gentleman for inadvertently&mdash;although, again, highly appropriately&mdash;addressing Mrs. Anderson as Madam Deputy Speaker. Not being a frequenter of Westminster Hall I had not realised that the rules had changed.</p>

	<p pid="b.152.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentlemen for their apologies. I was very grateful to be elevated to the dizzy heights of Madam Deputy Speaker, but they are correct to say that for the purpose of this debate I am merely Mrs. Anderson.</p>

	<p pid="b.152.1/1">May I say, Ma'am, you will never be merely Mrs. Anderson to us?</p>
	<p pid="b.152.1/2">My third apology is necessary because I have just been told that there is a severe deficit of Parliamentary Private Secretaries in the building, and I am required to attend an Adjournment debate before too long, which means that I may have to leave before I hear everything that hon. Gentlemen from the Democratic Unionist party have to say. I shall try to live with that, and assure them that I shall study their words later.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.1/3">The main point of the report before the House is to provide a template for the future direction of the Government. It is intended not to dictate to the Government what they should do, but to suggest what action it would be appropriate to take. It is also the function of the Committee&mdash;and one that it has exercised with great skill, excluding my own small part in it&mdash;to delineate the scale of the problem. That it has done. If the House were inclined to indulge me I could list the responses that the Government have made to the recommendations. There are many matters&mdash;particularly cabs, charities and the licensing of doorkeepers and door security staff&mdash;on which the Government have responded quickly, with respect to legislation. The Minister will have the same list that I do.</p>

	<p pid="b.152.2/1">I am somewhat bemused by the hon. Gentleman's statement about the Government responding quickly to some of the recommendations in the report. Given that the licensing regime for the road haulage industry is not due to come in until summer 2008; that the legislation on charities was to be laid before the House before the end of November, which has not happened; and that the licensing regime for petrol retailing is only the subject of consultation at present, and is perhaps another year and a half away, the Government's response is hardly swift, is it?</p>

	<p pid="b.152.3/1">The hon. Gentleman, as ever, brings his fine forensic skills and veritable verbal scalpel to the verbiage that I have offered the House, but if I may say so he is being a little unfair. To consider the particular issue of charities, the Minister of State launched the draft Charities (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-17">17 July</phrase>. I think that that is pretty rapid. There was a deal of controversy about the role of independent public sector inspectors general, but the Government should not act precipitately, and they acted thoughtfully and with care. Despite that they introduced the order in July.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/2">The Committee accepted that there had been a delay in introducing a road haulage licensing system, and expressed disappointment, particularly bearing it in mind that the licensing regime that we want has been in place in England and Wales since 2000. However, the Government said at the time, and the Minister can no doubt confirm, that that legislation to bring the road haulage licensing system into line with that in Great Britain will be launched for consultation in autumn 2007. I appreciate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the feelings of the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> about the fact that the system will not be ready until 2008, but these things have to be done with a certain amount of care. We all have experience of legislation that has been rushed through, and we have all suffered from it. This Government are not as other Governments. We do not act precipitately. We weigh the facts slowly and carefully, chewing them over, and masticating at length. Only when we have finally digested the proposals do we come forward with a legislative document, which will doubtless be welcomed by all hon. Members present.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/3">The Committee raised concerns about illegal dumping, and on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-21">21 July</phrase> the Government responded by introducing the draft Waste (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006. I could go on, but I suspect that that might try your patience, Mrs. Anderson, and that of other hon. Members. Overall the Committee has done a thorough, extensive and workmanlike job. It has drilled down deeply, as well as looking widely. As I said, it has produced a document that will stand the test of time, and which I suspect will come to be seen as the first point of reference for future discussions of the role of paramilitary organisations in crime, particularly in extortion.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/4">Everyone would like the Government to do more immediately. There are some things that they can do, and others that they cannot. However, there are many things, particularly in relation to the Organised Crime Task Force, on which action has been taken. I want to end by saying that the impression that I have gained is not just of the United Kingdom Government acting; the Committee Chairman, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire, has mentioned the fact that our inquiry extended into Ireland, and that we had discussions in Dublin with An Garda Siochana and other groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/5">I was mightily impressed by the cross-border co-operation between the PSNI and An Garda Siochana, and I think that one of the extremely positive factors to have emerged from the report is the complete commitment on both sides of the border to the eradication of that degree of criminality. It is a degree of criminality that may, politically, be difficult to prosecute in the Republic of Ireland; however, that is being done with enthusiasm. It is not for us to praise the Government of the Republic of Ireland, but it is appropriate to mention that the political direction that has been given, and the actions of An Garda Siochana, have been extremely impressive.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/6">A great many recommendations have emerged from the Committee's work, and all, with one exception, I think, are being addressed. That is a tribute to the hon. Member for South Staffordshire and his Committee members, but above all it is a tribute to the way in which the House operates through its Select Committee system. I commend the report to the House and, to continue the maritime metaphor that was used earlier, I launch it as a proud, well built, sturdy barque that might be launched on storm-tossed seas, but which has the strength to travel far and has, if I may say so, a happy crew.</p>

	<p pid="b.153.0/1">I rise to speak on the Committee's substantial report but, try as I might, I shall have difficulty following <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the eloquence of the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>. However, I shall endeavour to stick to the substance of the report.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/2">Organised crime is big business in Northern Ireland. I join other hon. Members in commending <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> and the staff who assisted in producing such a comprehensive report. We took a considerable amount of time travelling around Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, taking evidence and gathering information. As the hon. Gentleman said, some of that information had to be given in confidence, because of the nature of the evidence and the potential threat against those who imparted it to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/3">Organised crime is big business, whether it is run by criminal gangs or by paramilitary groups. During the course of our investigation, a number of people outlined specific details in their allegations against named republican groups and named loyalist groups. Ironically, the groups that they named are supposedly committed to a peaceful outcome to Northern Ireland's problems, yet it appears that many of their members are still deeply involved in such activities as running protection rackets.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/4">The extent of the problem is outlined in the report, from which I shall take two quotations. The director of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, Mr. Nigel Smyth, told us that extortion and racketeering were continuing</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/5" class="indent">&quot;at a very high level&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/6">and that counterfeiting was continuing &quot;to get worse&quot;. Mrs. Val Smith, who is a former national chairman of the Road Haulage Association in Northern Ireland, said that current levels of criminality were</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/7" class="indent">&quot;worse than...during the troubles&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/8">That is an indication of the backdrop against which we conducted our investigations.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/9">It is undoubtedly true that good progress has been made in dealing with some of the problems. No one should seek either to minimise or to undermine that. The Assets Recovery Agency has been hitting some of the individuals involved hard. That is good and should be welcomed, but there must be no room for any complacency or easing up of the campaign to hit those individuals where it hurts. Some announcements have been made in the past few weeks about action against one individual in south Armagh. That is good, but such action is long overdue, because that individual is believed to have a multi-million pound racketeering empire at his beck and call. Whether he is pursued for &pound;5 million or &pound;10 million, the final amount will be a drop in the ocean unless he is pursued rigorously, as all the others who are involved in such activities should be pursued.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/10">I am of the opinion, which I hope other hon. Members present share, that there is an innovative and chameleon-like quality to some of those groups. They can adapt and alter their illegal practices and modus operandi to take advantage of any loosening of the system and to drive a coach and horses through any attempt to crack down on their activities. The work is work in progress, to quote some of the people in Northern Ireland who have been quoted on other issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/11">I should like to discuss the Minister's response to our report, which we completed and launched in the summer. In responding to what the report said about the impact of organised crime on the economy in Northern Ireland, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/12" class="indent">&quot;I share the Committee's concerns about the impact of organised crime on our economy, and agree that everyone in Northern Ireland has a role to play in tackling the problem.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/13">I hope that the Minister will outline the extent to which the problem is being tackled, given that it is four months since the report was published. One would imagine that any response would be well under way, and we should like to see the outcome of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/14">In discussing the impact of organised crime on the economy, the Minister also said that he would invite the managing director of the Construction Employers Federation Ltd to discuss with him the nature and extent of such activity. I should also like the Minister to outline, if he able, what that amounted to and what positive plan of action he has.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/15">In conclusion, I draw attention to something that several hon. Members referred to. To expand upon what Val Smiths said, organised crime in Northern Ireland appears, in certain respects, to have been getting worse in recent years. However, there are members of organisations in Northern Ireland in both the republican movement and loyalist movements, but particularly the republican movement, who want to be involved in the Government there. That is precisely why my party and I have insisted not only that all prospective participants in any future Government in Northern Ireland must indicate that they support the police, the rule of law and the courts, but that those who previously did not support police officers&mdash;indeed, they engaged in shooting them rather than supporting them&mdash;must prove over a long period that their change of attitude is deep-seated, and not just grounded in a desire to get into power.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/16">That is why we need to see the report in the context of a changing political environment in Northern Ireland and why we need to keep the matter under review throughout the next period, whether it be of three months, six months or a year. We need constantly to monitor those who say that they are moving away from criminal activity. Whether that work is done through the Independent Monitoring Commission, the ARA, the police or other bodies, we need to monitor how such people are behaving, rather than simply accept a verbal statement to the effect that they now support the law that they broke so frequently and for so long.</p>

	<p pid="b.155.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a vital point about the need to test people who even today still refuse to give the slightest endorsement to the Police Authority for Northern Ireland in tackling crime. Does he agree that such organisations, including the republican movement, still have in their possession millions of pounds of illegally gained assets? The retention of those assets constitutes ongoing criminal activity. Does he therefore agree that, to prove their bona fides, people in the republican movement in particular who want to be part of the Government in Northern Ireland will have to get a move on in giving up those assets and encouraging others to do so?</p>

We have heard much about people's intention to move away from criminality, but we have seen very little by way of evidence. I commend my hon. Friend's comments and agree with them. We are entering a period in which we must test people to see the extent of their commitment to the rule of law. That commitment must be not merely verbal&mdash;something that can be said today and unsaid tomorrow. It has to be grounded in the reality of Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="b.156.1/1">Does my hon. Friend share my disappointment that the Government are not only not seeking an assurance that a commitment will be given and acted on, but are not yet even pushing republicans to give a verbal commitment to supporting the police, let alone evidence that that verbal commitment means something?</p>

	<p pid="b.156.2/1">I am somewhat disappointed that only earlier this week did my hon. Friend and colleague the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland indicate that he would like a Sinn Fein annual conference to commend the issue of support for the rule of law. That ought to have happened six months ago. Better late than never, however. It ought now to be a case of getting on with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.2/2">To conclude, the report is a welcome addition not only to the debate in Northern Ireland but to the collective concentration of minds in the Government and society in Northern Ireland to ensure that, however difficult the road back to peaceful and democratic rule, we must, in so far as we can, rid the Province of the mafia-like grip that has begun to extend throughout parts of the community with the support of those who would like their political representatives to be in places of power. We need a change of attitude and mindset, and the report could add considerably to that. If the Government follow it up and its recommendations are taken up and closely monitored in the coming period, it will have proved to have been a significant report in Northern Ireland's history.</p>

	<p pid="b.156.3/1">I welcome the report and how the Committee decided to launch it. In his speech, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the Committee Chairman, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase>, said that the future in Northern Ireland is not what it used to be. The Committee of this Westminster Parliament was able to launch a report on organised crime in Armagh, the seat of much of the organised crime that it describes. There are fuel laundering plants there, and one of the biggest markets of counterfeit goods was recently closed down at Jonesborough in County Armagh. Many of the godfathers of the mafia gangs that run organised crime scams are located in south Armagh. The fact that the Committee was able to go to south Armagh and launch its report there was therefore very significant. Only 10 years ago, a Committee of the House of Commons would certainly not have launched a report of that nature at that location.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/2">Having said that, the report highlights the fact that there is still a massive terrorist problem. We have to be careful not to divorce organised crime from the terrorist activities and organisations of the past. As I pointed out in an intervention, one of the descriptions given of organised crime in Northern Ireland was that terrorist crime had turned into paramilitary crime. We have to bear in mind that many of the gangs are run by people who were previously engaged in terrorist activity. All the evidence that we were given by the police and others was that those people use the same skills, weaponry, tactics, personnel and intimidation methods as they used in their terrorist activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/3">Organised crime is an extension of the terrorist campaign of the past; we cannot divorce the two. Many would say that the terrorist gangs have simply moved over to criminal activity. Paragraphs 77 to 81 of the report contain many of the comments made by people who gave evidence. Tom Wilson of the Freight Transport Association said that in the past ten years there had been considerable organised crime activity&mdash;in fact,</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/4" class="indent">&quot;more so than ever before&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/5">Val Smith said that current levels of criminality were higher and</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/6" class="indent">&quot;worse than...during the troubles&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/7">The Confederation of British Industry said that racketeering and extortion were continuing</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/8" class="indent">&quot;at a very high level&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/9">and that fuel smuggling, fuel laundering and counterfeiting &quot;continued to get worse&quot;. The head of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs said that counterfeit alcohol was being produced on an alarming scale. Hugh Orde said that Northern Ireland was a &quot;major player&quot; in intellectual property crime and that last year the PSNI had</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/10" class="indent">&quot;seized more counterfeit goods in Northern Ireland than the other 43 police forces&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/11">across the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/12">The problem has got worse: terrorist gangs are moving into criminal activity and that affects Northern Ireland's economy because it affects businesses. Business leaders gave us a lot of information about that. Crime put their costs up, they had higher insurance costs, and it affected their employees. One of our most poignant visits was to Val Smith's transport company, where we interviewed drivers, some of whom had been held up at gunpoint; the families of some of them had been held up at gunpoint. One driver described being held up and his life being threatened on five occasions. As Val Smith pointed out, that has an immense impact on the morale of employees and their ability to carry out their work. The criminality affects where businesses can locate. During some deliveries of alcohol and tobacco, scout cars had to be sent ahead of lorries to ensure that the routes were clear and that any patterns of behaviour showing that a hold-up was likely could be identified. Sometimes former policemen were employed for that task.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/13">Businesses had and have to work in that climate, and it is important that we tackle organised crime, if only for businesses. However, such crime affects communities as well. Again, we received evidence about the activities of paramilitary groups&mdash;they are all at it, loyalists and republicans. They may simply be touting drugs to young people in their communities. That causes social problems: it trickles down into petty crime, which affects pensioners, shops and householders who are burgled as people seek to finance their drug habits&mdash;habits made possible through the organised crime gangs who supply the drugs.</p>

	<p pid="b.158.1/1">Absolutely; the hon. Gentleman has stolen my next point. There is no loyalty when it comes to such crime. Even people who say that they are sworn enemies collude and split the proceeds of crime. They bring in illegal supplies in bulk, split them among themselves, and then use their own arms supply networks to distribute them.</p>

	<p pid="b.158.2/1">I represent an inner-city Belfast constituency, and my hon. Friend represents Belfast in another place. I know that he is all too aware of the problems that afflict the communities. He mentioned that all the groups are involved, whether republican or loyalist.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.2/2">I am deeply impressed by the Committee's report. It is an immensely powerful and significant piece of work, and I pay tribute to everybody involved in it. As I was not on the Committee and did not hear all the evidence, can my hon. Friend say whether there was any indication that any of the groups are beginning to desist from such activity, or was there evidence that this is a continuing problem and that it would take some time to get rid of it?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.158.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="158"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0003.htm#06113062000286">
	<p pid="b.158.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. The Chief Constable said that the crime would continue. He believed that the police could eventually defeat it, but made it clear to us that it continued to be carried out by loyalist and republican groups that in the past were engaged in terrorist activity. Indeed, as I pointed out in an intervention, the evidence was that even up until this year, five-figure sums were given to some of the groups that said that they were not involved in such activities. Six-figure sums were given to the Provisional IRA. It is clear that such groups continue to engage in criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/2">The political spokesmen for many of the terrorist groups complain vociferously about deprivation in working class Catholic or Protestant areas, yet the groups with which they are associated, which they defend, whose members they argue should get out of jail&mdash;many of them have gone back to criminal activity&mdash;are the very groups that are responsible for much of the economic deprivation, either by destroying the livelihood and lives of young people by pulling them the drug culture or criminality, or by chasing businesses away. I took a TV crew along one small section of road in my council area of East Belfast, and some of the shopkeepers came out and bravely took part in interviews. They said that no sooner had they opened their doors than demands came in for amounts ranging from &pound;1,500 down to &pound;100. Some of those who gave evidence to the police and got people put away ended up having to flee their own houses. That kind of thing chases business away, and then the political representatives complain about the resulting economic deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/3">Another effect of such activities is clearly stated in the report. Both of my colleagues made this point, and I cannot emphasise it enough: this type of crime will have an impact on political progress in Northern Ireland. Paragraph 21 states:</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Paramilitary organised crime continues to threaten the stability of communities in Northern Ireland and poses a real threat to future political progress.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/5">I sat in the Northern Ireland Assembly from 1998 to 2002 or 2003&mdash;whenever it was&mdash;and watched political representatives there who had one foot in Stormont and the other foot in all kinds of terrorist activity, including a spy room in the room underneath my room in Stormont. The thing that caused that Assembly to stumble from one crisis to another was the crime and terrorism associated with one of the parties whose representatives sat in Stormont and were even in government. It is important not just to give the impression that there has been a divorce between the IRA and Sinn Fein, but that the crime and any stigma that comes from it is no longer associated with a political party. The only way that that can happen is for those Sinn Fein leaders who have the ability to exercise some control to make it clear to those who follow them, those who support them and those for whom they speak that such criminal activity must stop.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/6">The report outlines several things that must be done to fight organised crime. I shall take them in a certain order. I am sorry that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> is gone. Organised crime is embedded in paramilitary organisations, many of which, unfortunately, are held in esteem in the communities in which they operate. Some of the individuals are seen as heroes, and some of the organisations are seen as defenders. The first prerequisite for fighting organised crime is that the political leaders of communities make it clear that there is no justification for crime or for sheltering criminals, and that communities must work with the statutory authorities, whether they be the police, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the Assets Recovery Agency or whoever happens to deal with a criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/7">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> pointed out in a telling intervention, the report emphasises in several places&mdash;I believe in three or four different paragraphs&mdash;the importance of the need not only for community support but for leadership to persuade communities to work with statutory agencies. In paragraph 145, the Committee states that it is under no illusions about</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/8" class="indent">&quot;gaining the community support that is essential in tackling organised crime and reducing the hold of the paramilitaries&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/9">The next paragraph&mdash;paragraph 146&mdash;tells us one of the things that must be done if we are to get community support. Paragraph 146 states that</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/10" class="indent">&quot;the success of the police in tackling organised crime will be significantly limited so long as one of the major political parties, Sinn Fein, withholds its support for, and recognition of the legitimacy of, the PSNI&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/11">That is crucial, and the Committee recognised it as such, not because some Northern Ireland political representatives asked for it to be included, but because the overwhelming evidence that we received from law enforcement agencies, citizens and businesspeople was that that had to be done. Although the recommendations gave the Minister at least four opportunities to make some comment on the need for political parties to support the police, there is not one endorsement of that position in his response to the report. I find that disappointing and I hope that he will address it when he comes to sum up at the end of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/12">There is a feeling in Northern Ireland and among many of my colleagues that from the time the Secretary of State stood in the House and said in response to questions from spokesmen for the Conservative party and my party that he did not want to make support for the police a new precondition in any talks, the wrong signal went out to Sinn Fein that somehow or other the Government would fudge the issue of support for the police. Even when we discussed the Northern Ireland (St. Andrews Agreement) Bill and the spokesman for the Conservative party tried on three occasions to get the Secretary of State to say when he believed it would be essential for Sinn Fein to hold a party conference, he could not even pin him down to something as woolly as before or after the election in March. What kind of signal does that send out to the representatives of one of the largest paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland who are engaged in organised crime?</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/13">I want to see political movement in Northern Ireland and the establishment of an Assembly. As a Member who feels increasingly frustrated that the Government, with their large majority, can push legislation in Northern Ireland through fairly rapidly and with the minimum of debate when they want to, I would rather see a lot of that transferred to a devolved Assembly in Northern Ireland. My party is on record as saying that it is committed to working towards that goal and wants to achieve it as soon as possible. It will not be achieved, and even the most enthusiastic supporter of devolution will not move rapidly towards that position, if the requirement of political support for the police is not addressed. As was pointed out by one of my colleagues, who have either become bored or have been chased away&mdash;they have gone, anyway&mdash;that means not only a verbal commitment but a testing period.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/14">Not only must there be support for the police, but the police must have the ability and the tools with which to do the job. The Committee made its recommendation based on the comments of people who gave evidence that they feel at times or in some areas that the police may have been under-resourced when it came to the tools that they needed to carry out their job. I note that in the Minister's response all we are told is that the financial commitment to the police will be about &pound;800 million until 2008 and that after that the comprehensive spending review kicks in.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/15">That masks the fact&mdash;I have some knowledge of this because I was chairman of the finance committee of the Northern Ireland Policing Board until I came off it a few months ago&mdash;that the police are staring at a huge financial deficit after 2008 with the comprehensive spending review, the Gershon efficiencies and the cuts that there will be in police expenditure. The extent of that meant that there was talk that the PSNI might have to divest itself of nearly 2,000 personnel and to come down to the levels given by Patten for a situation where Northern Ireland has as much normality as other parts of the United Kingdom. Of course, we know that with the dissident threat and the additional security problems that face Northern Ireland there is not that level of normality.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/16">When I read the Minister's conclusion on that recommendation I felt that he was not so much handing us an assurance as reinforcing the problems that many of us see down the road for policing in Northern Ireland. We need to be careful of saying that we want to build up confidence in the police service and asking politicians to build it up when, at the same time, the police are finding that they have less authority to carry on with the job that they are required to do, because then all that we would have was disappointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/17">First, there must be confidence in the police so that people will come forward with evidence. Secondly, the police must have the tools and resources to do the job. When they catch the criminals, there must be proper sentencing. Examples must be made of those criminals. The evidence that we were given on sentencing was not merely a populist view from people who do not know, although it could be argued that some of those who gave evidence about sentencing might not be as well informed as professionals.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/18">We heard such comments as</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/19" class="indent">&quot;penalties do not fit the crime&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/20">from Tom Wilson of the Freight Transport Association. The former chairman of the Road Haulage Association referred to &quot;derisory sentences&quot;. Officers for HMRC</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/21" class="indent">&quot;told us that on a number of occasions officers had expected custodial sentences to be passed but suspended sentences were handed down and that sentences in Northern Ireland are lighter than for comparable offences in England and Wales.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/22">One could argue that the first two were just ordinary members of the public making comment, but one would imagine that officers at HMRC would have some yardstick against which to judge the comments that they made. They say that in England, Wales or Scotland, people would have gone down for a similar offence to one that in Northern Ireland led to people being given non-custodial sentences. The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/23" class="indent">&quot;noted that the level of deterrent in Northern Ireland is often perceived as lower in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the United Kingdom&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/24">because of the weak sentencing policy of the courts. He was one of those who recommended that we do some investigation into comparable sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/25">Maybe the Minister has had a chance to revise his opinion, but when he gave evidence to the Committee he said that he believed that sentencing was &quot;on a par&quot; with the rest of the United Kingdom. That certainly was not the opinion of the Chief Constable, who is not someone who came up through the ranks of the old Royal Ulster Constabulary and then the PSNI and has no experience outside Northern Ireland. He had considerable experience in the Met before he came to Northern Ireland. The officers of HMRC would certainly have had wider experience, and their view was that sentencing was not on a par.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/26">As a public representative in Northern Ireland, one cannot help but know some of those who are involved in such activity. Many of them walk the streets as if they own them and feel that they are above the law. Sometime, I think, they take the light sentences as part of the risks of the job. It is important that some cognisance is taken of the Committee's view. Despite the fact that the Minister said in his response that it is not Government policy to interfere with the operation of the courts, we have precedents in Northern Ireland for giving guidance to courts to impose heavier sentences for certain types of crime. The report pointed that out: with hate crimes, whether they involve religion, sex, colour or whatever, judges are encouraged to and do give heavier sentences. It is important that there should be a similar direction in the cases of those who are involved in organised crime when they use their paramilitary muscle, paramilitary past, paramilitary involvement, paramilitary tactics or paramilitary friends, because allied to that is the culture of intimidation.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/27">The Committee's next recommendation was for certain legislative change. I listened to the hon. Member for Ealing, North, and I know that he is a Parliamentary Private Secretary and that he had to say all those things and be nice to the Minister, but he was not in touch with reality. He talked about how swiftly the Government have moved on some of the issues. That is not the experience that the Committee had when listening to evidence or indeed the impression given by the report or the Government's response.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/28">Let us look at a couple of the issues. On the licensing regime for petrol retailing, half of the garages in Northern Ireland sell illegal fuel. Many of them have been put out of business and many of the owners are forced to take loads from fuel-laundering plants. Despite the fact that in 2003 the Committee recommended that a licensing system should be introduced, nothing was done. There is promise of a consultation in paragraph 49 of the Government's response and of a licensing system that might come in some time in 2007, but it is likely to be later than that. I hardly think that that shows urgency. That is all despite the fact that the industry is crying out for a licensing system, as are those involved in collecting the revenue&mdash;or not collecting it as the case may be, as result of all of the illegal fuel. We are saying that a licensing system would help and may have saved many of the small petrol retailers. A robust licensing system would at least ensure that it was much more difficult for those who laundered fuel in plants along the border to find an outlet, because much of it is now going through what appear to be legitimate forecourts, but are not.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/29">I note that there has been some change regarding the second piece of legislation we asked for. That involved an amendment to part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to aid the Assets Recovery Agency in, first of all, speeding up the civil recovery of the proceeds of crime. One of the things that the Minister must look at very soon is the way in which even when assets have been seized, they can be used to fund the legal defence of those from whom they were seized. The evidence that we were given was that large amounts of those assets were simply ploughed back into the legal defence. In fact, the legal bills were sometimes so enormous that it called into question just how genuine some of the bills were. Given that the report courageously points out that some professionals were actually part of this network, and I know some of the professional organisations jumped up and down about that, it can be seen that this loophole of using seized assets for a defence might actually be recycling assets right around the system again. There is no sign in the Minister's response that that aspect is going to be looked at soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/30">The third area is the licensing regime for the road haulage industry; something that was introduced in other parts of the UK in 2000 and is not likely to come to Northern Ireland until the summer of 2008. Again, that is not a speedy response from the Government. In the meantime, people who are transporting illegal fuel can do so because there are not the same controls over the road haulage industry as elsewhere. Illegal cigarettes are transported and a whole range of other criminal activities are also taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/31">The requirement for the role of the Charity Commission to be extended to Northern Ireland is also important. There was a lot of interest in that issue in the local media when the Committee published its report. One of the fears that I had&mdash;I did a number of interviews at home on the issue&mdash;was that many legitimate charities could actually find themselves hurt by the fact we had identified charity fraud in a report. People do not want to see that money ending up in the pockets of the paramilitaries. It is important that some assurance is given in Northern Ireland that organisations set up as charities are genuine so that the funds do not dry up.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/32">There are many other recommendations that I wanted to discuss, but I have spoken for long enough. The Committee Chairman has been generous in his comments on the Minister's response. The Minister has tip-toed around many aspects of the report and the recommendations rather than address them head-on. There are some difficult issues here and I know that there is no panacea, but the tackling of organised crime is important for stability in Northern Ireland. It is important for the political stability of Northern Ireland and for showing that we are moving out of an era when paramilitaries and their political associates were able to run the place and benefit from organised crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/33">Every effort should be made to address the issues raised in the report and look at the recommendations that the Committee has made. They were made after due consideration and as a result of much thought and evidence from people who are affected by paramilitary and organised crime on a day-to-day basis. The Government must give serious consideration to the report, particularly because some of those who came along did so reluctantly, not, as the Chairman said, because they were afraid. Many of them were afraid and were very brave to come because they knew that, if some of the evidence given to us in private had got out and been made public, they would have been in personal danger. However, many came along saying, &quot;We have been here before. We came to this Committee when you were looking at fuel fraud in 2003. We gave evidence and nothing happened. We do not want this to be a waste of time again.&quot; People took a chance in giving evidence; they gave us an honest view of what it is like to be a business person in Northern Ireland and the Government have a duty to respond to the fears that they expressed.</p>

	<p pid="b.164.0/1">I have listened carefully to what has been said by hon. Members who are more eloquent than me and who have far more understanding of the issues. As a relatively new member of the Committee, it has been a privilege to serve under <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the chairmanship of my hon.

	<p pid="b.164.0/2">The financial costs of organised crime and the potential gains to criminal gangs are significant and continue to present a threat to the long-term stability of the economy and the communities of Northern Ireland. It is worth spending a moment assessing the size of the problem. The cost of intellectual property theft is estimated at &pound;200 million. Drugs worth more than &pound;7 million were seized by the PSNI in 2005-06. Some 35 million cigarettes were seized during the year, which amounts to almost &pound;7 million in revenue. Environmental crime such as illegal dumping is worth at least &pound;25 million to criminal gangs and extortion probably generates in excess of &pound;10 million in criminal profits a year. The revenue lost from fuel smuggling and legitimate cross-border shopping is estimated to be &pound;245 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/3">The Independent Monitoring Commission reported in 2005 that,</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/4" class="indent">&quot;because of...paramilitary involvement, organised crime is the biggest long term threat to the rule of law in Northern Ireland&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/5">That is something that the report articulated well. Paramilitary-backed gangs have been responsible for some of the largest scale and most lucrative organised crime activities undertaken in Northern Ireland. Paramilitary groups have long relied on criminal means to finance their activities, and all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland have been heavily involved in organised crime, both as a principal means of raising finance for their organisations and, obviously, for personal gain. The disciplined structures of paramilitary organisations have allowed a smooth transition from terrorist organisations into profitable criminal ventures. Extortion in particular has long been used by paramilitary groups as a means of raising finance for their terrorist operations and, since the early 1970s, has been an effective means of exercising paramilitary control over the community. The point about the community, which has been articulated this afternoon, is of great concern to us all. However, there has been a move beyond traditional means of fundraising such as extortion and armed robbery towards more sophisticated and complex forms of crime, such as counterfeiting and smuggling. Those points were well articulated to us during our inquiries. There is evidence to show that funds from organised crime run by dissident republican organisations in particular have been used to fund attacks and threats against members of the police, the Army and the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/6">According to the Organised Crime Task Force,</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/7" class="indent">&quot;extortion remains endemic in parts of Northern Ireland&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/8">but the true picture of the problem is far from clear. The true extent of Northern Ireland's extortion problem is not reflected in the number of cases successfully prosecuted, as we have heard in the past. It is likely that less than 10 per cent. of extortion is reported to the police&mdash;I hope that the Minister understands that. There are also many difficulties in prosecuting such cases successfully. In approximately 85 per cent. of the cases reported, the victims decline to work with the PSNI during the investigation. When the PSNI has been able to conduct an investigation, every case has resulted in the extortionists being convicted, which is marvellous. We must focus on increasing the number of people who report the crime in the first place, and there is a real issue about how that process can be undertaken. What steps are being taken to make the public aware of those facts, to give them more confidence about reporting crime?</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/9">Violent crimes are also a particular concern. The incidence of cash-in-transit robberies is increasing. The use of so-called tiger kidnaps, which were described and in which family members are taken hostage to compel an employee to facilitate a robbery from their place of work, is on the up. Perhaps the most notorious example of that was the Northern bank robbery in 2005. How many tiger kidnaps occur each year, and what advice is available to those who may be susceptible to that type of attack, to help them to protect themselves and their families?</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/10">HMRC has made significant progress on combating oils fraud, as the report highlighted. However, the amount of illicit fuel sold in Northern Ireland remains unacceptably high. It costs the Treasury &pound;245 million a year in lost revenue. HMRC assesses that nearly all its investigations relating to fuel on mainland Great Britain involve individuals from Northern Ireland. A particular problem is the misuse of rebated fuels&mdash;fuels on which a reduced rate of duty is payable&mdash;especially red diesel.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/11">The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee recommended, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire and others said, reducing the level of tax paid on fuel in Northern Ireland to the same level as that in the Republic of Ireland to reduce smuggling. I believe that serious consideration should be given to changing the system to allow duty to be paid on fuel at the point of sale&mdash;as in the Danish model, in which rebates are reclaimed and offset against VAT returns&mdash;rather than at the refinery gate, as is currently the case. Given the health and safety, as well as the financial, implications of laundering rebated fuels, and the extortion and intimidation that often accompany that, will the Minister reconsider his position and conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of that recommendation?</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/12">Counterfeit cigarettes, which were talked about, are a major problem. According to the Organised Crime Task Force, smuggling</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/13" class="indent">&quot;remains one of the most lucrative forms of organised criminal activity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/14">Counterfeit goods are of poor quality and carry health and safety risks. Illegal cigarettes carry an additional health risk because of increased levels of cadmium and lead and significantly higher levels of tar and nicotine. As we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>, they are sold mainly through informal networks&mdash;family, friends, pubs and street corners. What steps are the Government taking to increase public awareness of the greater health risks associated with illegal cigarettes, as applicable in Northern Ireland as elsewhere in the United Kingdom?</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/15">There is an illicit market in spirits in the UK, which costs about &pound;250 million a year&mdash;an enormous amount. Counterfeit alcohol has serious health implications as well. The risk of it being sold to children through unlicensed sources is enormously potent. That factor is important in all that we discuss, because I do not believe for a moment that people are necessarily buying these goods for themselves. They spread them around their communities and families, so the goods affect more people than just those who buy them. We must consider that extremely carefully in any further reports that we produce on the topic. Crime is a community issue. Individuals may be part of the problem, and they may be participating in the activity as a part of paramilitary organisations, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> pointed out, but it is the question how far it extends into the community that is so important to us. Support for the police in tackling crime must go to the very top of the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/16">All the issues that I have mentioned are very important. The figures speak for themselves&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.166.1/1">I know that the Minister understands and fully appreciates the severity of the problem, but what we have to do is to walk up to it and head it off at the pass. Part of that must involve a Government acceptance of the importance of education of the people in the communities who are involved, to enable them to realise that there is a better way. It is up to all of us in Westminster and colleagues from Northern Ireland, whom we support, to articulate the concerns to those communities and ensure that together&mdash;I repeat, together&mdash;with the Assembly up and running, as we all hope and pray it will be very shortly, we move forward positively, not just for sake of the present generation who are directly involved with the problems, but for the sake of future generations, who deserve a happy, safe future in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.166.2/1">I congratulate the Committee on the work that it has done. I think that it took six months to compile the report. I have not been a member of a Select Committee for about five years, but I well remember that serving on such a Committee can be very hard work, especially when one is dealing with an issue as sensitive as organised crime in Northern Ireland, with all its security implications. I therefore pay tribute to the Committee members and in particular to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> for chairing the Committee and for the very competent way in which he made his presentation today.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/2">There is obviously a different atmosphere in Northern Ireland these days. There is hope. Things have moved on considerably. However, the report emphasises something that I have been very aware of since I became a spokesman on Northern Ireland. We hear things over here, we read reports in the newspapers and we see pictures on television of events in Northern Ireland. That coverage tends to centre these days on the political movements and political discussions, but whenever I go over to Northern Ireland and read the local newspapers, I tend to see things that I do not read over here very often. More things are going on than perhaps the headlines report in this country. I know that we can access the newspapers in Northern Ireland through the internet, but if we go over there, read the newspapers and talk to people, they tell us of many things going on in the Province that perhaps we do not read about in England. That unfortunate fact is highlighted in the report, which emphasises the fact that there is a continuing big problem with organised crime in the Province. The fact that the Committee had to take evidence in private from witnesses who cannot be named shows how serious the situation remains.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/3">Although we can all be optimistic&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>, who is not in his place, is an eternal optimist&mdash;I sometimes think that we ought to take a more balanced approach to the way in which we address Northern Ireland issues. As ever, the hon. Gentleman spoke entertainingly, and I wish that he were here to hear my comments. I do not like to make them behind his back, as it were, but it is not my fault that he is not here. I wonder about the wisdom of having on Select Committees people who, although not exactly on the Government's payroll, are closely attached to them. That might water down the independence of a Committee. I do not mean that in a nasty way towards the hon. Gentleman, for whom I have a great deal of admiration. If he comes back into the Chamber, I shall repeat that. The Government should consider whether the membership of Select Committees is as independent as it should be.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> emphasised the great importance of supporting the police, to which I shall return in a moment. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> spoke about the cost to business of the continuing organised crime in Northern Ireland, and very sensibly about the way in which paramilitary groups feed off the chaos that they themselves create. That is an old tactic. We may look back&mdash;the comparison is valid&mdash;to the way in which the Nazis seized power in Germany: they fed off chaos. We should be aware of that happening in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> gave worrying figures about the level of crime and the difficulty that exists in persuading people to report it. I wish to talk about the impact of organised crime on business and, therefore, on the economy of Northern Ireland. I have the privilege of dealing with statutory instruments that come before the House and I therefore deal with many issues and become conscious of the problems of the Northern Irish economy. Yes, there is a lot going on that should be welcomed, for example around the docks area in Belfast, but there are an awful lot of problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/6">The fiscal deficit&mdash;something like &pound;5 billion&mdash;is very large for an area of the United Kingdom that has only about 1.7 million people. There is over-dependence on the public sector for employment, which cannot be good. Although there are encouraging signs, it is a big worry that the private sector is not coming on as strongly as it should be and that the level of economic inactivity in Northern Ireland is far too high. I know that the Government want to address such issues, but the continued organised crime cannot be helping. It could be said that, for the best part of 40 years, terrorism has led to the Province being relatively poorer economically than the rest of the UK, and we must address that.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/7">The differential tax rates between the north and south are a big problem in connection not only with matters that we have heard about, such as fuel and tobacco, but with corporation tax. It is not a matter that we want to get into too deeply today, but it needs to be examined, particularly in relation to fuel. The report goes into great detail on the matter, showing that the situation is getting worse, not better. There is great intelligence and the police are doing their best, so it is worrying that the situation is getting not marginally but a lot worse. One begins to wonder how that decline will be stopped and where it will end. I am concerned about the ability of the Government&mdash;any Government, actually&mdash;to improve Northern Ireland's economic prospects and make it more self-sufficient when there is such a degree of organised crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/8">That is the situation from the economic point of view, which is bad enough, but I must also ask why all the organised crime is going on in the first place. I have always seen the financial, profit-making side of the paramilitary organisations as one of the big problems to be solved. Organised crime and its proceeds must be financing political activities to some extent. I have talked many times in the House about a meeting that I had with the former Member of Parliament Seamus Mallon in his constituency, three or four years ago, before the previous election. He said that Sinn Fein had 200 paid employees working in his area, supposedly volunteers. That came not from the DUP but from a nationalist politician. I do not know about my hon. Friends, but I am lucky if I can get 10 people on the streets. We have a by-election in Tewkesbury today, and there will not be 200 people working on it. There will be 10. I am sure that the situation is similar throughout the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/9">How on earth are Sinn Fein's people paid for? I believe that we have the answer, which is a worrying one. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk mentioned the Northern Bank robbery. It caused a bit of a hiccup, but not as big a hiccup as it should have caused. The Government said that the IRA did it and that members of the IRA and Sinn Fein were one and the same, yet they are determined to propel them into government in Northern Ireland. That worries me. I want to see progress made as much as anybody, and in every Statutory Instrument Committee on which I sit I begin with the words, &quot;It is a shame that we are all here. I wish that the Assembly were up and running and carrying out this legislation.&quot; I stick by that, but it worries me that the people who will sit in government are the very people who knew about the Northern Bank robbery and might even have been involved in committing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/10">Even more worrying is where the money has gone. Not all of it has been accounted for and it could be used to fight the Assembly elections in March. It would be amazing if it were not used for that purpose. I am sure that some of it will be used for personal gain, but some will be put towards fighting the elections. That is not only highly illegal and dangerous but very unfair to the political parties in Northern Ireland, including the Social Democratic and Labour party, which must fight the election legitimately with small amounts of money. We are all well aware of the difficulties of raising money to finance our campaigns, and Sinn Fein might have something of an advantage. That cannot be right, and it makes it more difficult to solve the problem that there seems to be a dual-track process. There is a political track and a paramilitary, financial one. It cannot be right for people to be politicians by day and terrorists by night. That is not sustainable and the Government must somehow find a way to address the problem. I am not suggesting that that will be easy, but it must be recognised that such problems are going on.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/11">That is particularly true because of the prospect of policing and justice being devolved at some stage. I know that the Minister will talk about the triple lock mechanism, but things move on. I have spoken to Sinn Fein MPs such as Conor Murphy who have told me that they are not prepared to sign up to the policing boards until they get that devolution. I do not know whether they have changed their minds&mdash;things move on and people take different approaches at different times&mdash;but he looked me in the eye and said that they were not prepared to do that. Yet all this organised crime is going on.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/12">The report makes it absolutely clear that organised crime is being carried out by people on both sides of the divide: the loyalist paramilitaries&mdash;I regret the use of that phrase because it is a contradiction in terms, but that is the name by which they are recognised&mdash;and the republicans. I have so far focused on the role of the republicans because they are politically represented and would be sitting in government, but for the avoidance of doubt it is important to say that the Conservative party totally and utterly condemns paramilitary activity from either side.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/13">To say that I welcome the report seems wrong because it contains an awful lot of bad news, but it is valuable because it brings to the House the reality of life in Northern Ireland. As I said earlier, I am not sure whether everyone in England realises that everything there is not exactly right. That includes Members of the House who perhaps do not need to spend as much time on Northern Ireland matters as I do. A lot of people say, &quot;Everything is fine there now, isn't it?&quot; to which I reply, &quot;No, it's not fine. It's better but it is not fine. There is still a long way to go.&quot; One great value of the excellent report is that it brings these issues before the House and gives us the opportunity to debate them.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.2/14">The debate has been good-natured, unlike that on the water and sewerage statutory instrument the other day, which was somewhat more lively. Both kinds of debate have a place here in the House. I hope that the fact that today's debate has been a lot more civilised means that we can get more out of it. I congratulate Committee members on all their hard work in producing the report. I note that it was unanimous, which takes some doing with Northern Ireland business. I congratulate them again on their work and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p pid="b.170.0/1">I, too, congratulate all those who took part in this constructive debate. Particular thanks and congratulations go to the Chairman of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the Select Committee, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase>. I thank him for his comments at the start of his speech and for the way in which he led that long inquiry, which lasted for six months and involved a lot of hard work. I congratulate also members of the Committee and the people who came and gave evidence to it. We have heard that there was sometimes a sense of risk attached to that, and I pay tribute to those people.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/2">Notwithstanding <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the remarks of the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase>, I take very seriously the report and its recommendations. As far as I can, I deal with this issue with a sense of urgency that we should all share across parties and regardless of responsibilities. None of us is under any illusion about this issue. We recognise that serious organised crime in Northern Ireland has the capacity to undermine the positive process towards devolution and the peace there that we all want to see.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/3">The Committee has, as ever, shone a light on a part of the UK and on issues that sometimes go unnoticed by the majority of UK citizens and, occasionally, Members of Parliament. It does an important job in that respect, especially given the risk of paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland turning into organised criminal gangs. I openly acknowledge that that is an additional risk there that we have to confront.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/4">The report and its recommendations have been warmly received by all the members of the Organised Crime Task Force. I chaired the stakeholder group of the task force and think that staff in the relevant agencies, particularly those who work on the front line of law enforcement in the Assets Recovery Agency, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Police Service of Northern Ireland&mdash;often at considerable risk&mdash;feel that their work is affirmed and supported by the seriousness of the inquiry and the nature of the report.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/5">In performing its role of scrutinising, the Committee noted that we could do more in some areas and made 59 recommendations. Clearly, we need to do more in certain areas and I am determined that we will do so. I say to the Chairman of the Committee that I intend to update the Committee regularly on our work to implement the recommendations and the outline plan that we have given.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/6">We have heard many of the difficulties described accurately today, but we must also welcome and recognise the improvements that have been made. Hon. Members have been fair in acknowledging where there have been improvements. Three years ago, the Independent Monitoring Commission described organised crime as the</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/7" class="indent">&quot;biggest long-term threat to the rule of law in Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/8">In its latest report, from last month, it said that the</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/9" class="indent">&quot;picture has changed significantly&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/10">and that things with the Provisional IRA have &quot;materially&quot; changed.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/11">The hon. Member for East Antrim alleged earlier that the Government are trying to paint a particular picture&mdash;I think that those were his words&mdash;but it cannot be left just to the Government to make assessments as to whether certain organisations are still engaged in paramilitary activity or the organised crime that funds it. That is why we have the IMC: to report to us what progress is being made.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/12">The IMC has been clear in its reports, particularly the past two, that PIRA has set its face against organised crime although individual members may still be engaged in crime for personal gain. The IMC also says that dissident loyalist paramilitary groups are still engaged in organised crime. So progress is acknowledged but the difficult challenge that remains is also spelt out.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/13">The IMC also said in last month's report that</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/14" class="indent">&quot;all paramilitaries face more vigorous challenges because of the development of the Organised Crime Task Force strategy in Northern Ireland and through law enforcement and the growing use of assets recovery in both parts of the island.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/15">So it acknowledges that paramilitaries are being challenged by effective law enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/16">Several hon. Members, including the hon. Members for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser), for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) and for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell), talked about the impact of organised crime on the economy and the community, and wanted to know what more is being done on that&mdash;even since the important report was published. I can tell them that only last month, after a successful operation by the PSNI and HMRC, 3.5 tonnes of cannabis was seized in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/17">We get used to reading headlines about those kinds of quantities of cannabis being seized but let me share with hon. Members what it means in practice. I was with the district commander for Ballymena on Monday and he told me that the supply of cannabis on the streets in that town has been radically reduced because of the seizure. It means that cannabis is not getting through in anything like the quantities that it was. We should not underestimate the importance of such a seizure in stemming the supply of that drug to local communities in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/18">I shall visit the PSNI drug squad next week, and I shall certainly convey my appreciation of and support for its work. As hon. Members have said, those drugs and the perhaps more harmful class A drugs destroy lives and undermine communities. None of us should cease in our efforts to ensure that we challenge and tackle anyone who is involved in the supply of drugs into our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/19">I am also able to tell the House that between March and September, police seized counterfeit goods to the value of &pound;2 million. I am sure that hon. Members will share my sense of injustice and outrage at such criminality. One can picture a member of a low-income family, in the run-up to Christmas or at a time when such issues come to the fore, seeing counterfeit goods that appear to be the real thing but cheaper, and thinking that they can get something cheap for the family. They buy those goods, and they turn out to be fake, or they do not work, or they are even harmful. Meanwhile, the money goes to pay for the criminal's lavish lifestyle. The injustice is social as well as criminal. We are trying to address that issue with the public and raise awareness in Northern Ireland, so that people reject counterfeit goods, even if they are a bargain.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/20">During the same period, more than 1 million counterfeit cigarettes were seized. That is good news, particularly because, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> made clear, they are even more harmful than legitimate cigarettes. During the same period, HMRC closed down 12 fuel laundering plants, and I am pleased to say that they included several in what were regarded until recently as no-go areas for many aspects of law enforcement. When the hon. Member for East Antrim praised the Committee Chairman for going to Armagh to publicise the report, he made the point that it is important that such issues are confronted forcefully in those areas. Literally tens of millions of litres of illicit fuel are not on the market, and that must be good for the ordinary car user, who will not damage their engine, and it must be good for the environment, because of the damage that is caused by dumping waste products.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/21">The Assets Recovery Agency continues to do its important work in Northern Ireland. Hon. Members will know the case of Dylan Creaven, who recently settled with the agency, and with the Criminal Assets Bureau based in the Republic of Ireland, for &pound;18 million&mdash;the largest settlement to date. I am sure that that will be one of a growing number of settlements, as the criminals realise that we are serious about seizing assets from them. Some &pound;11 million of assets has already been disrupted this year alone, which is 40 per cent. of the total for the United Kingdom. We can see how seriously the agency deals with those issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/22">We must create a situation in Northern Ireland whereby the criminal mind concludes that it is just not worth engaging in such activity. When there is evidence, people will be arrested and prosecuted, and when the prosecution is successful, they will be sentenced appropriately. We will disrupt the criminal lifestyle from beginning to end, and when they come out of prison, we will follow them and see what they get up to. If they engage in further criminal activity, they will be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.0/23">The Queen's Speech mentioned a new Bill from the Home Office to toughen the law on organised crime. It will introduce serious crime prevention orders, more effective use of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and a facility for the greater sharing of information between public and even private bodies. It will facilitate the greater detection of organised crime.</p>

	<p pid="b.172.0/1">The Minister used a phrase about changing the mindset of criminals in Northern Ireland, and that is important. However, England has a similar problem, which is partly brought about by the high rate of tax on tobacco, alcohol and fuel. That is not a criticism of the Government, because the rate would probably have been the same under a Conservative Government. However, the rate encourages people to deal illegally in those products. The Minister may say that they are bad products, which should be taxed heavily. However, the rate is creating a problem. One in four cigarettes in England are brought in illegally, so there is a big problem generally. The problem is bigger in Northern Ireland, because the money is used to fund terrorism and other illegal activities. However, as a country, must not we reconsider our tax regime on such products?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.173.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="173"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0005.htm#06113062000293">
	<p pid="b.173.0/1">I understand where the hon. Gentleman is going with that argument, and we must be sensible about setting tax rates; however, the criminal mind will continually look for the opportunity to engage in criminal activity, make a profit and accumulate criminal assets. If we rely on closing a loophole here and a loophole there, even if we are successful at closing off that criminal option, criminals will simply move somewhere else. There is no substitute for confronting the criminal, finding out who they are and what they are up to, dealing with them, locking them up and seizing their assets. In the end, that must be the way. I shall address fuel in a moment, because it was the one area of substantial difference between the Government and the Committee. In the end, however, the criminal must be confronted, whatever activity they may have been up to.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/2">The hon. Member for South Staffordshire raised several issues about forthcoming legislation. Other Members commented more severely about what they perceive to be a lack of urgency. I shall deal with four examples, and, I hope, update and encourage Members. On charity law, the consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">13 October</phrase>. We received more than 90 responses, and we are confident that the order will be laid before the House before we rise for Christmas. On taxes, we held a 12-week consultation on the draft order, which ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November</phrase>. We received 53 responses and, altogether, 26 public meetings were held with people who operate in that industry. The comments were detailed and mainly positive. We are considering them, and if changes are needed, we will make them&mdash;I do not suppose that they will be large&mdash;and proceed with legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/3">On the petrol licensing scheme, the consultation started in September, and it will end on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase>. Again, assuming that there is a fair wind, new legislation will be in place by June next year. It will be some time before new road haulage industry legislation is in place, but we are still committed to it and a thorough consultation will begin in 2007. If all goes well, we are confident that legislation will be in place by summer 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/4">On top of that, in the Bill that we introduced on Monday, we included licensing provisions for the private security industry&mdash;a major undertaking whereby all operatives in the industry will have to be licensed. There will be a thorough system of regulation, the like of which we have not seen in Northern Ireland. I can understand why people urge us to do more and to do it quickly, but we are addressing a range of issues. There is a lot of work, and we must get it right. However, no one should be under any illusion; we are following through on all issues, and we will deliver as soon as we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/5">Fuel represented an area of difference between the Government and the Committee. The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk discussed the Danish model and asked us to reconsider it. Although there is a difference between us, we have considered the issues carefully. As was said in response to a previous report, the Danish model would be administratively more complex, and that must be taken into consideration. However, a more compelling argument is that it would create more opportunities for criminal activity, because duty would be paid further down the chain. Fuel would go missing from the supply chain, never to be seen legitimately again.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/6">The beauty of the current system is that duty is paid as fuel leaves the refinery. If we were to make the point of sale the point at which duty were paid, any fuel that disappeared between leaving the refinery and the point of sale, would be a lost legitimate sale. Issues of administration and practical organisation lead us to conclude that we do not wish to go for the Danish model.</p>

	<p pid="b.174.0/1">Does the Minister at least accept the need to reconsider the position and conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis? It may ultimately support the point he is making, but it would still be useful.</p>

	<p pid="b.174.1/1">We have considered the matter carefully, and as the hon. Gentleman is keen to follow it up, I would be happy to write to him in detail and give him our information and analysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.1/2">There are strong opinions on tax harmonisation. One view is that it would result in less revenue, and we cannot lightly dismiss that, although the Committee may say that that should be offset against potential reduction of organised crime.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.174.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="174"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0005.htm#06113062000296">
	<p pid="b.174.2/1">Even if there were less revenue there would not necessarily be a net loss. More legitimate sales could compensate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.174.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="174"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0005.htm#06113062000297">
	<p pid="b.174.3/1">That is partly why I wish to make one or two further points to explain our position more fully. However, we do not believe that that argument can be made in this case. In addition, the central principle is that we cannot have different tax duty systems in different parts of the United Kingdom. To do so would indeed mean derogating from the relevant European directive. As I said earlier to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, even if we took that step and closed down that area of criminal activity, the activity would move elsewhere. It is the criminals themselves who must be confronted.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.3/2">It is interesting that differential rates in other parts of Europe do not pose the same problem. Germany and Poland have a 20p per litre fuel price difference; the difference between Spain and France is 14p, and between the Netherlands and Belgium it is 8p. In itself, a differential should not present a difficulty; the issue is the criminality that arises around it. The way forward is to confront the criminal gangs themselves, deal with them, get them locked up, seize their assets and close down their operations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.174.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" speakername="Laurence Robertson" colnum="174"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0006.htm#06113062000298">
	<p pid="b.174.4/1">It is right to say that criminal activity must be stopped. The point that my hon. Friends and I were trying to make, however, is that there are easy targets for the criminals, because tax is so high and so different from the tax on the continent. It is a couple of years since I was energy spokesman for my party, but I think that petrol in this country starts off as the cheapest in the European Union but ends up the dearest after tax. That may be slightly out of date information, but the position will not have changed much. Criminals should not be allowed to get away with it&mdash;there are easy net gains for them in those areas.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.175.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="175"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0006.htm#06113062000299">
	<p pid="b.175.0/1">Of course, part of the rationale for the tax increases is environmental protection. That is part of Government strategy, and if it is linked with the determination, for which there is a coherent argument, to apply the same duty rates in different parts of the United Kingdom, that leads us to the conclusion that we have drawn. The Committee has made a legitimate argument, but in the end it is for Government to reflect on that argument. Although we have taken the recommendation seriously, we have come to a different conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/2">A number of hon. Members have mentioned extortion, including my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North. The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk was right to mention the figure of 10 per cent. of incidents reported. Some would argue that that is a generous assessment of the level of extortion that is reported and dealt with. He is also right, however, to underline the fact that in those cases in which a report is made, investigation takes place and a prosecution occurs, there is a 100 per cent. success rate for prosecution. The record shows further that there are no recriminations against those who gave evidence. Fear of recrimination is probably one of the reasons why people are reluctant to come forward, but in fact it does not occur in cases that have been proved. The hon. Gentleman rightly asked what we are doing to encourage people to report extortion. We have established an extortion helpline and we are widely advertising the contact number for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/3">The construction industry has been mentioned this afternoon. I have had a very detailed and constructive meeting with the Construction Employers Federation in which we dealt with many of the problems that employers are facing. The federation was invited to give information and further evidence whenever it feels the need to do so. We also had a very focused discussion of the problems at the most recent meeting of the Organised Crime Task Force stakeholder group, in which people from the business community gave us evidence and further information.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/4">We are trying to build confidence within the industry to report extortion whenever it is threatened, so that it can be thoroughly investigated. We want to develop the independent private sector inspector general&mdash;IPSIG&mdash;model, although hon. Members may be pleased to learn that we are giving it a different title: construction contract monitors. As far as we can see, there will be a &pound;1 billion programme of public investment in construction in the years ahead in Northern Ireland. That is a huge amount of money, and it is incumbent on us to ensure that it is absolutely free of extortion and of filtering out of taxpayers' money to fund criminal activity. The public sector has an important role, and we hope that the private sector will be able to make use of the model too.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/5">As I emphasised in my discussions with the Construction Employers Federation, ultimately we must move to a regulated and properly licensed private security industry, so that if companies feel the need to protect a building site or an asset, they pay a legitimate fee to a legitimate company, and do not have to hide away secret payments to extortionists, which is completely unacceptable. That is why the licensing arrangements proposed in the Bill introduced this week are so very important.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/6">The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk asked about tiger kidnaps. They have increased since 2005, and they are now running at roughly the same level as in 2004. The PSNI takes them very seriously indeed. Forums have been held involving people from banks and post offices to make them aware of the risks and to identify the risks that can be dealt with if staff know the correct procedures to follow. The PSNI's view is clear: it is important to obtain better intelligence in order to deal with the problem effectively, and it will continue its activities in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/7">The need to develop a greater public understanding of the damage done by organised crime has also been highlighted this afternoon. We are pursuing that objective vigorously through messages about the damage to people's health that illicit cigarettes and alcohol can do, and about the damage to car engines from illicit fuel. Communities are undermined by drugs and by the connection between organised crime and paramilitary activity. All those arguments must be made and must be made up front&mdash;there is no dodging that.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/8">We are working to strengthen our media strategy and to focus it more strongly, because it is important that we get the message across effectively. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-11">11 December</phrase> I shall launch an initiative with a group of 150 school students in the Coleraine area. There will be a roadshow to explain to them the impact of organised crime on their lives, and to explain that DVDs and certain items of clothing may not be legitimate. If it works, as we hope it will, it is a programme that we can roll out across Northern Ireland so that we can educate young people as well as adults about the dangers that lurk in illicit activities. Another event is planned for January with the chamber of commerce.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/9">A great deal of work is going on to try to spread the word and to instil greater confidence in the minds of ordinary citizens, as well as in the minds of companies. It is important that all of us engage together in the fight against organised crime. A short time ago I invited Sir Stephen Lander, the chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, to a launch in Northern Ireland. He undertook a review of the suspicious activity reports that lawyers and accountant have a responsibility to make when they think that money laundering is occurring. The launch was very well attended, and it was clear to me that people do indeed want to play their part in the fight against crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/10">During our discussion today, a great deal has rightly been said about progress since the report was published in July and about the moves towards devolved government in Northern Ireland. I want to reaffirm a point made during the debate and elsewhere about the conditions for the process moving forward. It is clear that two important elements underpin the process: first, a willingness on behalf of all parties and communities to share power, and secondly, a willingness on behalf of all parties and communities to support the police and the rule of law. It is unthinkable that any Government could be established that is not founded on those principles, and it is clear that both must be in place to establish stable, long-term, democratic government in Northern Ireland. We cannot have a casual on-off switch. Those are long-term, not short-term, commitments, and they must be strong and able to withstand the test of time. No ounce of energy will be spared by Ministers or anyone associated with the Northern Ireland Office to ensure that we work towards a lasting settlement with both those elements firmly in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/11">The hon. Member for East Antrim asked about police resources. He probably knows more than most about those resources in Northern Ireland because of his involvement with the Northern Ireland Policing Board. He knows that there is to be a comprehensive spending review in 2007 and that there will be discussions about long-term funding. He also knows the commitment that we have made to maintain the number of police officers in Northern Ireland at the current level until at least 2010. We must do that to fulfil the Patten commitment on the representation of the Catholic community in the police force. We are making huge progress in that area. The police force of 7,500 officers, which is the current full strength, will remain in place until 2010, and we will provide the money to ensure that.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/12">The hon. Gentleman expressed frustration about sentencing. That frustration is not confined to Northern Ireland&mdash;we all hear messages about sentencing in our constituencies. People are outraged by criminal activity and they want punishment that fits the crime. When they feel that it does not do so, they say so. Politicians cannot intervene in individual cases because that is a matter for the process of law, and for judges and the courts. However, when there is organised criminal activity and violence is used, the courts can take account of that when sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/13">I make an offer to the Chairman of the Committee to provide more information, but when we have examined sentencing trends and patterns, we see a situation in Northern Ireland that is broadly comparable with that in England and Wales. I am happy to share that information and we will monitor the situation. Sentencing is important, which is why we have continued to strengthen the law in a number of ways, not least the law covering organised crime, to ensure that punishment fits the crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/14">In conclusion, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire said, wisely, that we will never end criminality, whether in Northern Ireland or elsewhere, but that we should be firm in our resolution to break the link between paramilitary activity and criminality, to make it extremely difficult for organised crime to operate in Northern Ireland, and to make it clear to those engaged in it that they stand to lose more than they will gain if they persist in their endeavours. I assure the House that there will be no letting up in our efforts.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/15">I again thank the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee for its encouragement and the wise words that it sent to the Northern Ireland Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.178.0/1">I thank all who have taken part in this debate, which has been a useful exercise. I am grateful to every hon. Member who spoke, including the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase>, and the Minister. We have had a useful exchange of views and an extremely robust expression of opinion from my hon. Friend, as I shall call him, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> who made some valid and telling points, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1401" name="Nigel Dodds">the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds)</phrase>, who had to return to his constituency before the debate came to a close.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/2">I admire the way in which the Minister has got to grips with the issues since taking office relatively recently. He and I have a good personal relationship, which I value. He knows that the Select Committee is the creature not of Government, but of Parliament, and that it is our duty to hold him and his colleagues to account. He also knows that there are some differences between us, albeit not on the substance or the necessity of dealing with crime; perhaps we differ slightly in our sense of urgency. I know that in Northern Ireland the consultation process tends to be longer than elsewhere and that that tends to create delay, but it is crucial that there is no further delay on the charities issue, for example. There has already been slippage and an order should have been tabled by today. Indeed, that was promised in writing for today, but it has not happened. We sincerely hope that the Minister's commitment to produce an order before Christmas will materialise, because that is essential.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/3">We shall continue to differ respectfully on the fuel issue. I listened carefully to what the Minister said, but I was not convinced. Where I can willingly join forces with him is in congratulating the Police Service of Northern Ireland on many things, particularly the recent drugs haul to which he referred. I also congratulate the Minister on the recent roadshow initiative. I hope that it works well and that the Select Committee will be able to co-operate with him on future roadshows. If we could bring home to the young people of Northern Ireland the appalling dangers, aside from the criminality, of buying noxious substances, whether to smoke them or to drink them, that would be a significant achievement.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/4">I want to finish on a note that concerns us all. The Minister quoted from the IMC's report and referred to the favourable comments about the Provisional IRA, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and it must deliver. Time is running out in the Government's timetable. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>, the Assembly, such as it is at the moment, will be dissolved, an election campaign will begin, and it is proposed to have elections on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>. If Sinn Fein is to have credibility as a democratic party, it must have begun to show that it has truly signed up to the concept of the rule of law and that it has truly and absolutely foresworn criminality in all its forms and the ill-gotten gains that criminality has produced.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/5">It is not just the Minister's order on charities that I hope we shall have before Christmas; I hope that we shall also have a signing up by Sinn Fein so that we can enter the new year with all political parties absolutely committed to the rule of law, and utterly and totally committed to supporting the PSNI. Then, perhaps, we can begin 2007 with a month of demonstration of good intent, which would be an excellent backdrop for a cleanly fought election campaign&mdash;I hope that that is what we shall have&mdash;and the proper restoration of an Assembly and devolved government. It is up to Sinn Fein to listen to what has been said today and to read our report, to which the Minister made kind reference. Then, perhaps, that spirit of togetherness to which my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk referred will indeed prevail.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/6">I thank the Minister again for what he said. I hope that we can work constructively together in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/7" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/8" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at twenty minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
