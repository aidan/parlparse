<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.143.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="143"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0001.htm#06113062000251">
	<p pid="b.143.3/1">I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak&mdash;not too long, I hope&mdash;about the report that the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs produced in July on organised crime in Northern Ireland. I am glad to see several members of the Committee present, and glad, too, that the Under-Secretary of State for Nor<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" name="Paul Goggins">thern Ireland, the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins)</phrase> is present to respond. He and I have had several amicable conversations since he assumed his new duties earlier this year, and he is a man who has dedicated himself in that short time to the affairs of the province of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/2">As I said in the House last week when we were debating Northern Ireland matters, the future is not what it used to be in Northern Ireland. Things really have changed a lot, even since we produced the report in July. In July, there was a general air of pessimism about the prospects for the talks succeeding and the devolved institutions being restored. Although it would be a rash man who put money on all going smoothly between now and March, nevertheless, the prospects are better than they were, and it is important to put that on record.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/3">I should also like to put it on record that the report was unanimous. There was not a single Division in the Committee as we discussed the report. We had long discussions as it was drafted and re-drafted, but in the end, it represented the unanimous view of a Committee of 13 members, all of whom attended some or all deliberative sessions. I am particularly glad to see present <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>, who has played a most important and constructive part in the affairs of the Committee for a long time. I hope that later in the debate, he has the good fortune to catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/4">I also pay tribute to the Committee members from Northern Ireland, two of whom are present. The other two, the hon. Members for North Down (Lady Hermon) and for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell), have sent their apologies. They are unable to attend because of unavoidable engagements in Northern Ireland. All four Committee members from Northern Ireland played a constructive part in our deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/5">We launched the report at a press conference that was deliberately held in Armagh because it has much symbolic significance. It is the city of the two cathedrals and the ecclesiastical capital of the island of Ireland, and when we launched the report in July, representatives from all three Northern Ireland parties that play their full part in this Parliament were present on the platform.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/6">The Committee decided to consider the issue of organised crime, because when we began our deliberations after the last general election, it became apparent to all that it was the most important social issue in Northern Ireland. Organised crime in the Province, as I shall seek to describe, is different from crime in the rest of the United Kingdom. In compiling our report, we took evidence publicly from a number of people, and we are grateful to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Assets Recovery Agency, HM Revenue and Customs and others who gave evidence to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/7">If not uniquely, then most unusually for a Select Committee, we were also obliged to take much of our evidence in private&mdash;either in private session or in informal meetings. As the report makes claim, we are utterly convinced of the bona fides of all who met us on whatever basis, but it was significant that many people did not feel able to give either all or some of their evidence in public, so worried were they about the consequences of doing so. The Minister recognised that we had to take evidence in private, much as we regretted it. To all of those who talked to us, we are grateful.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/8">We are grateful, too, for the co-operation that we received in the Republic of Ireland. We went to Dublin and met&mdash;within the walls of the British embassy&mdash;leaders of the Garda Siochana, the Criminal Assets Bureau and others, who were frank and helpful with what they told us, and we were grateful for that. One thing that I shall do this afternoon is to respect the confidentiality of the information that we received during our inquiry. I know that all Committee colleagues who take part in the debate will do the same. It is absolutely crucial.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.3/9">Crime throughout the United Kingdom is a worry. It is a worry in your constituency, Madam Deputy Speaker, and it is a worry in mine. However, in Ireland, it has another dimension: paramilitaries from both sides of the divide are behind organised crime. I hate using &quot;loyalist&quot; in this context, because to engage in the activities that paramilitaries engage in, seems the reverse of loyalism to me; however, one has to use the shorthand. From the loyalist side and the nationalist side, paramilitaries or former paramilitaries continue to play a part in organised crime, to intimidate individuals and to exert a malign influence over communities. When one delves into the subject, it is noticeable just how far-reaching the effect is. Without breaking any confidence, we saw the nature of counterfeit goods and how skilfully many of them were counterfeited. We met people whose lives had been made a misery by the intimidatory tactics of those who sought, under various guises, to extort money from them.</p>

	<p pid="b.147.0/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and I do not wish to lead him into a thorny thicket of controversy, bearing in mind that we have avoided that in the inquiry, but if the criterion that he has outlined were the sole one, the inescapable logic of his argument would be that absolutely no crime is committed by loyalists or Unionists, who do indeed support the police. By implying that it is only the absence of a specific form of stated support for the police that enables republican and loyalist criminals to continue their criminality, he is making a point that does not stand up to much scrutiny.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.152.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" speakername="Stephen Pound" colnum="152"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0002.htm#06113062000276">
	<p pid="b.152.3/1">The hon. Gentleman, as ever, brings his fine forensic skills and veritable verbal scalpel to the verbiage that I have offered the House, but if I may say so he is being a little unfair. To consider the particular issue of charities, the Minister of State launched the draft Charities (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-17">17 July</phrase>. I think that that is pretty rapid. There was a deal of controversy about the role of independent public sector inspectors general, but the Government should not act precipitately, and they acted thoughtfully and with care. Despite that they introduced the order in July.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/2">The Committee accepted that there had been a delay in introducing a road haulage licensing system, and expressed disappointment, particularly bearing it in mind that the licensing regime that we want has been in place in England and Wales since 2000. However, the Government said at the time, and the Minister can no doubt confirm, that that legislation to bring the road haulage licensing system into line with that in Great Britain will be launched for consultation in autumn 2007. I appreciate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the feelings of the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> about the fact that the system will not be ready until 2008, but these things have to be done with a certain amount of care. We all have experience of legislation that has been rushed through, and we have all suffered from it. This Government are not as other Governments. We do not act precipitately. We weigh the facts slowly and carefully, chewing them over, and masticating at length. Only when we have finally digested the proposals do we come forward with a legislative document, which will doubtless be welcomed by all hon. Members present.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/3">The Committee raised concerns about illegal dumping, and on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-21">21 July</phrase> the Government responded by introducing the draft Waste (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006. I could go on, but I suspect that that might try your patience, Mrs. Anderson, and that of other hon. Members. Overall the Committee has done a thorough, extensive and workmanlike job. It has drilled down deeply, as well as looking widely. As I said, it has produced a document that will stand the test of time, and which I suspect will come to be seen as the first point of reference for future discussions of the role of paramilitary organisations in crime, particularly in extortion.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/4">Everyone would like the Government to do more immediately. There are some things that they can do, and others that they cannot. However, there are many things, particularly in relation to the Organised Crime Task Force, on which action has been taken. I want to end by saying that the impression that I have gained is not just of the United Kingdom Government acting; the Committee Chairman, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire, has mentioned the fact that our inquiry extended into Ireland, and that we had discussions in Dublin with An Garda Siochana and other groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/5">I was mightily impressed by the cross-border co-operation between the PSNI and An Garda Siochana, and I think that one of the extremely positive factors to have emerged from the report is the complete commitment on both sides of the border to the eradication of that degree of criminality. It is a degree of criminality that may, politically, be difficult to prosecute in the Republic of Ireland; however, that is being done with enthusiasm. It is not for us to praise the Government of the Republic of Ireland, but it is appropriate to mention that the political direction that has been given, and the actions of An Garda Siochana, have been extremely impressive.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.3/6">A great many recommendations have emerged from the Committee's work, and all, with one exception, I think, are being addressed. That is a tribute to the hon. Member for South Staffordshire and his Committee members, but above all it is a tribute to the way in which the House operates through its Select Committee system. I commend the report to the House and, to continue the maritime metaphor that was used earlier, I launch it as a proud, well built, sturdy barque that might be launched on storm-tossed seas, but which has the strength to travel far and has, if I may say so, a happy crew.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.153.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" speakername="Gregory Campbell" colnum="153"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0002.htm#06113062000277">
	<p pid="b.153.0/1">I rise to speak on the Committee's substantial report but, try as I might, I shall have difficulty following <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the eloquence of the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>. However, I shall endeavour to stick to the substance of the report.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/2">Organised crime is big business in Northern Ireland. I join other hon. Members in commending <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> and the staff who assisted in producing such a comprehensive report. We took a considerable amount of time travelling around Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, taking evidence and gathering information. As the hon. Gentleman said, some of that information had to be given in confidence, because of the nature of the evidence and the potential threat against those who imparted it to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/3">Organised crime is big business, whether it is run by criminal gangs or by paramilitary groups. During the course of our investigation, a number of people outlined specific details in their allegations against named republican groups and named loyalist groups. Ironically, the groups that they named are supposedly committed to a peaceful outcome to Northern Ireland's problems, yet it appears that many of their members are still deeply involved in such activities as running protection rackets.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/4">The extent of the problem is outlined in the report, from which I shall take two quotations. The director of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, Mr. Nigel Smyth, told us that extortion and racketeering were continuing</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/5" class="indent">&quot;at a very high level&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/6">and that counterfeiting was continuing &quot;to get worse&quot;. Mrs. Val Smith, who is a former national chairman of the Road Haulage Association in Northern Ireland, said that current levels of criminality were</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/7" class="indent">&quot;worse than...during the troubles&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/8">That is an indication of the backdrop against which we conducted our investigations.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/9">It is undoubtedly true that good progress has been made in dealing with some of the problems. No one should seek either to minimise or to undermine that. The Assets Recovery Agency has been hitting some of the individuals involved hard. That is good and should be welcomed, but there must be no room for any complacency or easing up of the campaign to hit those individuals where it hurts. Some announcements have been made in the past few weeks about action against one individual in south Armagh. That is good, but such action is long overdue, because that individual is believed to have a multi-million pound racketeering empire at his beck and call. Whether he is pursued for &pound;5 million or &pound;10 million, the final amount will be a drop in the ocean unless he is pursued rigorously, as all the others who are involved in such activities should be pursued.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/10">I am of the opinion, which I hope other hon. Members present share, that there is an innovative and chameleon-like quality to some of those groups. They can adapt and alter their illegal practices and modus operandi to take advantage of any loosening of the system and to drive a coach and horses through any attempt to crack down on their activities. The work is work in progress, to quote some of the people in Northern Ireland who have been quoted on other issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/11">I should like to discuss the Minister's response to our report, which we completed and launched in the summer. In responding to what the report said about the impact of organised crime on the economy in Northern Ireland, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/12" class="indent">&quot;I share the Committee's concerns about the impact of organised crime on our economy, and agree that everyone in Northern Ireland has a role to play in tackling the problem.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/13">I hope that the Minister will outline the extent to which the problem is being tackled, given that it is four months since the report was published. One would imagine that any response would be well under way, and we should like to see the outcome of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/14">In discussing the impact of organised crime on the economy, the Minister also said that he would invite the managing director of the Construction Employers Federation Ltd to discuss with him the nature and extent of such activity. I should also like the Minister to outline, if he able, what that amounted to and what positive plan of action he has.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/15">In conclusion, I draw attention to something that several hon. Members referred to. To expand upon what Val Smiths said, organised crime in Northern Ireland appears, in certain respects, to have been getting worse in recent years. However, there are members of organisations in Northern Ireland in both the republican movement and loyalist movements, but particularly the republican movement, who want to be involved in the Government there. That is precisely why my party and I have insisted not only that all prospective participants in any future Government in Northern Ireland must indicate that they support the police, the rule of law and the courts, but that those who previously did not support police officers&mdash;indeed, they engaged in shooting them rather than supporting them&mdash;must prove over a long period that their change of attitude is deep-seated, and not just grounded in a desire to get into power.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/16">That is why we need to see the report in the context of a changing political environment in Northern Ireland and why we need to keep the matter under review throughout the next period, whether it be of three months, six months or a year. We need constantly to monitor those who say that they are moving away from criminal activity. Whether that work is done through the Independent Monitoring Commission, the ARA, the police or other bodies, we need to monitor how such people are behaving, rather than simply accept a verbal statement to the effect that they now support the law that they broke so frequently and for so long.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.156.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="156"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0003.htm#06113062000282">
	<p pid="b.156.3/1">I welcome the report and how the Committee decided to launch it. In his speech, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the Committee Chairman, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase>, said that the future in Northern Ireland is not what it used to be. The Committee of this Westminster Parliament was able to launch a report on organised crime in Armagh, the seat of much of the organised crime that it describes. There are fuel laundering plants there, and one of the biggest markets of counterfeit goods was recently closed down at Jonesborough in County Armagh. Many of the godfathers of the mafia gangs that run organised crime scams are located in south Armagh. The fact that the Committee was able to go to south Armagh and launch its report there was therefore very significant. Only 10 years ago, a Committee of the House of Commons would certainly not have launched a report of that nature at that location.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/2">Having said that, the report highlights the fact that there is still a massive terrorist problem. We have to be careful not to divorce organised crime from the terrorist activities and organisations of the past. As I pointed out in an intervention, one of the descriptions given of organised crime in Northern Ireland was that terrorist crime had turned into paramilitary crime. We have to bear in mind that many of the gangs are run by people who were previously engaged in terrorist activity. All the evidence that we were given by the police and others was that those people use the same skills, weaponry, tactics, personnel and intimidation methods as they used in their terrorist activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/3">Organised crime is an extension of the terrorist campaign of the past; we cannot divorce the two. Many would say that the terrorist gangs have simply moved over to criminal activity. Paragraphs 77 to 81 of the report contain many of the comments made by people who gave evidence. Tom Wilson of the Freight Transport Association said that in the past ten years there had been considerable organised crime activity&mdash;in fact,</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/4" class="indent">&quot;more so than ever before&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/5">Val Smith said that current levels of criminality were higher and</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/6" class="indent">&quot;worse than...during the troubles&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/7">The Confederation of British Industry said that racketeering and extortion were continuing</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/8" class="indent">&quot;at a very high level&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/9">and that fuel smuggling, fuel laundering and counterfeiting &quot;continued to get worse&quot;. The head of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs said that counterfeit alcohol was being produced on an alarming scale. Hugh Orde said that Northern Ireland was a &quot;major player&quot; in intellectual property crime and that last year the PSNI had</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/10" class="indent">&quot;seized more counterfeit goods in Northern Ireland than the other 43 police forces&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/11">across the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/12">The problem has got worse: terrorist gangs are moving into criminal activity and that affects Northern Ireland's economy because it affects businesses. Business leaders gave us a lot of information about that. Crime put their costs up, they had higher insurance costs, and it affected their employees. One of our most poignant visits was to Val Smith's transport company, where we interviewed drivers, some of whom had been held up at gunpoint; the families of some of them had been held up at gunpoint. One driver described being held up and his life being threatened on five occasions. As Val Smith pointed out, that has an immense impact on the morale of employees and their ability to carry out their work. The criminality affects where businesses can locate. During some deliveries of alcohol and tobacco, scout cars had to be sent ahead of lorries to ensure that the routes were clear and that any patterns of behaviour showing that a hold-up was likely could be identified. Sometimes former policemen were employed for that task.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.3/13">Businesses had and have to work in that climate, and it is important that we tackle organised crime, if only for businesses. However, such crime affects communities as well. Again, we received evidence about the activities of paramilitary groups&mdash;they are all at it, loyalists and republicans. They may simply be touting drugs to young people in their communities. That causes social problems: it trickles down into petty crime, which affects pensioners, shops and householders who are burgled as people seek to finance their drug habits&mdash;habits made possible through the organised crime gangs who supply the drugs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.158.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="158"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0003.htm#06113062000286">
	<p pid="b.158.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. The Chief Constable said that the crime would continue. He believed that the police could eventually defeat it, but made it clear to us that it continued to be carried out by loyalist and republican groups that in the past were engaged in terrorist activity. Indeed, as I pointed out in an intervention, the evidence was that even up until this year, five-figure sums were given to some of the groups that said that they were not involved in such activities. Six-figure sums were given to the Provisional IRA. It is clear that such groups continue to engage in criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/2">The political spokesmen for many of the terrorist groups complain vociferously about deprivation in working class Catholic or Protestant areas, yet the groups with which they are associated, which they defend, whose members they argue should get out of jail&mdash;many of them have gone back to criminal activity&mdash;are the very groups that are responsible for much of the economic deprivation, either by destroying the livelihood and lives of young people by pulling them the drug culture or criminality, or by chasing businesses away. I took a TV crew along one small section of road in my council area of East Belfast, and some of the shopkeepers came out and bravely took part in interviews. They said that no sooner had they opened their doors than demands came in for amounts ranging from &pound;1,500 down to &pound;100. Some of those who gave evidence to the police and got people put away ended up having to flee their own houses. That kind of thing chases business away, and then the political representatives complain about the resulting economic deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/3">Another effect of such activities is clearly stated in the report. Both of my colleagues made this point, and I cannot emphasise it enough: this type of crime will have an impact on political progress in Northern Ireland. Paragraph 21 states:</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Paramilitary organised crime continues to threaten the stability of communities in Northern Ireland and poses a real threat to future political progress.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/5">I sat in the Northern Ireland Assembly from 1998 to 2002 or 2003&mdash;whenever it was&mdash;and watched political representatives there who had one foot in Stormont and the other foot in all kinds of terrorist activity, including a spy room in the room underneath my room in Stormont. The thing that caused that Assembly to stumble from one crisis to another was the crime and terrorism associated with one of the parties whose representatives sat in Stormont and were even in government. It is important not just to give the impression that there has been a divorce between the IRA and Sinn Fein, but that the crime and any stigma that comes from it is no longer associated with a political party. The only way that that can happen is for those Sinn Fein leaders who have the ability to exercise some control to make it clear to those who follow them, those who support them and those for whom they speak that such criminal activity must stop.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/6">The report outlines several things that must be done to fight organised crime. I shall take them in a certain order. I am sorry that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> is gone. Organised crime is embedded in paramilitary organisations, many of which, unfortunately, are held in esteem in the communities in which they operate. Some of the individuals are seen as heroes, and some of the organisations are seen as defenders. The first prerequisite for fighting organised crime is that the political leaders of communities make it clear that there is no justification for crime or for sheltering criminals, and that communities must work with the statutory authorities, whether they be the police, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the Assets Recovery Agency or whoever happens to deal with a criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/7">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> pointed out in a telling intervention, the report emphasises in several places&mdash;I believe in three or four different paragraphs&mdash;the importance of the need not only for community support but for leadership to persuade communities to work with statutory agencies. In paragraph 145, the Committee states that it is under no illusions about</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/8" class="indent">&quot;gaining the community support that is essential in tackling organised crime and reducing the hold of the paramilitaries&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/9">The next paragraph&mdash;paragraph 146&mdash;tells us one of the things that must be done if we are to get community support. Paragraph 146 states that</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/10" class="indent">&quot;the success of the police in tackling organised crime will be significantly limited so long as one of the major political parties, Sinn Fein, withholds its support for, and recognition of the legitimacy of, the PSNI&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/11">That is crucial, and the Committee recognised it as such, not because some Northern Ireland political representatives asked for it to be included, but because the overwhelming evidence that we received from law enforcement agencies, citizens and businesspeople was that that had to be done. Although the recommendations gave the Minister at least four opportunities to make some comment on the need for political parties to support the police, there is not one endorsement of that position in his response to the report. I find that disappointing and I hope that he will address it when he comes to sum up at the end of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/12">There is a feeling in Northern Ireland and among many of my colleagues that from the time the Secretary of State stood in the House and said in response to questions from spokesmen for the Conservative party and my party that he did not want to make support for the police a new precondition in any talks, the wrong signal went out to Sinn Fein that somehow or other the Government would fudge the issue of support for the police. Even when we discussed the Northern Ireland (St. Andrews Agreement) Bill and the spokesman for the Conservative party tried on three occasions to get the Secretary of State to say when he believed it would be essential for Sinn Fein to hold a party conference, he could not even pin him down to something as woolly as before or after the election in March. What kind of signal does that send out to the representatives of one of the largest paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland who are engaged in organised crime?</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/13">I want to see political movement in Northern Ireland and the establishment of an Assembly. As a Member who feels increasingly frustrated that the Government, with their large majority, can push legislation in Northern Ireland through fairly rapidly and with the minimum of debate when they want to, I would rather see a lot of that transferred to a devolved Assembly in Northern Ireland. My party is on record as saying that it is committed to working towards that goal and wants to achieve it as soon as possible. It will not be achieved, and even the most enthusiastic supporter of devolution will not move rapidly towards that position, if the requirement of political support for the police is not addressed. As was pointed out by one of my colleagues, who have either become bored or have been chased away&mdash;they have gone, anyway&mdash;that means not only a verbal commitment but a testing period.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/14">Not only must there be support for the police, but the police must have the ability and the tools with which to do the job. The Committee made its recommendation based on the comments of people who gave evidence that they feel at times or in some areas that the police may have been under-resourced when it came to the tools that they needed to carry out their job. I note that in the Minister's response all we are told is that the financial commitment to the police will be about &pound;800 million until 2008 and that after that the comprehensive spending review kicks in.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/15">That masks the fact&mdash;I have some knowledge of this because I was chairman of the finance committee of the Northern Ireland Policing Board until I came off it a few months ago&mdash;that the police are staring at a huge financial deficit after 2008 with the comprehensive spending review, the Gershon efficiencies and the cuts that there will be in police expenditure. The extent of that meant that there was talk that the PSNI might have to divest itself of nearly 2,000 personnel and to come down to the levels given by Patten for a situation where Northern Ireland has as much normality as other parts of the United Kingdom. Of course, we know that with the dissident threat and the additional security problems that face Northern Ireland there is not that level of normality.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/16">When I read the Minister's conclusion on that recommendation I felt that he was not so much handing us an assurance as reinforcing the problems that many of us see down the road for policing in Northern Ireland. We need to be careful of saying that we want to build up confidence in the police service and asking politicians to build it up when, at the same time, the police are finding that they have less authority to carry on with the job that they are required to do, because then all that we would have was disappointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/17">First, there must be confidence in the police so that people will come forward with evidence. Secondly, the police must have the tools and resources to do the job. When they catch the criminals, there must be proper sentencing. Examples must be made of those criminals. The evidence that we were given on sentencing was not merely a populist view from people who do not know, although it could be argued that some of those who gave evidence about sentencing might not be as well informed as professionals.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/18">We heard such comments as</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/19" class="indent">&quot;penalties do not fit the crime&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/20">from Tom Wilson of the Freight Transport Association. The former chairman of the Road Haulage Association referred to &quot;derisory sentences&quot;. Officers for HMRC</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/21" class="indent">&quot;told us that on a number of occasions officers had expected custodial sentences to be passed but suspended sentences were handed down and that sentences in Northern Ireland are lighter than for comparable offences in England and Wales.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/22">One could argue that the first two were just ordinary members of the public making comment, but one would imagine that officers at HMRC would have some yardstick against which to judge the comments that they made. They say that in England, Wales or Scotland, people would have gone down for a similar offence to one that in Northern Ireland led to people being given non-custodial sentences. The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/23" class="indent">&quot;noted that the level of deterrent in Northern Ireland is often perceived as lower in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the United Kingdom&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/24">because of the weak sentencing policy of the courts. He was one of those who recommended that we do some investigation into comparable sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/25">Maybe the Minister has had a chance to revise his opinion, but when he gave evidence to the Committee he said that he believed that sentencing was &quot;on a par&quot; with the rest of the United Kingdom. That certainly was not the opinion of the Chief Constable, who is not someone who came up through the ranks of the old Royal Ulster Constabulary and then the PSNI and has no experience outside Northern Ireland. He had considerable experience in the Met before he came to Northern Ireland. The officers of HMRC would certainly have had wider experience, and their view was that sentencing was not on a par.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/26">As a public representative in Northern Ireland, one cannot help but know some of those who are involved in such activity. Many of them walk the streets as if they own them and feel that they are above the law. Sometime, I think, they take the light sentences as part of the risks of the job. It is important that some cognisance is taken of the Committee's view. Despite the fact that the Minister said in his response that it is not Government policy to interfere with the operation of the courts, we have precedents in Northern Ireland for giving guidance to courts to impose heavier sentences for certain types of crime. The report pointed that out: with hate crimes, whether they involve religion, sex, colour or whatever, judges are encouraged to and do give heavier sentences. It is important that there should be a similar direction in the cases of those who are involved in organised crime when they use their paramilitary muscle, paramilitary past, paramilitary involvement, paramilitary tactics or paramilitary friends, because allied to that is the culture of intimidation.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/27">The Committee's next recommendation was for certain legislative change. I listened to the hon. Member for Ealing, North, and I know that he is a Parliamentary Private Secretary and that he had to say all those things and be nice to the Minister, but he was not in touch with reality. He talked about how swiftly the Government have moved on some of the issues. That is not the experience that the Committee had when listening to evidence or indeed the impression given by the report or the Government's response.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/28">Let us look at a couple of the issues. On the licensing regime for petrol retailing, half of the garages in Northern Ireland sell illegal fuel. Many of them have been put out of business and many of the owners are forced to take loads from fuel-laundering plants. Despite the fact that in 2003 the Committee recommended that a licensing system should be introduced, nothing was done. There is promise of a consultation in paragraph 49 of the Government's response and of a licensing system that might come in some time in 2007, but it is likely to be later than that. I hardly think that that shows urgency. That is all despite the fact that the industry is crying out for a licensing system, as are those involved in collecting the revenue&mdash;or not collecting it as the case may be, as result of all of the illegal fuel. We are saying that a licensing system would help and may have saved many of the small petrol retailers. A robust licensing system would at least ensure that it was much more difficult for those who laundered fuel in plants along the border to find an outlet, because much of it is now going through what appear to be legitimate forecourts, but are not.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/29">I note that there has been some change regarding the second piece of legislation we asked for. That involved an amendment to part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to aid the Assets Recovery Agency in, first of all, speeding up the civil recovery of the proceeds of crime. One of the things that the Minister must look at very soon is the way in which even when assets have been seized, they can be used to fund the legal defence of those from whom they were seized. The evidence that we were given was that large amounts of those assets were simply ploughed back into the legal defence. In fact, the legal bills were sometimes so enormous that it called into question just how genuine some of the bills were. Given that the report courageously points out that some professionals were actually part of this network, and I know some of the professional organisations jumped up and down about that, it can be seen that this loophole of using seized assets for a defence might actually be recycling assets right around the system again. There is no sign in the Minister's response that that aspect is going to be looked at soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/30">The third area is the licensing regime for the road haulage industry; something that was introduced in other parts of the UK in 2000 and is not likely to come to Northern Ireland until the summer of 2008. Again, that is not a speedy response from the Government. In the meantime, people who are transporting illegal fuel can do so because there are not the same controls over the road haulage industry as elsewhere. Illegal cigarettes are transported and a whole range of other criminal activities are also taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/31">The requirement for the role of the Charity Commission to be extended to Northern Ireland is also important. There was a lot of interest in that issue in the local media when the Committee published its report. One of the fears that I had&mdash;I did a number of interviews at home on the issue&mdash;was that many legitimate charities could actually find themselves hurt by the fact we had identified charity fraud in a report. People do not want to see that money ending up in the pockets of the paramilitaries. It is important that some assurance is given in Northern Ireland that organisations set up as charities are genuine so that the funds do not dry up.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/32">There are many other recommendations that I wanted to discuss, but I have spoken for long enough. The Committee Chairman has been generous in his comments on the Minister's response. The Minister has tip-toed around many aspects of the report and the recommendations rather than address them head-on. There are some difficult issues here and I know that there is no panacea, but the tackling of organised crime is important for stability in Northern Ireland. It is important for the political stability of Northern Ireland and for showing that we are moving out of an era when paramilitaries and their political associates were able to run the place and benefit from organised crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.158.3/33">Every effort should be made to address the issues raised in the report and look at the recommendations that the Committee has made. They were made after due consideration and as a result of much thought and evidence from people who are affected by paramilitary and organised crime on a day-to-day basis. The Government must give serious consideration to the report, particularly because some of those who came along did so reluctantly, not, as the Chairman said, because they were afraid. Many of them were afraid and were very brave to come because they knew that, if some of the evidence given to us in private had got out and been made public, they would have been in personal danger. However, many came along saying, &quot;We have been here before. We came to this Committee when you were looking at fuel fraud in 2003. We gave evidence and nothing happened. We do not want this to be a waste of time again.&quot; People took a chance in giving evidence; they gave us an honest view of what it is like to be a business person in Northern Ireland and the Government have a duty to respond to the fears that they expressed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.164.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" speakername="Christopher Fraser" colnum="164"  time="016:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0004.htm#06113062000287">
	<p pid="b.164.0/1">I have listened carefully to what has been said by hon. Members who are more eloquent than me and who have far more understanding of the issues. As a relatively new member of the Committee, it has been a privilege to serve under <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> and I compliment him and the Committee on the way in which the inquiry was conducted. The Committee made comprehensive recommendations and, as has already been said, was unanimous in doing so, which is quite something given the different views expressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/2">The financial costs of organised crime and the potential gains to criminal gangs are significant and continue to present a threat to the long-term stability of the economy and the communities of Northern Ireland. It is worth spending a moment assessing the size of the problem. The cost of intellectual property theft is estimated at &pound;200 million. Drugs worth more than &pound;7 million were seized by the PSNI in 2005-06. Some 35 million cigarettes were seized during the year, which amounts to almost &pound;7 million in revenue. Environmental crime such as illegal dumping is worth at least &pound;25 million to criminal gangs and extortion probably generates in excess of &pound;10 million in criminal profits a year. The revenue lost from fuel smuggling and legitimate cross-border shopping is estimated to be &pound;245 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/3">The Independent Monitoring Commission reported in 2005 that,</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/4" class="indent">&quot;because of...paramilitary involvement, organised crime is the biggest long term threat to the rule of law in Northern Ireland&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/5">That is something that the report articulated well. Paramilitary-backed gangs have been responsible for some of the largest scale and most lucrative organised crime activities undertaken in Northern Ireland. Paramilitary groups have long relied on criminal means to finance their activities, and all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland have been heavily involved in organised crime, both as a principal means of raising finance for their organisations and, obviously, for personal gain. The disciplined structures of paramilitary organisations have allowed a smooth transition from terrorist organisations into profitable criminal ventures. Extortion in particular has long been used by paramilitary groups as a means of raising finance for their terrorist operations and, since the early 1970s, has been an effective means of exercising paramilitary control over the community. The point about the community, which has been articulated this afternoon, is of great concern to us all. However, there has been a move beyond traditional means of fundraising such as extortion and armed robbery towards more sophisticated and complex forms of crime, such as counterfeiting and smuggling. Those points were well articulated to us during our inquiries. There is evidence to show that funds from organised crime run by dissident republican organisations in particular have been used to fund attacks and threats against members of the police, the Army and the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/6">According to the Organised Crime Task Force,</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/7" class="indent">&quot;extortion remains endemic in parts of Northern Ireland&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/8">but the true picture of the problem is far from clear. The true extent of Northern Ireland's extortion problem is not reflected in the number of cases successfully prosecuted, as we have heard in the past. It is likely that less than 10 per cent. of extortion is reported to the police&mdash;I hope that the Minister understands that. There are also many difficulties in prosecuting such cases successfully. In approximately 85 per cent. of the cases reported, the victims decline to work with the PSNI during the investigation. When the PSNI has been able to conduct an investigation, every case has resulted in the extortionists being convicted, which is marvellous. We must focus on increasing the number of people who report the crime in the first place, and there is a real issue about how that process can be undertaken. What steps are being taken to make the public aware of those facts, to give them more confidence about reporting crime?</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/9">Violent crimes are also a particular concern. The incidence of cash-in-transit robberies is increasing. The use of so-called tiger kidnaps, which were described and in which family members are taken hostage to compel an employee to facilitate a robbery from their place of work, is on the up. Perhaps the most notorious example of that was the Northern bank robbery in 2005. How many tiger kidnaps occur each year, and what advice is available to those who may be susceptible to that type of attack, to help them to protect themselves and their families?</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/10">HMRC has made significant progress on combating oils fraud, as the report highlighted. However, the amount of illicit fuel sold in Northern Ireland remains unacceptably high. It costs the Treasury &pound;245 million a year in lost revenue. HMRC assesses that nearly all its investigations relating to fuel on mainland Great Britain involve individuals from Northern Ireland. A particular problem is the misuse of rebated fuels&mdash;fuels on which a reduced rate of duty is payable&mdash;especially red diesel.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/11">The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee recommended, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire and others said, reducing the level of tax paid on fuel in Northern Ireland to the same level as that in the Republic of Ireland to reduce smuggling. I believe that serious consideration should be given to changing the system to allow duty to be paid on fuel at the point of sale&mdash;as in the Danish model, in which rebates are reclaimed and offset against VAT returns&mdash;rather than at the refinery gate, as is currently the case. Given the health and safety, as well as the financial, implications of laundering rebated fuels, and the extortion and intimidation that often accompany that, will the Minister reconsider his position and conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of that recommendation?</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/12">Counterfeit cigarettes, which were talked about, are a major problem. According to the Organised Crime Task Force, smuggling</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/13" class="indent">&quot;remains one of the most lucrative forms of organised criminal activity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/14">Counterfeit goods are of poor quality and carry health and safety risks. Illegal cigarettes carry an additional health risk because of increased levels of cadmium and lead and significantly higher levels of tar and nicotine. As we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>, they are sold mainly through informal networks&mdash;family, friends, pubs and street corners. What steps are the Government taking to increase public awareness of the greater health risks associated with illegal cigarettes, as applicable in Northern Ireland as elsewhere in the United Kingdom?</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/15">There is an illicit market in spirits in the UK, which costs about &pound;250 million a year&mdash;an enormous amount. Counterfeit alcohol has serious health implications as well. The risk of it being sold to children through unlicensed sources is enormously potent. That factor is important in all that we discuss, because I do not believe for a moment that people are necessarily buying these goods for themselves. They spread them around their communities and families, so the goods affect more people than just those who buy them. We must consider that extremely carefully in any further reports that we produce on the topic. Crime is a community issue. Individuals may be part of the problem, and they may be participating in the activity as a part of paramilitary organisations, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> pointed out, but it is the question how far it extends into the community that is so important to us. Support for the police in tackling crime must go to the very top of the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.0/16">All the issues that I have mentioned are very important. The figures speak for themselves&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.173.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="173"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0005.htm#06113062000293">
	<p pid="b.173.0/1">I understand where the hon. Gentleman is going with that argument, and we must be sensible about setting tax rates; however, the criminal mind will continually look for the opportunity to engage in criminal activity, make a profit and accumulate criminal assets. If we rely on closing a loophole here and a loophole there, even if we are successful at closing off that criminal option, criminals will simply move somewhere else. There is no substitute for confronting the criminal, finding out who they are and what they are up to, dealing with them, locking them up and seizing their assets. In the end, that must be the way. I shall address fuel in a moment, because it was the one area of substantial difference between the Government and the Committee. In the end, however, the criminal must be confronted, whatever activity they may have been up to.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/2">The hon. Member for South Staffordshire raised several issues about forthcoming legislation. Other Members commented more severely about what they perceive to be a lack of urgency. I shall deal with four examples, and, I hope, update and encourage Members. On charity law, the consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">13 October</phrase>. We received more than 90 responses, and we are confident that the order will be laid before the House before we rise for Christmas. On taxes, we held a 12-week consultation on the draft order, which ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November</phrase>. We received 53 responses and, altogether, 26 public meetings were held with people who operate in that industry. The comments were detailed and mainly positive. We are considering them, and if changes are needed, we will make them&mdash;I do not suppose that they will be large&mdash;and proceed with legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/3">On the petrol licensing scheme, the consultation started in September, and it will end on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase>. Again, assuming that there is a fair wind, new legislation will be in place by June next year. It will be some time before new road haulage industry legislation is in place, but we are still committed to it and a thorough consultation will begin in 2007. If all goes well, we are confident that legislation will be in place by summer 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/4">On top of that, in the Bill that we introduced on Monday, we included licensing provisions for the private security industry&mdash;a major undertaking whereby all operatives in the industry will have to be licensed. There will be a thorough system of regulation, the like of which we have not seen in Northern Ireland. I can understand why people urge us to do more and to do it quickly, but we are addressing a range of issues. There is a lot of work, and we must get it right. However, no one should be under any illusion; we are following through on all issues, and we will deliver as soon as we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/5">Fuel represented an area of difference between the Government and the Committee. The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk discussed the Danish model and asked us to reconsider it. Although there is a difference between us, we have considered the issues carefully. As was said in response to a previous report, the Danish model would be administratively more complex, and that must be taken into consideration. However, a more compelling argument is that it would create more opportunities for criminal activity, because duty would be paid further down the chain. Fuel would go missing from the supply chain, never to be seen legitimately again.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/6">The beauty of the current system is that duty is paid as fuel leaves the refinery. If we were to make the point of sale the point at which duty were paid, any fuel that disappeared between leaving the refinery and the point of sale, would be a lost legitimate sale. Issues of administration and practical organisation lead us to conclude that we do not wish to go for the Danish model.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.175.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="175"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0006.htm#06113062000299">
	<p pid="b.175.0/1">Of course, part of the rationale for the tax increases is environmental protection. That is part of Government strategy, and if it is linked with the determination, for which there is a coherent argument, to apply the same duty rates in different parts of the United Kingdom, that leads us to the conclusion that we have drawn. The Committee has made a legitimate argument, but in the end it is for Government to reflect on that argument. Although we have taken the recommendation seriously, we have come to a different conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/2">A number of hon. Members have mentioned extortion, including my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North. The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk was right to mention the figure of 10 per cent. of incidents reported. Some would argue that that is a generous assessment of the level of extortion that is reported and dealt with. He is also right, however, to underline the fact that in those cases in which a report is made, investigation takes place and a prosecution occurs, there is a 100 per cent. success rate for prosecution. The record shows further that there are no recriminations against those who gave evidence. Fear of recrimination is probably one of the reasons why people are reluctant to come forward, but in fact it does not occur in cases that have been proved. The hon. Gentleman rightly asked what we are doing to encourage people to report extortion. We have established an extortion helpline and we are widely advertising the contact number for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/3">The construction industry has been mentioned this afternoon. I have had a very detailed and constructive meeting with the Construction Employers Federation in which we dealt with many of the problems that employers are facing. The federation was invited to give information and further evidence whenever it feels the need to do so. We also had a very focused discussion of the problems at the most recent meeting of the Organised Crime Task Force stakeholder group, in which people from the business community gave us evidence and further information.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/4">We are trying to build confidence within the industry to report extortion whenever it is threatened, so that it can be thoroughly investigated. We want to develop the independent private sector inspector general&mdash;IPSIG&mdash;model, although hon. Members may be pleased to learn that we are giving it a different title: construction contract monitors. As far as we can see, there will be a &pound;1 billion programme of public investment in construction in the years ahead in Northern Ireland. That is a huge amount of money, and it is incumbent on us to ensure that it is absolutely free of extortion and of filtering out of taxpayers' money to fund criminal activity. The public sector has an important role, and we hope that the private sector will be able to make use of the model too.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/5">As I emphasised in my discussions with the Construction Employers Federation, ultimately we must move to a regulated and properly licensed private security industry, so that if companies feel the need to protect a building site or an asset, they pay a legitimate fee to a legitimate company, and do not have to hide away secret payments to extortionists, which is completely unacceptable. That is why the licensing arrangements proposed in the Bill introduced this week are so very important.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/6">The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk asked about tiger kidnaps. They have increased since 2005, and they are now running at roughly the same level as in 2004. The PSNI takes them very seriously indeed. Forums have been held involving people from banks and post offices to make them aware of the risks and to identify the risks that can be dealt with if staff know the correct procedures to follow. The PSNI's view is clear: it is important to obtain better intelligence in order to deal with the problem effectively, and it will continue its activities in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/7">The need to develop a greater public understanding of the damage done by organised crime has also been highlighted this afternoon. We are pursuing that objective vigorously through messages about the damage to people's health that illicit cigarettes and alcohol can do, and about the damage to car engines from illicit fuel. Communities are undermined by drugs and by the connection between organised crime and paramilitary activity. All those arguments must be made and must be made up front&mdash;there is no dodging that.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/8">We are working to strengthen our media strategy and to focus it more strongly, because it is important that we get the message across effectively. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-11">11 December</phrase> I shall launch an initiative with a group of 150 school students in the Coleraine area. There will be a roadshow to explain to them the impact of organised crime on their lives, and to explain that DVDs and certain items of clothing may not be legitimate. If it works, as we hope it will, it is a programme that we can roll out across Northern Ireland so that we can educate young people as well as adults about the dangers that lurk in illicit activities. Another event is planned for January with the chamber of commerce.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/9">A great deal of work is going on to try to spread the word and to instil greater confidence in the minds of ordinary citizens, as well as in the minds of companies. It is important that all of us engage together in the fight against organised crime. A short time ago I invited Sir Stephen Lander, the chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, to a launch in Northern Ireland. He undertook a review of the suspicious activity reports that lawyers and accountant have a responsibility to make when they think that money laundering is occurring. The launch was very well attended, and it was clear to me that people do indeed want to play their part in the fight against crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/10">During our discussion today, a great deal has rightly been said about progress since the report was published in July and about the moves towards devolved government in Northern Ireland. I want to reaffirm a point made during the debate and elsewhere about the conditions for the process moving forward. It is clear that two important elements underpin the process: first, a willingness on behalf of all parties and communities to share power, and secondly, a willingness on behalf of all parties and communities to support the police and the rule of law. It is unthinkable that any Government could be established that is not founded on those principles, and it is clear that both must be in place to establish stable, long-term, democratic government in Northern Ireland. We cannot have a casual on-off switch. Those are long-term, not short-term, commitments, and they must be strong and able to withstand the test of time. No ounce of energy will be spared by Ministers or anyone associated with the Northern Ireland Office to ensure that we work towards a lasting settlement with both those elements firmly in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/11">The hon. Member for East Antrim asked about police resources. He probably knows more than most about those resources in Northern Ireland because of his involvement with the Northern Ireland Policing Board. He knows that there is to be a comprehensive spending review in 2007 and that there will be discussions about long-term funding. He also knows the commitment that we have made to maintain the number of police officers in Northern Ireland at the current level until at least 2010. We must do that to fulfil the Patten commitment on the representation of the Catholic community in the police force. We are making huge progress in that area. The police force of 7,500 officers, which is the current full strength, will remain in place until 2010, and we will provide the money to ensure that.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/12">The hon. Gentleman expressed frustration about sentencing. That frustration is not confined to Northern Ireland&mdash;we all hear messages about sentencing in our constituencies. People are outraged by criminal activity and they want punishment that fits the crime. When they feel that it does not do so, they say so. Politicians cannot intervene in individual cases because that is a matter for the process of law, and for judges and the courts. However, when there is organised criminal activity and violence is used, the courts can take account of that when sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/13">I make an offer to the Chairman of the Committee to provide more information, but when we have examined sentencing trends and patterns, we see a situation in Northern Ireland that is broadly comparable with that in England and Wales. I am happy to share that information and we will monitor the situation. Sentencing is important, which is why we have continued to strengthen the law in a number of ways, not least the law covering organised crime, to ensure that punishment fits the crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/14">In conclusion, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire said, wisely, that we will never end criminality, whether in Northern Ireland or elsewhere, but that we should be firm in our resolution to break the link between paramilitary activity and criminality, to make it extremely difficult for organised crime to operate in Northern Ireland, and to make it clear to those engaged in it that they stand to lose more than they will gain if they persist in their endeavours. I assure the House that there will be no letting up in our efforts.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/15">I again thank the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee for its encouragement and the wise words that it sent to the Northern Ireland Office.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-30b.178.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="178"  time="017:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061130/halltext/61130h0006.htm#06113062000300">
	<p pid="b.178.0/1">I thank all who have taken part in this debate, which has been a useful exercise. I am grateful to every hon. Member who spoke, including the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase>, and the Minister. We have had a useful exchange of views and an extremely robust expression of opinion from my hon. Friend, as I shall call him, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> who made some valid and telling points, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1401" name="Nigel Dodds">the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds)</phrase>, who had to return to his constituency before the debate came to a close.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/2">I admire the way in which the Minister has got to grips with the issues since taking office relatively recently. He and I have a good personal relationship, which I value. He knows that the Select Committee is the creature not of Government, but of Parliament, and that it is our duty to hold him and his colleagues to account. He also knows that there are some differences between us, albeit not on the substance or the necessity of dealing with crime; perhaps we differ slightly in our sense of urgency. I know that in Northern Ireland the consultation process tends to be longer than elsewhere and that that tends to create delay, but it is crucial that there is no further delay on the charities issue, for example. There has already been slippage and an order should have been tabled by today. Indeed, that was promised in writing for today, but it has not happened. We sincerely hope that the Minister's commitment to produce an order before Christmas will materialise, because that is essential.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/3">We shall continue to differ respectfully on the fuel issue. I listened carefully to what the Minister said, but I was not convinced. Where I can willingly join forces with him is in congratulating the Police Service of Northern Ireland on many things, particularly the recent drugs haul to which he referred. I also congratulate the Minister on the recent roadshow initiative. I hope that it works well and that the Select Committee will be able to co-operate with him on future roadshows. If we could bring home to the young people of Northern Ireland the appalling dangers, aside from the criminality, of buying noxious substances, whether to smoke them or to drink them, that would be a significant achievement.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/4">I want to finish on a note that concerns us all. The Minister quoted from the IMC's report and referred to the favourable comments about the Provisional IRA, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and it must deliver. Time is running out in the Government's timetable. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>, the Assembly, such as it is at the moment, will be dissolved, an election campaign will begin, and it is proposed to have elections on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>. If Sinn Fein is to have credibility as a democratic party, it must have begun to show that it has truly signed up to the concept of the rule of law and that it has truly and absolutely foresworn criminality in all its forms and the ill-gotten gains that criminality has produced.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/5">It is not just the Minister's order on charities that I hope we shall have before Christmas; I hope that we shall also have a signing up by Sinn Fein so that we can enter the new year with all political parties absolutely committed to the rule of law, and utterly and totally committed to supporting the PSNI. Then, perhaps, we can begin 2007 with a month of demonstration of good intent, which would be an excellent backdrop for a cleanly fought election campaign&mdash;I hope that that is what we shall have&mdash;and the proper restoration of an Assembly and devolved government. It is up to Sinn Fein to listen to what has been said today and to read our report, to which the Minister made kind reference. Then, perhaps, that spirit of togetherness to which my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk referred will indeed prevail.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/6">I thank the Minister again for what he said. I hope that we can work constructively together in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/7" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/8" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at twenty minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
