	<p pid="a.1.3/1">I am delighted to have this opportunity to return yet again to the subject of water bills in the south-west, which has been debated many times in this House, most recently by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>, who introduced an Adjournment debate on 1 February. Following on from that debate, there is a meeting tomorrow between Water Voice South West and the Minister responsible for water at which the consumer body will yet again put the case for action to alleviate the high water bills in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/2">On a point of record, I feel that I must go over some old ground. In 1989&mdash;the time of privatisation of the water companies&mdash;there was not a huge disparity between water bills in different regions. The industry average was &pound;120 a year, and the south-west, at &pound;147 a year, was about 20 per cent. above the average. That was not the highest figure&mdash;two regions paid more&mdash;but figures for all regions were relatively close together. Rolling forward to this year, the industry average is &pound;264, but the south-west is paying &pound;400, which is much the highest. The gap between the highest and the lowest figures has become enormous and the situation has got progressively worse over those years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/3">The reasons for that are fairly well known. In the first instance, the costs of cleaning up the coastline and of sewage processes at the coastline placed a huge capital burden on South West Water&mdash;the company and its customers had to pay the costs of that clean-up. Broadly speaking, the clean-up is complete, and certain expectations have been raised that, following that completion, the south-west can anticipate water bills returning to what is the norm for the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/4">South West Water is now telling Ofwat and customers that, although it has completed the clean sweep programme, it has put in place a lot of new infrastructure, which will need to be maintained and supported over the years to come and will therefore cost money. Additionally, there are all the capital burdens placed on South West Water&mdash;as on all water companies&mdash;in terms of drinking water quality, the amount lost through leaking pipes and security of supply. Therefore, the company cannot make good its promise to charge a price nearer the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/5">Indeed, in addition to South West Water customers already paying by far the highest bills in the country, the periodic review in December, which covered the next five years, has placed on top of the highest bills much the highest yearly rises. It is not scaremongering or causing alarm to predict that, unless something is done, at the end of that five-year period South West Water will produce another eminently plausible programme for the following five years, which will be a reason why a further fortune must be spent and why bills must get higher. Everyone is paying higher water bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/6">As I went round my constituency, I found that water rates and the council tax were the two biggest issues on the doorstep. It was quite different from other elections: despite all the previous rumpus, I heard much less about hunting and Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/7">The two things on voters' minds were water rates and council tax: that is fair enough, because we hold elections at a time of year when both those bills have only just arrived on people's doorsteps, and they will be at the forefront of their thinking, but in my experience those bills both caused anger bordering on rage. The council tax is undergoing a substantive Government review, and in any event I think that voters in the south-west understand that the whole country finds the council tax burden unacceptable. What is unique about the water rates is the fact that customers in the south-west are carrying so much more of a burden than those in other parts of the country. That, I think, has given rise to such a degree of rage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/8">In addition to the fact that water bills in the south-west are the highest, it is essential to point out that Devon and Cornwall have the lowest incomes in England. The highest burden therefore falls on those least able to carry it. It is well known that many people in Devon and Cornwall are of retirement age and live on fixed incomes. In particular, pensioners find that an unacceptably high proportion of their disposable income is going on their water bills. Each year they receive a modest state pension increase, but their water bills and the council tax between them more than eat up the entire rise. Indeed, on occasion, either increase might do it alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/9">In my view, it is a gross injustice that these enormous bills are being paid by people on small incomes, and the time has come for the Government to intervene. Various options are open, but too much time has passed and it is now incumbent on them to decide how to tackle the problem&mdash;and to get on and do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/10">We saw the problem coming when the water privatisation legislation was making its way through the House in 1988. My hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/11" class="indent">&quot;I hope that the Minister can assure the people of Cornwall that they will not be expected to meet all the costs of cleaning up the beaches, which are used by citizens of the UK and Europe, purely because the Government through their ideological approach are cutting off the potential to obtain money in other ways.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1988-12-08.536"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 December 1988; Vol. 143, c. 536</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/12">That problem, which was anticipated from the outset, is probably far worse than even the most anxious commentators suggested at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/13">Water Voice, which is meeting the Minister tomorrow, will, I am sure, invite him to cast his mind back to the Water Charges Equalisation Act 1977. It was enacted by a Labour Government, who recognised the problem caused by disparities in water bills across the country. Those on any benefit receive uniform support to help to pay their bills, but water bills have become hugely different from one region to another. The Act imposed a levy on each regional water company. The money went into a central pot and was then rebated out to water companies to help them with some of their capital costs. The net effect should have been to get water bills as near to equal as could be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/14">The 1977 Act was repealed in 1983 by the Conservative Government, who thought that it created perverse incentives, rewarded inefficiency and levied charges on efficient companies while handing out money to the inefficient. Several years later came water privatisation. Some would say that privatisation makes it impossible, impractical or undesirable to go back to the principle of water charges equalisation. I believe that the opposite is the case and that the fact of privatisation may make equalisation a better idea than it was when everything was in public hands. If we continued with a system of periodic reviews by Ofwat, and if in addition to considering price issues Ofwat imposed a levy of the   kind I am describing, the company would know where it stood for the forthcoming five-year period. Furthermore, it would still have all the incentives to improve its efficiency and to do better than the figures&mdash;in effect, the targets&mdash;that had been set so as to make a return for its shareholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/15">It is perfectly feasible to move to the equalisation principle despite privatisation. There are many sectors in which private companies compete, but where they do so on a regulated playing field. In the rail industry, for example, different operators work on the basis of completely different financial relationships with the Government: some involve rail companies paying in while others involve the opposite. The fact that the ownership of companies has transferred to the private sector does not prevent a return to the principle of water charges equalisation. I very much hope that when representatives of Water Voice come to the Department tomorrow to put those points to the Government, they are given a good hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/16">There are alternatives. The Government could, for example, grant aid some capital works, which would impose a new charge on taxpayers. Some might argue that it would be fairer in principle for the taxpayer rather than the water customer to meet such capital costs, because taxation is a fairer system of raising money than water charges. Frankly, I am not pushing one method or another. I am telling the Government that there is a huge issue here; it has been bubbling and simmering for years and it is coming to the boil. They must consider the various options and take action now to ensure that a huge injustice is put right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/17">At various times, my hon. Friends have argued for the water tariff to shift from the old rating system, which was abolished many years ago because it was discredited, and from using valuations that are years and years out of date. Instead, they argued, it should be based on the council tax. That would have the advantage that the council tax benefits system could be used to help those on very low incomes to meet their water charges. Although that idea had merit at the time, we very much hope that the council tax itself is about to be abolished, and it would be no solution to the water problem to attach the water tariff to another local government finance system that is on its way out. That would simply be to repeat the mistake of attaching the tariff to the old rateable values.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/18">Alternatively, action could be targeted specifically on those on low or fixed incomes. I do not believe that that is a complete solution, because the burdens are unfair on everybody, but it would certainly make a welcome start if the Government targeted aid on those most in need of it. As I said, benefits are calculated on a national basis, but the bills that people have to pay differ significantly from one area to another. By the end of the current period, South West Water households will be paying an average of &pound;444&mdash;2 per cent. of their disposable income, compared with a national average of 1.1 per cent. A single-pensioner household living on the minimum pension credit and paying an average South West Water bill might end up paying 7 per cent. of their disposable income on water and sewerage charges by the end of that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/19">In March 2004, the Secretary of State said in her guidance that she would be reviewing how lower-income households are helped with their water and sewerage charges. We have to hope very much that something emerges to address the most desperate cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/20">Overall, although average water bills have risen since 1994, they now make up a smaller percentage of household income than they did then. However, the opposite is true in the south-west, where 21.6 per cent. of households spend more than 3 per cent. of their disposable income on water and sewerage&mdash;that is heading towards 30 per cent., compared with a national average of 7.9 per cent.&mdash;so there is a huge disparity between the south-west and other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/21">Representatives of Water Voice will put other issues to the Minister tomorrow. It is particularly keen for those who cause problems that lead to high sewerage bills to pay towards the costs that they create. I will leave that issue for Water Voice, but I think it makes a good point in some cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/22">Highway drainage gets into the sewerage infrastructure, which invariably causes problems. It is particularly unpleasant for householders who get on the wrong end of the back-up of an unsavoury cocktail, as I have found when I have had to deal with issues of small, localised flooding in my constituency. Some of my constituents suffer repeatedly. They know that virtually every winter the hatches in their floors will rise and various unmentionables will appear in their houses. Highway drainage getting into sewerage infrastructure is a huge problem, although resolving it will lead to the additional capital costs that I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/23">Metering is also an issue. Hon. Members whose constituents come to their surgeries expressing horror at the size of their water bills are likely to recommend meters if they think their constituents will benefit from them. In England and Wales, 26 per cent. of customers have water meters, with the local variations from 61 per cent. in Essex to 5 per cent. in Portsmouth. Among the larger companies, only Anglian Water has a majority of customers&mdash;54 per cent.&mdash;using meters. Water Voice takes the view that in the long term most customers should pay on the basis of a metered supply, but that lower-income customers should receive help through the benefits and tax credit systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/24">The Government need to introduce an explicit link between the tax and benefit systems and water charges if anyone is to be convinced that targeted help really is being produced through the system to provide some comfort. Every time somebody takes on a water meter, that increases the pressure on the price that has to be paid by the rest of the customer base, so it can become a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/25">In the south-west, there are many second homes and holiday homes. Astute owners of such homes waste little time in getting meters because they use little water and therefore pay low bills. However, in parts of my constituency many such homes are in idyllic spots miles from anywhere, with beautiful coastal views, and massive infrastructure expenses are incurred in providing water and sewerage services to them. In some instances, therefore, the houses that are the most cost-intensive to supply pay the lowest bills. That is another anomaly that needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/26">I am delighted that a number of my hon. Friends and other hon. Members from the south-west are here for the debate. That demonstrates the strength of feeling on the issue. We have returned fresh from an election in which water and sewerage services were undoubtedly a major issue. The Government need to be told, and the purpose of the debate is to draw to their attention the strength of feeling in the south-west on that issue and the sincere belief that the situation has gone on for too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/27">There are options, each with differing merits, and it is for the Government to decide which solutions have the most appeal. However, they cannot just leave the situation to drift on and on. They are turning into rebels and protestors people whom they would not normally expect to take to the streets and march, but that is where we will be headed if nothing is done. There is an immense need for action soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/28">The public are very aware of this unfairness. Thanks to the good offices of the regional media&mdash;the <i>Western Morning News</i> and our regional television and radio companies&mdash;there is a high awareness of the disparity between bills in the south-west and those in the rest of the country. There is a good understanding of the issues involved and of why some expenses have mounted up, but the public are absolutely determined that there should be change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/29">I look forward to hearing from the Minister that the Government have got the message and that substantial change is on its way.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.1/1">Order. I would like to announce the ruling on procedure for debates on local rather than national issues, such as today's. In such debates, the Front-Bench spokesmen for the official Opposition and the Liberal Democrats will normally be allowed five minutes each. There will then be at least 10 minutes for the Minister to reply. I ask hon. Members to bear that in mind.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Taylor. As is customary, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate and on picking this particular subject. As he rightly said, it preoccupied us&mdash;Labour Members as well as his hon. Friends&mdash;a lot during the last Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/2">I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister, as this is the first occasion on which I have had the opportunity to engage in debate with him. I think I am right in saying that he recorded either the only Labour gain, or one of two Labour gains, in the 2001 election. That was quite a feat, but holding his seat with an increased majority at the last election was quite remarkable. I hope he deploys in the Department the undoubted skills that he showed in the general election, particularly on the issue that we are considering today.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/3">I would like to point out at the beginning that only the Labour manifesto mentioned water at all. On page 28, we gave a categorical undertaking that we would</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/4" class="indent">&quot;work to tackle diffuse water pollution through addressing impacts across water catchments without the costs falling on water customers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/5">In the context of the very large charges that we are talking about, that is, in some respects, a small issue, but it is an important signal that the Government are beginning to recognise the pressure that hon. Members have put on them on the matter of water charges in the south-west. I like to think that such recognition has resulted not only from lobbying by hon. Members, but, in particular, from lobbying brought to bear on Ministers&mdash;in particular the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment&mdash;by me and by Candy Atherton, the former Member for Falmouth and Camborne.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/6">I remind the House that there was a proposal to move the office of Water Voice in the south-west from Exeter, and I want to record my thanks for the Minister's intervention, which followed his meeting with me and the former Member for Falmouth and Camborne, and my request to meet the chair of the national Water Voice committee with a delegation from the local Water Voice committee, and to meet Ofwat about the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/7">I pay tribute to the work of Noel Olsen, the current chair, and to his members for the work they have been doing to represent water consumers. I refer in particular to the help that he gave me in our fight to ensure that proper attention was paid to the sewage smells from Cattedown treatment works and those at Camels Head and Keyham, which continue to have problems. I know that my new hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" name="Alison Seabeck">the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> will fight that corner, assisted by the new code of practice and the good practice guide, which emerged from the clarification we sought of the law in that regard. I also thank Mr. Olsen for his help in seeing that the regulator ensured that the cost of rectifying the flaw in the original design of the treatment works&mdash;the figure involved was more than &pound;1 million&mdash;was not passed on to water users.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/8">I am sure that the Minister will remind the House of the Government's success during the previous Parliament in keeping water charges down. Nevertheless, as the hon. Member for North Devon pointed out, and as I pointed out in the Adjournment debates that I initiated in the previous Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-10">10 November 2004</phrase> and in December 2001, the price hikes, added to the higher-than-average burden dating back to the 1989 privatisation, are unsustainable in terms of Government policy on tackling poverty and intolerable for individual constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/9">In my previous Adjournment debate, I said that I thought the review being carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs would be challenged to come up with answers within the current regulatory framework. That comment has turned out to be right. A pilot scheme linked to the warm front programme was announced. It emerged from the cross-Government review of water affordability and will introduce targeted assistance for lower-income households. Also, it will take place in the south-west. I am not sure from the hon. Gentleman's remarks whether he has come across that initiative. It will help lower-income households to access all the assistance available and it will help metered customers to use water more efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/10">The scheme will also promote the vulnerable groups regulations. I say to the Minister that I continue to be disappointed at the take-up in that regard. The regulations are limited in how they can help our constituents, because to qualify someone has to have a defined medical condition or be on a defined benefit and have three children. Even though considerable lobbying has been done on take-up, in 2001&ndash;02 only 4,716 people were in receipt of benefit through those regulations on the social tariff. According to the answer to a written question that I received on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June</phrase>, that figure has gone up to 7,202, but it is still derisory, considering the number of our constituents who are in real hardship and struggling to pay these bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/11">I have paid tribute to Noel Olsen and I understood his anger and that of Water Voice&mdash;indeed, I think hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber share their concern&mdash;but it was a bit cheap to deride the water pilot as merely putting hippos into cisterns, because there is a great deal more to it than that. One benefit of the scheme is that it will demonstrate clearly what we see in our surgeries all the time&mdash;the great hardship experienced by our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/12">In the debate that I initiated last November, I mentioned a plethora of potential solutions that needed to be examined, some of which the hon. Member for North Devon referred to this morning. In particular, we need to consider how owners of second homes could pay a fairer share. I think Water Voice shares that view. The hon. Gentleman feels&mdash;more as a vain hope than anything else&mdash;that the council tax will be abolished. I do not think that will happen. Following the balance of funding review, I hope there will be major changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.1/1">The hon. Gentleman took the words out of my mouth: not only do I intend to do as he suggests, but I have been doing so for some time. I have made representations to the Lyons review to ask that the matter be considered. The hon. Gentleman will know that I co-chair the Public Utilities Reform Group, which deals with all utility issues but majors on the question of water. I will promote the issue at a meeting later this month, and I hope a representative from the Lyons review will attend. The matter is very important.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/2">The council tax review must address the issues of pensioners who are asset rich but income poor. The same issues affect water charges. I have mentioned the vulnerable groups regulations, which, through the social tariff, help far too few people. I believe that South West Water has a trust fund of the sort that I advocated during the previous Adjournment debate, which some other companies had at that time. I do not think that anyone knows about it and certainly no one has engaged us as Members of Parliament to enable us to pass on its benefits to our constituents. The Minister could examine that and encourage the company to do more in the immediate future.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/3">In reply to the previous debate, the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment said:</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We have not shut down the idea of review of structures, prices and tariffs.

	<p pid="a.7.1/5">Specifically, he said he would examine the study on variable tariffs done for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. I know he indicated that consideration of altering the prohibition on mergers should not be ruled out. I am sure that the Minister here today has been briefed to be cautious about referring to that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/6">Pushed on that issue by our friend the former Member for Falmouth and Camborne while visiting her, the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment expressed merely mild support for it to be examined. That caused a share price movement. I must tell this Minister that the matter deserves serious and urgent attention, because this is a path that could help. This is a big problem and, as with all big problems, no one solution will produce a result that addresses the matter fully.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/7">I was fortunate to secure the Adjournment debate in the House last night&mdash;fortunate only in some ways, Mr. Taylor, because it was a rather late one and I was torn between the subject about which I spoke then, the urban renaissance of Plymouth, and water charges. I wish to return to this subject to discuss the research that I have been conducting in Plymouth&mdash;in Plymouth, Sutton in particular. The Minister knows about it and I am seeking a meeting with his Department to discuss it. It will be the prime concern for PURGe, which I have already mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/8">Hon. Members will recall that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, when he was an environment Minister, privatised the industry with a totally inadequate green dowry. There are all sorts of rumours about why that was, linked with the fact that the pension liabilities were totally unsustainable and there had to be a trade-off between the two. These frustrating questions are haunting the search for a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/9">I urge the Minister to convey the need to come up with solutions and to underpin them with a review of the whole regulatory process of the type referred to by Dr. Dieter Helm when he addressed the Select Committee. He mentioned the difficulty of current regulation:</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/10" class="indent">&quot;It creates set-piece artificial decision points, focuses management on the short term, and encourages game playing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/11">He advocates a longer-term review, comprising an overarching policy framework, 10-year fundamental reviews and much more reliance on an interim determination process to allow flexibility within periods. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" name="Jim Knight">the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase>, who is now the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I have taken part in debates with him on radio and on television stations in the south-west, and I found that he always listened to the questions put to him and tried to answer them. I hope that his new elevated status does not deter him from sticking to that record and that he answers some of the very serious questions that Members on both sides of the House will put to him today.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/2">I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> on securing the debate. He said that the issue was raised during the election; it certainly was. He also said that the election was held as legislation was being discussed, so it was inevitable that the issue would be raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/3">We in Teignbridge have conducted our campaign on water charges through a rolling petition. We have gone out every month or every six weeks, and whenever we have taken our stall to Newton Abbot, Teignmouth or Dawlish and asked people whether they wanted to sign a petition on water charges, they have said yes. Indeed, when we petitioned during the election, queues of people signed&mdash;far more than have signed petitions on any other subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/4">That is unsurprising, because, as my hon. Friend pointed out, some households are spending up to 7 per cent. of their income on water charges. That is in addition to the injustice of several households in the south-west already spending up to 11 or 12 per cent. on council tax. If we add those two figures together, Mr. Deputy Speaker, almost a fifth of householder income is being taken in statutory charges for council tax and water.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/5">Those people have worked and saved, but a fifth of their income is being taken away. They might as well go back to work and pay 20 per cent. income tax&mdash;it is the same sum. They have worked hard all their lives, but we are still taking from them. We should not be doing so. This is an injustice. Today's debate is about water justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/6">My hon. Friend also said that, after the current increases, water charges in the south-west will be three times as great as the lowest water charges in the country. Mr. Deputy Speaker, the water charges that we pay in the south-west&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.9.4/1">I apologise, Mr. Taylor.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.4/2">The water charges paid in the south-west after these increases will be three times what they were in 1989. That means that the rest of the country is, in effect, paying what we in the south-west were paying 16 years ago. What sort of justice is that? What sort of fair society is that? We know that the water companies, when privatised, were slow to implement the clean-up programmes, and it was the former Member for Bath, Chris Patten, who forced them to take the clean-up programme seriously. I must say that the water companies did a very good job in cleaning up the water, but that still left 3 per cent. of the population cleaning up 30 per cent. of the country's beaches in the south-west. That cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.4/3">A couple of years ago, the Government had an opportunity to correct this situation. They introduced the Water Act 2003. I thought then that we could propose an amendment to the Act to allow an equalisation scheme like the 1977 scheme, which was referred to earlier. Through it, there would, in effect, have been a levy on the water companies, which could have claimed back a grant against capital costs of programmes such as clean sweep. That would not have been perfect, but we were trying to work out how to use the legislation to make the system fairer.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.4/4">There was no support from those on the Labour Benches&mdash;not one Labour Member supported that amendment. It had the full support of the Liberal Democrats, but was sadly opposed by the Conservative Front-Bench team, although its spokesman <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" name="Bill Wiggin">the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin)</phrase> is shaking his head.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.7/1">We had an opportunity to bring water justice to the south-west, but I am afraid that it was thrown away. We have an opportunity today to debate the issue further, and tomorrow the Minister has an opportunity to listen to what Water Voice has to say. It is an impartial body, and it has come to the same conclusion as many of us: there is no water justice in the south-west and something has to be done to relieve a large number of households of the heavy burden of water charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.7/2">I ask the Minister to acknowledge, as a Minister did in the debate on the Water Act 2003, that there is a problem and that the Government will seek a way to equalise water charges to households in the south-west with those in the other parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.0/1">We have heard a catalogue of complaint from hon. Members who have had long experience of South West Water's poor relationship with its consumers. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> has vociferously campaigned over many years for water bills to be reduced in the south-west, highlighting the disparity between our region and the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">Apart from the serious concerns that my constituents have about the high level of their bills and the disproportionate impact on those on low and fixed incomes, they have also expressed deep unhappiness about South West Water's failure to communicate effectively with them. Given the charges levied, we would surely expect the company to be able to afford a decent public relations department, but no&mdash;constituents living in Ernesettle and close to the Camels Head works suffer regularly from the most unpleasant odours or stink. South West Water has been unable to give an acceptable explanation of the causes of the smell, which at times is so awful that the local residents find that it puts them off eating. It pervades the whole area.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">What makes the situation worse is the historic failure of South West Water to communicate with those affected by the smell. It has taken a great deal of work by my hon. Friend and by my predecessor as Member for Plymouth, Devonport to elicit press notices for future works. Indeed, the local council was considering putting an antisocial behaviour order on South West Water, such was the desperation of local residents. I will study carefully the good practice guide for the water industry established by the Government in response to the public's concerns. I hope that that will enable practical solutions to complaints to be found in a way that is clearly not happening at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/4">The quality of supply and the cost of water in the south-west will require ongoing serious consideration by the Government. I look forward to the Minister's comments.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.1/1">The reasons for the high water charges are clearly and succinctly laid out in a House of Commons Library brief to our debate. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.11.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The high charges are due primarily to historical underinvestment and the traditional use of sea outfalls. Major improvements and treatment works on all these outfalls were necessary to comply with the EC Bathing Waters Directive. The Government decided that the upgrades in this region should be paid for by the customers of South West Water. This has meant that the vast capital programme to improve water quality at 30 per cent. of the designated bathing beaches in England and Wales is met solely by 3 per cent. of the population and local industry.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.11.1/3">It is therefore clear that the problems our constituents face are a consequence of privatisation, and, in turn, of the fact that we have such a long coastline. It is also a consequence of something that has not so far been mentioned: the fact that we live in a large rural area where the distribution of water and sewerage services is, perhaps, more expensive than in a small urban area.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.1/4">The Government knew at the time of privatisation that there would be a problem for customers when customer bases were small. That is why a green dowry was suggested and created. However, the problem with that dowry was that it was available to all the water companies, and because the larger water companies were more able to secure a larger part of the dowry than the smallest of the water companies&mdash;South West Water&mdash;the dowry did not actually help the south-west. South West Water itself makes that criticism of the dowry.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.0/1">Are the hon. Gentleman's constituents puzzled, as mine sometimes are, as to why such a small water company with such a small customer base was created? That is one of the big problems with regard to resolving the charges problem.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.12.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" speakername="Adrian Sanders" colnum="12"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h01.htm#50614h01_spnew22">
	<p pid="a.12.1/1">The hon. Lady puts her finger on the key point: the problem is the size of the customer base. I will address that shortly. The result is that there is a substantial gap between the cost of the bills in the south-west and the ability of the customer base to pay, both in relation to its size and the fact that it contains some of the lowest-income households in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/2">There are things that customers can do and have done. There is no doubt that meters help; in a low-use household, a water meter will reduce the bill, and we encourage constituents to go down that route. If a household's property is not eligible to have a meter, the household is eligible for an assessed water charge, which will save it money if there is low usage. We also encourage people to take water efficiency measures. A lot more can be done in the area to reduce water usage, but that is true not just for the south-west but nationwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/3">There is also the essential user tariff&mdash;means-tested support for a small group of people who are eligible. That is not widely known about, and more information should be made available, particularly through the benefits system, so that people are aware that certain medical conditions attract extra support towards water costs because water is essential in respect of those conditions. All those measures are available nationwide, so even if they were all applied, there would still be that gap between the south-west and the rest of the country. That gap is seen as an injustice.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/4">I turn to the solutions. The first of them is the one that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> put her finger on: we need to widen the customer base. As politicians, we cannot do that unless we intervene in the market. Finding a way of sharing the burden has to be the easiest route to finding a solution. Can the Government intervene, regulate and peg charges? I pose that as a question. I do not like Government intervention and regulation, but if that is a last resort in the interests of justice, perhaps that is something the Government need to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/5">Can we do more to target support at low-income households, perhaps even in particular areas where they face higher-than-average bills? That would provide specific support for South West Water customers. Can we legislate and introduce some form of equalisation scheme to bring us back to where we were before privatisation, when water and sewerage charges were generally the same, whether people lived in Northumberland or north Cornwall? Those are the solutions and the people of the south-west want to hear that this Government will do something about the problem; they know that the previous Government created the problem and that the Conservative position at the general election ruled out any specific support. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase> said on BBC Radio Devon, the Conservatives had no plans to help South West Water customers. The people of the south-west are therefore looking to this Government for a solution and to find some justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.0/1">In view of your comments earlier, Mr. Taylor, I will try to be brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> on securing this debate, and congratulate hon. Members from all parties on the work that they have already put in and on the campaigns that they have been running over a number of years. Although I am a new Member of the House, I have been involved in campaigning on this issue outside the House for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/3">It is clear that consumers and all those involved in the water industry in the south-west are subject to two pressures: ensuring that we have the cleanest beaches and environment we possibly can and ensuring that the burden does not fall unfairly on the consumer. Those pressures, however, are pushing in different directions. The money for the environmental clean-up has to come from somewhere and, unfortunately, up to now the burden has fallen solely on the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/4">There are a number of projects in my constituency on the north coast&mdash;in Bossiney, Tintagel and Boscastle&mdash;where the water company is proposing measures to try to meet water directives, but local people have seen that the treatment offered to them, which will be put in place in those areas, does not meet the standard that they would hope to have for their area. The reason for that is that their area of coastline does not have bathing beaches. That is a rather odd distinction, because the sea does not flow just to one part of the coast and not to the bathing beaches just around the headland. It is common sense to try to achieve a decent standard of treatment all along the coastline. However, it would be and has been unfair to see the burden of any such works fall on the people of North Cornwall, or indeed the people of the wider south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/5">We must consider not just the scale of the charges, as hon. Members have said, but the disparity between charges faced by the people in the south-west and those elsewhere. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon said, this is not just a problem faced by those on lower incomes, but a matter of what people, whatever their income, should realistically be prepared to expect as an outgoing compared with those in other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/6">A number of solutions have been proposed. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase> talked about amending legislation, which raised the possibility of reawakening the idea of equalisation across the country. I am looking with interest to see what proposals the Government have to tackle this matter, and I hope the Minister can enlighten us.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/7">I was slightly concerned to hear the views of my Conservative opponent in the general election, who, in a debate on Radio Cornwall, decided that the best way to tackle high water charges was to build more reservoirs. He thought that the problem was a shortage of water and that if we had more water, the cost would come down. He could not say how the new reservoirs would be funded nor what bearing such proposals would have on the costs faced by the water consumer, but perhaps his colleague <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" name="Bill Wiggin">the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin)</phrase> can enlighten me.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/8">It is fair to say that water charges is probably the biggest issue facing those of all political parties the south-west. Indeed, it is the biggest issue facing people in Devon, Cornwall and the south-west in their day-to-day lives, when they have a family budget to balance. It is therefore vital that the Government come forward with proposals to address this issue. The hon. Members for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) and for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) said that they hope to bring pressure to bear on the Government. I hope that they do so and that this debate keeps the subject in forefront of the Government's mind as they consider their programme for this Parliament.

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Taylor. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> on securing this debate. We have heard some good and thoughtful contributions this morning. There is significant agreement on the problem, but perhaps not quite on what the solution might be.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">We are reminded that a Government of some 30 years ago, in thinking about equalisation, recognised that there were two fundamental problems even then, pre-privatisation. They revolved around affordability and fairness, which are at the heart of this debate. Of course, there is a fundamental difference between charging for water and charging for sewerage services. If we consider the comparators in terms of water provision, we do not find much difference among many of the water companies throughout the country. It is in the sewerage department&mdash;if that is the right phrase&mdash;that we see the greatest disparity. That is because of the environmental clean-up and the significant costs of the infrastructure, which has already been mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/3">We are talking about vital public services that are essential to every household. Now that we have gone into privatisation, they remain, effectively, a tax, which people have to pay. They cannot even decide to use an alternative supplier, unlike in energy, where they can use different suppliers. It is impossible for us in the south-west to decide that Severn Trent looks a better option and ask it to supply our water or take away our sewage. We have no choice; we have to pay South West Water. We have gone from a public to a private monopoly. The unintended although perhaps not unknown consequence is that the problems we experience in the south-west have been exacerbated by privatisation, although the issue is of course linked to the green dowry and how it was introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/4">With the winter fuel payment, the Government acknowledge that there are energy pressures on low-income households, but nothing is provided to assist people with the vital public service of water. It was therefore unsurprising that the Select Committee, of which I was a member, looked carefully at affordability. Its excellent 19th report of the 2003&ndash;04 Session says:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/5" class="indent">&quot;People on low incomes in areas with high charges can therefore face acute problems. The Government's own figure for affordability of water is that less than 3 per cent. of income should be spent on water charges. But WaterVoice argued that, based on the draft determination, by 2010 pensioners in the South West would be paying almost 11 per cent. of their disposable income on water and sewerage charges . . . Ofwat concludes that average water bills would increase by 17 per cent. over the period to 2010, which compares with WaterVoice's forecast that typical measured bills in the South West would increase by 29 per cent. and typical unmeasured bills by 35 per cent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/6">Those astronomical figures show the urgency with which the situation must be tackled. They are projections based on current figures that have been agreed. We have recognised the unfairness in some situations, and the most prominent example is that of second homes. People who occupy their second homes very infrequently and make certain that they are on a meter pay significantly less than their next door neighbours, who live in their homes all the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/7">Various solutions have been suggested over a number of years. If it were easy, I suppose it would have been done, but it is not easy and it still must be done. Equalisation may well be a way forward and it can take place in different forms. Clearly, what was intended under the Water Charges Equalisation Act 1977 would not be appropriate now, but there are other options. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon pointed out, privatisation does not provide a bar to looking at equalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/8">Tax and benefits might also offer a possibility. Paragraph 29 of the chapter on affordability in the Select Committee report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/9" class="indent">&quot;In addition, it is conducting a cross-Government review of the ways in which low income groups are helped to pay. However, WaterVoice told us that the review had so far taken rather a narrow view of the options available for helping those on low incomes with their water bills and that the possibility of offering further help though the benefits and tax credits system has effectively been dismissed. If this proves to be the case, WaterVoice told us that it would be necessary to consider meeting the costs of programmes for the wider public benefit, such as those associated with cleaning up bathing waters or protecting special environmental areas, through general taxation. At present, it seems that the Government is reluctant to consider either option.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/10">As the Government are not interested in tax and benefits, general taxation or equalisation, it is difficult to see just where they will look for the elusive solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/11">A small point about the most recent regulator agreement to the increase in water charges was missed&mdash;the corporation tax treatment of the water companies. That was different when these privatised companies were set up, because the Government recognised that the pipes&mdash;the infrastructure&mdash;were the assets and needed special treatment. That has run its course. Part of the increase is an increase in tax to the Treasury. Will the Minister take up the cudgels with his Treasury colleagues and say that part of that extra corporation tax, which was a total windfall to them and perhaps even a stealth tax, could be used in this equalisation solution?</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/12">Finally, I end where I began&mdash;discussing the situation of 30 years ago. I shall quote a letter to the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment from Water Voice dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-11">11 February 2005</phrase>. No doubt it will form part of the discussions tomorrow. Dr. Noel Olsen, the chairman, says in his last paragraph:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/13" class="indent">&quot;Nearly 30 years after recognisation by Parliament of the problem the time has come for effective solutions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/14">I say amen to that.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.0/1">No wonder people are worried about the cost of their water bills when customers of at least eight water companies face increases of over 15 per cent. this year alone. Indeed, customers of Dwr Cymru&mdash;Welsh Water&mdash;face a &pound;34 increase. This argument is not about privatisation. Dwr Cymru is not a for-profit company. The argument is about legislation and the cost implications of the rules with which water companies must comply. Of course, the Liberal Democrats were bound to try to blame the Conservatives for privatisation, but we all know that this argument does not follow. Privatised industries can work effectively and efficiently, given the right legislative framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/2">South West Water is the smallest water company and it has had to invest vast amounts to comply with European legislation. Ofwat's international comparison of water and sewerage, published in March 2004, also found that 19 per cent. of households have revenue outstanding from their water bills, creating collection costs of about &pound;10 to &pound;20 per indebted customer. This extra cost exacerbates the problem. At the end of 2004, long-term customer debt totalled &pound;527 million. It is plain that water charges are unmanageable for many bill payers.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/3">With increases to bills, these debts are set to grow. If water companies are to face customer debts on such a scale, that could lead to even greater price increases to compensate. The Government simply cannot ignore the serious need to address the impact of water bill rises on low and fixed-income customers. The attempts to cover over the cracks through cost reductions to the most vulnerable groups can work only to a certain extent. More often than not, it simply results in other customers having to subsidise the bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/4">We need to know whether the Government are trying hard enough. At the end of 2004, Water Voice reported that the Government's attempts to consider the increase in water charges had resulted in</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/5" class="indent">&quot;a completely inadequate package of measures that fails to address the real problems of water affordability.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/6">To avoid perpetuating and escalating the problems, more work must be done to look into alternatives for payments, action against customers who can afford to pay but will not, and the performance of water companies. It is the Government's job to intervene on the social aspects of water supply&mdash;precisely those that have recently been allowed to get so out of hand.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.1/1">Will the hon. Lady forgive me if I make a bit of progress? I will give way later if I have time.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/2">Water Voice commented that</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the Government must take responsibility for finding solutions&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/4">because of the &quot;political and social dimensions&quot; of affordability and water debt. It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/5" class="indent">&quot;It is not appropriate that the water companies, as private enterprises, should assess customers' individual circumstances and ability to pay their water bills, or to move away from&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/6">accepted</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/7" class="indent">&quot;cost reflective charging principles.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/8">The Government are clearly failing to control the impact of increased water rates on many people and businesses. How can the Government seriously claim to be helping families and first-time buyers of homes when those people face ever-increasing taxes and bills on top of the cost of their home? How can the Government expect to foster the growth of enterprise and business when, on top of all the other red tape and taxes they have thrust upon us, our businesses face some of the highest water charges in Europe? As Ofwat's international comparison also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Prices to business customers in England and Wales, according to a survey by NUS consulting, are towards the upper end of the range in Europe, and increasing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/10">Indeed, Britain was the only country in Europe, apart from Spain, where water bills for businesses increased between 1997 and 2001. This Government have overseen large and ineffective increases in water charges. This Government have aggravated the water charges situation with tax increases that rapidly multiply the running costs for our water companies. The increase in national insurance has impacted on all water companies and, of course, that is reflected in the price of water.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.17.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" speakername="Bill Wiggin" colnum="17"  time="010:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h01.htm#50614h01_spnew33">
	<p pid="a.17.5/1">I am sorry that that is the depth of wisdom at which the hon. Lady chose to intervene&mdash;a ridiculous suggestion. Of course I will not apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/2">This Government's periodic price review of water supply has resulted in continuing increases in water charges, although in many areas the quality of water still remains unacceptable. Despite the cost of water and sewerage services reaching unprecedented levels, Ofwat's international comparison found that 15 per cent. of water supply zones did not comply with regulatory requirements for the level of iron in the water supply in 2001&ndash;02, that 2.8 per cent. failed to reach regulatory requirements for pesticide levels and that more than 1 per cent. failed to comply with the requirements for nitrate and aluminium levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/3">We all accept the need for investment in water infrastructure to improve water quality and protect the environment, but the Government are failing to do enough to ensure that the efficiency of those actions is maximised. As the chairman of Water Voice Wales commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/4" class="indent">&quot;We are way short of twenty-first century standards with measures to prevent company sewers discharging their contents into customers' homes. The industry and government need to be realistic about current priorities and focus on the most pressing needs of customers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/5">There are so many opportunities to look into the costs of matters such as cleaning up pollutants in our water supply. If we are to avoid further deterioration in the water charges crisis affecting some of the most vulnerable people in Britain, the Government must accept that there is a problem. When Water Voice reports a near doubling of complaints in the north-west in the past two years and an 87 per cent. increase in the Wessex area between March 2004 and 2005&mdash;just two examples of a wider problem&mdash;something is clearly massively wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/6">The Government are not delivering and the need for more to be done to bring savings to water customers is obvious. The Government must look into all the options to help people in some of the most disadvantaged areas, who face the highest water bills in the UK, not least by ensuring that our water companies can operate in the most efficient and cost-effective environment, rather than one dominated by red tape and ever-increasing taxes.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/7">I am sure the Minister will tell us what happened to the windfall tax of some &pound;107 million, which was supposedly levied to create jobs under the new deal. I wonder how many of those were actually created.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.3/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> on securing this important debate and pay tribute to the high standard of the thoughtful and constructive speeches from Back Benchers who have contributed. I particularly acknowledge the work of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>, who has raised this subject, which is so important for the people of Devon and Cornwall, on many occasions in the House. In the past, she was ably joined as their champion by my friend Candy Atherton, the former Member for Falmouth and Camborne. I learned of her absence from the House with particular regret.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/2">My constituency, which is in the south-west, is not, I am happy to say, in the South West Water area. I pay my bills to Wessex Water, but I and my ministerial colleagues&mdash;not least the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>&mdash;are particularly concerned about the effect of water bills on those who are least able to pay. That is particularly serious in the south-west, where there are already relatively high water charges. I noticed a little flurry when I mentioned my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. Of course, ministerial responsibility lies with my hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, but I know that as a south-west Member and water charge payer the Under-Secretary is very concerned about the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/3">I hope it will be helpful if I sketch out the Government's room for manoeuvre. In considering the problem of South West Water bills we are between a rock and a hard place. The rock is the framework of water industry regulation&mdash;a system put in place on privatisation by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase> in his previous incarnation as an environment Minister in 1989. The system deliberately takes much of the responsibility for the water industry out of Ministers' hands and puts it into the hands of private sector companies and their regulators. The hard place is the way that costs in the south-west have been concentrated into high bills, with a complex infrastructure in a sparsely populated area serving a limited number of bill payers.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/4">Providing necessary water and sewerage services as efficiently as possible is the responsibility of South West Water, and it is not for me to be that company's voice in Parliament&mdash;it must speak for itself. The economic regulation of water companies is the responsibility of the Ofwat, the independent economic regulator, and, equally, it is not for me to enter into a detailed justification of the exact price limits that it has set.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/5">Each region, as well as each company and its customers, has its own problems and priorities. Costs such as bathing water improvements may have affected the south-west most heavily in the past, but problems such as nitrate removal, sewer flooding and the replacement of worn out infrastructure are at their worst in other parts of the country. Some aspects of the Thames Water system need to be cleaned up, and the north-west has conurbations with a large stock of Victorian infrastructure that needs expensive maintenance and renewal.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/6">The quality regulators&mdash;the Environment Agency and the drinking water inspectorate&mdash;have secured benefits to customers. Revenue from customers and funding from investors have funded a programme of improvements in the south-west. The next five-year programme will enable the company to invest &pound;760 million to carry out a bigger programme to maintain pipes, sewers and treatment works. Further improvements in water quality will be achieved, for example, by the renovation of more than 3,200 km of water mains in the region; an investment programme to improve rivers and coastal waters involving, for example, the upgrade of 40 sewage treatment works, which will, I hope, include action on the stink to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" name="Alison Seabeck">the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> referred; and resolution or alleviation of internal flooding from overloaded sewers&mdash;a problem to which the hon. Member for North Devon referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/7">That is the company's programme. It is for Ofwat to ensure that it is funded to deliver its services at least cost. Ofwat argues that it has done much to keep the increase down. The company's proposal in its business plan was for an increase almost 40 per cent. higher than that which Ofwat eventually allowed. An average increase of more than &pound;120 over five years has been reduced to &pound;89. That 25 per cent. increase is the same as I received from Wessex Water, and it almost matched the increase of 1 per cent. less that customers of Thames Water and Welsh Water received.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/8">I have sketched out the rock and the hard place, as well as how the regulator and the company work. It is reasonable for hon. Members to ask what the Government will do to help with this serious problem. We have heard a lot about that problem, but little in the way of solutions&mdash;indeed, none at all from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" name="Bill Wiggin">the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin)</phrase>, who speaks alone on this issue for the Tory party. There have, however, been some suggestions.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/9">The Government have taken action, through legislation, to alleviate water poverty where there might be a risk to household health. We have legislated to prevent the disconnection of household water due to inability to pay, and we have set up protection for vulnerable people on meters, who might otherwise cut back on water that they cannot afford. I shall return to that issue if there is time.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/10">The hon. Member for North Devon talked a lot about equalisation, as did many other hon. Members. That solution would involve shifting the burden on to national taxpayers or water customers in other parts of the country, depending on the mechanism introduced. I am not yet persuaded that it would be right to subsidise South West Water's investment either through a national fund drawing money from all water companies or by public subsidy from taxation. Any such solution would overturn the legislative and regulatory framework&mdash;a system that has delivered significant efficiency savings nationally, which have been passed on to customers, although I accept that those savings have not been delivered so well to many people in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/11">There is considerable risk that any national fund would weaken the connection between water companies and their customers, and it is questionable whether they would pay as much heed to their customers if customers throughout the country met the cost of their plans. There would be a lack of accountability and a weakening of the driver that encourages individual companies to keep their costs as low as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/12">I was interested to hear the hon. Member for North Devon say that one can impose a levy and make it work in the private sector. He cited, most extraordinarily, rail privatisation as an example of something that worked. I would hesitate to say that that is a good example, as problems remain in that system.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.0/1">I agree with the Minister about the shortcomings of rail privatisation and how it came about. I was trying to make the point that the concept is not completely novel and that the principle of manipulating a market in which private sector players operate has already been established.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.1/1">I accept that, and I am sure that the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment will examine the hon. Gentleman's suggestions, as he will all those made today.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/2">The use of the tax and benefit system was raised by, among others, the hon. Members for North Devon and for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), and my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton. Indeed, the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall used the example of the winter fuel payment, which has gone a long way to address some problems that the elderly have in paying their fuel bills. However, that involves a flat rate and a universal benefit, which makes it easier to administer, and it is not geographically focused.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/3">My concern about water is that the tax credit and benefit systems do not provide targeted support for the costs of particular goods and services&mdash;I am not aware of any exceptions to that based on discrete problems in one region. Extending the range of goods and services the costs of which are directly supported through tax credits or benefits in a targeted way would complicate the system and increase administration costs. The Government are not minded to introduce an explicit link between the tax and benefit system and water charges.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">My point was not to do with a particular problem in a particular geographical area. The problem could be national, because there are low-paid households in difficulty in other parts of the country. My point was about the discrepancy in the percentage of income being spent on water charges. The Government recognise that 3 per cent. should be the average and 11 per cent. is clearly way beyond that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.22.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" colnum="22"  time="010:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h01.htm#50614h01_spnew44">
	<p pid="a.22.0/1">I accept to some extent what the hon. Gentleman says, which is why we have pursued the vulnerable groups regulations to deal with people with particular problems, and they are applied nationally. However, the debate has been about the extra costs that South West Water customers pay compared with others. We cannot deal with that through the national tax and benefit system because there would be a geographical focus, which would be difficult to introduce.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the vulnerable groups regulations, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" name="Adrian Sanders">the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton. They asked whether we would further extend the range of those regulations, and I can tell them that DEFRA, Ofwat and Water Voice are meeting to discuss that.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/3">The hon. Member for North Devon and my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton raised the issue of second homes. There is a particularly large number of second homes in the south-west, including in my constituency. The Government recognise that there are issues as to the balance between the fixed costs of a network and costs that vary according to how much water is used. I certainly agree that second-home owners should pay their fair share.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/4">My hon. Friend also suggested that the Government should facilitate water company mergers, and she has done interesting work on the subject, but there are currently no plans to do that. In the first place, it is not for the Government to tell companies whether to merge. Ministers are rightly removed from decisions on mergers. The legal regime for water mergers leaves the decision on what would be in the interests of competition and customers to the Competition Commission, with the advice of Ofwat. In any case, it is not proven that mergers would produce economies of scale. Ofwat's view, based on a 2004 study, is that no significant economies of scale would be achieved through water industry mergers.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/5">Nor should proponents of mergers assume that the bills of a merged company would be averaged out, which is perhaps the most telling point for me. I understand that there may be issues involving the number of customers paying for a large and complicated network, but when companies with higher and lower water bills have merged in the past, the bills of the customers of the combined company have not been averaged out.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/6">The regulator has considered it his duty to protect the customers of the lower-charging company from losing out&mdash;thus constraining increases&mdash;which has equally meant that the bills of customers of the higher-charging company have not been averaged down. I am sure we will want to explore that solution with hon. Members, but we would have to address some very basic problems if we went down that road.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/7">So, what can we do? I have done what everybody else has done: talked about the problems and the problems with the solutions. That is the trap in this debate. The Government acknowledge that there is an issue of water affordability. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee's 2003 report on water pricing recommended that the Government review how poorer households are helped with their water and sewerage charges. That we have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/8">Last year, a cross-Government steering group reviewed the matter. A wide range of stakeholders were involved in discussions and a report was published last December. It concluded that a range of measures is already in place to assist lower-income households with their water and sewerage charges but that there is scope for improving those measures in the near term.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/9">The Government, Ofwat and the water industry are looking to progress the issues identified in the report. The principal recommendations included setting up a local pilot scheme to target water affordability assistance to lower-income households; studying how water meters affect households, with a particular emphasis, obviously, on lower-income households; extending the vulnerable groups scheme; extending the list of vulnerable group qualifying medical conditions that determine eligibility for help; encouraging water companies to deliver best practice on key affordability and debt issues; and asking Ofwat to review debt guidelines in 2006 to update and promote good practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.0/1">I am listening carefully to the Minister's description of the pilot scheme. I am interested to learn that it might involve some extension on the medical conditions, and I would be grateful if he confirmed that. Can he also make available to us an up-to-date report on how the pilot is progressing? The issue will, no doubt, be discussed at the meeting with Water Voice tomorrow.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.1/1">I can certainly ask the Department to look into giving my hon. Friend that update. The extension on vulnerable groups is one of the things identified in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/2">The pilot study, which will be held in the south-west region as an explicit acknowledgment of the problem it faces, will offer households assistance with accessing advice on saving water, installing water-efficient appliances and devices, and checking for water leakage. It will also undertake benefits checks, allowing us to deal specifically with entitlement problems in a locality, check for eligibility under the water direct scheme and the vulnerable groups tariff, offer advice on debt management and check to see whether switching to a metered supply could be cheaper, which, in many cases, it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/3">South West Water customers have to pay more for their water and sewerage services than customers in other regions as a result of privatisation, which required each customer to pay the costs incurred by their water company. Regional variations in scale were, and are, inevitable over time. Identifying the problems, however, does not mean that there are easy solutions. So far, none of the ideas that have been suggested fully solve the problem in interests of customers. We will be running the pilot study and will look carefully at how it works to see whether any solutions arise from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/4">Ministers are engaged in the ongoing search for a solution, and although we are yet to find one, we certainly have not given up. The pilot study in the south-west will focus our efforts to help the most vulnerable customers where that help is most needed. I have no doubt that many lessons will be learned from that work, and we will be able to take those lessons forward when we consider long-term solutions to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/5">I have listened carefully to the points that have been made&mdash;I know that officials have, too&mdash;and the views of hon. Members will be fed back to the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment. I hope and trust that South West Water and Ofwat have listened equally carefully to hon. Members from both sides of the House, who have voiced so well the concerns of the majority of customers in Devon and Cornwall.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this debate on an issue of huge importance not just to my constituents but to the whole of the midlands and beyond. At the start, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Deputy Minister for Women and Equality on her appointment to the Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">Last Friday I attended a meeting held by the administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers for MG Rover's creditors. The creditors heard that they were unlikely to get much, perhaps even any, of their money back. I doubt that many will have been surprised by that, but there was a clear message from that meeting that they wanted some answers. My constituents, and the 6,100 former MG Rover workers, also want some answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">The problem is not so much the fact that MG Rover was unable to survive. Everybody knew that for a long-term future, the company needed a partner. That was clearly and openly stated when Phoenix took over in 2000. It was equally clear at that time that there was never any guarantee that that would happen. The issue is much more the manner in which the collapse took place, and what led up to it. Why did the talks with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, which had been presented as far advanced, finally come to nothing? What happened about intellectual property rights, and had people been misled? Was there something fundamentally wrong with how Phoenix Venture Holdings had structured the businesses and run their affairs?</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4">I am pleased that the Secretary of State has launched a thorough investigation. I know that some had political motives for rubbishing that investigation before it had even started, but I do not think that my constituents will be any more prepared to allow themselves to be used for such party political posturing than they were during the election. They simply want the truth, so I ask the Minister to confirm today that there will be no no-go areas for the investigation, and that the intention is for its results to be made public.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/5">I advise some caution on the part of those who are now attacking the fact that Phoenix ever took over Longbridge following BMW's withdrawal in 2000, but who welcomed it, or even claimed credit for it, at the time. On the other side of the fence, I also urge some humility on the part of the &quot;we told you so&quot; brigade, including people who for a variety of reasons&mdash;some probably linked to self-interest&mdash;lobbied against Phoenix in 2000 and who relentlessly briefed against the company in public and in private thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/6">Of course there were real questions, which emerged over the past four years, about the actions of the Phoenix directors. I have asked them a number of those questions to their faces in the past four years, but I must say that the endless scattergun stream of anti-Rover stories that have appeared in the press probably ended up getting in the way of proper scrutiny rather than promoting it. It also undoubtedly encouraged a bunker mentality on the part of the company. Whatever the Phoenix four may have been responsible for, I also believe that the endless public belittling of MG Rover by its detractors played a role in depressing both sales and confidence and in hastening the company's demise. Make no mistake, there is still real anger about that among former MG Rover employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/7">I would also caution against the selective amnesia of those who claim that Phoenix took over Rover only because the Government somehow forced BMW to choose it in preference to a rival bid from the Alchemy venture capital firm. It is true that the Government, supported by the unions and local politicians including me, encouraged BMW to talk to Phoenix and seriously consider its bid rather than maintain exclusive negotiations with Alchemy.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/8">However, we must remember that the Phoenix deal was done overnight on 8 and <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-09">9 May 2000</phrase>. Alchemy had pulled out of its negotiations with BMW on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-28">28 April</phrase>, when it still had exclusive negotiating rights, so when Phoenix took over in May, the alternative was closure, with many more thousands of job losses even than there have been this year. Although the Phoenix deal meant that MG Rover workers had five years' pay that they would not have had if the plant had closed in 2000, one of the tragedies and injustices of the collapse has been that those workers have now lost their jobs, having bought the time for others to keep theirs.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.0/1">May I emphasise the fact that in West Bromwich, West an enormous number of second, third and even fourth-tier suppliers have said that that five years has enabled them to diversify their markets? That means that the potential impact in my constituency is significantly less than it would have been four or five years ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.1/1">There is consensus among serious commentators that the closure or massive downsizing of Longbridge in 2000 would have led to a great many job losses. I pay tribute to the work done by Advantage West Midlands, the Industry Forum, the suppliers and the manufacturing advisory service in encouraging the supply base to diversify.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">I served on the Trade and Industry Committee at that time, and it was obvious to us that had Alchemy taken over, there would have been a bigger catastrophe than there is now. Five years down the road, people tend to forget what the circumstances were. We spent many hours on the issue&mdash;hon. Members can look at the report. It was not something that we took lightly. We went to the site and spoke to everybody concerned, and it became apparent that despite press statements to the contrary, Alchemy was perceived to be an asset stripper.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.26.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" speakername="Richard Burden" colnum="26"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h02.htm#50614h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.26.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Had the Alchemy deal happened, it would not have been in the interests of Longbridge, the company or the supply chain. However, we should remember that there was no Alchemy deal on the table when the Phoenix deal was done. The choice was between Phoenix and closure.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.3/2">I am sure that the Phoenix directors would like to be remembered for having helped to buy the time that we have been talking about, during which the region pursued a brave but ultimately unsuccessful strategy. However, it is difficult to square that with some of the subsequent decisions, which meant that the company's failure cost the employees a lot more than their jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.3/3">The car leasing policy that was promoted internally left employees exposed to unsustainable debts in the event of company failure, and failure meant that employees' pensions could be put at risk. The company's suppliers know only too well that the risks were transferred to them from Phoenix&mdash;as do the retailers, who found themselves with responsibility for stock worth a lot less than the debts that Phoenix had encouraged them to incur with finance companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.3/4">Having left others so seriously exposed to the effects of failure, the Phoenix directors appear to have systematically insulated themselves from those effects through the proceeds of multi-million pound loan notes and pension pots. That is not morally sustainable. The gains that the Phoenix directors awarded themselves should be put to work for the benefit of those who have lost so much, and whose needs are, to speak bluntly, greater than those of the Phoenix four.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on having secured this important debate. What happens to the existing pensioners depends on how the situation plays out. I am sure that, like me, the hon. Gentleman has constituents who retired between 2000 and 2004 and who will be very badly hit if the pension fund is drawn into the Pension Protection Fund. Will he join me in calling on the Minister to consider that injustice towards approximately 200 pensioners who retired during that time, and whose pension terms will be fundamentally altered from what, during the intervening years, they were led to believe that they would retire with?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.27.1/1">The hon. Lady pre-empts something that I was going to say a little later&mdash;but I am not sure whether 200 is the correct number for those affected by the Phoenix pension fund. In fact, several of those people would be secure in the BMW pension fund, but the principle behind the issue that she raises is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2">I am pleased that the Phoenix directors appear to be taking up a suggestion that I put to them last year at the Trade and Industry Committee by putting the remaining assets of Phoenix Venture Holdings into a trust for employees. It would also be useful to know if any funds are left in the company Techtronic. However, if the Phoenix four are concerned about how history will judge them, which I am sure they are, they also need to contribute from what they awarded themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/3">It would be arrogant for anyone with an involvement in or after 2000 not to consider whether the courses of action that we took then were the right ones, or for anyone to take the view that it was all everyone else's fault. I do not believe, however, that the unions, or any of us, were wrong to look for an alternative to the massive downsizing or closure of Longbridge. Nor do I believe that it was wrong to try to buy time for the region to adjust, or to allow time for a partner to be sought to secure the future of Longbridge. The Labour Government were right not to turn their back on Rover in 2000, as the Tories turned their backs on so much manufacturing in the 1980s. Indeed, what has happened in the past five years does not indicate that there was too much Government intervention in 2000. Perhaps there should have been more.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/4">The days of old-style intervention and nationalisation are long gone, and rightly so, but I ask Ministers to consider the possibility that those of us who have argued at different times in the past five years for the Government to consider acquiring a strategic stake in the company, or other forms of leverage, may have had a point. Perhaps that could have played a role in allowing greater transparency and more investment in new products without falling foul of European Union rules, and perhaps even boosted MG Rover's credibility in its search for international partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/5">Public authorities should reflect on how their own procurement policies hastened MG Rover's demise. Why do we so rarely see a British police car that has been built in Britain, such as a Rover or a Jaguar, when one would never see a French police car built anywhere but France, or a German police car built outside Germany?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/6">I do, however, pay tribute to the speed with which the Government reacted to the failure of MG Rover&mdash;paying employees' wages while attempts were made to restart negotiations with SAIC, establishing the MG Rover taskforce and building on the lessons of 2000&mdash;and to the preparations made since then. Credit is also due to the members and partner agencies of the task force, led by Advantage West Midlands, for the fact that it moved so quickly to bring Jobcentre Plus, the learning and skills council, the colleges, the Department of Trade and Industry and other agencies to process redundancy payments, to draw up individual training plans and to assist with job search for employees affected, all while working with business to provide support to give companies in the supply chain a breathing space to react to the collapse. I am sure that the Minister will give the figures on that, so I shall not take up time doing so here.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/7">I also pay tribute to all those, including Birmingham city council's neighbourhood office staff and the staff of other statutory agencies and the voluntary sector, who have staffed helplines and provided support at a human level to the employees. Particular mention, however, must be made of the contribution made by the trade unions, especially by stewards who were also employees of MG Rover and of other affected companies, and who have experienced the same uncertainties and pain as those whom they are trying to help and advise.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/8">Let us not forget the families of MG Rover workers, led by Gemma Cartwright, whose efforts remind us all that this is not only about Longbridge the workplace, but about the communities that rely on it. Most of the challenges that they face still lie ahead. I hope that everyone will do what they can to build on the support that they have established.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/9">Before I finish, I shall mention some of the issues that remain to be resolved and some of the lessons for the future, which I ask the Minister to address in her winding-up speech. Conflicting provisions in benefit rules and redundancy regulations have been shown to get in the way of doing the right thing by employees with regard to pay in lieu of notice and in the speedy processing of protective awards claims. Those provisions have also been a disincentive to people obtaining new jobs until they know that the awards have been paid. That cannot be right, and needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/10">We need to reconsider the operation of barriers, such as the 16-hour rule in particular, that prevent people on benefits from accessing training. There has been a creative approach to that with those affected by the MG Rover collapse, but a more fundamental review is required if we are to promote rather than restrict flexibility and security in the labour market, and if we are to breed a culture that actively encourages people on benefits to learn and retrain rather than discouraging them. The taskforce needs to track how successful the training input is in creating opportunities for people to return to work. Incidentally, I also ask the Minister to ensure that the money for the exercise comes through properly, and does not get caught up in bureaucratic boundary disputes between Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/11">Thirdly, what happened to MG Rover has underlined why the Government were right to establish the Pension Protection Fund, but has also highlighted issues regarding the PPF rules. That relates to the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> made. I am pleased that Ministers have made it clear that they are determined to overcome the problems, and like the hon. Lady, I ask them to address the potentially perverse impact on people who have already taken early retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/12">MG Rover is an issue of significance to the entire west midlands and beyond. Many of the challenges for component manufacturers are yet to be felt, as emergency assistance starts to come to an end. The epicentre, however, is south-west Birmingham, whose identity has always been intertwined with Longbridge. It is an area with a massive concentration of MG Rover workers and their families, which means that it faces extraordinary challenges ahead, not just for months but for years. Although a lot has been done to diversify the west midlands and reduce its reliance on MG Rover in the past five years, a lot more remains to be done in the areas immediately surrounding the plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/13">It is surprising that despite the instability of MG Rover, south-west Birmingham is one of the few areas of the city that is not designated as a regeneration zone by the regional development agency. That creates ongoing problems for the area in accessing regeneration and other investment. The funding mechanisms available to south-west Birmingham need to reassessed, to upskill the people and to provide real opportunities, including physical opportunities, for redevelopment. Such issues should be at the forefront of Ministers' minds when they make decisions&mdash;for example, about how the Lyons review is implemented. I hope that they will respond positively to the exciting suggestion of creating a national centre for nanotechnology at the Longbridge site, and to the ideas about how the royal centre for defence medicine in Birmingham can develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/14">As for the future of car making at Longbridge, I ask Ministers to bear in mind the fact that the administrators have confirmed that three credible bidders are interested in MG sports car-based production, and that two may be interested in more extensive car production. Nobody should raise false hopes about the scale of what may be possible, and I do not want to do that. However, I would be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister would confirm that the Government will do everything they can to help retain sustainable car production at Longbridge, particularly as it becomes increasingly clear that the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation's acquisition of certain intellectual property rights for Rover cars and Powertrain engines means that a possible, if different, joint arrangement with a car producer at Longbridge could still make a great deal of sense. If my hon. Friend could give some comfort on that subject, I am sure that people in Longbridge and throughout the west midlands would be very pleased to hear it.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> on securing this debate. We share the Rover car plant between our two constituencies. The past few months have been gruesome in my constituency and elsewhere in the west midlands, although really it is the past few years that have been gruesome, as we have watched the slow death of MG Rover since BMW pulled out in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/2">It is worth going back over the history, because, as the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to learn, I rather dispute his view of how we got to where we are now, and of the decisions that the Government took. In 2000, when BMW announced that it was going to sell the car plant if it could, the then Secretary of State said that he had no idea that the Rover car company was in such great trouble. It beggars belief that anyone could be Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and not be aware of the difficulties of Britain's only domestic car maker. Nevertheless, that is what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1888" name="Stephen Byers">the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers)</phrase> said at the time. There is no question but that the Government, in a flat panic to try to put a sticking plaster over the difficulties that had been created by that announcement, ordered BMW to sell the car plant to Towers and the Phoenix consortium.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/3">When the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield says that there was no deal on the table to be done by Alchemy and Jon Moulton, because he pulled out before that period at the end of April&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.31.0/1">Proof is always difficult to get from this Government, because they try to hide from it most of the time. However, it is worth reviewing what was said at the time by the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for North Tyneside. He said that he was happy, and continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/2" class="indent">&quot;I would like to add my personal congratulations to John Towers for the way in which he pulled the consortium together and brought what I know have been difficult negotiations to a successful conclusion, he has been determined and dogged in the face of hostility and criticism.

	<p pid="a.31.0/3">How very prescient that was, certainly when it came to Mr. Towers' own pocket.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/5" class="indent">&quot;we have taken an active role to facilitate the commercial negotiations over the future of Rover . . . It was the Government who brought John Towers and BMW together for their first face-to-face meeting a month ago on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-10">10 April</phrase> and we have remained in contact with both parties throughout the negotiations.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2000-05-09.645"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 May 2000; Vol. 349, c. 645</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="a.32.8/1">I am sorry, but I shall not take any more interventions for the time being, as it is not fair to other hon. Members who wish to take part in the debate. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> says that I have been very generous. I agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.8/2">Just this morning I got an answer from the Minister in charge of the Motability scheme, and it is interesting to note that there is little support for our domestic car maker there either. Of 171,638 Motability cars bought with the help of Government funds last year, just 2,606 were bought from Rover.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.8/3">The company creaked on. There was a possible deal to be done with the Chinese, who basically took the Government and the PVH directors to the cleaners. They bought the intellectual property, but without the car plant, and without the future of production at Longbridge. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer went to China and failed to produce a deal, the writing was on the wall that the company would close, because without a foreign investor, it simply could not carry on.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.8/4">Ministers were left in something of a dilemma. The clock was ticking towards a general election, and they did not want the whole thing to blow up just beforehand. Sadly, it became clear to them that if they could not hang on to the situation, it was much better to let it blow up early in the general election rather than closer to polling day on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-05">5 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.8/5">I am sure that Labour Members will not believe me, but they might believe the business editor of <i>The</i> <i>Birmingham Post</i>, John Duckers, who also made this point. In his article of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-22">22 April</phrase> he wrote that when Ministers returned from China, the Government determined that they must not have a Rover crisis breaking in the days immediately before polling day. They dared not risk that happening, so they decided to dump the ailing car giant well ahead of polling day.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.8/6">John Duckers went on to quote a highly placed source:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.8/7" class="indent">&quot;'The election was happening and Labour could not afford something like this towards the end of the campaign. The Pope was dying, there was the Royal wedding between Charles and Camilla and that was concentrating attention.' Labour, he said, had to keep the issue controlled and so news management went into overdrive. No one is suggesting that the MG Rover might have necessarily been saved, but, it is maintained, the Government chose when it was to go down&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.8/8">I agree with that, bearing in mind the fact that the previous Secretary of State announced that the company would be going into receivership before the board had even decided that it would. The Government's complicity in this is clear. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am not surprised that Labour Members are having a fit about complicity in selling Rover to the PVH consortium, because the record of what PVH has done, and John Towers in particular&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.33.1/6">the PVH directors&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/7" class="indent">&quot;did what any ruthless entrepreneur would have done in their situation: incentivise, strip assets, take cash out early.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/8">That is exactly what the directors did. The &pound;427 million that BMW left for the company was put into a separate account for the benefit of the directors. Then the car-making plant was charged interest on the loan that it took from the &pound;427 million. They set up a separate little company for the car loan book, in which they have a 50 per cent. share, along with the bank, and of course they sold the entire site of Longbridge from under the feet of the company. The point is that now that the company is in administration&mdash;although obviously, we hope that some resurrection can take place&mdash;they simply do not own the land on which the car production facility sits, and St. Modwen would dearly love to use the land for something other than making cars, which has not been seen to make much money recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/9">John Towers and his fellow directors stand firmly in the dock accused of greed, asset stripping and taking the company, the employees and the Government for a ride. There is no question about that. Indeed, one particular fact says it all. As we all know, the car company was owned by BMW. Last year, BMW made &pound;2 billion, but its chairman, Helmut Panke, earns less than John Towers pays himself in a company that has never made a penny during the five years for which he has been in charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/10">It is interesting to note that when the previous Secretary of State was at the Birmingham motor show in May 2004, she defended the sums that the Rover directors had been awarding themselves. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/11" class="indent">&quot;I am very pleased with Rover's performance and I look forward to going to their stand to look at the new redesigned Rover 45. There was a very big risk involved when setting up Rover again when it looked likely to come to the end of the road for car manufacturing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/12">Quite what risks the PVH directors took, I find it difficult to establish, but their greed is clearly established, as is their &pound;16.5 million personal pension pot.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/13">Meanwhile, the other Rover car workers still face the worry about what will happen to their pension savings. That is one issue that I hope the Minister will do more to clarify, because there is considerable uncertainty. I have received written answers saying that the Government &quot;believe&quot; or that it is &quot;expected&quot; that something will happen, but there is no certainty that the Pension Protection Fund will kick in to protect the pension savings of the people represented by me and by many other hon. Members in the Chamber. We would like more clarity on that subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/14">As my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden said, we would also like the Minister to make clear the position of the workers who retired early, who feel particularly vulnerable about the application to the Pension Protection Fund. If that is the way forward, it will severely reduce their expected living standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/15">I would also be grateful if the Minister could establish for us how there can be an application to the Pension Protection Fund when the holding company of PVH is not in administration. My understanding is that until it is, there can be no application to the pension protection fund. How will we be able to engineer the moment when such an application can be made, as private assets are involved? What happens if the holding company does not go into administration? What happens to the Rover workers' pension savings, and how can we ensure that people receive the money that they have saved for their retirement? Some clarity on that issue would be particularly helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/16">I understand that an inquiry is going on, but I should also be grateful if the Minister clarified whether the pension pot provided for the directors could be included in the general pension pot, so that everyone had to share the shortfall in the payout at the end of the day. Although I represent many Rover workers, I also represent many other people who are not Rover workers, but whose pensions will be subject to a levy to cover the shortfall at the plant's pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/17">Although I welcome that, it is grossly unfair to put a levy on other workers' pensions because funds have been stolen from the pension fund and the Rover company's assets, which rightly belong to the creditors for payment of the liabilities, and to the pension fund. It is important that we fill that pot as much as possible from the potentially stolen assets, to ensure that when we pay out on what is effectively an insurance policy, the arrangement is fair, and someone else has not run off with the money and forced the rest of us to pick up the pieces. I should be grateful if the Minister talked about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/18">I, too, pass on my thanks for the efforts that have gone into the taskforce. I thank all the people who manned the phone lines, organised the training and tried to establish job opportunities for people. The Minister will be aware that at the moment the job situation still looks rather bleak; slightly more than 500 people have jobs, but 6,100 people are unemployed. I hope that that situation will change and that people will be in a position to find new well-paid jobs when the redundancy money finally comes through. However, at the moment the picture is not as good as we might have hoped, bearing in mind the efforts that have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/19">Will the Minister set out exactly how much money has been paid from Government funds into the taskforce? I understand that at yesterday's meeting there was a fair amount of muttering about the fact that moneys had not been forthcoming, and there was a view that the impetus from the Government had disappeared, as some weeks had passed since the general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/20">Will the Minister clarify how much money has been paid over? A steady stream of my constituents have been expecting to have some training, which has not been forthcoming. They have not even been put on a training course. A good example of that arrived by e-mail just yesterday. Someone who wants to take a plastering course that costs approximately &pound;400&mdash;to learn a skill that seems highly relevant, as there is a shortage of plasterers in our region&mdash;is being turned down by the learning and skills council, which is part of the taskforce. There have been significant problems with how training has been forthcoming for many workers, although there have been some success stories.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.1/1">I feel that I am eating into other people's time&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;You certainly are.&quot;] I shall simply say that I would be grateful if the Minister clarified the money position as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/2">What of the future? The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield made great play of saying that there was no future other than Phoenix Venture Holdings and the activities of the directors. However, had Alchemy taken over back in 2000, there would have been a &pound;50,000-plus pay-off for the workers. Some 2,000 people would have been employed in making MG sports cars, and suppliers would have produced component parts for MG sports cars made at Longbridge.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/3">It is pretty sad that because we now have a fire sale, as opposed to an organised sell-off of the car plant and its land, we may well not see the resurrection of car making&mdash;not even under the very successful MG sports car brand&mdash;on the site at all. That is particularly bitter-sweet, because this year is the original Austin works' 100th anniversary, which will be celebrated in Cofton park in my constituency. The company was the pinnacle of British engineering, innovation and design over the past 100 years, and it is very sad that this particular year should see its demise. Because this is effectively a fire sale, it will be particularly difficult to resurrect the company. Nevertheless, we hope that that will be the case, and that we will have something more to celebrate by <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-08">8 July</phrase>, with that niche player coming back into the market.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.0/1">I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I want to focus on the issue of training and its evaluation, which has been raised by other Members, but there are a few points that I want to make first.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/2">I welcome the inquiry; it is important that we should know exactly what happened. Some of the arguments have been put in context today: things sound different when one reads the quotes that people gave at the time. Those of us with slightly longer memories hope that the inquiry will also recall how Rover came to be in the hands of BMW in the first place, and how the tie-up with Honda&mdash;one of Rover's most successful periods&mdash;was severed by the actions of the Conservative Government, in what workers in the area would describe as industrial vandalism. I hope that the inquiry will look at the whole picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/3">I welcome what the taskforce and the regional development agency appear to have achieved in the short period of two months or so. I was intrigued to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1460" name="Julie Kirkbride">the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride)</phrase>, a member of the taskforce, ask about the training components. I hope to find, when I read the minutes, that she has been asking such demanding questions there too, because it would be a bit pointless if she were only asking them here, when she has been afforded such an opportunity elsewhere. I look forward to seeing the taskforce's work.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/4">Many of us were at a meeting with the representatives of the taskforce last week in the House of Commons, at which I was interested to hear that it intends to write up the whole experience, so that for the future we will have a model of what can be done if we have to face job losses on this scale again in any part of the country. That is a welcome process, and I look forward to reading about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/5">We will be able to read about the input and the actions of the taskforce. Welcome though those are now, we do not know what will happen to the affected people, many of whom are to receive further training&mdash;some short- term, some in higher education&mdash;which I also welcome. I believe that the hon. Lady said that slightly less than 10 per cent. of those people have found new jobs, but we do not know what will happen to the larger mass of affected people&mdash;those employed by MG Rover or related industries&mdash;and their families, many of whom live in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/6">We should look systematically at what happens to such people. I did not think that the answer afforded by taskforce representatives at last week's meeting was wholly convincing. It is not enough to assume that learning and skills councils will track the outcomes of training for those employees. If we are to have a report on Rover, what happened at the outset and what the taskforce did, we need to know about the outcomes, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/7">There is an argument, which I hope that the Minister will consider, for a systematic study of what happens to Rover workers and their families. I should like to know what training they had, how many of those training episodes had a successful outcome, how many people started small businesses, and how those businesses had fared by the end of, say, two years. I would also like to know how many people were forced to leave the area, as that will have implications for further work needed in similar situations. It is not sufficient to rely on the learning and skills council, not least because, as has been pointed out, about 40 per cent. of Rover workers do not live in Birmingham, so the work would involve more than one LSC.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that, in addition, we must consider the number of redundancies, how the suppliers have been affected and whether adequate training facilities are available&mdash;and whether a six-week training course is long enough?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.37.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1413" speakername="Stephen McCabe" colnum="37"  time="011:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h02.htm#50614h02_spnew37">
	<p pid="a.37.1/1">The short answer is that I do not know&mdash;but that is the point. I agree with my hon. Friend that if we are to hear the whole story and get the full picture, we need more than an inquiry and a taskforce report; we need the Government to agree to a systematic follow-up of the Rover workers and their families. Only then will we be able to answer questions about training, relocation, new starts, new businesses and types of training intervention. I would say that that has to be a formal piece of work. My instinct would be to give it to a university equipped to handle such a task.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">It will not be satisfactory simply to have an inquiry into what happened and a report on the inputs of the taskforce. If we are serious about it, we will need to know what lessons must be learned. We must follow up those workers&mdash;those 6,000 people and their families. We must know where they end up, what happens to them and what interventions are successful. I strongly urge the Minister to give serious consideration to make that part of the total picture of the Rover experience.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.37.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1420" speakername="John Hemming" colnum="37"  time="011:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h02.htm#50614h02_spnew38">
	<p pid="a.37.2/1">Those who have seen &quot;The Rotters' Club&quot; on the television or read the book may understand a little more about my links to MG Rover. Jonathan Coe, the author of the book, which is semi-autobiographical, travelled on the same bus as me to school in my teenage years, and we used to pass the Longbridge plant. The historic importance of Leyland and MG Rover in Birmingham cannot be denied.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/2">My history with the Phoenix consortium goes back to 2000, when I brought it together. The original arrangement was that I would chair the consequent company, but from the first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, in the offices of Old Mutual&mdash;previously Albert E. Sharp&mdash;it was clear that John Towers did not want any community or workforce scrutiny on the board, and although there was agreement for the work force to have shares, they ended up disfranchised and the shares were essentially worthless. In April, community scrutiny was pushed out using the argument that BMW would not do the deal if community representatives remained involved. I considered what might be needed to enforce a scrutiny process in 2003; I got no external support, but did receive legal threats from one of the Phoenix Venture Holdings directors.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/3">I have been known not to be positive about John Towers and his leadership of the company for five years. However, it is wrong simply to blame the directors for today's situation. Errors were made, but it took quite a few cooks to spoil this particular broth.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/4">The insolvency caused massive problems in the west midlands, not least because it was unexpected. The deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation had been running smoothly for some time. It involved a payment of more than &pound;200 million to MG Rover, which would have enabled us to discover the holy grail of a stable and profitable company working as part of an international manufacturing partnership, which is what everyone sought.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/5">Insolvency is a complex aspect of company law. The issue that matters is not whether a company is insolvent on a particular day, but whether the directors believe that it will be able to pay its debts. The important legal issue is wrongful trading; if the directors believe that the company would be wrongfully trading because it could not pay its debts, it should go into some form of insolvency. If they believe that things can come good, however, it can continue trading.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/6">At a board meeting held on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-17">17 December 2004</phrase>, it was recognised that the company was balance-sheet insolvent, and therefore depended on the SAIC deal being likely to happen in order to continue trading. A letter of intent was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-17">17 December 2004</phrase> that specified completion milestones. SAIC had paid &pound;37 million in September 2004 and &pound;30 million on 13th January 2005. There were people from Birmingham who had gone across to China. The deal was going forward. The intellectual property is of no value without the people who know how to do things. One could not do anything in isolation.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/7">This is where the Department of Trade and Industry got involved. Obviously, the company was burning cash, and a bridging loan was needed to handle its position until the Chinese Government could go through the regulatory processes and agree the deal. A due diligence exercise was undertaken by the DTI's accountants and lawyers, and the facility was approved in principle. Loan documentation was prepared and circulated. Within that period, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February 2005</phrase>, a revised letter of intent was signed by SAIC, Nanjing Automotive, the company and PVH, agreeing to a further cash amount of &pound;201.5 million, which would be paid progressively over a period.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase> in Shanghai&mdash;which was <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">7 April</phrase> in Birmingham&mdash;the DTI indicated to the Phoenix directors that they did not think that the conditions they had set for providing the loan would be achieved. Without the loan, the deal with SAIC could not go through. As soon as the deal with SAIC was unlikely to happen, the company was in wrongful trading. That is the key issue: how we got from a position in which a deal would have sorted everything out, to one where it went all wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/9">There were a few very odd things that came from the DTI&mdash;and this is where, to an extent, I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1460" name="Julie Kirkbride">the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride)</phrase>, although I disagree with her idea that we always knew we would end up here. I very much agree with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> said about there being no no-go areas for the inquiry, and the idea that nationally, MG Rover has been talked down. It was not the case that we always knew that we would be here. It would have been entirely possible for the deal with SAIC to continue. The fact that the interest there remains shows that that was entirely possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/10">I now come to the odd behaviour of the Department of Trade and Industry. The first thing was going public about the bridging loan on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase>. That was a massively sensitive piece of information. It had the effect of undermining credibility in the company, of increasing the working capital requirement by about &pound;50 million, and of leading traders to refuse to trade with the company the following week. That information should not have been made public.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/11">Secondly, the DTI announced that the company was going into administration. It is not up to the DTI to make that sort of decision. It is not up to the DTI Minister to tell the company to go into administration. Ministers may have a view, but they should keep it to themselves. They should not hold a press conference saying that the company is going into administration. It is a decision for the board to take.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.1/1">Yes, I do.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/2">There are three questions that the DTI needs to answer. Given the very real evidence that the bridging loan had been agreed and documented, what caused the U-turn and its subsequent disastrous results? Second, why did the DTI publicly undermine the credibility of the company, and in effect prevent it from trading? Third, why were DTI Ministers calling for the company to go into administration, and why was an announcement made by the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Tony Woodley that the company was going into administration?</p>

	<p pid="a.39.3/1">I have a lot of time for Tony Woodley. He has always worked very hard for his members. Whether he should have been there or not, the fact is that the announcement should not have been made by the DTI in the first instance. It was a totally inappropriate public announcement. Tony Woodley, however, has always tried to work as best he can to try to help the business to survive, so I would not wish to criticise him.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.0/1">I am sorry to have to clarify this again, but I am intrigued that the hon. Gentleman's view now appears to be that the DTI made a number of mistakes that undermined the company. Does he accept that on the Lib Dem website, as early as 2003, he was quoted as saying that he had doubts and suspicions about the way in which directors were extracting money and assets from the company? He was looking at the possibility of legal action to remove them from overall control. Are we now to forget his feelings and anxieties of that time? Is not it reasonable to think that the DTI might have shared some of his suspicions?</p>

	<p pid="a.40.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman had been listening to my speech earlier, he would have heard me mention that. I have always made the point that, putting aside the issue of money having been taken out of the company, the deal in question could have been done. We did not have to end up here. The DTI showed no interest in the governance issues at the time. My concern is about the behaviour of the DTI in undermining the company's trading position, doing a U-turn on the bridging loan, and doing a lot of damage throughout the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.2/1">My difficulty is that I can remember the events unfolding. As far as I recollect, until the time when the Chinese walked out of the room, the bridging loan was in place; the condition of the bridging loan was that the Chinese should sign the agreement. However, it was not just another loan; it was not just more money being pumped into the company. If I believed for a moment that a company whose directors knew it to be insolvent was apparently being given the backing of the Government, with an extra loan, to continue hoodwinking all its suppliers and its workers, I would be seriously concerned. Apparently, they are damned if they do and damned if they do not. Which is it?</p>

	<p pid="a.40.3/1">The complexity of the law is an important point in that respect. Someone is wrongfully trading if they think that things are going to go wrong. If they think that things will come good, and if they have good evidence for that, they are not wrongfully trading. The point that the hon. Gentleman raised is exactly the one that the inquiry needs to consider. Did SAIC actually pull out of the deal? When I was talking to Tony Woodley after the company went into administration it was clear that it was still talking to SAIC, which was still interested in trying to do a deal and had not lost interest in the commercial side of the business. My understanding is that concerns were raised by the advisers to the DTI about the stability of the residual business, and that that had caused some concerns with SAIC. However, as hon. Members are aware, because we have discussed it today, there were not any problems with the stability of the residual business.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.3/2">We are talking about an inquiry. I agree with the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield that there should not be any no-go areas. We must consider what actually happened: what switched the business from being solvent to being insolvent&mdash;from non-wrongful trading to wrongful trading. That is the critical issue to be determined.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.3/3">I may be wrong, but my understanding is that a precondition had been established by the DTI that the funds needed to go into an escrow account from SAIC. There were challenges, in that China has a different governmental system, and it is necessary to get authority from the Government to do certain things. We all know that Governments take a little time to handle such things, and that in itself can cause substantial problems. If the DTI says, &quot;You must do this now,&quot; and they say, &quot;We can only do it in three weeks' time,&quot; there is a problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is jumping from blaming the DTI to blaming someone else, while persuading us that we need an inquiry. There is something that I do not understand: around November, Government officials were in China and discussions were taking place. From then to May it was six or seven months. How long does it take, in such a situation, to know whether the business can or cannot be done? My understanding is that the Chinese were not interested after they found out that there were certain problems with the company. As for the loan that was always available, how long is a piece of string? Why jump in and out of blaming the DTI or others? The hon. Gentleman should confine himself to his original premise. Let us have an inquiry, and cut out all the rumour and innuendo, because I know no better than he does what really happened.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.1/1">Until the inquiry has taken place, we will not be 100 per cent. certain. There is information from many different sources. It remains true that discussions with SAIC continued after the company had gone into administration. That shows that there were still merits in terms of commercial viability.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">I follow that&mdash;but logically, does it not tell people that perhaps, even at that late hour when everything looked impossible, the Government and the other parties involved still wanted to see whether there was another last chance? It seems as if somebody was determined to sort the problem out and get some sort of deal. We can speculate until the cows come home, but until there is a proper inquiry, we will all be playing on hunches and saying all sorts of things, when we have no fundamental basis for doing so.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.5/1">You will not be aware of what has gone on in the debate so far, Sir John, as you have only just taken the Chair, but one issue that must be considered is limiting the length of speeches in these debates, because many people have strong views and it is important that they should have the opportunity to be aired fully.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/2">This has been an important debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> on securing it. He was right to say that there should be no no-go areas in an inquiry, and that the findings must be made public so that we can examine precisely what went wrong. I also accept his view that for those who seek to criticise the Government, there is a danger of speaking with the benefit of hindsight, to dissociate themselves from what went wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/3">I do not know the full truth of what happened, particularly in the period leading up to the acquisition of MG Rover by the Phoenix consortium. We have heard the competing claims of the hon. Members for Birmingham, Northfield and for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride). That is why it is important to have a full inquiry that examines the period and goes right back.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1413" name="Stephen McCabe">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe)</phrase> raised legitimate concerns about a period before that which I mentioned. Reference was made to the acquisition by BMW in the first place, and how the Honda association collapsed. Many people saw that as a valuable association that might well have secured the future of MG Rover.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/5">There has been public debate since the tragic collapse of the company. It is worth making the point that as we argue over who is to blame and what went wrong, we ought to focus on the fact that more than 5,500 people lost their jobs, and on the impact not only on them, but on their families and the local economy, which can be devastating. The point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green about the importance of examining whether the retraining is adequate, and whether the structures to support it are in place, is as important as examining the history.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/6">The focus so far has been on the potential culpability of the Phoenix four, whether there was wrongdoing, and the extent to which they may have profited from MG Rover. The contrast between their situation and that of the work force is stark. The Financial Reporting Council raised issues that properly require further investigation. I have no real idea whether anything sinister was involved, because so far the FRC report remains secret. It is important that at some stage, preferably sooner rather than later, it is brought into the open so that we can see what its initial conclusions are.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/7">A former director, Peter Stevens, has weighed in with accusations of naivety, muddle, mismanagement and waste. While it is right to investigate the role of the Phoenix four, there is a danger of heaping all the blame at their door when in reality the fate of Rover may&mdash;I stress the word &quot;may&quot;&mdash;have been sealed before they acquired the car maker. I fully accept the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1420" name="John Hemming">the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming)</phrase> that a deal with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation could still have worked as a long-term association. However, many analysts reached the conclusion that the situation for Rover had looked pretty bleak for some time.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/8">We are faced with a large number of inquiries. On top of the FRC inquiry, we have the current inquiry launched by the Secretary of State and the likelihood of two Select Committee inquiries. The National Audit Office is also thinking about pursuing an inquiry. If all these inquiries are to be of lasting value, everybody must learn lessons. Centrally, the inquiries must also explore the role of Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/9">The strongest charge against the Government was made in <i>The Economist</i>, which described Rover as</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/10" class="indent">&quot;a classic victim of industrial policy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/11">It asserted that pinning the blame on the Phoenix four was missing the real target. The blame, according to the article, lay first with the laws of economics, and secondly,</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/12" class="indent">&quot;on the Government, whose cowardly intervention five years ago damaged the interests of the workers it said it was trying to protect.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/13">That is the charge against the Government. I do not know the full story. Again, that is why an inquiry is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/14">As for the economics, when the company collapsed, the world's car industry had the capacity to produce some 80 million cars and light vehicles a year, but was producing only 60 million a year. That is massive overcapacity. Most of that spare capacity is in Europe and the United States, where costs are higher and sales growth is slower than elsewhere. One could say that inevitably, a medium-sized company like MG Rover was most vulnerable in that harsh economic environment. However, many analysts have concluded that the fate of MG Rover as a volume car maker was sealed a long time ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/15">It is important to examine what happened in 2000. As we have heard, at that time there were two competing suitors, Alchemy and Phoenix. That is a crucial period. I have heard and listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield, who was very much involved at that time, has said. It is important to examine and make public exactly what happened between March, when Alchemy was in pole position, and May, when Rover was sold to the Phoenix group.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/16">The Alchemy option, superficially, was hardly attractive. Only 20 per cent. of jobs would have been saved. But was it the only viable option for the long term? I do not know the answer, but that is a question we need to ask if we are to learn lessons from this sad story. Did the Government intervene, as some allege, swapping sides in the face of public protest? Did they favour a bid that saved jobs in the short term, but had no plan or direction to make the company viable in the long term?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/17">What of the role of John Towers? In March 2000 he was appointed to the taskforce established to consider options for the failing company, as BMW was rapidly losing interest. Towers then became the head of the taskforce, proposing a &quot;project Phoenix&quot;. By the beginning of April, Towers had stepped down from the DTI task force to head the Phoenix consortium officially. We all know the outcome. Did the Government interfere or intervene in a way that ultimately damaged any long-term prospect of car making in the west midlands? Those are the reasons why, ultimately, we need a full inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/18">It is worth finishing with a more positive point. Many commentators have talked about the death of the British car industry. In fact, the car industry is healthy. It just happens not to be British owned. A lot of cars are being made in this country, in plants that are remarkably productive. The future, in many respects, is quite bright. We must balance that against the tragedy of this particular story. We all ought to be learning lessons here. We all ought to look at what happened over the years, at whether any of us reached wrong conclusions, and at what lessons can be learned for the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.44.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="44"  time="012:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h02.htm#50614h02_spnew53">
	<p pid="a.44.0/1">I echo the congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on the eloquent and sincere way in which he introduced it. It is a shame that we have to discuss the topic in an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall, as it should have been the subject of a statement by the Secretary of State soon after the House returned. This was probably the biggest economic and industrial issue affecting the country while Parliament was dissolved for the general election, and it is shocking that the Secretary of State did not come to the Dispatch Box to set out clearly what had happened and give the House a chance to question him on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/2">As we have seen from today's debate, there has been a catalogue of mistakes that go back over many years and have resulted in the terrible tragedy that we see before us. Although hon. Members have spoken from different perspectives, what has come across is the fact that they are all speaking with a genuine interest in their constituents&mdash;people who were employees of Rover or whose livelihood depended on it&mdash;and with a tremendous commitment to their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/3">Above all, the issue is tragic for the work force, who have lost their livelihood and find that their pensions are under threat. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> said, it is tragic for those who have already retired and now face tremendous insecurity, as they do not know how their pensions will be paid. It is a tragedy, too, for the creditors and dealers, some of whom will be driven out of business. A number have already closed down, and it is likely that others will follow&mdash;people who did nothing other than their best to sell Rover cars.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/4">Of course we welcome the rescue package, but we would be grateful if the Minister could clarify whether all the money is new money or whether it has been diverted from other funding packages that were already in place in Birmingham and the west midlands more generally, or elsewhere. I also endorse the call from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> that the Financial Reporting Council report should be published. When it was handed over to the Secretary of State, it was made clear that it contained issues that the Department of Trade and Industry would want to address. The House should see exactly what Sir Bryan Nicholson's report concluded, so that we can understand fully what more needs to be assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/5">We welcome the decision to have a full investigation, but the inquiry must also consider the actions of the DTI and to what extent they might have contributed to the closure of Rover. After all, it is only just over a year ago that the former Secretary of State defended the &pound;31 million bonuses paid to the Phoenix four, in words that bear repeating:</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/6" class="indent">&quot;I am very pleased with Rover's performance. There were very big risks involved in starting up Rover again when it looked as if it would be the end of the road . . . Company directors who take big risks and achieve big successes deserve big rewards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/7">Would the Minister care to endorse those words today, or has she changed the Department's mind from paying tribute to John Towers and his colleagues in such a fulsome way?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/8">The report needs to consider historically what happened when Phoenix took over. As has been explained today, we want to know the detail of why the Phoenix solution was preferred to Alchemy. We also need to know why the BMW pension fund was not ring-fenced, so that the people who were entitled to expect that they would benefit from it can understand why the money is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/9">The main issue that the investigation should look into is the handling of the situation as it moved towards its final stages. It is my understanding that in the early hours of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">Tuesday 5 April</phrase>, directors of MG Rover and solicitors were meeting at Longbridge. When they finished that meeting, they believed that they had an agreement for the &pound;100 million loan. It is also my understanding that the then Secretary of State had cleared time in her diary later that Tuesday to announce formally that the &pound;100 million loan had been agreed. It is also clear that the DTI press office briefed the media earlier in the week that the loan was almost in the bag. The press coverage that resulted from that actually made matters worse: it increased the pressure on the company as more creditors came forward seeking to be paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/10">What happened to change the Government's mind on the loan between the early hours of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">Tuesday 5 April</phrase> and the Secretary of State's decision later that day to cancel the formal announcement of the loan package? Will the Minister confirm that the Government changed the nature of the loan that they were prepared to provide, and it became a loan for two months rather than six months? Will she confirm that when that was made clear to Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, it backed out of the deal because that was not acceptable?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/11">Will the Minister also confirm that at about 9 o'clock on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">Thursday 7 April</phrase>, PricewaterhouseCoopers was informed of the likelihood that it would be called in, not as a receiver, but to advise the company on its situation? Will she confirm that just one hour later, the Secretary of State announced on national television that MG Rover had entered administration? In the words of John Duckers, the business editor of <i>The Birmingham Post</i>,</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/12" class="indent">&quot;No one is suggesting that MG Rover might have necessarily been saved, but, it is maintained, the Government chose when it was to go down&mdash;not the company's chairman, Mr Towers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/13">What happened during that hour? Which other parties had been informed of the insolvency before the Secretary of State declared it on national television?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/14">Will the Minister publish a report, or even better a transcript, of the discussions that took place that Thursday evening between the Secretary of State, or other DTI Ministers and officials, and senior Rover management? Is not it the case that Mr. Towers told the then Secretary of State, &quot;If the loan is not agreed, we will have to call in the receivers,&quot; not, &quot;We are calling in the receivers&quot;? That is a fundamental difference. As the Minister will be aware, the Secretary of State's announcement would in any case have brought about the collapse of Rover, because by Friday morning, the demands from creditors had made receivership inevitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/15">Finally, does the Minister understand the cynicism of people such as John Duckers, who believe that it suited the Government's purpose to bring forward the closure of the company so that it happened in the early stages of the election campaign, not in the middle or final stages? To counter those suspicions, will she arrange for the internal documents from the DTI, the Treasury and No. 10 to be made public so that the full process and the timings can be understood?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/16">This is one of the biggest industrial disasters of recent years. Of course, massive responsibility lies in the hands of the directors of Phoenix Venture Holdings, but the Government's hands are not clean either. Nothing less than a full inquiry into the role of the company and Ministers, with all the findings made public, will reassure MG Rover's former employers and its creditors that the Government acted in the company's best interests. I urge the Minister to agree to that demand today.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> on securing this important debate. His work and consistent advocacy on behalf of his constituents and others who have been affected should be commended.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/2">First and most importantly, I want to express my profound sympathy for all those who have been affected. The appointment of administrators to MG Rover on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase> was a huge blow to the company's employees, their families, the local community and companies that did business with MG Rover. The impact of its failure has been felt up and down the supply chain among suppliers and retailers. It has been felt most deeply in the west midlands, including in my hon. Friend's constituency and the constituencies of other hon. Members present, but it has also spread to other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/3">The shock was all the greater because for most of the employees, the collapse of MG Rover was somewhat unexpected at that point. Although the company's fundamental difficulties were well known, and the DTI had been tracking its fortunes since autumn 2004, the hopes of a deal with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation had been strong until that week. There was no reason to doubt the seriousness of the corporation's intent. Indeed, the Government had made it clear to the corporation and the Chinese Government that we supported a joint venture in principle and were ready to provide a short-term bridging loan.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/4">However, we were prepared to offer that loan only on certain conditions. Those included that we were sure the deal would be done, that the money could not be siphoned off and that the loan would be repaid. The DTI, the shareholder executive and others worked round the clock to see whether a deal could be done to save the company and the jobs that went with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/5">The company had been publicly pressing for a loan, and taxpayers' money was involved. The loan would also have had to be declared to the European Commission. There was no prospect of its remaining a secret, nor would that have been right. To respond to some of the questions asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1420" name="John Hemming">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming)</phrase>, as the then Secretary of State said, in the end SAIC made it clear that&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.47.1/1">I am sorry, but I cannot give way; I have many questions to answer, and I fear that I will not get through them all if I do.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/2">In the end SAIC made it clear that it was not confident of the future solvency of MG Rover, so there was no reasonable prospect of a deal. The Government stood ready to issue bridging finance of more than &pound;100 million, but without a deal there was no possibility of a bridging loan, and SAIC indicated that such financing would not have resolved its concerns. It is not correct to say that the period for the loan changed from six months to two. The collapse of the deal led to MG Rover and Powertrain going into administration on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase>. At that point it was clear that the Chinese would not proceed with the deal as contemplated. It was also clear that the Government would be unable to advance a substantial bridging loan, so the directors of MG Rover were obliged to put the business into administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">7 April</phrase> the then Secretary of State spoke several times to John Towers&mdash;who made it clear that the directors had no option but to put the companies into administration&mdash;and she made the statement that evening. The administrators were called in on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase>. That was inevitable, and would have happened whether the Secretary of State had made that statement or not. However, the development, unwelcome as it was, presented new possibilities for the sale of the company without the historical liabilities that had been among the key stumbling blocks in the way of the proposed SAIC deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/4">Over the weekend of 9 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-10">10 April</phrase>, the Government decided to make a loan of &pound;6.5 million to the administrators. That allowed options for the sale of the company as a going concern with an available work force to be pursued for a further week. It was a justified and proportionate decision, taken in the light of the information available at the time about potential purchaser appetite. Sadly, it became clear during that week that a quick deal with certain liabilities excluded would not be forthcoming, and the administrators were forced to make most of the employees redundant. The fate of the assets is still in the hands of the administrators, and it is not for me to speculate how and to whom those assets will now be sold. The Government will be supportive of any proposal presenting a viable economic future for parts of the MG Rover business.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/5">As soon as the fact of administration was known, the Government put into place a contingency plan that we had been developing over the course of several months in case the deal was not done. Some of this was announced by the then Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase> and some the following week, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-15">15 April</phrase>, once it became clear that SAIC would not immediately buy the business as a going concern. In total, the Government allocated &pound;150 million to that support package.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/6">The former Secretary of State also set up the MG Rover taskforce led by Advantage West Midlands. That brought together stakeholders from across the region, including my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Northfield and for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey) and, until he became a DTI Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" name="Ian Pearson">the Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson)</phrase>, as well as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1460" name="Julie Kirkbride">the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride)</phrase>, to advise Government and local agencies on how best to respond and deliver the emergency package.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/7">The response was rapid: on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-11">Monday 11 April</phrase> a range of measures was in place. They included the MG Rover Jobcentre Plus hotline; a planned emergency package of support to help workers to find new jobs and develop new skills; a website giving advice and contact details; a package of tailored support for companies in MG Rover's supply chain; a telephone hotline for companies; a meeting at Birmingham chamber of commerce to help with proposals; and a helpline established by Birmingham city council. That work has continued over the succeeding weeks, delivering what the employees are entitled to with great efficiency. For example, the redundancy payments service paid each claim an average of 3.2 days ahead of its target of six weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/8">The way in which the Rover taskforce, Advantage West Midlands, Business Link and so many others responded was nothing short of magnificent. In the first month alone, &pound;1.5 million was paid out to safeguard more than 2,000 jobs in the supply chain, nearly 10,000 calls were taken by the Jobcentre Plus hotline and nearly 5,000 new job vacancy opportunities were offered through the employer hotline. As of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-10">10 June</phrase> some 5,500 individuals from MG Rover and its suppliers have contacted Jobcentre Plus. Some 649 of those individuals have been placed in jobs by Jobcentre Plus, and others may have found work independently. Some 2,510 have training plans, and 2,219 of those have been booked on courses. Some 461 have started training.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/9">In response to the question asked by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, I should say that up to &pound;50 million is available for training for workers made redundant at MG Rover and its suppliers. Money is not an issue with training places, although I understand that there is some difficulty about the availability of training staff, which needs to be followed through. For training, some &pound;5 million, drawn from forecast underspend in 2005&ndash;06, has come from the DTI, &pound;5 million has come from the Department for Work and Pensions, &pound;10 million has come from the European Social Fund, and priority access to the existing &pound;25 million has come from the employer training pilots in the west midlands and nationally. I hope that that goes some way towards answering the question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/10">HM Revenue and Customs has spoken to more than 400 companies to discuss deferring VAT, national insurance and PAYE. Almost 50 deferrals have been agreed, amounting to more than &pound;4.7 million, and more than 2,900 employees from 154 supply chain companies have benefited from the wage replacement fund. A transition loan fund has been set up and is operating. The fund is for companies that have been damaged significantly by the collapse of MG Rover, but have a viable business plan that needs additional finance in the short to medium term to enable them to respond to the traumatic event.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield asked about tracking the impact of training. I agree that it is vital to track that impact, which is why we have asked the MG Rover taskforce to report after six months on the lessons learnt and make recommendations to the Government. I listened to the proposal advanced by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1413" name="Stephen McCabe">the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe)</phrase>, and am sure that the DTI will consider the issue further.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/12">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield expressed several concerns today, the first of which related to benefits and the 16-hour rule as a disincentive to train. He will know that this is an issue primarily for the Department for Work and Pensions, but I can tell him that financial support is available, through the allowance payment system, to jobseekers who need to access specific training provision to help them to return to work. Allowance payments can be made to people accessing work-focused provision through Jobcentre Plus and its partner organisations. Former MG Rover workers who have been referred to work-focused provision are currently being supported in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/13">Our preliminary analysis of redundancy pay in lieu of notice in insolvency cases is that very few workers will receive less than the statutory &pound;280 a week as payment in lieu of notice, despite the statutory need to mitigate damages.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/14">The Pension Protection Fund will protect members of defined benefit schemes by paying compensation if their employer becomes insolvent and the pension scheme is underfunded. We are very aware that this is a worrying time for Rover workers, but pensioners are currently receiving their pensions in full, and we believe that it remains a question of when, not whether, a PPF assessment period will start. That is the start of the PPF's formal involvement in the scheme. At the moment, the Rover scheme has not yet entered an assessment period because one of the participating employers is still solvent.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/15">In the final minute available to me, I shall discuss the issues of the investigation. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May 2005</phrase>, the current Secretary of State for Trade and Industry appointed inspectors to investigate and report on the affairs of the MG Rover group, including Phoenix Venture Holdings and MGR Capital Ltd. The public interest requires that the issues raised by the financial reporting review panel and by developments after 2003 when the last accounts were published be investigated by independent inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/16">The Secretary of State has asked that the inspectors report as quickly as possible, in a form that will enable the report to be made public. The inspectors will decide what is relevant to investigate, and the DTI will co-operate fully with the inspectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.1/1">I welcome this opportunity to debate this important subject, which has an immediate impact on my constituents and those of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase>, as well as a broader impact across the whole of Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/2">I congratulate the Minister on his new appointment. He has moved from the Principality of Wales to the principality of defence. I wish him well with his new responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/3">Norfolk has been living with the prospect of the closure of RAF Coltishall since 1998, when it emerged that it was likely that the Jaguar aircraft deployed there would be withdrawn within a decade. Therefore, the formal announcement in July last year, as part of the defence White Paper, that by December 2006 all RAF operations would cease at Coltishall and that the RAF would have no further use for the base did not come as a complete surprise to me or my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/4">Nevertheless, there was a lot of local anxiety about the future, as the local catchment area that is affected covers a wide area of north and mid-Norfolk where there are scattered communities and areas of local economic and social deprivation. The closure has an immediate impact on villages within my constituency such as Horstead, Wroxham, Buxton, as well as Coltishall itself. It also has an impact on a town the size of Aylsham, and it has a similar impact in north Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-01">1 November 2004</phrase>, an RAF Coltishall task group was established, led by Norfolk county council. Its membership included myself and the hon. Member for North Norfolk, representatives of parish councils, North Norfolk district council and Broadland district council, RAF Coltishall, Defence Estates, Business Link, the East of England Development Agency and others. The short-term issue was to address immediately problems of redundancy and economic loss of income by local communities. The medium-term strategy, as identified by the task group, was to establish whether the Ministry of Defence or any other Department might have a use for the base and to prepare for the eventuality of RAF Coltishall being declared surplus to all Government requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/6">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-01">1 November</phrase>, the task group has met regularly and has taken forward a number of practical issues such as a comprehensive study prepared under the auspices of Norfolk county council and EEDA, which provided factual information about the immediate impact of the closure of both RAF Coltishall and RAF Neatishead. I wish to emphasise that RAF Neatishead is in the constituency of the hon. Member for North Norfolk, and that its closure, along with that of RAF Coltishall, delivers, to a certain extent, a double whammy to the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/7">Much good work has been done, and I wish to put on record my appreciation of the contributions made by Squadron Leader Paul Robins, the project officer at RAF Coltishall, who has been as open and constructive as possible from the perspective of RAF Coltishall, and Mr. Barry Sygrove, the area manager east of Defence Estates, who also brings a lot of practical experience to the issues that we have been addressing.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/8">There are many specific questions to address, such as environmental degradation of the base, the future of the married quarters, and what residual RAF use might continue after December 2006. The key question for the local community and the task group was whether the Ministry of Defence or any other Department might have a further use for the base. At the first meeting of our task group in November 2004, we were informed that the MOD had yet to declare the base surplus to its requirements, but that a decision on other possible military uses would be made by April 2005. If no MOD requirement were found, other Departments would be consulted through English Partnerships. Only after the exercise carried out within the MOD and other Departments drew a blank would the base be declared surplus to requirements. In November 2004, it was thought that the whole exercise would be completed by April 2005, giving a period of 18 months between potentially being declared surplus and disposal. That is key for consideration of planning uses other than those by a Department. The Minister will appreciate that although the task group has had to conduct a lot of forward thinking and planning on the assumption that the base would be surplus to all Government requirements, the lack of a clear decision has inhibited the work and creates uncertainty in the local communities most affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/9">I appreciate that, from March onwards, the expected decision by the MOD was postponed because of the general election. However, I was somewhat disappointed by the reply that I received from the Minister to a letter that I wrote on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-23">23 May</phrase> seeking clarification about the MOD's possible further requirements for RAF Coltishall. I learned that I had achieved this debate last Wednesday and, lo and behold, on Thursday I received a reply from the Minister. I am sure that hon. Members will see that purely as a coincidence, but who says that parliamentary debate and pressure do not achieve at least some results? He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/10" class="indent">&quot;I can confirm that this Department has not yet reached a decision as to whether there is any alternative defence use for the site. Indeed, we intend that the simulator at Coltishall will remain on the site until the Jaguar goes out of service. It is possible that some of the living accommodation may be used after 2006. I understand that in order to progress further you would wish to know the outcome of our studies. We do not expect to complete our investigations before the autumn of 2005.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/11">Even keeping to that decision, the timing will have slipped by six months. Can the Minister say whether autumn means September or December? If it is the back end of December, that means that we have only about one year before most of the RAF functions cease at Coltishall. If the MOD has no further use but other Departments are to be trawled, could that mean that a final Government decision might slip further into 2006? I know that the Minister may not have control over responses from other Departments, but clarification would be welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/12">Such points are not legalistic debating points. They have a real impact on the contingency planning being carried out by the RAF Coltishall task group, which is spending EEDA money and Norfolk county council money, as well as MOD money, and they affect the morale of local communities, which feel that a lot of time has passed without a big decision being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/13">The local community overwhelmingly supports the RAF presence at Coltishall. Many people are sad that the RAF is leaving Coltishall and they are aware that that presence goes back to the late 1930s. RAF Coltishall is the last battle of Britain RAF base still in use operationally and there is a lot of local good feeling. I recognise the fact that some local people will welcome the end of flying, but the majority, even those directly affected, are sad to see the RAF going and appreciate the work that it did in maintaining our freedom, not only during the second world war but in the long watch of the cold war. Many RAF personnel have decided that they will live in our community when they leave the services and have married local people. There is a strong link.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/14">As far as I can ascertain from talking to local people, there would be a positive reaction if an alternative MOD requirement were found for the future of RAF Coltishall. A similar thing happened at what had been RAF Swanton Morley in my constituency nearly a decade ago. The RAF had no further use, but the Army found that it had a requirement and moved in an armoured regiment. That has worked well in terms of community relationships and the impact on the local economy. The Minister will not be surprised to hear that, even if local communities cannot agree on possible alternatives, they are certain that they do not want RAF Coltishall to be an asylum centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/15">The Minister should be aware that the closure of RAF Coltishall is the equivalent of the loss of a steelworks or a car factory in terms of the impact on the local economy and jobs. A recent provisional report by EEDA and Norfolk county council on the effect on the local economy suggests that it would be in the region of &pound;19 million per annum and 400 jobs. That is a major impact for an area such as mid and north Norfolk. I recognise that the Ministry of Defence is not just a job creator and economic bolster for the area, but the Minister should bear that impact in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/16">The MOD owes the local community of mid and north Norfolk and must get the decision right from the point of view of local people. Also, RAF Coltishall is one of the first two RAF bases flagged up for closure in what I suspect will be a continuing round of closures of other MOD bases rolled out over the next two or three years. Is it not in the MOD's interests to get it right in this case so that, when other bases are closed, Ministers can turn to people worried in other parts of the United Kingdom and say, &quot;Look what happened with RAF Coltishall. We got it right. You can go and talk to the local MPs and representatives and they are relatively happy&quot;? The alternative would not be a good precedent.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/17">Finally, local people are apprehensive that, if the MOD ceases RAF use of Coltishall but there is an administrative hiatus before disposal, the site will deteriorate and the married quarters might be vandalised. Will the Minister assure me that that will not happen and that effective measures will be taken to secure RAF Coltishall against the kind of vandalism that has taken place at other former RAF and Army sites?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.53.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="53"  time="012:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h03.htm#50614h03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.53.0/1">May I first congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on securing this debate and also thank him for allowing me time to contribute to it? We were both members of the task group and took the view that it is important that everyone works together for the interests of this part of north-east Norfolk. The RAF Coltishall base straddles the border between our two constituencies, so we both have a central interest in the outcome of the considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/2">May I also join the hon. Gentleman in expressing sadness at the closure of RAF Coltishall? It seems that the RAF is unlikely to have a continuing use for the base, which has been part of the country's post-war history. I should also mention RAF Neatishead in my constituency, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned and which is also being scaled down. That base played a central role during the post-war and cold war periods in safeguarding the interests of this country and western Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/3">The first concern that I and others have is the impact on the local economy. As the hon. Gentleman already mentioned, some 400 jobs will be lost. It is a low-wage economy with poor communications, so the impact of the loss of that number of jobs will be significant. It has already been estimated that the total impact on the local economy will be &pound;19 million to &pound;20 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/4">It is also important to stress the risk of inertia and indecision. I have frequently made the comparison with what happened at RAF West Raynham, where the base was closed some four years ago and was allowed to fall into dereliction with no decision made for a decade. That had a real impact not only on the local economy, but on local communities. Thankfully, the properties at RAF West Raynham have been released and we can, I hope, get them back into use.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/5">When I met the Minister responsible for the armed forces to talk about the scaling down of RAF Neatishead, he insisted that lessons had been learned from West Raynham and other places and that the Ministry of Defence was determined to be a good neighbour. That is important. Defence Estates has played a very constructive role in relation to the taskforce, attending all the meetings and offering to contribute to the cost of planning analysis of what the site could be used for and so on, but it is important that decisions are made on a timely basis and that we do not have drift and, ultimately, decay.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/6">We have been advised throughout to work on the basis that it is unlikely that there will be another military or Government use, so the taskforce has gone about its work on that basis. However, there are now strong rumours of a potential Army use. A constituent has just told me about this. The suggestion made to me, which I am told is from an impeccable source, is that there is a plan for a super-garrison based at Colchester but with self-supporting satellite units, including Coltishall. The appeal of Coltishall is said to be that it is located on the east coast, has a large amount of land available, provides good accommodation and has an airstrip.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/7">Is there any truth in that rumour? If so, how many personnel could be involved and what are the time scales for decision? As the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, autumn is a vague concept. I should mention that I have a remarkably similarly worded letter to his. It arrived last week, just after we discovered that he had secured the debate. What is the likely time scale for making decisions? I think that the local community would welcome that alternative military use. It would have a very beneficial impact on the local economy if we did not lose the number of personnel who currently work on the site. Will the Minister provide clarity? Above all else, drift and delay are what must be avoided for the benefit of this part of north-east Norfolk.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> for his kind comments about my appointment to the Ministry of Defence. It is a challenging job. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> thinks that it is one of the best jobs in the Government. I certainly intend to make it one of the best jobs. It is very people-focused, and the issues that hon. Members have raised today are about the effect that our decisions have on people.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/2">I congratulate the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk on securing the debate. As far as I am aware, there was no connection between his securing the debate and my letters arriving, but it is an opportune debate, because the closure and reuse of defence sites is an important subject and worthy of discussion. He and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> have taken a keen and consistent interest in the future of RAF Coltishall. I thank the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk for his kind comments about the personnel who have been working, through the task group, to secure a decision on its future.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/3">I am grateful that both hon. Gentlemen gave me notice of the points that they wanted to raise, and I hope that I can respond constructively to them. This is my first opportunity since becoming a Minister in the   Ministry of Defence to take part in a debate on the    defence estate. The debate surrounding the rationalisation of our estate and the disposal of sites that have become surplus is important. Before I turn to specific points about Coltishall, I shall make one or two general points.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/4">First, we do not take decisions on the closure of sites lightly. The decision-making process is complex and lengthy. It involves the consideration of many options and requires a good deal of consultation. It is, however, something that we have to go through if we are to attain our goal of achieving an estate that is of the right size and fit for the demands of today. We must take account of the better quality of life and better working conditions for servicemen and women and others in the Department, and we seek to ensure that we obtain the best value for money from the estate. Secondly, we have a good story to tell about bringing surplus defence sites back into renewed economic use, whether for employment or residential use, as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/5">I am grateful for the opportunity that the debate affords me to pay tribute to the work of the personnel at RAF Coltishall. As the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, the base has a long and illustrious history. It was built in 1939 for Bomber Command and, while it was being used by Fighter Command, an aircraft from the base claimed the first enemy aircraft to be shot down during the battle of Britain on <phrase class="date" code="1940-07-10">10 July 1940</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/6">Until March this year, RAF Coltishall was the home of four Jaguar squadrons, at which point two were disbanded. Of the remaining two, 41 Squadron will be disbanded by <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. At the same time, 6 Squadron, the last remaining, will move to RAF Coningsby. The airfield at RAF Coltishall will close later that year, although, as the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk knows, the simulator will remain until the Jaguar goes out of service in 2007. It is also possible that some of the living accommodation on the site may be used after 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/7">It is against that background that we need to ascertain whether the site can be put to alternative defence use. Consideration is being given to potential reuse by the Royal Air Force, within the context of our long-term service estate plans. However, if no such defence use emerges, the site will be disposed of. The hon. Member for North Norfolk mentioned a strong rumour that the Army would be interested in taking over the base or that it is seeking to do so. I can say only that I am not aware of any formal proposal that would lead me to believe that that is the case, but, as I have made clear, we are in discussions throughout the Ministry of Defence about future use of the base for defence needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.0/1">Is it not right that the Minister should be aware of the issue of potential Army use and that it is being discussed? The proposal may not be formal, but I think that he is aware that something is being discussed.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.3/1">The hon. Gentleman certainly heard me correctly, but I should clarify the position. What I should have said is that consideration is being given to potential reuse of the RAF base at Coltishall&mdash;not use by the RAF. I beg his pardon and am grateful that he pointed that out.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/2">On current views, we expect a final decision around autumn this year. I regret that I cannot be precise about the date, but current expectations are that it will be earlier rather than later. Knowing the concern and interest of the hon. Gentlemen, and because I also particularly want to bring the matters to an early conclusion, I shall press for that to happen as quickly as possible. I shall undertake to keep both hon. Gentlemen fully informed.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.5/1">I understand how frustrating it can be for the hon. Gentlemen and the communities that they represent that the site appears to be caught in limbo for the present. That creates uncertainty in the community. However, I hope that the hon. Gentlemen and their constituents will understand that several factors must be taken into account, and that it would make no sense financially, or in management terms, to sell the base only to have to acquire another to meet future requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/2">I am aware that the long hiatus that occurred in deciding whether the site at West Raynham, which the hon. Member for North Norfolk mentioned, would be retained or disposed of was a real problem. West Raynham was potentially suitable for several alternative defence uses, and the issues involved were complex. That case was exceptional, I believe, and lessons were learned. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall make every effort to ensure that RAF Coltishall does not languish in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/3">Housing was an issue at West Raynham. As the hon. Gentleman will recall from his attendance at task group meetings, the housing at RAF Coltishall is subject to the Annington Homes long lease agreement. Consequently, it will be for Annington Homes to decide on the future use of the housing should the MOD declare the site to be surplus. Of course, if further defence use of the site is identified, housing may be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/4">I note the concerns over site security and vandalism if the site is vacated. The best way to avoid damage is to pass the site to a new owner as quickly as possible. We find that if there is a hiatus, temporary lettings of buildings on site can be an effective deterrent to vandals, but our usual practice is to employ civilian guards to patrol the site. That would be likely at Coltishall.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/5">It is to avoid delay, should the site eventually be put up for sale, that we are progressing consideration of alternative defence uses and initial preparations for disposal in parallel. Since October 2004, the MOD has been fully engaged with the task group attended by principal stakeholders, which will seek to mitigate or minimise the impact of the proposed closure. I am aware of the recent report that suggested that there would be a &pound;20 million loss to the local economy if the base were closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/6">The hon. Members for Mid-Norfolk and for North Norfolk are members of the task group, as are representatives of the county and district councils and the East of England Development Agency. The task group has openly discussed potential future uses of the site should it be declared to be surplus. That is an excellent demonstration of the proper approach to consultation and partnership so that everyone is involved in the decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-18">18 February</phrase>, the group agreed that North Norfolk district council would draw up terms and specifications for a planning document covering the whole site. That will ensure that the planning potential of the site is fully known should it be declared to be surplus. I take this opportunity to urge the planning authorities to be as innovative and flexible as possible in considering alternative uses for the site. We also need to ensure that decisions are made as quickly as possible if the site is not to be left unused for a period, and deteriorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/8">It may be helpful if I explain what will happen should Coltishall be declared surplus, and how we will progress with its disposal. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk asked if we had ascertained whether any other Department had an interest in the site. The answer is, simply, not yet, but should the site be confirmed as surplus to our requirements, it will be included in the English Partnerships register of surplus public sector land for 40 working days.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.0/1">Will the Minister tell us about timing? The MOD will reach its conclusions, then other Departments will be trawled, so might we not have a final decision until 2006?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.57.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" colnum="57"  time="012:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h03.htm#50614h03_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.57.1/1">I hope that we will progress as speedily as possible, but I cannot give an undertaking regarding the time frame. I reiterate that the land available will be on the register for 40 days to see whether any other Departments have a particular interest. The MOD has a close working relationship with English Partnerships, which has been hugely beneficial and important in ensuring that brownfield and other sites that are suitable for affordable housing developments are identified and used.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/2">I return to the disposal process that we are likely to use. If RAF Coltishall is declared to be surplus, we will consider, as we are required to, whether the land has to be returned to its former owners or their successors under the Crichel Down rules. At this stage, we do not know whether we will be required to offer it back. If there is no wider Government interest and former owner rules do not apply, the site will be disposed of on the open market.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/3">To draw the threads of the debate together, I should say that the closure and disposal of the site is a complex process, and that we need to balance possible defence requirements with the wish to get the site back into productive alternative use as quickly as possible. That is what we will try to achieve at RAF Coltishall.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/4">I appreciate that there is a degree of uncertainty in the community, which I hope my remarks have gone some way towards allaying. If the hon. Gentlemen will work closely with me, we will do the best that we possibly can, with the task group, to ensure that if the site is declared to be surplus, it gets back into productive use to the benefit of the people whom they represent.</p>

	Climate Change (G8)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.58.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1722" speakername="Colin Challen" colnum="58"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h04.htm#50614h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.58.1/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to raise some of my concerns about the possible outcomes of the G8 summit in relation to climate change. First, I must welcome my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" name="Jim Knight">the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase> to his new appointment as Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I hope that he will bring fresh impetus and wisdom to our thinking on the subject. I am sure that he will. I must also ask him to do his best to ensure that the whole House has a chance to debate this crucial subject at the earliest opportunity in Government time.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/2">I will start with my conclusion. The Government should commit themselves to conducting a serious and impartial study of the climate change model known as contraction and convergence&mdash;C and C. In its barest outline, C and C proposes that we should reduce our carbon emissions. That bit is relatively uncontroversial, at least outside the White House. C and C, rather more controversially, says that, over the next 45 years, we should reduce our emissions to the point at which they are not only sustainable, but at which no humans may accumulate for themselves more carbon emitting rights than any other. It is a simple concept, but it is supported by serious analysis. Much detailed work has been carried out on it by the Global Commons Institute.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/3">It appears that, in Government circles, there is much scepticism and confusion about C and C, even though there is also some support. The Government have rightly done what they could to dispel the myth that there remain any credible doubts in the scientific community about human-originated climate change. We now have a better understanding of the processes involved and the likely outcomes if we do nothing to change our ways. There is almost total unanimity on that. But remember how long it took to get to that position. If we allow ourselves the same time to develop a solution as we took to grasp that there was a problem, the solution will come too late.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/4">C and C is a full-term solution, and is the only one on the table that addresses the whole time scale to 2050. C and C and the discrete measures that we are already adopting, such as cap and trade schemes, renewables or environmental taxation, are not mutually exclusive. But C and C provides the benchmark against which those policies can be tested. We know from recent figures that our policies are not delivering the desired net reductions in carbon emissions. We need to be more scientific in our approach, and far more determined. We need an overarching framework in which to operate, not only so that we can test our policies against it, but because it will provide long-term certainty to all those who are required to invest in future systems&mdash;be they in carbon trading or technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/5">Only last week two dozen leading British industrialists called for a 30-year period of certainty in policy. We are not offering them that at the present. These industrialists are known as the G8 climate change round table, which was convened only a week or so ago by the World Economic Forum. They said:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The current 'patchwork' scheme of regulatory, financial, and technology incentives that has evolved in various parts of the world is not conducive to a cost-effective and efficient approach to the problem of climate change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/7">That is what we need. Our policies at the moment&mdash;that patchwork quilt&mdash;are not giving off the right signals about our long-term policies on climate change. At a recent conference in Bonn, called to prepare for the United Nations conference of the parties meeting later this year, a senior civil servant at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was quoted as saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/8" class="indent">&quot;even trading may not be the way forward.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/9">I find that rather incredible. If true, it would certainly be a significant shift in policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/10">Many who are investing in renewable technologies are anxiously waiting to see whether the Government will go down the nuclear route. As in the past, such a move would inevitably soak up huge amounts of public funds. As we saw in the general election, climate change was not an issue, hardly being raised by the Government, let alone by the Opposition. Indeed, our climate change manifesto was launched as part of the rural manifesto launch. This is a sad commentary, especially when the Prime Minister has done so much to make this issue one of his top priorities at the G8.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/11">There are times when it feels like the whole G8 agenda is too big, even with only two items on it. It has become clear that climate change is being shunted to one side because of a lack of clarity in our response to the science. I also recognise the obstacle represented by the United States President, but he is increasingly isolated, even in his own country, despite his dissembling friends in ExxonMobil. I commend the initiatives that are now taking place all over the United States, from the Chicago climate exchange to the mayor of Seattle's climate protection agreement, which has been signed by scores of city mayors across the United States, representing perhaps 130 million people.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/12">Those involved do not feel that they have to wait for President Bush, and nor should we. Indeed, if we had, we would not have Kyoto. We must not enter the post-Kyoto negotiations seeking to appease Bush. I realise that without him, no agreement would be as effective as it should be, but if we please him, we will have an agreement that is of little value to anyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/13">C and C has acquired much support, and the Secretary of State understated the case in telling Aubrey Meyer, the director of the Global Commons Institute, that C and C was merely &quot;currently fashionable&quot;. In 2003, the secretariat of the UN climate change convention said:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Achieving the goal of the UN Climate Treaty inevitably requires contraction and convergence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/15">In 2000, our own royal commission on environmental pollution said that it supported C and C. In 1997, at Kyoto, the Africa group tabled a C and C amendment. Even the American delegation said that C and C</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/16" class="indent">&quot;are elements for the future, perhaps for a next agreement that we may ultimately all seek to engage in.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/17">Indeed, the Byrd-Hagel resolution of the United States Senate, which is often cited as an example of American hostility to climate change agreements per se, actually opposes only climate change treaties that exclude developing countries. Of course, the American Administration have changed since Kyoto, but they will change again, and we must not wait to make progress on these ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/18">I fear that the Government's approach to renewables technology&mdash;saying, &quot;We do not choose winners. Let the markets decide&quot;&mdash;also applies to overall climate change policy and that they want to wait and see what consensus emerges. Of course, it would be highly desirable to obtain consensus, but all markets have leaders, and the good start that we made in setting the G8 agenda is in danger of being frittered away.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/19">Let us take a closer look at where the Americans are coming from. Bush wants to reduce the carbon intensity of the American economy, but that could easily be explained as much by a fear of weakening security of energy supplies as by a fear of climate change; indeed, it is probably the former. As such, the policy does not guarantee a net reduction in carbon emissions. That is identical to our own experience over recent years. We may have seen a reduction in carbon intensity&mdash;in transport, for example&mdash;but the growth in the economy has outweighed it. That is not a good result, no matter how much the Department for Transport would like us to think otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/20">Such a policy is also dangerous because it encourages some industries&mdash;aviation is the worst&mdash;to believe that Governments should accept that improvements in their energy efficiency must lead to the grandfathering of emissions rights into the foreseeable future. They want future growth to be built into negotiations, not negotiated away. If they succeed, we might as well stop discussing doing something about climate change in our homes and offices. There are not enough energy-saving light bulbs in the world to compensate for the extra flights Ryanair alone would like us to take in one month.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/21">George Bush is at least putting some money where his mouth is, and the US is committed to spending a lot on new technologies. In the UK, the Council for Science and Technology, which was appointed by the Prime Minister and co-chaired by the Government's chief scientific adviser, published a little-noticed report entitled &quot;An Electricity Supply Strategy for the UK&quot;, illustrating the parlous state of our investment in energy technologies. It shows that Government investment in energy research, development and demonstration&mdash;RD and D&mdash;has dropped to just 5 per cent. of what it was in 1974, down from the equivalent of $1 billion annually then to just over $50 million annually now. According to the report, we spend about 10 per cent. of what France spends and 20 per cent. of what Germany spends.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/22">Our privatised industries' performance is equally poor: measured as a percentage of sales, spending on RD and D is half that of American companies. In its report, the council says that Government spending on RD and D is highly fragmented. That is not a rosy picture, and it urgently needs addressing, because without a strong RD and D base, the optimism surrounding new technologies such as hydrogen will be misplaced. The report also shows that we have no choice but to make reductions in energy use a more radical feature of policy than it is. There is no alternative, and the promise of business as usual on the back of technological innovation is wishful thinking. However, that does not lead me to one of the council report's conclusions, which was that nuclear power offers a way out. The dangers of nuclear power have not gone away, but the real danger of hitching up again with that hugely expensive beast is that it will drain resources away from other technologies that offer a cleaner long-term future.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/23">Back in 1974, when we spent so much on research and development, more than three quarters of it went on nuclear power. If we had spent similar sums on renewables, we would be in a far better position. Are we condemned to make the same mistake again? A very powerful lobby would wish that on us, and points to nuclear power's &quot;renaissance&quot; in China, Finland and elsewhere. Although it uses the word &quot;renaissance&quot;, I think that &quot;proliferation&quot; is more appropriate, as it implies a more significant meaning.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/24">I recognise that the Government are in a bind. It would take a courageous or, some might say, suicidal politician to tell his or her electorate that their lifestyle was unsustainable. However, we are moving swiftly towards that unpalatable truth and people are beginning to understand why the future cannot be an ever-expanding balloon of economic growth without consequences. I have deep reservations about the Department for Transport's predict-and-provide approach to aviation, but nevertheless its radical thinking on tackling congestion is emerging, although that is not yet about climate change. If it were, the question would not be about whether we should have to pay more for driving our cars at certain times of the day, but about how we could use our cars less.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/25">In the run-up to the G8 summit, we are sending out too many mixed signals. We do not have a single, straight, honest and powerful message that is both practical and conceptually coherent. Unless we adopt a firmer approach, we shall find ourselves firefighting on more and more fronts, to be engulfed&mdash;forgive the mixed metaphor&mdash;not by fire, but by the sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/26">I repeat my conclusion. C and C provides the framework necessary to construct our climate change policies; it provides the discipline that we lack. It is not only environmentally indispensable, but socially just. Nobody on this earth has a greater right to pollute than anyone else. No rich nation has the right to purloin the atmosphere of the poorest nations and then, as is exemplified by our approach to tackling poverty, tell them that we will give them our charity or release them from their debt to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/27">Let the Archbishop of Canterbury have the final word. He said that contraction and convergence</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/28" class="indent">&quot;appears utopian only if we refuse to contemplate the alternatives honestly.&quot;</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.61.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="61"  time="013:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h04.htm#50614h04_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.61.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1722" name="Colin Challen">the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen)</phrase> on securing this debate on climate change and the G8. Like me, he was elected in 2001; since then, he has established an excellent reputation as a passionate campaigner on such issues. His work on the Environmental Audit Committee and elsewhere in Parliament adds real value to our debates. I thank him for his leadership on such vital matters. Similarly, the UK's leadership on international climate change is respected and welcomed all over the world by those committed to tackling that issue; no country has done more in recent years to make it an issue for Heads of State, and we shall continue to do so during our EU presidency and presidency of the G8.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/2">Action must be taken in conjunction with our international partners, but if the UK is to influence others successfully, we must first demonstrate that we have taken action at home. Since 1997, we have established the target of 10 per cent. renewable energy by 2010; placed an obligation on energy suppliers to supply an increasing proportion of energy from renewables; introduced the climate change levy; established the Carbon Trust to work with businesses on reducing energy use; and established the first greenhouse gas trading scheme in the world and one of the toughest trading caps in the new European Union regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/3">We have also overturned the whole basis of company car fleet taxation, shifting it towards low-carbon emissions, and lowered vehicle excise duty for low-carbon vehicles. I can tell my hon. Friend that we are pushing for aviation to be included in future in the EU emissions trading scheme and that, just today, the Department of Trade and Industry launched a carbon abatement technology strategy, which I am sure he will find interesting.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/4">The UK has shown that tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved without damaging economic competitiveness or living standards. The UK has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. since 1990; during the same period the UK economy has grown by more than 36 per cent. We are one of only two EU countries on track to meet the target of cutting 1990 greenhouse emissions by 8 per cent. before 2010. As has been mentioned, we have more work to do to meet the domestic target of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide because CO <sub>2</sub> reductions are less than greenhouse gas reductions as a whole and because 20 per cent. is a tougher target.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/5">The climate change programme review will report later this year. We will make some announcements on that shortly and advise on those measures required for the UK to achieve the 2010 target. We cannot tackle climate change unilaterally. As the Minister with responsibility for biodiversity, I noted with concern the report today from the Royal Horticultural Society conference&mdash;it has taken a lead by organising the event&mdash;on the effect of climate change on trees and forests in this country. Clearly, we cannot do anything on our own to tackle that loss to the enjoyment that we all take from our gardens, recreation areas and rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/6">As we know, the Prime Minister has made tackling climate change a central theme of the UK's G8 presidency this year. The Government's primary objective is to raise the profile of climate change as a matter deserving the urgent attention of Heads of Government in the G8 and outside, so as to promote an international consensus on the need for further action to control emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/7">We have also set ourselves more detailed but no less ambitious objectives. The first is to set out a clear direction of travel to deal with climate change, based on the science. The second is to agree a package of practical measures focusing on technologies that have significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than traditional technologies. The third is to work in partnership with the major emerging economies to reach a new consensus on how we deal with the challenge in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/8">Our detailed proposals have been developed during the year. On science, they have been developed to reflect the outcome of a science conference hosted by the UK in February. Scientists from more than 30 different countries considered how to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions. They considered what level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would be self-evidently too much and what options we have to avoid such levels. They concluded that there was greater clarity and less uncertainty about the impacts of climate change across a wide range of systems, sectors and societies. In many cases, the risks identified were also more serious than previously thought. We are making progress in understanding the science.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/9">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June</phrase>, the science academies of all the G8 nations plus those of Brazil, China and India signed a joint statement. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/11">When independent scientists speak with such clarity, it behoves politicians to listen. The science academies called on G8 nations to</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/12" class="indent">&quot;identify cost-effective steps that can be taken now to contribute to substantial and long-term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/13">To further our aim of developing a package of practical measures, we are working on a possible technology package to be agreed at Gleneagles. Specific proposals are being prepared in collaboration with our G8 partners on cleaning up fossil fuels and improving energy performance. The G8 has already agreed, under the Evian action plan on science and technology for sustainable development, to accelerate the research, development and diffusion of energy technologies. We are hopeful that the G8 can agree on turning the political agreement that we already have from the Evian summit into concrete action.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/14">To address our third aim of working in partnership with emerging economies, we are engaging with a number of developing countries on mitigation and adaptation. The share of global greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries is set to rise significantly. As countries develop, it will be important that they are able to meet their growing energy needs sustainably. There is a role for G8 countries and international financial institutions to work with those economies to enable them to achieve a low-carbon future. Greater clean coal technology, energy efficiency, and renewable energy within the emerging economies should be supported through a combination of capacity building, technical assistance and additional finance. Therefore, we have invited the Heads of Government of Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa to the summit in Gleneagles, where they will have extensive discussions with their G8 counterparts on climate change issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/15">It is also important that the G8 and the major emerging economies discuss the impacts of climate change per se. It is widely accepted that some degree of climate change is now unavoidable, due to historic and current emissions. Those effects will disproportionately affect developing countries&mdash;the countries that have contributed least to the problem. I know that in many ways that is philosophically what is behind the contraction and conversion ideas about which my hon. Friend has such strong feelings. Developing countries also lack the necessary financial means to cope with the widespread effects of climate change. We need to work with vulnerable developing countries to help them respond to the challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/16">Climate variability and climate change put some $10 billion to $20 billion of net overseas development aid at risk each year, threatening the achievement of the UN millennium development goals. As an important first step, we need to ensure that developing countries have adequate regional and national data and the capacity to interpret them, so that they will be able to assess their degree of vulnerability and plan effective responses for the future. We, as donors, should climate-proof our development spending through better screening and management of climate risk. As biodiversity Minister, I attended the launch of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which has shown the clear link between the loss of biodiversity and the problem of achieving poverty eradication and, as I have already stated, the clear link between biodiversity loss and climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/17">Our aims are challenging, but we are confident that they are achievable. We are not at Gleneagles yet&mdash;there is still a lot of work to be done&mdash;but momentum is moving in our direction. The Prime Minister recently visited Rome, Moscow, Berlin and Washington, and he is in Paris today. He will also be holding a video conference with his Japanese and Canadian counterparts. The Prime Minister and President Bush had constructive discussions on climate change, and I hear my hon. Friend's cynicism about the President. The differences between Europe and the US on the scientific evidence surrounding climate change are well known, but we agree on the fundamental points that climate change is a serious issue and that we need to act in response. President Bush has said he is looking forward to a discussion on climate change at Gleneagles, and so are we. He and the Prime Minister have regular discussions on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/18">We should not forget that the summit is not about creating a new Kyoto or any other international agreement, and nor is it about setting new targets&mdash;the UN framework convention on climate change is the right place for that. Instead, we want to find ways of reaching a new level of dialogue between the leading economies, private sector and technology leaders and the major emerging economics&mdash;dialogue that will lead to practical action, involving promoting new clean technologies and supporting sustainable economic growth. We will achieve that through both the measures that we agree at the summit and working together beyond Gleneagles. In many ways, Gleneagles will be about creating a will and momentum that can be then taken forward through the UN process. The package of measures on the table at Gleneagles will complement the   UN framework convention process by providing the   means through which the necessary emissions reductions can be more easily achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/19">The UK remains open to any new international framework as long as it is realistic so that it is relevant to countries with different national circumstances, robust so that it is can be adjusted in the light of experience, and durable so that the system does not become irrelevant in a few years' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/20">My hon. Friend has been very patient, and I will come to his specific points on contraction and convergence. He has been an articulate and passionate champion for the framework. His points are well argued and will be compelling to many listening to the debate. Certain aspects of contraction and convergence are appealing, including the identification of a fixed level for stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations, and comprehensive global participation. It is a long-term framework and has advantages of clear equity&mdash;all things that we support.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/21">One key element, however, of any future regime must be workability. One particular concern with contraction and convergence is the question of how globally acceptable and, in consequence, how workable that would prove to be. The debate on further action is at an early stage and to support any one framework over any other at the moment would be premature.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.0/1">What are the other frameworks? That is the question. I am not aware that anything else is seriously on the table. What is described is an overarching framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.1/1">The argument that I am putting to my hon. Friend is that if we went with this particular framework, given that there is nothing approaching uniform support at the moment, we would be setting out our stall too early. We are very early in negotiations about how the framework can go forward at the UN convention in Montreal at the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/2">It is important that all existing suggestions remain on the table at present and that full consideration is given both to the possible solutions and to the elements within them that could be used to form part of a workable solution. As I said, the outcome will be decided by negotiations under the UN framework convention on climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/3">My hon. Friend asked if we could commission an independent expert study. I am told that there are already a large number of independent expert studies, which suggest a number of possible future frameworks, including contraction and convergence.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/4">As well as the official G8 political process, we have been engaging with international business to hear its views. When the Prime Minister attended the World Economic Forum this year, he asked 25 leading multinational companies, including BP, Deutsche Bank, EDF, Ford and Toyota, to look at the issue of climate change. We are particularly pleased with their statement, issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-09">9 June</phrase>. Their message was strong&mdash;that we must take action now and Governments must send a strong policy signal to markets, taking into account the long periods over which investments in infrastructure are considered. They highlighted the need for the rapid commercialisation of new technologies, which are in many cases already developed. They also dismissed the idea that action to tackle climate change causes economic harm. They pointed out that there are likely to be economic benefits, particularly if initial costs are compared to the costs of inaction. The Government will take their message to the Gleneagles summit and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/5">With limited membership and participation, the G8 alone cannot and should not produce a new international framework. What the UK's G8 presidency will produce is the momentum that the international community needs to develop a future framework. We hope that that dialogue continues through the United Nations framework convention on climate change, specifically at the next conference of the parties meeting in Montreal this year. We will be pressing for the conference to agree to start negotiations on the framework for beyond 2012, which we hope will produce a regime capable of tackling the huge challenge that we face. I trust that we will continue to debate such a crucial issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/6">At the beginning of his remarks, my hon. Friend asked for a debate on the Floor of the House. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House will have noted what he said. Debating the issue is important. As we move through Gleneagles to Montreal, I hope that we continue to hear from my hon. Friend as the debate continues.</p>

	Electoral Reform
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.67.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="67"  time="013:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h05.htm#50614h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.67.1/1">I very much welcome this albeit brief opportunity to discuss electoral reform and where this country should go following the recent general election. I accept from the outset that the issue of electoral reform is far from the top of the electorate's list of priorities, and certainly far from the top of the Government's list.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/2">One problem of electoral reform is that all too often the issue gets bogged down in detailed conversations for&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;anoraks who go on about the merits of one electoral system versus another. Which is the most proportional? Which keeps the constituency link? Is the d'Hondt formula really fair? To me, all those miss a more fundamental question, which all of us who are involved and interested in politics must ask: what sort of Parliament do we want to represent us and what sort of Government do we want to rule over us? In this country, unlike in the United States, our Executive and legislature are inextricably linked, so those two aspects are in effect one and the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/3">I place on record my appreciation for the work of the all-party group on electoral reform, which is chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase>. The group has done a power of work for many years and, having attended its first meeting of the new Parliament last week, I can tell the Minister that it is reinvigorated and ready for the debate ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/4">l do not want to use this debate to extol the virtues of any particular system. I have my own views&mdash;indeed, my party has a very clear and long-standing policy in this area&mdash;but today I am arguing for an open debate, not just in this place, but throughout the United Kingdom. I hope the Minister takes the desire for that debate back to her Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/5">As the Minister will be aware, this Labour Government were re-elected on the smallest share of the vote in UK electoral history. As the Electoral Reform Society has said, no Government in our history have had such a flimsy base of public support on which to rule. Surely, questions must be asked when a party can win a majority of 66 seats with only 35 per cent. of the vote. In finding answers to these questions, we need a reasoned and sensible debate in which people's differing views are respected.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/6">The Government and this Parliament cannot shy away from that debate. The House of Commons has often been called the mother of Parliaments. Rather than being the loved mother, however, we are in real danger of becoming the embarrassing relative.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/7">The Government have stated that there is no groundswell of support for changing the system. I accept that electoral systems may not be the talk of the steamy, as we say in Scotland, but there is no question but that more and more people of great reputation are coming round to the idea. Professor Patrick Dunleavy of the London School of Economics has described a change in the electoral system as inevitable. I share his sentiment, but cannot, at this stage, share his optimism. There is a great deal of work to be done to win this argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/8">It goes almost without saying that any change in the electoral system should be made for the right reasons. It should not merely be mooted by certain members of certain political parties, only when their position under first past the post begins to look vulnerable. It should be a principled decision, based on a desire to improve democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/9">Any electoral system should work for the benefit of the public, not necessarily of the politicians, but the current system fails on that most basic of aims. The British public deserve far better from the system that they use to elect their representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/10">As the Minister will be well aware, <i>The Independent </i>has launched a major campaign for electoral reform entitled &quot;Campaign for Democracy&quot;. It has already been backed by leading figures across the political spectrum, and when I last checked more than 36,000 people had signed up. This is an excellent campaign, which seeks not only support, but to educate people about the realities of our electoral system. I pay tribute to all those involved and to the work that they continue to do. To have gathered so many names in a relatively short time is very impressive. I have no doubt that the campaigners will be listening to the debate and that they will be listening particularly intently to the Minister's remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/11">The figures showing the extent of the unfairness built into our electoral system have been well documented, especially in the past few weeks, and I shall revisit some of them. In the general election, the Labour party was rewarded with 55 per cent. of the seats in the House of Commons on a mere 35 per cent. of the vote. The picture is even worse when one considers the percentage of the overall electorate. Labour was given a solid parliamentary majority despite fewer than 22 per cent. of people in the UK voting for it. It received 9.6 million votes from an electorate of more than 44 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/12">I remember election night, when it was clear as the votes came in that the agreed line from the Labour party was that people had wanted the return of a Labour Government but with a reduced majority. That mantra was chanted by the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson, but I believe it is plainly false. Only 35 per cent. of those who did vote voted Labour and 65 per cent. did not want a Labour Government at all, yet that is exactly what they ended up with.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/13">If first past the post is used for the next election, it will be interesting to see what the electoral lottery produces. Under our current system, it is perfectly possible for the party with the most votes to come second in seats&mdash;indeed, that is what happened in 1951 and 1974. In fact, the detail of the 2005 election result shows that we faced exactly the same electoral quirk. In England, the Conservative party won 50,000 more votes than Labour, yet Labour won 92 more English seats than the Tories. I challenge anyone to defend that ridiculous situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the situation is equally ridiculous north of the border? The Member of Parliament for Glasgow, North, the constituency next to mine, was elected by less than one in five of the registered voters. Across Scotland, Labour won over 70 per cent. of the seats with less than 40 per cent. of the votes. Does my hon. Friend agree that this is unfair?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.69.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="69"  time="013:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h05.htm#50614h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.69.0/1">Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes a very good point. While there is an established three-party system in England, in Scotland we have four well-established parties and, in many areas, five. So, the situation is worse north of the border.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/2">Under our current system, the job of government and the powers that come with it can be awarded exclusively to a party that enjoys the support of scarcely one in three of those who vote, and just over one in five of the electorate. That cannot be acceptable. It seems that it is no longer a case of parties winning an election, as winning is about who can work the system best and who can use the vote to greatest effect to win the greatest possible number of seats.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/3">It is clear that, this year, the Labour party did not win the great debate of ideas. Rather, it was able to use the quirks of the system to deliver a parliamentary majority. If the same number of votes had been distributed differently, the general election result could have been completely different.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/4">The current system is also unfair&mdash;in many cases grossly unfair&mdash;to smaller parties, as in many Scottish seats. There is an undeniable trend towards multi-party politics in the UK. The day of the two big political parties fighting it out among themselves is over. It took just 26,000 votes to elect a Labour MP at the general election, but 40,000 votes to elect a Conservative. Taking the number of people who voted Liberal Democrat and dividing it by the number of Liberal Democrat MPs, it took 96,000 votes to elect a Liberal Democrat.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/5">At the other end of the spectrum, the UK Independence party received no representation whatever for its 610,000 votes. Similarly, the Green party polled over 250,000 votes and did not win any seats in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/6">First past the post may have been acceptable in a two-party culture, but the UK is now unquestionably a multi-party democracy. We urgently need an electoral system that reflects the political climate in exactly the same way as happens with the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the London assembly, Northern Ireland councils, the European elections and, soon, Scottish councils. How much longer can Westminster be ring-fenced from such reform?</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/7">My party is often charged with proposing electoral reform because we would benefit most from it. There is no question but that the current system acts as a major barrier to my party, although, slowly but surely, we are overcoming that barrier. It is wrong to suggest, however, that we are acting in self-interest. In Scotland, where some of the most vocal proponents of a fair electoral system for electing the Scottish Parliament were Liberal Democrats, that system delivered 17 Liberal Democrat seats in Holyrood. Under first past the post, it is likely that we would have got 21 or 22.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/8">Similarly, we are two years away from the first ever Scottish council elections under proportional representation. All the independent projections show that if PR had been used for the last council elections we would have ended up with fewer councillors. In my own seat, 70 per cent. of councillors are Liberal Democrats on 40 per cent. of the vote, yet we are still saying that this is an unfair system&mdash;that it is wrong. We argue for electoral reform because we believe it to be right and fair. We do not propose it for our own narrow gain. We are its advocates because we believe that it can produce a fairer and better parliamentary democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/9">No system is perfect; it would be wrong for anyone to pretend otherwise. All systems, whether proportional or not, have their advantages and disadvantages. Those of us who support PR have individual preferences about which system is best, but the inherent unfairness of the current system unites us in our belief. No electoral system can ever be perfect or hope to please everyone, but there are many better electoral systems out there that do not produce such unrepresentative results.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/10">The decline in voter participation is as much a concern for me as it is for many other Members of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.0/1">My hon. Friend may be interested in research that I have done on the G8 countries, which identifies a turnout of 80 per cent. in Germany and Italy, for example, where proportionate electoral systems are used, whereas in Britain and Canada the turnout is about 60 per cent. The evidence is quite clear: electoral reform results in an increase in turnout of 20 per cent. Does he agree?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14a.70.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="70"  time="013:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050614/halltext/50614h05.htm#50614h05_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.70.1/1">I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend said. I am sad to have to admit that there are cases where that has not been quite so successful&mdash;I am about to touch on those&mdash;but anything that re-engages the public is definitely worth doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/2">I was delighted to see turnout in my constituency rise at the general election from 64 to 69 per cent., which is an increase above the national average. However, in too many constituencies the turnout is still dire&mdash;below 50 per cent. in more than 30 seats. A problem arises when seats are regarded as safe, although I accept it is becoming more difficult to define what a truly safe seat is.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/3">Under the current system, some two-thirds of seats are unlikely to change hands irrespective of the overall result, which is hardly an incentive for voters in those seats to vote. That argument is backed up by the figures. At the last general election, turnout in marginal seats was almost 69 per cent., compared to an overall turnout of just 51 per cent. in relatively safe seats. Putting it bluntly, many votes in safe seats around the country are counted but do not count.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/4">At the last election, the majority of votes went to losing candidates. If we are to re-engage the population at large in the political process, we must convince people that their vote really counts. However, under the current system, the power rests in the hands of a few key voters in swing seats around the country, which leaves most people in the majority of seats facing little or no contest in their area. Little wonder so many of them are increasingly apathetic. It is clear that turnout at the general election was strongly influenced by the degree to which there was a genuine contest in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/5">Changing the electoral system will not solve the problem of low turnout, but it is a logical place to start. I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1420" name="John Hemming">the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming)</phrase>: PR is not a panacea for that problem, but it could make a key contribution to re-engaging the unengaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/6">I accept that there is evidence to suggest that moving towards PR does not bring with it an automatic increase in turnout. In the 1999 European elections&mdash;the first to be fought under PR&mdash;the turnout fell compared with 1994, and in the last Scottish Parliament elections the turnout was just under 50 per cent., but, although I believe that both those events were the result of serious underlying issues, I do believe that the problem was caused by the proportional system. In fact, I would even argue that the turnouts may have been even lower if those elections had been held under first past the post.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/7">I want to give the Minister as much time as possible to respond to the points I have raised. I hope that she    considers my arguments and the countless representations she will receive over coming weeks and months. Whether one is in favour of or against electoral reform, this important issue needs to be addressed urgently, and the Government cannot keep their head in the sand any longer in the naive hope that it will go away.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/8">The Prime Minister promised that this Government would be more listening and inclusive following the reduction in their majority. I hope the Minister will listen to the growing and widening body of opinion that is promoting electoral reform, which she and the Government can no longer ignore.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> on securing the debate and on attracting his colleagues here; it is good that a number of them are interested.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/2">I shall pick up on some of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised, say where I believe there is common ground and tell the Chamber what the Government are doing in that respect. He started by saying that electoral reform is sometimes seen as a matter of great interest to anorak-wearing obsessionals, but that it does not have a wider interest. I agree with him in two respects.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/3">First, the technicalities of the various voting systems and the arguments for reform mean that the subject often passes over people's heads. None the less, I agree profoundly that our democracy is at stake. Fairness, legitimacy and turnout form the basis of our representative democracy so, like the hon. Gentleman, I will be undeterred by suggestions that those who focus on the issue have somehow lost the plot and that we should be talking instead about the health service or the economy. The subject is technical, but it is hugely important, and I welcome the fact that he chose the subject today.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/4">Secondly, the hon. Gentleman was right to say that there are many deeply held views, not only in the House but outside. We hold our views strongly because, apart from the independent Members, we are all members of political parties; we have all been elected and we all have a big focus on the system. However, we are not the only ones who feel passionately about the subject and who want to engage in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/5">Many people are concerned to be involved in the debate more widely, and the hon. Gentleman asks whether we are prepared to listen and to respect the views of those who participate in it. The answer must be yes, not least because, as he said, we must take a principled approach to a debate about improving democracy. It would be okay to talk about what suits our party, or what might suit two parties but not the others, but if there is one thing that the voting public would run a mile from, it is the idea that, having got into power, we would rig the system in our favour and that party political interest would somehow override the principled issues. We must always be vigilant about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/6">As party creatures, it is sometimes difficult for us to disentangle the issues; it is often easy to think that we have argued something from principle because we feel it hugely strongly and because it happens to help our party. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the principle that should underpin our debate is that reform should mean an improvement in democracy and not a fix for one party or another.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/7">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that no system is perfect. None of those who support any of the range of electoral systems that operate here and abroad would ever claim that one system hits all the objectives. Otherwise, all elections would be held on the same basis as here. The point is that, despite the fact that no system is perfect, we want to have the best system that we can.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I have just returned from a trip during the recess to Tanzania, the country of origin of many of my constituents. That country is about to hold elections in October and I was asked how we felt comfortable when, although we had a falling share of the vote, we still had a large majority. It thinks that it will face a similar situation. In response to that, we urged the country to continue with its commitment to multi-party democracy, but it must decide on its own systems for elections in order to command the confidence of its people. We do not go around the world lecturing people on voting systems, although we closely examine systems that operate in different parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/2">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West said that a fundamental problem was that people did not get what they wanted from the 2005 election. I think that I am right in saying that the opinion polls broadly showed that the centre of gravity of public opinion was that there should be a Labour Government with a reduced majority. In that respect, I did not get what I wanted because I would have preferred a Labour Government with a large majority. Not everyone gets what they want&mdash;perhaps that is a facile and self-evident thing to say&mdash;but that was generally what the opinion polls showed. I will not quote any more opinion polls because we are trying to have a discussion about principles.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.3/1">I will make this my final intervention. How does the Minister think that people can vote for a political party to have a smaller majority? Someone can vote only for who they favour to be the Member of Parliament for the constituency in which they live. They cannot influence the overall outcome of the election.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/2">Will the Minister also tell me whether she thinks that 35 per cent. of the vote is sufficient to give a Government legitimacy with an overall majority? What percentage figure does she think would be too low to give a Government the legitimate authority to govern even if they had an overall majority in the House of Commons?</p>

	<p pid="a.73.4/1">That returns me to the original point, on which I agreed with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, of what the best system is that commands support, has legitimacy, is seen to be fair and simple, and yields what we want, which is a representative Parliament that can hold to account effective Government. I think that hon. Members will agree that the Government have engaged in a great deal of reform since 1997 of the constitution more widely and also of voting systems. We have not been sitting on our hands, refusing to engage in debate or change things. There has been a huge change, including devolution to Scotland and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.5/1">Although I admit that the Labour Government have achieved a great amount in terms of constitutional reform and devolution, the voting system in Scotland under the devolved Administration is a proportional system. Would the Minister not agree that it is about time that we moved into the 21st century and did the same in Westminster? If it is good enough for setting up a new Parliament with a modern voting system, why can we not do the same in Westminster?</p>

	<p pid="a.73.6/1">In addition to devolution in Scotland, Wales and London, we have brought about other constitutional changes through the Freedom of Information Act 2000, regarding transparency and how government works, and with the Human Rights Act 1998, regarding the holding of the powers of the Executive to account in the courts. We have been constitutional reformers.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.8/1">We want a good electoral system and for the Government to be held to account under the rule of law; we should not have to choose one or the other. However, I should like to respond to the hon. Lady's points about the voting systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.8/2">The new constitutional arrangements mean different systems for elections to the European Parliament, and a different election system for Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. The single transferable vote system has been used in Northern Ireland for the past 30 years, except for elections to Westminster. We now have the Greater London authority and the additional member system, which we brought in with the 2000 elections, and, of course, the mayoral elections with the supplementary vote. It is only right, having introduced such a large range of new election systems, that we should take stock of the effect of those systems and how they have worked.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.8/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1420" name="John Hemming">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming)</phrase> said that the key to turnout is proportionality. We need to look at our systems and understand not only the level of turnout for elections to each institution, but the trend, and we must also consider the effect of different voting systems on turnout both abroad and here. I think that he would agree that turnout is affected by many more factors than just the clarity or fairness of individual voting systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.9/1">I return to my point about G8 countries and the clear 20 per cent. increase in turnout.

	<p pid="a.73.10/1">We are looking at UK elections that use a proportional system to assess both the level of turnout and trend, because we are concerned about turnout that is on a falling trend. I say this only to report it to the Chamber, but the trend in turnout in elections with proportional systems in this country seems to be no better than that with first past the post. That is why we are doing what we said in our manifesto that we would do: reviewing the experience of the new electoral systems that were introduced for the devolved Administrations. We also said that if we were to recommend a change in the system of election to the House, there would have to be a referendum to agree the right way forward. At the very least, we need to review the effect of the current systems while we discuss issues such as public confidence in politicians, availability of information to citizens and accessibility to the vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.10/2">Many factors other than people's opinion of the voting system dictate whether they are enthusiastic about politics and are prepared to go to the ballot box and vote. We all want a high turnout, as that is key to legitimacy, but we must consider the many factors that affect it, rather than single out the electoral system. Would that it were so easy that we could fix the problem of legitimacy simply by changing the voting system. I strongly believe that it is more complicated than that. We must consider not only the voting systems&mdash;which we are looking at&mdash;but all the other factors that affect turnout.</p>
