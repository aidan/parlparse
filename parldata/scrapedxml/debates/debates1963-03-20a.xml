<p>asked the Lord Privy Seal whether, in pursuance of the Paris Declaration of October, 1954, he will call the attention of the Governments of France and of the German Federal Republic to the fact that the military clauses of the Treaty of Alliance between France and Germany threaten the integrity and unity of the Atlantic Alliance and its defensive purposes, as defined in that Declaration, and that if the Treaty is ratified Her Majesty's Government will consider France and West Germany as having forfeited their rights under the North Atlantic Treaty to any guarantee and any military assistance provided for in that Treaty and its Protocols.</p>

<p>I recognise the limitations.

<p>I can give only an approximate answer. But I should say that for the United Kingdom something like &#x00A3;400 per annum and for India and Pakistan about &#x00A3;20. The average would

come out between &#x00A3;50 and &#x00A3;60. This would show the big difference that is pointed out by my hon. Friend.</p>

<p>The most recent information regarding the state of contributions to the Regular and Special accounts of the United Nations is contained in the United Nations Secretariat document dated 25th February, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. According to that document arrears of contributions on 31st January this year amounted to approximately 116 million dollars. As against this, receipts from the United Nations Bond Issue totalled on 15th February a little over 124 million dollars.<br/>
The question of what action should be taken regarding members who are in arrears with their contributions is now being studied by the Working Group of Twenty-One established by the General Assembly at its last Session to consider the question of United Nations' finances in the light of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court. The United Kingdom is a member of the Working Group, which is to complete its report by 31st March. Its recommendations will be considered by a Special Session of the General Assembly which is expected to begin on 14th May.</p>

<p>I regret that no further progress has been made in the latest dis-

cussions a Geneva on a nuclear test ban treaty. The major point of difficulty is in the field of on-site inspections, where the West feel that seven such inspections on Soviet territory are necessary annually and the Soviet Government is willing to concede only three. There are of course a number of other substantive matters to be agreed on, but so far, as my right honourable Friend the Prime Minister told the House yesterday, the Russians have refused to discuss them unless their offer of three on-site inspections is first accepted. Although there have been reports that the eight non-aligned delegations intend to put forward new proposals, they have not so far done so.</p>

<p>In view of the Prime Minister's statement yesterday that no progress is likely to be made by entering into a public auction on numbers of on-site inspections, and as there does exist a wide measure of agreement, is it not time that the three Foreign Ministers returned to Geneva and themselves took over the responsibility for these negotiations?</p>

<p>My noble Friend has been taking a very close interest in all this, and I am sure that if he felt that it would help he would be very ready to go. At the moment, we are in a real difficulty in relation to these numbers, but I will take note of that point.</p>

<p>In supporting my right hon. and learned Friend, may I ask whether the Minister of State is aware that many people are completely disgusted and hopeless about the four years of failure of the U.S., U.S.S.R. and U.K. Governments to reach agreement because of mutual suspicion'? Would not the best solution be for Britain to declare forthwith that she will end all her tests and invite inspection, and ask the other two countries to follow her initiative?</p>

<p>When the gap between the Russian proposals of three on-site inspections and the Western proposal of seven inspections is so small, is it not


completely indefensible that the negotiations should seem to be foundering on this point? Why cannot the British Government put forward a compromise proposal of, say, five on-site inspections? Have the Government done this?</p>

<p>I have tried to make it plain on a number of occasions that although the numbers are fairly close together, the bases on which they are arrived at are entirely different. The Soviet Union have all along said that they have put forward this number only for purely political reasons; they do not see the need for any on-site inspections. We have said that we base ourselves on the best scientific advice available to us. If the Soviet Union have better scientific advice, we ask them to bring it forward. If they do not do so, we can only presume that they do not possess it.</p>

<p>As even the neutral nations seem unable to provide any proposals that will induce general agreement, does not that give the noble Lord the Secretary of State a still greater opportunity to achieve a compromise? Apart altogether from the scientific knowledge behind each of the proposals, would not the Secretary of State consider a compromise such as that suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Milian) as a basis of negotiation?</p>

<p>It is all very well to propose compromise, but unless we can have some confidence that the other side will also be willing to compromise, there is little prospect of making progress there. Of course, one can make informal contacts in relation to this, and I am sure that my noble Friend will be glad to do anything he can to get agreement, but it is no good ignoring these basic facts, and the fact is that to get a treaty which one had no confidence would be carried out would be a mockery.</p>

<p>Is it not important that the British Government&#x2014;while, of course, remaining in the Western Alliance&#x2014;should take the initiative in the matter?

<p>It is the combination of these with other matters as well, and we have asked the Soviet Union to go into detail in relation to the other matters.

<p>As stated in the first line of the table included in my right hon. Friend's reply to the hon.

<p>Again, does the Minister of State think that one in five of successful applicants from our State schools is really representative of the number of boys attending these schools or is in line with the policy of other Government Departments?

<p>I would point out that the trend in this matter is in favour of more coming from the direct grant and State schools. In 1960&#x2013;62, 61 per cent. of successful applicants came from public schools and 39 per cent. from other schools. In 1962 itself less than 50 per cent. came from the public schools.

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware, as I am sure he is, that his right hon. Friend the Minister of Defence made a statement on this matter in conjunction with the Minister of Defence of Western Germany on Monday? I presume the Foreign Office at some stage informed the right hon. Gentleman of


this statement and that Her Majesty's Government, according to this statement, have accepted the idea of contributing to a multilateral force?<br/>
Can the right hon. Gentleman clear up the equivocation which characterised his previous answers, by giving the House the answer to two questions? First, is it intended that the multinational force will be dropped when the multilateral force comes into being, or shall we be committed to both these types of force? Secondly, since the right hon. Gentleman seems to have an idea of the order of expenditure involved in a multilateral force, can he say, if it is not in the order of &#x00A3;200 million, what it is?</p>

<p>There is no need for the hon. Gentleman to be so objectionable in a supplementary question. I have said nothing which is in conflict with the communiqu&#x00E9; issued yesterday after the talks between my right hon. Friend and the German Minister of Defence.<br/>
Secondly, the multinational force will naturally continue so long as it is a viable force. The multilateral force will be built up, and if N.A.T.O. can be strengthened by both of them, well and good. As the multinational force gradually becomes obsolescent, so it will cease to play its part.<br/>
Thirdly, so far as expenditure is concerned, I am not prepared to give any detailed estimates at the moment because Her Majesty's Government are still considering in what form they should make a contribution and what the contribution should be.

<p>Yes, Sir. The Supplementary Estimate was due partly to a salary award, which applied throughout the Civil Service, and a wage increase to forest workers during the year; and partly to a fall in prices obtained for softwood thinnings.<br/>

<p>The discrepancies in this estimate amount to &#x00A3;600,000 in all.

<p>Nobody would decry the good job done by our inshore fishermen, and the hon. Member is right in saying that inshore fishermen in this country, like those in a lot of other countries, would like to see their limits extended. Of that there is no doubt. The hon. Member asked whether it is not time that we looked after our interests. This is a question of the interests of fishermen and of the fishing fleets as a whole. It must be remembered that it is the long-distance trawler fleets which provide 90 per cent. of the fish in our markets.</p>

<p>With permission, I should like to make a statement about a matter raised by the hon. Member for


Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) on 14th March during discussion of the business of the House for this week.<br/>
The hon. Member referred to Press reports that the Government proposed that Clause I of the Children and Young Persons Bill should be extended to cover Scotland.<br/>
The history of the matter is briefly as follows. Clause 1 of the Bill, as drafted, is designed to implement a recommendation of the Ingleby Committee on Children and Young Persons&#x2014;a Committee which dealt with England and Wales only&#x2014;to the effect that
<q>there should be a general duty laid upon local authorities to prevent or forestall the suffering of children through neglect in their own homes".</q>
The Clause, as introduced, was not framed to cover Scotland because the matter in relation to Scotland was being considered by a committee of the Scottish Advisory Council on Child Care under the chairmanship of Mr. J. McBoyle.<br/>
It was indicated to the House, however, by my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, during the course of the Second Reading of the Bill on 27th February, that the Report of the McBoyle Committee had recently been submitted and would shortly be published; that its main recommendations were on much the same lines as those of the Ingleby Committee for England and Wales; and that I had asked the Scottish local authority associations to let me have their views on them as a matter of urgency.<br/>
I am sorry that the intention that Clause 1 would be extended to cover Scotland if the local authority associations agreed was not stated more definitely, though I think that the implication of what was said was clear enough.<br/>
Subsequently, all the local authority associations supported the view that the main recommendations of the McBoyle Committee should be implemented by the extension of Clause 1 of the Bill to Scotland; and the Report was published as a Command Paper on 12th March, with an accompanying Press notice which indicated that Amendments designed to achieve this end would be tabled.<br/>
I very much regret that it was overlooked that the effect of this procedure

was that the announcement of my intentions was made to the Press before they had been precisely stated to Parliament&#x2014;although, as I have mentioned, the general indication of what was in my mind had, in fact, been given during the Second Reading debate on the Bill.<br/>
The Bill is, of course, to a considerable extent on a Great Britain basis and a large part of it already applies to Scotland. It now seems appropriate, by this proposed extension of Clause I to Scotland, to implement as soon as possible the most important part of the McBoyle Committee's Report and to that end the necessary Amendments to extend Clause 1 to Scotland will be tabled today.<br/>
I should have thought it unnecessary for this one particular point to be discussed in the Scottish Grand Committee when there has already been a very full debate in this House on the principles of the Bill, and there is no particularly Scottish problem arising out of the general issues involved in the Clause.<br/>
I apologise to the House. It would have been more appropriate to have answered a Parliamentary Question about my intentions and I am sorry that this was not done.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-03-20a.388.0" hansard_membership_id="11443" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31395" speakername="Mr. Ross" colnum="388" time="">
<p>We are grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his apology to the House for his belated recognition that it is unusual that in a matter as important as this a Bill which has been through all its stages in another place, and has had its Second Reading in this House, should then be so drastically altered in Committee, and for his recognition that this is a matter for announcement in the House.<br/>
The Secretary of State is rather unfair to us on this side and to the House as a whole in stating that his intention was not quite clear. I suggest to him that it simply was not declared. Indeed, does he appreciate that if his mind had been made up, his hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary had the opportunity to reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), who asked the point-blank question about Clause 1 and Scotland? No answer was forthcoming, either then or at the end of the debate, although my hon. Friend's speech was referred to by the Home Secretary.<br/>
Does the right hon. Gentleman appreciate that the Clause concerned was reckoned by everybody who spoke to it to be the most important Clause in the Bill? From that point of view, it could well be regarded as worthy of consideration by the Scottish Grand Committee.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman talks about full debate. Does he consider that a full debate, certainly on a matter as important as this affecting Scotland, is one in which one Scottish back bencher takes part? It is certainly not our idea. Will the right hon. Gentleman think again, not only about having a Second Reading debate and preserving our rights but about this second point? Many of his difficulties may well have arisen from the fact that while having the Report of the McBoyle Committee he consulted local authorities without giving Members of the House and the public the opportunity to see the Report. Why did he not publish the Report? Then we could have had our debate in the light of the McBoyle Report, which we on this side welcome and accept.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-03-20a.389.0" hansard_membership_id="9803" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30481" speakername="Mr. Noble" colnum="389" time="">
<p>It is true that my intention was not stated during Second Reading, but it is also true, if the hon. Member will think back to what was said on that occasion, that, in referring to Clause 1, my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department said that
<q>my right hon. Friend has asked the local authorities' associations to let him have their views on them as a matter of urgency,</q>
He went on to say:
<q>As regards the remainder of Part I of the Bill, we cannot at present foresee the possibility of comparable Scottish legislation."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th February, 1963: Vol. 672, c. 1267.]</q>
I should have thought that that was at least a very broad hint.<br/>
To deal with the second point made by the hon. Member, it would have been difficult without being discourteous to local authorities&#x2014;and we moved very fast in this matter, because we realised its importance&#x2014;to have announced something to the House as my intention before all the local authorities' replies had been received. The McBoyle Report was submitted to me on 31st January, the local authorities were circulated an 15th February and the debate took place on the 27th.<br/>
Therefore, as the hon. Member will realise, some local authorities would not have had full time to consider it. If, however, there has been a fault, I agree that it is perhaps through my trying to hurry too much to get this desirable feature in our legislation and I have apologised to the House for making this mistake.<br/>
It seems to me that a Second Reading debate is unnecessary, because there is in Committee an opportunity for, perhaps, widening the scope of Clause 1 to include other matters which hon. Members want. It is on a Great Britain basis. I do not see that by having a Second Reading debate in principle on this one aspect, we would be doing anything more than having a parallel debate which could take place in Committee.<br/>
I think that I have covered the points about consulting the local authorities before telling Members of the House. This, of course, is a very common practice in many of these cases&#x2014;</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has apologised quite clearly to the House and I think that the House will wish to leave the matter there in the light of his apology, but he has gone on to make a number of explanations, or attempted explanations, and I think that it is only right to ask him whether he is aware that the words which he has just quoted could not have been taken by the House as a broad hint or any other kind of hint. Those words were entirely obscure and gave no indication at all that there was the intention to widen Clause 1 to cover Scotland.<br/>
Is the right hon. Gentleman further aware that my hon. Friend made an extremely good point just now when he pointed out to the right hon. Gentleman that, he having received the Report on 31st January, if we were to get broad or obscure hints in the debate on 27th February, we could at least have been given the privilege of seeing the Report even while the local authority associations were being consulted? It is not


good enough to get a report, to hold it up for six weeks before publication, to make obscure noises in a Second Reading debate which we are now expected retrospectively to read more into than was expected at that time, and then think that the point has been dealt with.<br/>
Will the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;and I put it to the Leader of the House, too, since he is here listening&#x2014;take into account what my hon. Friend has just said about the desirability of debating the principle of this in the Scottish Grand Committee? I think that the right hon. Gentleman will find on rereading in HANSARD the debate to which he has just referred that there was no commitment that a debate would take place when the Scottish Report was available to this House, and I think that, in the circumstances, the best thing now would be to allow the Scottish Members to have the same freedom of discussion on a published Report as the English and Welsh Members had in the debate on 27th February. If he and the Leader of the House would consult about this I think that the House would be well content to leave the matter where it is.</p>

<p>I am sure that he House will be grateful to the Secretary of State for his apology. I am not quite certain why he apologised for not answering a question, or thought that it would be more appropriate to answering a question, because the Government were asked a question and if they wanted to answer it they could have done so.<br/>
Apart from the Parliamentary position, I am rather concerned about the status of Scottish administration. There have been suspicions in Scotland before that legislation for Scotland is tacked on to legislation primarily designed for England.<br/>
I am rather interested to know what might have been done, or was intended to be done, about the McBoyle's Committee's Report. The Committee did a lot of work on this matter, yet the Bill was introduced and allowed to proceed a long way on its course when it was known that the Committee was on the point of reporting? Was no notice taken of this by the Government in general? Or was it intended to have a

separate Scottish Bill? Or how were the findings of the Committee to be dealt with?</p>

<p>I think that the right hon. Gentleman, who has a long experience of these things, knows that when separate committees are sitting for England, Wales and Scotland and the reporting is not simultaneous, as so often has happened in the past, because the Scottish Committee reports, four, five or six months later, legislation is not brought before the House perhaps until a year or two later. In this case, we have done our very best to hurry this proceeding up and, perhaps, made a mistake in hurrying it too much, but we have done our best to overcome the sort of difficulty the right hon. Gentleman referred to.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman said that the Government were asked a question. This is true, but they were asked a question before the local authorities' reports had been received and the Government's intention at that time could not, therefore, I think, be given.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-03-20a.392.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. H. Wilson" colnum="392" time="">
<p>May I press the right hon. Gentleman further, to get it right on the record? He said that he received this Report on 31st January. Is it not a fact that the Report was signed in December, 1962, and then went to the Scottish Advisory Council on Child Care for comment before he formally received it? Is he really telling us that he did not know and no one in his Department knew the contents of this Report in December, 1962? Is it not a fact that in normal circumstances there was likely to be someone in his Department who would have known?<br/>
Did nobody in the Scottish Office know? Did not he tell him about the contents of this Report in December, 1962? So it was not six weeks, but 10 or 11 weeks, before publication. In all these circumstances would it not have been possible to have hurried up the printing and had this made available to Members before this "broad hint" was delivered on 27th February?</p>

<p>I think that the right hon. Gentleman is probably right in his suspicion that there were people in my Department who had, at any rate, some knowledge of what Mr. McBoyle's Committee was likely to report on some


factors, but, as I said, I received the Report on 31st January.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to indemnify the Secretary of State for Scotland from any penal consequences he may have incurred by his failure to observe the provisions of the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889.</q>
We have just had another example, if I may say so, of the kind of behaviour to which I now want to refer. The Bill which I now seek permission to introduce becomes necessary because it would appear that the Secretary of State for Scotland, by indifference, indolence and incompetence, has failed to secure the laying before Parliament of detailed annual reports under Section 30 of the Universities (Scotland) Act, 1889.<br/>
Implicit in my proposed Bill is the reassertion of the rights and privileges of Parliament against the might of the Executive and one particular member of it who has persistently evaded and ignored our legitimate claims for information, a problem which is very prominent in our debates in Parliament and the Press at the present time.<br/>
For some years now I and some of my hon. Friends have been asking Questions and initiating Adjournment debates to elicit information and facts about the Scottish universities, and all this activity, of course, was designed to substantiate the case for at least one new university in Scotland to meet the growing crisis over higher education. One source which we thought would be of advantage for this purpose was the laying of the reports provided for in the Act. Section 30 of that Act&#x2014;I shall only quote part of it&#x2014;says:
<q>The University Court of each University shall make an annual report &#x2026; and such other information as the Commissioners &#x2026; may from time to time determine, and &#x2026; on the state of the finances &#x2026; and the said reports shall be made to the Secretary for Scotland, and shall be laid by him before the General Council of the University and before Parliament &#x2026;</q>
There are no permissive powers there. They are mandatory all the way through, but, in fact, the reports have not been so laid for forty years, and certainly not in the form in which they were originally intended.<br/>
Questions which have been directed to these particular aspects have been


shuttled between the Scottish Office and the Treasury. The esteemed and respected Clerks of the House were, on occasion, as we were, puzzled as to which Minister had responsibility. Succeeding Secretaries of State for Scotland ignored our representations, but ultimately, on 5th December, 1962, I asked the Secretary of State for Scotland whether he had inquired into why the four universities had ceased at various times to fulfil their obligations, whether the former practice of making their annual returns could now be resumed, and whether, as a member of the Scottish Universities Committee of the Privy Council, he would bring that matter before that Committee.<br/>
Again, the Secretary of State did not take the hint. He walked blindly into trouble, and, instead of putting himself right, runs the risk of indictment at common law.<br/>
I received a letter from the Lord President of the Council. This is a most interesting letter, which reveals an extraordinary state of affairs. He starts by saying:
<q>The story is an odd one".</q>
And then makes the damning admission which makes this Bill necessary:
<q>On examining the matter I think that there is no doubt that the consultation of the Scottish Universities Committee in 1920 and 1921 was not only not a statutory duty, but was <i>ultra vires</i> &#x2026; The Committee has no say as to statistics of attendance on the various classes or details of teaching staff. It can only determine what other information shall be given in the Report.</q>
The Lord President of the Council goes on to say, with almost an audible sigh of relief:
<q>This, however, is not really a matter for me, for the Privy Council Office as such has, for the reason I have indicated, no jurisdiction either to dispense or to enforce the law and I really only come into it because I have to confess to a blunder by my predecessors of 1920 and 1921, and I suppose, to apologise for their having acted <i>ultra vires."</i></q>
Then he asks, plaintively:
<q>In the meantime, what is to be done?</q>
What, indeed? I thought that the best answer was to introduce this Bill.<br/>
It may be argued that there are no legal precedents on the question whether a Minister who must lay reports must also take the responsibility that they contain the items specified in the Act.<br/>
I submit, however, that the obligation to present does imply a responsibility to scrutinise what he is presenting and, if he considers it to be deficient or inefficient, to adopt suitable precautions. That responsibility is a political one to be discharged in and to Parliament.<br/>
As far as I know, there is only one precedent for such a state of affairs when a principal Minister was indemnified by the Government of the day. In 1944, the then Home Secretary, now Lord Morrison of Lambeth, admitted in the House that certain Fire Service Regulations, which his Department was required to lay before the House by Act of Parliament, had not, in fact, been so laid, but he said that no act of indemnity would be required since the matter was one only for Parliament. As reported in HANSARD, 26th July, 1944, he said that as far as he knew, there were no sanctions for failing to lay the Regulations. He added:
<q>I do not think any question of indemnifying legislation will be necessary."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 26th July, 1944; Vol. 402, c. 763.]</q>
But the House&#x2014;we know who the Prime Minister was in those days&#x2014;took quite a different view and insisted that such a Bill should be introduced. That, too, is quite clear from a perusal of the same Volume of HANSARD, at columns 899 and 1207. The then Home Secretary said:
<q>There lies on every Minister a heavy responsibility to secure meticulous observance of a mandatory duty imposed on him by Act of Parliament &#x2026; Every Department &#x2026; will examine its arrangements with a view to ensuring that, the Minister shall not be exposed to such risk by any fault in the official machinery.</q>
The then Home Secretary even went on to say, referring to himself:
<q>&#x2026; appropriate punishment ought to fall on the responsible Minister. &#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 26th July, 1944; Vol. 402, c. 1218&#x2013;9.]</q>
That Act of indemnification absolved the then Home Secretary for his neglect to lay those Regulations, and it received the Royal Assent on 3rd August, 1944.<br/>
We have now to consider the punishment to which the Secretary of State for Scotland is liable in the absence of indemnification. The Act of 1889 does not itself lay down any penalty. But he is indictable at common law and can be tried for misdemeanour. Some of my hon. Friends think that the term should


be "criminal negligence". But reference to Halsbury's 3rd Edition, Vol. 36, paragraph 675, shows that it reads:
<q>Indictment on Information. Every breach of a statutory command is, in the absence of specific provision, indictable at common law as a misdemeanour.</q>
It may be argued that such a personal disaster would be most unlikely but we have had quite a few personal disasters attending Ministers in the Conservative Administration during the last twelve years. Acts of indemnity are passed not to protect against the probability, but to cover a Minister against any possibility, however remote, of penal sanctions.<br/>
The Secretary of State's defence may be that he is an extremely busy man. He is Minister for Housing, Health, Education, Agriculture and Town Planning, and, of course, he also has to keep an interest in the study of Highland cattle, their habits and habitats. But so is the Lord President of the Council an extremely busy man. Yet it did not take him years to reply. He replied within three weeks. He, too, is a busy man, as we all know, because in addition to being Lord President, he is Minister of Sport, Minister for Science and Minister for North-East England and, I understand, he is also a devotee of campanology.<br/>
Some of my hon. Friends disagree with me in my asking permission to introduce the Bill. They think that the law should take its course, not only for this offence but for those in respect of his failure to deal with unemployment and housing. To me, however, the part of Portia is much more attractive than that of Shylock. The grand jury, the Scottish electorate, will try him on those charges in due course at the next General Election, and I have no doubt about their verdict.<br/>
My hon. Friends will have noted that if the Secretary of State were proceeded against and found guilty, his two years' sentence would overrun the statutory limit of this Parliament. Even with six months' remission for good conduct, which is doubtful, it is still questionable whether he would be released in time. In any case, I ask him to believe&#x2014;not that I have had any experience of it&#x2014;that Barlinnie Prison is not an ideal place from which the Chairman of the Scottish Unionist Party could conduct an election campaign.<br/>
Appropriately enough, we have the Scottish Criminal Justice Bill coming into the Committee stage. Since we are already without a Lord Advocate in the House, and without a Solicitor-General, it would be just too much to deprive ourselves of the Secretary of State for Scotland. On balance, it would be much better that he should pilot that Bill through the House, so that he would be one of the first inhabitants to reap some of the benefits.<br/>
The real victims of this unholy mess are probably the growing numbers of young people in Scotland who, having certificates of fitness for entry into universities, may have been deprived of their opportunity because of the Secretary of State's complete failure to inquire more closely into the increasing difficulties attending higher education. It will need a new Government with alert, energetic Ministers, to put this right.</p>

We have been told that the Secretary of State for Scotland has been guilty of gross neglect in his duty on a very important issue concerning the universities. I do not at ail wince from the prospect of the Secretary of State for Scotland going to Barlinnie. I would willingly visit him there, as I did recently a minister who is a constituent of mine and who went there for taking part in demonstrations at the Holy Loch.<br/>
The Secretary of State must agree that there has been a grave neglect of duty. Although I am usually inclined to mercy, I think that the law should take its course and that the Secretary of State should be dispatched to Barlinnie forthwith.</p>

<p>I desire to raise an item of Government expenditure of &#x00A3;5,000, what they call, I believe, their final contribution to the funds of the Freedom From Hunger Campaign. The &#x00A3;5,000 is an addition to the &#x00A3;30,000 which they have given before.<br/>
I want to start by making clear the aim and purpose of the eminent organisers of this campaign. Since it was launched three years ago by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, our British committee has established 750 local committees, has secured the affiliation of 72 voluntary organisations, has obtained from private

sources promises of help or actual gifts of nearly &#x00A3;6 million, and still hopes to raise much more. It is operating on a common plan with national committees in 55 other countries that are members of the United Nations.<br/>
What is the purpose of this formidable organisation of effort and good will? It is not charity. It is not to buy food for hungry mouths. It is, say the organisers, twofold, and I quote their words:
<q>First, to make known the facts of hunger in our twentieth century world, to explain the urgency of the problem, and how it can be conquered; second, to show the peoples of the underdeveloped countries"&#x2014;</q>
it is more convenient to call them, as I shall call them, the developing countries&#x2014;
<q>what they can do successfully to help themselves</q>
The committee wants to do this&#x2014;
<q>by raising funds to be used for starting work of permanent value in as many places as possible".</q>


In other words, the money given in Britain will all be used for social and economic development. It will be the first phase of the United Nations Development Decade, for which the British delegate voted in December, 1961. It will, above all, if it succeeds, educate the Governments and the peoples, including our Government and our people here, in the vastly greater task which they must carry through with Government resources before our present decade ends.<br/>
It is this task of public education which gives real significance to our British Freedom From Hunger Campaign. In itself, the campaign is and can be only a tiny pilot plan to deal with the biggest international problem, after armaments, which the world confronts today. Suppose it succeeds beyond our dreams. World Refugee Year raised &#x00A3;80 million. If this raised twice as much&#x2014;&#x00A3;160 million&#x2014;what could that achieve in solving world hunger?<br/>
What are the facts? Mr. Gordon Evans, of the United Nations Association, who has done such admirable work in creating informed opinion on the subject, says that the main purpose of the campaign is to dramatise and humanise the programme of action that is needed. The facts, in all conscience, are dramatic enough. Half the people of the world are underfed. They do not eat enough to keep them healthy, strong and well. But all the same, they are increasing in numbers very fast. Today, the total is 3,000 million. In 2000 A.D., only thirty-seven years from now, half the lifetime of the babies born in 1963, it will be 6,000 million.<br/>
When I was at the Peace Conference in Paris, in 1919, I remember learning with astonishment that the population of the great African continent was under 100 million. It is now 237 million. In 2000 A.D. it will be 517 million. The population of Latin America is now 206 million. In 2000 A.D. it will be nearly 600 million. The population of Asia is now 1,500 million. In 2000 A.D. it will be 3,707 million. Who, I wonder, will be the great Powers then? To feed these people, says F.A.O., world food production must be doubled by 1980 and trebled a more difficult task, by 2000.<br/>
From what level do we start? What do our words convey when we say that

half our fellow human beings are underfed? Ritchie Calder, one of the greatest authorities on the subject, quoted the other day what he called the "Litany of Hunger in the East"&#x2014;
<q>Better to walk than to run.</q>
<q>Better to sit than to walk.</q>
<q>Better to sleep than to sit.</q>
<q>Better to die than to wake.</q>
That, he says&#x2014;
<q>is the muted misery of millions It does not shout from the headlines like famine, nor scandalise us like the walking skeletons of Belsen. It is the creeping death of malnutrition, of people dragging out the years of a stunted life, without the energy or the will to help themselves.</q>
Let the House look more closely at what this means. Professor Banks, Professor of Human Ecology at Cambridge, wont for the World Health Organisation to the University of Lucknow. He made a detailed survey of the lives of 5,000 people in four villages near there. The infant mortality was 190 per 1,000. In Britain, it is 21. Only half the children born grow up to be adult. Fifty per cent. of the people had hook-worm and another 10 per cent. had other worm diseases, which caused them grievous suffering and drastically reduced their ability and their will to work.<br/>
In village schools there was often not a single healthy child. Seventy per cent. in the age group 0 to 14 were tubercular positive. In one district, 92 per cent. of the population suffered from eye troubles. Trachoma varied in different districts from 60 per cent. to 80 per cent. Everyone&#x2014;men, women and children&#x2014;were suffering from malnutrition.<br/>
Things are much the same in large parts of Africa. There is a common disease in children in Africa, kwashickor. This means, "the sickness of which the first baby dies when the next baby is born". When a baby is weaned by its mother, it goes on a diet which is deficient in protein. Its hair goes grey. Its skin cracks like a crazy paving. Its stomach swells. It lives, and soon dies, in tearless, inarticulate misery.<br/>
There is another affliction, zerophthalmia, blindness in infants due to lack of Vitamin A. There is hunger toxicosis, dehydrating a baby, which will die without the complicated treatment of transfusion.<br/>
Consider the problem of these developing countries through the eyes of a Communist. In the General Assembly of the United Nations, a few days ago, ad Iron Curtain delegate said that United States capitalists had for a century or more been taking minerals, oil, fruit and sugar from Latin America and had made enormous fortunes for themselves. The statistics showed, he said, that the average income of the people of the United States was ten times the average of the peoples of Latin America. The Iron Curtain delegate added, with a sardonic irony not lost on many of the delegates in the Assembly, "And they call it the free world".<br/>
We can make the same sort of comparison for ourselves. For three centuries we have had an expanding empire of which, for many reasons, if not all, we were justly proud. Last July, the hon. Member for Louth (Sir C. Osborne) told the House that the average income per person in Pakistan was &#x00A3;19 a year, that in India it was &#x00A3;24, and in Britain was &#x00A3;387. He might have added that in Uganda, now independent, the average income was &#x00A3;20 and that for the five years up to 1961 it had been going down.<br/>
With the curse of hunger, poverty and disease there goes the crowning handicap of illiteracy. There are, perhaps, 1,000 million people in the world who cannot really read or write. U.N.E.S.C.O. stated last autumn that of all people between the ages of 5 and 20 only two in five received any kind of formal education. So the great majority of young people in the developing countries today get no schooling at all. If present plans mature less than half the children is Asia will go to school in 1970. How can we hope, in these circumstances, for a system of free democracy to work?<br/>
What can the Freedom From Hunger Campaign, with its voluntary contributions, hope to do to meet this vast complex of tragic human problems and mitigate the suffering and waste they involve? It can demonstrate by concrete schemes of development that if the advanced nations want to do it, all those problems can be solved. Indeed, some of them could be solved very quickly and cheaply. Yaws is a horrible disease, but it can be cured by a dose or two of penicillin. Ten cures for a dollar is what

it means and if it were wiped out the agricultural output of the countries in which it is found would be immensely increased. Blindness makes a person helpless and a burden on the society in which he lives, but trachoma can be cured by the application of an ointment which is cheap to buy.<br/>
Food production can be much increased by simple changes requiring no agricultural revolution. The Western scythe for the sickle multiplied the hay crop threefold some years ago in Afghanistan, while Western hoes did the same for vegetable foods. Better seed multiplied the rice yield in India, Japan, Italy and in many other countries. The farming of fish in the paddy-fields of South-East Asia, introduced by F.A.O. ten years ago, has added protein to the diet of many millions of people. Western experts, Western methods and Western machines can do much more.<br/>
It is not a lack of knowledge or resources that need limit our efforts to wipe out these great world evils. The Freedom From Hunger Campaign will demonstrate in many places and in many ways how this can be done. It is giving &#x00A3;12,000 to improve the cattle at Allahabad by cross-breeding the local cattle with Jersey the Brown Swiss bulls; and 300 villages will benefit by the results of this. It is giving &#x00A3;22,000 for a scheme of nutritional education for young women in Uganda to teach them, when they become mothers, how to avoid the deadly deficiency disease of which I have spoken.<br/>
It is giving &#x00A3;150,000 to the Department of Land Utilisation in Swaziland&#x2014;and how vastly important is the argricultural future of Swaziland today&#x2014;to set up an agricultural college to provide 20 students a year with a two-year course. It is giving &#x00A3;1,000 to enable the fishermen of Aden to visit Malta for a six-week course in modern methods and to learn these methods from the Maltese fishermen. It is giving the F.A.O. &#x00A3;38,000 to establish cheese production in Libya by the importation of Sarda sheep.<br/>
So far, the Freedom From Hunger Campaign has committed more than &#x00A3;3 million to schemes like this, and the three great relief organisations&#x2014;Oxfam, War on Want and Save the Children Fund&#x2014;have pledged more than another &#x00A3;2 million. All this is admirable work to which the whole Committee will pledge its full


support. It will open our people's eyes to the nature of the problem and its vast extent, it will show the receiving peoples how they can help themselves and it will be a notable addition to the work of the United Nations agencies which have been struggling with the problem since 1945. But if we are to avoid a great disaster within two decades from now the Governments must do far more to support the United Nations agencies than they are now doing; to give them moral support, experts and far greater resources than they have been granted hitherto.<br/>
The United Nations Technical Assistance Board began, I think, in 1950 with a programme of 25 million dollars for eighteen months. For years, while in opposition, we had great difficulty in making Her Majesty's Government maintain their proper contribution to the total of 25 million dollars. At length we got it up to 30 million dollars and last year&#x2014;and I am talking of the total&#x2014;it touched 50 million dollars.<br/>
In 1959, Mr. Paul Hoffman's Special Fund was added to the Assistance Board. It began with 25 million dollars a year and in 1962 it was increased to 50 million dollars. But this was far short of the target which was set when the British delegate voted for the United Nations Development Decade in 1961. The target was 150 million dollars and the Secretary-General has said that if the minimum target of the Decade is to be attained by 1970, the resources of these two agencies&#x2014;the Technical Assistance Board and the Special Fund&#x2014;must rise by 25 million dollars a year and must reach 300 million dollars by the end of the decade.<br/>
Much the most important of the agencies has been the International Bank. It has done splendid work and 600 million dollars worth of loans, mostly to developing countries, have been made in its first fifteen years of work. However, Mr. Eugene Black, who has just retired as Chairman, and who has a world-wide reputation for statesmanship of the highest order, has said that the Bank must lend far more in the years to come.<br/>
Mr. Black set up, to supplement the work of the International Bank, what is called the International Development Association, its purpose being to make interest-free loans for what Mr. Black

calls "pre-investment projects"&#x2014;such as water supply, roads, schools, railways, housing, health services; things that must be done before productive agriculture, mineral and industrial development plans can be put on foot.<br/>
The I.D.A. will this year commit, in interest-free loans, 500 million dollars, and will exhaust the funds which have so far been put at its disposal. Mr. Black says that the demands will grow very greatly from year to year. Mr. Hoffman, more specifically, and with equal experience of big business and world poverty, says that the International Bank and the I.D.A. must each invest at least 1,000 million dollars a year for the rest of this decade.<br/>
What is the minimum target that this investment would achieve? It is modest enough. It would be a rise from 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. in the annual rate of growth of the national incomes of the developing countries, an increase in their standard of living by 1970 of only 25 per cent. Of course, such an increase would be, for Britain, which lives by importing food and raw materials and by exporting manufactured goods, a magnificent investment. It would be no less magnificent for the world at large.<br/>
But where will the money come from? Where will these agencies get the 25 million dollar annual increase, the 300 million dollars in 1970 for the Technical Assistance Board and the Special Fund, the 1,000 million dollars for the International Bank, and the 1,000 million dollars for the I.D.A.? These sums must come, of course, from Government resources of advanced nations like ours. That is why the most important function of the present campaign is to educate Governments and peoples in the brutal facts which they must face.<br/>
Of course, there are other things besides giving aid which Governments ought to do. Above all, they ought to stabilise the prices of the commodities which the developing countries have to sell. Shortly before he died, Mr. Hammarskjoeld said:
<q>A fall of only 5 per cent, in the average of their export prices is approximately equivalent to the entire annual inflow of capital which they receive, not from International Bank loans only, but from all other public and private loans and Government grants</q>
In a recent year, cereals fell by 11 per cent. in price, sugar by 47 per cent., fats


by 12 per cent., wool by 32 per cent. and metal ores by 9 per cent. We in this country benefited by these falls in prices of our imports and our export prices for manufactured goods were simultaneously going up.<br/>
The terms of trade are still turning in our favour at the expense of these developing countries. It must be a prime object of Government policy to get commodity agreements to stabilise prices, however difficult it may be, Surely, as Lady Jackson argued so eloquently upstairs the other day, we must open our Western markets to the simple manufactured goods which the developing countries have to sell.<br/>
Whatever else may happen, the Government must invest much more through the United Nations agencies of which I have spoken. Our present Government have not a very brilliant record on this. For years, as I have said, they stabilised their contribution to the United Nations Technical Assistance Board and the Special Fund at 8 million dollars a year. Last autumn, for 1963, thanks to the persistent efforts of my hon. Friends the Members for East Ham, North (Mr. Prentice) and Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson), they have added 2 million dollars. They called that a 25 per cent. increase, and it sounds grand, but it will not go far towards meeting the 300 million dollars needed by these two agencies in 1970.<br/>
The Government have also given 5 million dollars, spread over three years, to the World Food Fund, an F.A.O. project to use food surpluses to promote development schemes. They have refused to issue in this country Freedom From Hunger stamps, although 76 other countries have found it possible to do so.<br/>
In the General Assembly, they voted that 1 per cent. of the national income should be devoted to international aid. I should like to hear very much how this vote has been implemented since then. I agree that they have also given the sum of &#x00A3;35,000 to our British Freedom From Hunger campaign. That is 0&#x00B7;002 per cent. of our annual armaments bill, and would pay Dr. Beeching for eighteen months.<br/>
What visionary master mind in what corner of Whitehall hit on that majestic sum? Perhaps he thought that the

Government could recoup it from one day's revenue from the new Post Office tariffs, announced yesterday. Whatever the calculation, it is a pretty sordid reflection on the priorities of those who rule us now. It is a derisory sum which the Government should at once and very much increase.<br/>
This great international campaign will succeed in its purpose only if it brings Governments to face the realities of this and the other decades that lie ahead. At present, the great military Powers are spending &#x00A3;45,000 million on armaments a year&#x2014;perhaps as much, says the Economist intelligence Unit, as the whole present income of the developing nations which need our aid. Unless we can have a new vision of this problem, and take the measures which Mr. Black and Mr. Hoffman now advise, we shall face a great world disaster in the lifetime of most hon. Members present here today.<br/>
I have quoted many figures about hunger, poverty and disease. But imagination is, alas, the feeblest of human faculties. Have I made anyone really feel the misery and the needless pain which these figures represent? If the Government will face this moral challenge&#x2014;for that is what it is&#x2014;and allow Britain to lead the other nations in doing what Mr. Black and Mr. Hoffman have told us is required, they will not only be serving a British interest, they will not only earn a handsome dividend for British trade in years to come, but will do very much to build up, on firm foundations, the authority of the United Nations and the sovereign power of its international law.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mr. P. Noel-Baker) has rendered signal service by raising this problem as the subject of our debate. It is a problem that transcends all party considerations. Indeed, it passes over national boundaries. It is a problem which affects the whole world. It is quite impossible to carry on any longer ignoring the stark facts of the world situation&#x2014;a situation which, as my right hon. Friend has just told us, results in more than half the total population of the world living on the margin of subsistence in conditions of hunger and affected by disease.<br/>
Such conditions constitute a premium upon war and conflict. So long as they continue, they will undermine the permanent basis of world peace. We are told of the potential nuclear threat to the welfare of mankind, but here we are dealing with an actual problem affecting the welfare and happiness of the teeming millions of Asia, Africa and Latin America.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South has quoted some basic facts relating to the problem of world hunger. I will give another. One-third of the world's population lives in the industrialised countries of Europe and North America. The average yearly income of that one-third is ten times that of the 2,000 million people of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It is obvious that so long as we have a world divided into haves and have-nots, so long will we have the undercurrents of seething discontents in those parts of the world which we call the under-developed countries.<br/>
It is in these circumstances that, at long last, the United Nations has decided to grapple with this terrible problem. I said that it transcended party lines and national boundaries. In a world divided East from West, and in which &#x00A3;45,000 million a year are spent on the creation and construction of some of the worst weapons of mass destruction that the human imagination is able to appreciate, every single member of the United Nations, 104 members, representing both Communist and non-Communist, all races and all nations, unanimously decided to launch this programme of the Development Decade.<br/>
It is not sufficient to regard this as merely providing food and nourishment for the hungry and those suffering from malnutrition, vital as that is to the millions in the underdeveloped countries. Through no fault of their own, these people do not have the "know-how" and the social and economic infrastructures which are so essential in the more advanced countries and to the standards of living which so many of us in the West are able to enjoy. These people are not merely to be given charity. What is essential is that their standards of living should be built up and to do that they must be assisted to develop their economies

and to play their part in that development.<br/>
This programme&#x2014;and it is only a programme and there is a long way to go before it becomes reality&#x2014;provides that until 1970 aid will be given through private and national investment so that the underdeveloped countries can build up their economic and social infrastructures. This means that we have to do a great deal more than we have done.<br/>
A great deal has already been done, and we should not underestimate it, by most of the countries of the West, although I agree with my right hon. Friend that we would like to see our own Government doing more. Much has been done, through the Colombo Plan and Point Four and through technical assistance, to train these people to be able to build up their own economies.<br/>
I was in Guatemala six weeks ago and I was very impressed with the fine main roads along which I travelled. I congratulated the person with whom I was travelling on the efforts of the Guatemalan engineers, but I was told that the roads had been built by United States engineers with capital provided by the United States. That is a good contribution to that country's economy, but we have to seek to train these countries so that they are able to build up their economies through their own efforts.<br/>
One of the main provisions of the Development Decade will be to assist underdeveloped countries by constructing roads, hospitals, drainage systems, railways and factories, and by providing them with agricultural and industrial machinery and other means of developing their own economies. This will not be done without the provision of capital, both private and governmental.<br/>
Mr. Paul Hoffman has estimated that at least &#x00A3;1,000 million a year during the next ten years, in addition to what has already bean invested, will be necessary to secure the target set by the programme, namely, that by the end of the decade the aggregate national income throughout the underdeveloped countries will have been increased by 5 per cent. per annum. That may not seem very much until it is appreciated that in countries like India and Pakistan and those of Africa the present annual income is extremely small. If


we can secure an increase of 5 per cent. per annum, in due course it will be possible to double the standard of living of these countries.<br/>
I do not know whether the &#x00A3;1,000 million will be available. If it is not, this programme will fail. This is not only a moral but an economic challenge. It is in our own interest that the programme should succeed and that the world should no longer be divided into haves and have-nots. I am reminded of what Abraham Lincoln said during the early stages of the American Civil War, that a nation could not endure half-slave and half-free. The world cannot endure when half its population lives in abundance and half in squalor, poverty, disease and misery such as characterise the people of these countries.<br/>
That is the challenge which faces us, not only our own people, but all the peoples of the world, irrespective of colour, creed or religion. The challenge was accepted by the 104 nations of the United Nations. We need deeds as well as words. I cannot believe that this is a challenge which we cannot expect to fulfil. In a world spending &#x00A3;45,000 million a year on armaments, I cannot believe that it is not possible for the nations to make their contribution to the &#x00A3;1,000 million a year needed over the next ten years.<br/>
I should like to quote what was said by the Secretary-General of the United Nations about the problem of world hunger and the depressed nations and the importance of this programme, the Development Decade. In Copenhagen, in May last year, U Thant said:
<q>Shall we be able to make this Decade of Development the achievement in human solidarity we hope it will be &#x2026;? It is not enough for us in the United Nations to dedicate ourselves to the Decade of Development. We have to take with us the Governments to whom we are responsible and through them we have to reach out to the peoples &#x2026;Our Decade of Development cannot ultimately succeed unless it is rooted in the wills and hearts of millions of citizens everywhere. It will not succeed unless it can win their sustained support. It will not succeed unless they see it as a great goal of human endeavour and one which they are prepared to make their own &#x2026;</q>
I believe that this debate will help to make the people of our country realise that this is a goal which they can make their own.</p>

<p>I apologise to the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Mr. P. Noel-Baker) for not having been present for the beginning of his speech. It may be that, in consequence, I shall traverse some of the ground already covered and give some figures which the right hon. Gentleman has already quoted.<br/>
We have just heard a very moving speech by the right hon. and learned Member for Rowley Regis and Tipton (Mr. A. Henderson). There is no doubt that this campaign, the Freedom From Hunger Campaign, is one which appeals to the humanity of the people of the world. It calls forth the greatest charity&#x2014;I use the word "charity" in its best sense&#x2014;but, unfortunately, appeals to the charity of the human race often fall on very few ears.<br/>
When one is talking on a subject like this one is often accused of talking in platitudes. But what is a platitude but a truth that we are tired of hearing? We are constantly told of the hunger, poverty, misery and disease which inflict so many millions of people throughout the world, and after a time we get hardened to it; we get bored by repetition and begin to think that we are talking in platitudes because most of us have no personal experience of this problem. We have not actually seen the conditions about which eve are being told.<br/>
I want, therefore, not to appeal to the House on the ground of humanity entirely, but on the ground of enlightened self-interest. It has been calculated that the world population today is increasing at the rate of about 1&#x00B7;8 per cent. per annum. At present, that means that it is increasing by about 54 million people a year&#x2014;more than the entire population of the United Kingdom. It means, too, that over the next forty years, at a progressive rate the population of the world will have gone up from about 3,000 million to 6,000 million.<br/>
The great danger that will face the world as a result of what is popularly described today as the "population explosion" will be to the peace of the world and increasing danger, too, to the forms of democratic government as we know them today.<br/>
A very interesting conference was held in the United States not very long ago, at which some of the outstanding scientists of the world were present, when this danger was emphasised&#x2014;that problems would arise, for democratic forms of government as we understand them, from this increasing pressure of population. If we are to meet this problem&#x2014;and we have not got very long; forty years, after all, is nothing&#x2014;and if the danger is to increase intensely year by year, we must, I am certain, conscript all the available resources of the Western world.<br/>
One major problem is to produce enough food for the increasing population. Another problem is that of achieving some control of population growth, which is very difficult in some underdeveloped countries. There is no doubt that there are many ways of increasing food supplies. We have not yet done more than touch the fringe of the world's food resources&#x2014;in the sea, for example. But to develop new kinds of food resources we want a great deal of money, technical "know-how" and technical resources.<br/>
As much as anything, the underdeveloped parts of the world require technical assistance from skilled men and women. We have not just to provide them with food that we obtain or produce ourselves and hand it over to them; we have, as the right hon. Gentleman said, to help to teach them to help themselves. We have to increase their own ability to maintain their own growing population and make a contribution to the world resources as a whole.<br/>
In the past, I have advanced what some people would describe as a rather insane idea; but it is not an unusual thing to hear insane ideas advanced in this House, so perhaps I am in good company. My idea is to try to mobilise the resources of technical skills in the developing Western countries and particularly in our own for the benefit of the underdeveloped countries.<br/>
I envisage, for example, a form of conscription for peace. We have conscription for war, or for the preparation for war, and I should like to see the youth of the nation brought into a service where they can receive training in technical skills which they may not possess

already and be employed around the world to help the underdeveloped countries which need that kind of skill.<br/>
This would have two major advantages. One is that it would give help to the underdeveloped countries which they really need, and the other is that it would give technical training to many young people who might not otherwise get it, which would he of great value to them after they have finished their period of service.<br/>
This idea has many problems and difficulties, but it emphasises the main point that I want to make, that if we rely merely upon voluntary effort, upon appeals to the instinct of charity and the good nature of the people of the world, we shall get a very limited response. Cases of this sort are duly supported by a fraction of the people, by a small minority with a strongly developed social conscience who come to the rescue, but this is not sufficient. We have to conscript&#x2014;and I use that word deliberately&#x2014;the world's resources of manpower, technical ability, and cash for the benefit of the world as a whole if we are to solve this problem.<br/>
I do not want to develop this any more, because there may be other hon. Members who may wish to speak on this topic. I end by emphasising the tremendous danger to the peace of the world if we do not do something quite drastic and revolutionary to meet the danger in the very near future. Time is not on our side. We shall face one of the greatest problems that the world has ever faced if we do not find a way of dealing with this tremendous growth in population and ensuring that its peoples have a reasonable opportunity of enjoying a moderate standard of living.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mr. P. Noel-Baker) said that one of the objectives of his speech was to dramatise the facts, and he did this with the eloquence and humanity that we expect of him.<br/>
I should like to carry on one or two of the points made by my right hon. Friend. Never before in our history has there been a deeper ditch or a wider gap


between the wealthy people of the world and the poor, between those who lack nothing and those who have need of everything. It is ironical that an American professor, Prof. Galbraith, should write a book on the economics of affluence, a book, in effect, on the economics of satiation and the problems of an economy which is trying to persuade people with two cars to have three and people with two refrigerators to have another one. It is ironic that a person should write this sort of book in a world in which Mr. Norris Dodds, the Director-General on the F.A.O., on his world travels in Asia as few years ago, quoted the example of a family who had one linen sheet which was used not only for bedding but for clothing. When one member of the family went to town dressed in the linen sheet the rest of the family crouched naked in their hut waiting for his return&#x2014;this side by side with the economists of the West discussing the problems of satiation.<br/>
Before the war 38 per cent. of the world's population did not have enough to eat. After ail our advances, this figure has risen to 59&#x00B7;5 per cent., and yet our world stocks are rising. In a recent year the North American output of cereals and other foodstuffs rose by 12 per cent. The paradox is that at a time when the starvation level, measured by arbitrary medical standards, is rising, world stocks of food are rising. There are various things that we can do about this. One was touched on by my right hon. Friend&#x2014;give people a fair price for their products and get world trade moving between industrial countries and the primary trade countries.<br/>
I often think that economists have become obsessed, as we did over the Common Market negotiations, with the pattern of trade rather than the process of trade. If the process of world trade is liberalised, I think that the pattern to some extent takes care of itself. I think that economists have become too obsessed with static examples of patterns of trade instead of looking at international export-import organisations to facilitate the processes of world trade.<br/>
Another thing that we must do is to help people to help themselves. We can do this in a variety of ways, which I shall touch on in a moment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall) gave an estimate of the rise

in population. It will be 6,000 million by the end of the century. Economists have estimated that every million added to the world's population calls for an addition to the world's food supplies of 13 million tons of cereals and 14 million tons of animal products, by which I mean meat, milk, eggs and the like. Every year about 100 million children are born and about 51 million die. In other words, each year our population increases by about 48 million. A population increase equal to the size of France is added to the world virtually every year. When we break down the figures into regions we see that the rate of growth of population in Europe, for instance, with all its tremendous technological and cultural achievements, is 0&#x00B7;7 per cent. At the other extreme, the rate of population growth in the Ivory Coast is 5&#x00B7;3 per cent.<br/>
I think that my right hon. Friend used the term "developing countries". This is a better phrase than underdeveloped countries. The problem of these developing countries is that they have a medieval birth rate associated with a modern death rate, and this is a very serious problem. Some countries, such as China, are tackling their problems efficiently though rather ruthlessly. The Chinese now have a population of 660 million, and they estimate to double that&#x2014;to about 1,280 million&#x2014;by the end of the century. In other words, by that time a quarter of humanity will be Chinese. The Chinese are tackling the problem in various ways. They are doing it by directing migration to the more sparsely inhabited lands of the north and west territories, and also by a good deal of ruthless control and hard work. By these methods they are reducing the incidence of famine and plagues in a spectacular fashion, but the more tempting areas of colonisation lie beyond the existing frontiers of China, which brings me back to the point made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rowley Regis and Tipton (Mr. A. Henderson), who related the diplomatic and military problems to our economic problems.<br/>
We have seen China casting covetous eyes on Tibet and Nepal. Tomorrow she may be interested in Mongolia and those parts of Manchuria under Russian control. Siberia has only eighteen people per square mile, compared with the


densely populated areas of China. To remove the threat of hunger in the world is to lessen the diplomatic and military tensions that arise. What we need for these backward territories is more agricultural production, which I think in turn depends on giving a greater aptitude to the farmers and workers in those countries to work harder and harder; but here we come to a vicious circle. The people in many parts of these countries are afflicted by diseases like malaria. They want to sit or sleep, and their energy is sapped. Children go to school on a nonexistent breakfast and fall asleep in front of their teachers. Their intellectual processes are slowed down. Their physical processes are slowed down by a lack of food, and they do not produce very much.<br/>
These developing countries must have the tools. In the world of electronics and automation, in a world in which we are sending people to the moon and developing nuclear power beyond our wildest dreams, most of the people who cultivate land in India do not have even a scythe. If they had their task would be made infinitely easier. We therefore have to equip these people, encourage the rearrangement of fanning methods and land reform, and provide facilities for health and education.<br/>
One of the things that we have to get across to the developing countries&#x2014;and we are partly to blame&#x2014;is that they must not always become obsessed with the spectacular highly industrialised schemes. There is no reason why projects for fertilising deserts should be held back for more spectacular ventures. These countries look to Britain and the West and see that in our country industrialisation is accompanied by higher living standards, but I think that this can be a dangerous obsession. One reason why we do not provide a good example is that these developing countries see that industrialisation is a good basis for military power. Some of those countries want to be in on the arms race. We cannot stop progress in electronics, automation and industrialisation, but we can spread information about the need for meeting man's essential needs&#x2014;food, clothing, housing, health, and so on&#x2014;in those parts of the world.<br/>
One of the reasons for morbidity and mortality in a large part of the world is something that scientists located and

diagnosed long ago&#x2014;a deficiency of protein. We have carried out a tremendous amount of research into this problem. It is not a lack of knowledge that holds these people back. For example, there has been our research into Vitamin A, which is found in oils and mineral fats, which prevents blindness. In Indonesia, a recent pilot project showed that 83 per cent. of the children between the ages of one and six years old had eye diseases which, unless checked, would in adult life cause lesions of the cornea and consequent blindness which would then be irreversible. This could be cured if these people could have food containing Vitamin A or the vitamin itself.<br/>
Then there is the lack of Vitamin B.1, which causes beri-beri. It has been shown that if this is present in food, or if it is given in vitamin form, it can cure this disease. The same thing applies in the case of Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, which prevents scurvy, and Vitamin D, which is vital for proper bone formation. There is a lack of this in the diets of people over a large proportion of the globe. All these vitamins are present in certain high-quality foods, such as meat, milk and cheese, but these foods are very scarce in some continents and unknown in some countries.<br/>
Scientists have estimated that a satisfactory diet is provided by about 3,000 calories a day. If there is less than 2,500 there is under-nourishment. Less than 2,000 calories means acute shortage&#x2014;and most of the areas that we are discussing come into that category&#x2014;less than 1,500 indicates famine, and a diet of less than 1,000 calories, if prolonged, causes death to ensue. The Nazis, in their concentration camps, disposed of their victims by setting a ceiling of 1,000 calories. This was a highly successful way of massacring the inhabitants of those camps.<br/>
Here again, we have to spread information about the kind of crops that yield these calories. Historical accidents in different parts of the world, and accidents of soil and climate, in geography, have had much to do with the health of the people living in these areas. If we think in terms of the average calory yield, per million to the acre, we find that a sugar crop produces 10&#x00B7;1; bananas, 5&#x00B7;6; potatoes, 4&#x00B7;7; rice, 2&#x00B7;7; wheat, 2&#x00B7;1; milk, 0&#x00B7;7, and meat, 0&#x00B7;16. These are calory contents. There are other elements in


our diet, but these figures provide a good guide, especially in relation to the backward countries.<br/>
In Basutoland, 41 per cent. of the people&#x2014;or nearly half&#x2014;have goitre. This could be cured by something which is well known to medical science&#x2014;iodised salt. If it could be given in the diet the lives of these people would be utterly transformed, in terms of health and intellectual activities, and their whole way of life. Malnutrition affects everything&#x2014;education, production, and the whole range of human activities.<br/>
We cannot tackle the overall problem by providing cows' milk. If we could supply the whole of Africa with cows' milk it would cure many of that continent's problems, including ultimately even its aggressive diplomatic problems. What we can do is to use vegetable oils from peanuts or soya beans, which, if not as good as milk, show very good results, which the Africans can prepare for themselves.<br/>
Sometimes problems arise because of a nation's concern with cultural and religious matters. India is a good example. She has the greatest number of cattle in the world&#x2014;190 million. There is one cow for every two Indians. But because slaughter is forbidden by their religion, these cattle are used in the worst possible way&#x2014;to provide energy, by pulling carts and drawing water. Their droppings are used to provide fuel or for plastering the interiors of houses and floors, Even in respect of the one important use to which Indian cattle are put, namely, the yielding of milk, production is very poor because of the lack of crossbreeding. An Indian cow produces 40 gallons as compared with a Dutch cow's 790 gallons.<br/>
Indians are so averse to the taking of life that even in the recent campaign of the Indian Government to kill rats, which were spreading disease, it frequently happened that villagers would capture the rats in their village, put them into sacks, and then, because their religion forbade them kill the rats, steal furtively along to the next village, taking the rats with them and deposit them on their neighbours. These cultural and religious problems can be overcome only by massive programmes of re-education.<br/>
We have several aims before us, as outlined in my right hon. Friend's opening

speech. Our short-term aim is the temporary relief of under-nourishment. Even that will enable some people to live who might otherwise die. But our longer-term aims are more important&#x2014;the elimination of hunger and the spread throughout the world of the food surpluses which exist in some countries.<br/>
How can we achieve these aims? How can we eliminate hunger? We can do so by scientific methods&#x2014;improved farming techniques, cross-breeding, the use of better animal and vegetable strains, soil analysis, treatment with natural and artificial manures, irrigation and drainage. All these things lie in the realm of applied science. There are also antibiotics, and the use of insecticides against pests. Our horizons become wider every day&#x2014;wider than they have ever been before. Revolutionary and hopeful discoveries connected with food production are being made every day. But the important thing about applied science is that it should be applied, and our efforts should be directed to making sure that its benefits are known and applied throughout the world.<br/>
But it is not only the benefits of science which should be spread; we also need to spread the benefits of education, by the teaching and guidance of backward rural communities. The Republic of Ghana has carried out something that it calls "mass education assistance". It recruits many dedicated young men in their early twenties who have had a primary education&#x2014;not men with Ph.D.s or advanced scientific and technical knowledge; those people cannot be spared&#x2014;but men with a sense of mission&#x2014;who do nine months' training in rural studies, and are then sent to villages where organised meetings and discussions are held. They get the farmers and workers together and train them. In a way, they provide a liaison between farmers and peasants and the specialist Government departments to whom they apply for help in engineering and scientific agricultural methods. Here the matching of mass information techniques to the knowledge of science and agriculture is having a very useful effect.<br/>
There is one other point, which is really an example of what can be done, given the will. Suggestions have been made that an inland sea could be created in the Sahara. That may sound fantastic, and it is true that to create such an


inland sea would require the moving of five times as much earth as de Lesseps moved when he built the Suez Canal. But he did not have the benefit of the thermo-nuclear explosion. He had only shovels at his disposal. If our nuclear knowledge could be applied to this positive purpose instead of to the silly explosions which General de Gaulle carried out in pursuit of empty national prestige in the Sahara, it would be much more useful to the population of the Middle East.<br/>
If we did this in the Sahara oceangoing vessels could sail right into the middle of the present desert, bringing world trade to the area. We could establish a fishing industry which would provide some of the vitamins, particularly Vitamin A, which I mentioned earlier, and others, to this part of the world which is desperately starved of them, and, of course, increase the fertility of the surrounding area. I suggest that a project of this kind could do far more to stabilise the Middle East diplomatically and militarily than any of the purely defensive or military arrangements which we might make.<br/>
I hope I have said enough to convince hon. Members that, although the problem is a complex one, nevertheless we have at our finger tips as no generation before has had a tremendous array of knowledge and expertise. If we can marry that knowledge, as I believe we can, to good will and energy, then I am sure the proposals which my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South outlined will be nearer fruition.</p>

<p>I hope it may be for the convenience of the House if I intervene now. I am certainly very grateful to the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Mr. P. Noel-Baker) for drawing the attention to the plight of the hungry and ill-nourished peoples of the world. I do not dispute the fact that an awful lot of people in the world are badly fed and in bad conditions at the present time.<br/>
I hope during the course of my speech to demonstrate that the Government are doing their fair share&#x2014;indeed, are taking a leading part&#x2014;in meeting this challenge and in fighting the hunger which exists

throughout a large part of the world. Of course, we always want to do more, but we are bound by the limitations of our resources. Even so, I am convinced that we are doing the most we can in the present circumstances.<br/>
The Freedom From Hunger Campaign, which has been going on for two and a half years in this country, is a voluntary campaign, and its national committee is under the chairmanship of my noble Friend Earl De La Warr. I congratulate that committee on the tremendous work it is doing in bringing to the attention of our fellow countrymen this work and the need for it. There are now over fifty countries with national committees of this kind, and our country was one of the first in the field. We have reached the halfway stage.<br/>
One of the most important matters with which the national committee has dealt to date, and which was mentioned by the right hon. Member for Derby, South, is that of making the people of this country aware of the need of people in other parts of the world for food. To this end the funds collected are being used to increase the production of food in the developing countries and to raise the purchasing power of the large rural population in these countries.<br/>
One of the first tasks of the national committee was to seek out worth-while projects in the developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. So far about 300 projects have been sent in, each with the approval of the developing country concerned. The projects are scrutinised by an expert committee, which is part of the national committee, and 127 of them have been approved up to date costing around &#x00A3;4 million. The list is growing all the time, both in the number of projects sent in and the number approved. But, of course, the main object, as has been mentioned already in the debate, is to make it possible for the people of the developing countries to help themselves. This is why our national committee has decided that a high proportion of the schemes which it is sponsoring should be concerned with agricultural and other forms of training.<br/>
A number of other schemes, such as those for rural water supplies and cooperative societies, or for research into


pests and diseases, are aimed at strengthening the developing country's economy rather than directly at food production. I think that they will have a lasting impact on those countries after the actual campaign finishes its course when the five-year period is up.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Derby, South mentioned one project in Swaziland where an agricultural college and a short course centre are being financed by this country, partly by the Luton and Leek branch committees of the national committee, costing upwards of &#x00A3;250,000. There are some larger schemes and some much smaller schemes going down to &#x00A3;1,000 or less. The important thing is the way in which the public have been made aware through television, Press and radio of the need for this work and of the work which the campaign committee is doing. Indeed, I believe that there are some 132 hon. Members of this House, of which I am one, who have made a contribution of one hour of their pay. I sincerely hope and believe, and I am sure that the right hon. Member for Derby, South does too, that this will continue.<br/>
I want to assure the House that the Government are doing their full share in meeting this challenge. We have contributed &#x00A3;55,000 to the campaign funds. As the right hon. Member for Derby, South said, &#x00A3;30,000 of this was given to the national committee at the outset of the campaign to help it set up its administrative machine. At the same time, &#x00A3;20,000 was given to F.A.O. headquarters in Rome towards its administrative costs in organising this world-wide campaign. That was a direct contribution for this specific purpose. The further &#x00A3;5,000 which was given this year, and which is the subject of this Supplementary Estimate, was an additional donation in response to an urgent appeal from the United Kingdom national committee to help it with a specific difficulty. Inevitably, the costs of the campaign were heavy at the outset and the committee found that the original &#x00A3;30,000 was not quite sufficient to see it through its initial operations; but I understand that in the future sufficient funds will be available from other sources.<br/>
This is essentially a voluntary effort. Indeed, we have only to cast our minds back to the enormous amount of money raised through the World Refugee Fund,

which was a purely voluntary organisation, to realise what sources can be tapped in this field. We have been extremely glad to give this extra interim help, and I understand that the Committee has now made permanent arrangements for meeting its administrative costs.</p>

<p>I understand that the Government have given &#x00A3;35,000 to our Freedom From Hunger Campaign and &#x00A3;20,000 to F.A.O. to help it to start its organisation because there was no money in the kitty when it was begun.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-03-20a.432.1" hansard_membership_id="11871" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20449" speakername="Mr. Scott-Hopkins" colnum="432" time="">
<p>I think the point is that the &#x00A3;55,000 has all gone to the Freedom From Hunger Campaign whether it has gone in this country or to Rome, or wherever else. As long as it is devoted to this purpose, I think I am justified in saying that it is being given to the campaign.<br/>
The contribution of &#x00A3;20,000 to F.A.O. headquarters was for 1960&#x2013;61, when there was no provision in F.A.O.'s regular budget for the headquarters costs of the campaign. I should like to make it clear that for the two years 1962 and 1963 we are giving something above 10 per cent. of the 800,000 dollars provided for these costs in the F.A.O. regular budget&#x2014;10 per cent., or about 80,000 dollars, for this specific purpose.<br/>
But, as has been mentioned, F.A.O. is only one of the specialised agencies of the United Nations. Not only is it important in its own right&#x2014;with its declared objective of increasing food production, improving nutritional standards and raising the living standards of the rural population of less-developed countries&#x2014;but it does a tremendous amount of work as executing agency for the United Nations Special Fund and the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance.<br/>
The many forms of aid which this country provides are directed towards the achievement of self-sustaining economic growth in the less developed countries. We are usually the largest contributor, after the United States, to the aid programmes of the United Nations and to the financing of its specialised agencies. In 1963 we shall be paying out about &#x00A3;485,000 as our contribution to the running of F.A.O.; nearly &#x00A3;2&#x00BC; million to the United Nations Special


Fund and over &#x00A3;1&#x00BC; million to the expanded programme of technical assistance.<br/>
I think the House will agree that in this sphere alone that is a considerable amount of money to be expended for these purposes. The most important of these programmes are the expanded programme of technical assistance and the Special Fund. They are designed to fulfil the same purpose, to alleviate hunger and want in the developing countries and to bring their economies nearer to the standards enjoyed in the highly sophisticated countries of the West. Our contribution to this Fund has been increased this year by 25 per cent. I hope that other countries will follow the lead that we have given. The Special Fund finances much larger projects than those about which we have been talking. An example is the Near East Animal Health Institute, which has units in the Sudan, Lebanon, and various other places in the Middle East. The project will last for five years and involve a total expenditure of about 5 million dollars.<br/>
We give about &#x00A3;3 million a year to the various United Nations relief organisations, including our contribution to the world food programme. In addition, we make a contribution to national disaster funds. Last year, for example, we gave &#x00A3;20,000 in respect of the earthquake in Iran; &#x00A3;15,000 after the Pakistan floods; &#x00A3;10,000 in respect of the Hong Kong typhoon and &#x00A3;10,000 for insecticides following the locust disaster in Iran.<br/>
The World Food Programme has been set up jointly by the United Nations and F.A.O. as an experiment in giving food aid multilaterally. It is to run for three years, and it aims to provide food aid to a total value of approximately 100 million dollars. Contributions to the programme are voluntary and may be pledged by countries in the form of appropriate commodities, acceptable services, or cash. Our contribution of 5 million dollars was half in services and half in foodstuffs.</p>

<p>Five million dollars is 5 per cent. of the 100 million dollars to be raised for the World Food Fund. We are one of the advanced countries which are to help the developing countries. That amount of 5 per cent. is far below our normal quota of the

U.N. budget. The hon. Gentleman is now repeating what the Government always say&#x2014;that we are second, that we are very generous. We are the second richest country in the world and we make a contribution for our own people and for the 43 million people in other parts of the world whom we still rule. What the hon. Gentleman is now saying has convinced me of something which I hesitated to say in my original speech, namely, that the alibi of the Government for doing nothing more in support of our Freedom From Hunger Campaign is that British private generosity is making a contribution.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-03-20a.434.0" hansard_membership_id="11871" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20449" speakername="Mr. Scott-Hopkins" colnum="434" time="">
<p>That is a most unjust charge. The right hon. Gentleman knows full well that our contribution to the developing countries is very great in proportion to our wealth and resources. The contributions which I have listed are not the only ones. There are other forms of contribution by this country, and I think that in the circumstances 5 million dollars, given half in the form of services and half in foodstuffs, is generous at this stage.<br/>
Of course, we all want to give as much as we can to see that hunger and starvation is conquered throughout the world. But it is a continuing problem, and we must keep an eye on our resources and our ability to contribute. The main point is that there are many other spheres in which the Government spend a great deal of money in helping people in the developing countries and I will refer to them briefly.<br/>
Probably the greatest contribution which we make to this problem is in the form of helping those countries which lack the resources to solve their problems themselves. With other countries of the highly sophisticated West we give aid in the form of grants, loans, technical assistance and aid in kind, and by facilitating trade with the less developed countries. We are one of the most generous contributors in these efforts, and an important aspect of our aid programme is the provision of facilities for education and training, on which we spend over &#x00A3;30 million annually.<br/>
We provide assistance to developing countries, with the full co-operation of their Governments, aimed at educating their men and women and developing


their natural resources, raising their standards of living and building up their institutions and services. This programme includes bringing people to this country from overseas for education and training, and supplying qualified and experienced men and women to teach, help and work overseas.<br/>
The Department of Technical Cooperation was established in July, 1961, to co-ordinate, promote and carry out arrangements for furnishing aid to overseas countries with which we have technical assistance arrangements. Loans at low rates of interest with long terms for repayment, and grants, play an extremely important r&#x00F4;le in raising the standard of living of the less fortunate countries. There are, of course, other ways in addition to cash contributions by which we can help.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman propose to say anything about the programme for the Development Decade?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-03-20a.435.1" hansard_membership_id="11871" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20449" speakername="Mr. Scott-Hopkins" colnum="435" time="">
<p>In fact I am referring to the Development Decade all the time. The Freedom From Hunger Campaign is part of it. The 100 million dollar fund is part of it, and our aid to overseas developing countries is part. Surely the right hon. and learned Gentleman is aware that I have been talking about that the whole time, as he did during his interesting intervention.<br/>
The total economic and technical assistance to less developed countries from this country and from Government funds was approximately doubled between 1957&#x2013;58 and 1961&#x2013;62 from &#x00A3;81 million to &#x00A3;161 million. In addition, there is a substantial flow of private funds from this country to the less developed countries. While grants and loans can help, the real need of the developing countries is for increased opportunities for their exports, as was mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman and others. To this end we have been playing an active part in the work of a special committee set up under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to consider measures for the maintenance and expansion of the export earnings of the less developed countries. We have a good record in providing the less

developed countries with increased opportunities for trade. This comes into the same category.<br/>
In particular, we have supported the efforts made in international fora to secure the elimination of quantitative restrictions affecting the exports of less developed countries. We have played a full part in international commodity agreements designed to avoid excessive price fluctuations, and in this sphere we have been working with other countries and taken a full part in the agreements on sugar, tin, coffee and cocoa. It is the aim of the Government to work towards world commodity price agreements and the stabilisation of raw materials upon which the developing countries depend for their trade. As the House will realise, this takes time and it is not an easy objective to achieve.<br/>
Where there are surpluses in the West, and in the industrial countries, there is the problem of getting these surpluses to the developing countries. It is here that the difficulties arise. The United States has had a great deal of experience in administering aid of this kind and has learned about the difficulties and limitations. With permission, I should like to quote what Mr. Orville Freeman, the United States Secretary for Agriculture, said to the Ministers of Agriculture of O.E.C.D. countries last November:
<q>We have learned much of the difficulties and the complexities, the hazards and the costs, the very real limitations of such programmes. Precautions must be taken to prevent a disruption of normal commerce or a deterrent effect on local agricultural development. Costs of effective distribution can be higher than the cost of food itself. Many countries lack both the physical facilities and the administrative experience to receive, handle, and distribute food aid.</q>
This illustrates some of the difficulties which face us in trying to cope with this problem.<br/>
I do not want to finish my speech with the figures and quotations I have given the House. I think the most important element of all is the human element, what we can ourselves do and what we are doing on the human side to solve this problem of helping our brothers overseas in developing countries. In past generations we built up our place in history as a country by our young people going overseas, making their fortunes, and meeting the challenge of the times, which


in those days was very great. We face the same sort of challenge today. Our young people have the same sense of adventure. They will benefit from it, and we as a country will benefit.<br/>
Our young people, as trained personnel and graduates, are going overseas now in hundreds and in thousands. We are helping to train public servants, supplying and training teachers, supplying doctors and nurses. We are supplying technicians of various kinds and engineers, who are going to these developing countries to help them to go ahead. Altogether there are more than 60,000 students from overseas, mostly from the developing countries, at our universities and technical colleges studying our skills and we are passing on our knowledge to them. In addition, we are giving support to 15,000 men and women serving the Governments of dependent and independent countries of the Commonwealth. Voluntary Service Overseas is sending school-leavers and graduates abroad in increasing numbers year by year.<br/>
Apart from the contributions the Government are making to help the developing countries which I have outlined very briefly, we are helping in the technical field. It is up to our young people to meet the challenges with which those developing countries face us, to go out as our forefathers did in years gone by, not to conquer those countries, but to bring them up to the same standard of living, of prosperity and sophistication which we enjoy in this country.</p>

<p>Is it not the case that there are far more applicants among young men and women for these opportunities than there are opportunities for young men and women? Is there not room for even greater contributions by the Government to agencies such as International Voluntary Service to increase the availability of these openings for young people?</p>

<p>This voluntary service is increasing year by year, I am glad to say, but I hope there will not ever be a situation in which we shall lack volunteers for it. We want the highest quality people to go out to help these countries. I am confident that they will not be lacking, as indeed they are not now. The hon. and learned Member made a good point there.<br/>
The Government make a contribution, not only in this field, but over the whole field of financial aid and technical assistance. In voluntary assistance, also, we in this country should play our part in the battle against hunger, famine and malnutrition.</p>

<p>It is a good thing that the House has this opportunity of discussing world hunger in the middle of Freedom From Hunger Week. One hopes that this debate, so far as it receives attention in the country, will call attention to the fact that "This is the week this is". I hope that at least a proportion of the millions who see the television programme on Saturday nights&#x2014;among whom I count myself as an enthusiastic viewer&#x2014;will regard this week as one of unusual importance because of the campaign taking place as part of an intensification of the longer-term campaign against world hunger. I hope that, as the Minister has said, now 130 hon. Members have joined in the scheme by giving up an hour of pay, that will set an example to others, not only outside but inside this House.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will not take it amiss when I say that I thought his speech was somewhat complacent. It was a recital, which we have heard before in this House, of rather minimal figures in face of a problem of immense importance. I had certainly heard much of his speech before, not from him but from the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who was speaking for the Government in the debate at Geneva on the Development Decade. I then felt, as I am sure delegates from developing countries felt, that a recital of these figures, which are quite inadequate in face of the size of the problem, is not the best way to arouse enthusiasm among the population of this country nor to arouse in the developing countries a sense that the industrialised countries are doing all that they should.<br/>
When I heard the Minister mention figures of &#x00A3;30,000, &#x00A3;20,000, &#x00A3;5,000 and even &#x00A3;3 million, or 5 million dollars, in relation to other projects, I considered that if he added them all together the total would not be very impressive compared either with national incomes or


with the size of the problem we are discussing or&#x2014;and this was the contrast in my mind when he was speaking&#x2014;with the Service Estimates which we were debating last week and on Monday this week. Those are the contrasts which a speech of such complacency brought out.<br/>
The hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall), in a very welcome speech, almost apologised for one of his suggestions as being "insane". The idea of what I think he called "conscription for peace" was unorthodox only because of the insane standards which orthodoxy applies in these matters. I often think that arithmetic becomes a different technique when we are talking about armaments from when we are talking about economic matters and particularly the welfare of the people of developing countries.<br/>
This Freedom From Hunger Campaign is a massive exercise in aid all over the world. It deserves the utmost support from all Governments and all peoples. I wish that the Government had shown rather more enthusiasm in welcoming this week. I shall give one example. My right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mr. P. Noel-Baker) mentioned it, although I think he got his facts a little out of date. That is the question of the stamp which is to be issued.</p>

I want to point out the limitations of aid from Western countries in tackling world poverty. I am all for that aid&#x2014;I hope that I have indicated that I think that should be very much greater&#x2014;but however generous may be the grants in aid from developing countries, the generosity can be the opposite if seen in a context of a decline in the prices of the foodstuffs and raw materials that the developing countries seek to sell on the world market.<br/>
I have accused the Minister of making a complacent speech. An that he described in terms of the aid that has come from the West has been wiped out by the decline in prices of the commodities which the developing countries seek to sell The balance of advantage has, therefore, been with the West, not with the developing countries. That gap has been widening rather than narrowing, and the aid we have given has only stopped the gap from widening a little more.<br/>
That is why I say that the Government's attitude in these matters is complacent. Time after time they trot out this familiar list of the things they do, but what they do is really nothing in terms of the real problem, which is that because we in the West are getting advantages on the world commodity markets the people in the developing countries are getting less. Over the last decade, the terms of trade have gone entirely in our favour, and entirely against the interests of the developing countries.<br/>
That is why, though aid is important, trade is so much more important. That is why the commodity schemes to which the Minister referred are of great urgency. He has claimed that the Government have done something about coffee, tin and sugar&#x2014;yes, there are these schemes, but I suggest that here again this problem of declining commodity prices has not been tackled with


nearly the sense of urgency with which it should be tackled. The Minister says that these things take time. That is true, but there is a danger of using talk about commodity schemes as an excuse to do nothing about them.<br/>
I remember that the big idea emerging from the Ottawa Commonwealth Conference in, I think, 1958, was commodity schemes. I remember that when we were negotiating for British entry into Europe, and there was a Commonwealth problem, it was said, "Ah, but commodity schemes will take care of that problem." When it was found that we could not get into Europe and had to think of an alternative, the Prime Minister said, "Oh, we will get commodity schemes." So whether we are in Europe or out of it, or whatever the time may be, there is much talk about these things and all too little action.<br/>
I should like the Government to think not only in terms of these internationally-arranged commodity prices&#x2014;which I consider to be the most effective long-term safeguards for the welfare of the people in the developing countries&#x2014;but also in terms of schemes which this country can undertake entirely on its own. I mention the commodity plan put forward by Mr. St. Clare Grondona, a most eminent economist, who has developed a most important scheme which this country could adopt on its own. I have heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer refer to that scheme as being most interesting and helpful&#x2014;here again, sympathetic noises, but never any action.<br/>
I therefore urge that the Government, in approaching this question&#x2014;the most important question of our generation&#x2014;should think in terms, not only of aid but of fair trade for the developing countries; above all, not only in terms of complacent talk, but in terms of getting on with something as soon as we can.</p>

<p>I confess that at the beginning of this debate I had not intended to speak, but as so many of the speeches are so near my heart I feel impelled to do so. I have told the House before of my interests in tropical agriculture in different parts of the world, and for that reason this debate particularly

appeals to me, because we find that so much of the poverty of the world exists in the tropical agricultural areas. My family was one of pioneers of the rubber planting industry in Malaya, and I have been interested in the tea, coconut, palm oil and copra industries.<br/>
Those who have followed the development of Malaya over the last fifty years will realise what a wonderful job the Colonial Office and the private sector of development have done there. We have now passed to the people there a rich, fine country, and they have carried on with their freedom and made a greater success of it than probably any other of the emergent territories. I am particularly pleased to follow the hon. Member for East Ham, South (Mr. Oram) because I had the opportunity of travelling with him in the wilds of Borneo about four years ago, and I can see that he has remembered many of the lessons he then learned. Unfortunately, our travels were cut short. The General Election of 1959 was suddenly announced, and we both had to fly home hurriedly to secure our re-election.<br/>
This debate has very largely revolved around what the Government are doing, and the Parliamentary Secretary has shown that the Government have for many years done a great deal of useful work in the development of these Commonwealth countries and to help the underfed and the hungry. I also appreciate the speech of the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Mr. P. Noel-Baker). Some of us who have known him for at least 45 years know the tremendous work he has done during that time on this and similar lines, and I was delighted to hear him.<br/>
I want to emphasise more particularly what has been done, and what can be done, in the private sector. The development of tropical estates producing rubber, tea, copra, and other things, has done a tremendous amount to help the local population. We have made profit out of it at times, and, at other times, incurred great loss&#x2014;I agree with the hon. Member for East Ham, South there, but I shall deal with prices later. In prewar days, most well-run estates had a relatively far higher standard of living than existed in this country. I do not speak in terms of absolute income, but the idea of the Welfare State was far better developed on many properties in


Malaya, India and Ceylon in the 'twenties and 'thirties than in this country. All well-run estates at that time had their own schools, hospitals, cr&#x00E8;ches, maternity benefits and so on&#x2014;things which were quite unknown then in this country. An immense amount of British capital has been spent on these developments for the mutual benefit of all concerned.<br/>
When I say that it probably costs &#x00A3;150 an acre to plant a rubber estate and about &#x00A3;300 an acre to plant a tea estate, the tremendous amount of wealth in these countries will be appreciated. That money is largely spent on labour. The people receive the benefit of good wages and good conditions, but perhaps the greatest benefit they receive is the example set of how to run agriculture efficiently. Before the development of these estates the budding of rubber trees on clonel seed was quite unknown. Now that these great European estates have been developed, the benefit has been passed on to local farmers in different countries. This has been a wonderful source of education and of wealth to these people.<br/>
One cannot discuss this subject without mentioning also the excellent work of the Colonial Development Corporation which was started after the war. In its early days the Corporation made many mistakes, just as any similar corporation would make mistakes. It had to experiment by trial and error. It found what it could do successfully and it had many failures as well as great successes. My one and only criticism of that Corporation, in view of the excellent work that it did, was that it did not differentiate between commercial work to make money and benevolent work to improve the country and the conditions of the people. When one tries to mix the two, one usually does not make a great success of either. Both are necessary, but it is best to keep them apart and to have different peoples and organisations developing them.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should intervene for a moment to remind the House that we are discussing a Supplementary Estimate and the debate should be concentrated on the Freedom From Hunger Campaign. I do not know that the Colonial Development Corporation comes into that directly, although an incidental reference to it is fair enough.</p>

<p>I hope that my reference has been quite sufficient to prove my point.<br/>
The hon. Member for East Ham, South referred to the difficulty about prices. Many of these tropical countries have developed two or three commodities, such as rubber, tin and cocoa, from which they have specially benefited and which they can produce very efficiently. This has meant that the whole of the economy of these countries has relied on two or three very speculative commodities in which there have been violent fluctuations of prices. It is quite wrong to expect the economy of a whole nation to rest entirely on two or three speculative kinds of produce, and for that reason most of these countries have tried to develop small local industries.<br/>
In many cases we have provided a large amount of capital for this purpose, although we know that in world markets these schemes are quite uneconomic and could never produce efficiently. For this reason, it would be of great financial benefit to us and to these countries if a scheme of stabilisation of prices were developed. It would mean much greater efficiency for both the producer and the user. I do not think that such a scheme is impossible. It has been tried, successfully in some cases. It has failed in others, but it is important that we should go much further with this idea than we have gone up to the present.<br/>
A great deal of the money which has gone overseas has been used very wastefully. We have helped many of these small emerging countries in the past and we can help them in the future, but in many cases they are not making it easy for us to help them now. It is essential when using modern machinery and techniques to have a certain limited amount of European supervision. This we now find increasingly difficult to maintain. It would be to the greater interest of these countries and of ourselves if they


recognised this fact and allowed more of our enterprising young men to go out and help develop the countries as young men have done in the past.<br/>
When these developments are successful there is in every case a substantial revenue from Income Tax and, in many instances, from export duty, and the countries concerned benefit greatly. Revenue is raised from taxation for the development of education and of agriculture and for the large-scale employment of labour.<br/>
These are the lines along which we can help the world, and the Commonwealth in particular, far more than by the collection of small funds for a World Hunger Week or anything of that kind, This is a great world problem. Although having a week to help the hungry draws attention to the need to do something to help these people, it does not begin to solve the real problem.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the very powerful speech with which my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mr. P. Noel-Baker) opened the debate, he spoke about the limitations of the human imagination in being able to comprehend what world hunger means. He drew attention to these limitations in speaking in terms of thousands of millions of people or in terms of calories and of the difficulty of finding a yardstick by which to measure the scope of this subject.<br/>
I have referred before in the House, and make no apology for referring again, to the yardstick which I find useful in measuring this problem in real terms. I have a daughter of whom I am very proud. She is now 11&#x00BD; years old. I calculate that since she was born about 1,000 million other children have been born, and I am sure that, generally, their parents were or are as fond of them as my wife and I are fond of our daughter. About 150 million of these children are already dead. Most of them have died unnecessarily because of hunger or disease associated with inadequate diets.<br/>
Of the rest, between one-half and two-thirds face a life in which they are constantly threatened with that kind of disease; a life in which they will never have an adequate diet and an existence in which their average expectation of life

may be about thirty-five years. It is against that background that we are discussing this Estimate and the purpose which it is meant to fulfil.<br/>
The Freedom From Hunger Campaign is a wonderful thing, and we should all support it in every way that we can. I believe that we can be encouraged by the fact that throughout the country hundreds of local committees have been established and thousands of people are not merely giving money, but are working to support the campaign. Politicians in general, and Conservative politicians, in particular, have been inclined to underestimate the latent idealism of the British people in matters of this kind. There is an idealism which has been tapped by this campaign, and it is a movement which can grow.<br/>
Television may have had quite an impact here. One of the incidental benefits of television is that it has brought the outside world into people's drawing roms. When people see hungry children, with swollen bellies, they realise what hunger means. When they saw the conditions which existed in the Congo in the early stages of the crisis, people were anxious and willing to give money. When people saw the effects of the earthquake in Iran last year, they crowded outside the Red Cross headquarters in London to see what they could give and what they could do to help in the disaster.<br/>
People are responding to the Freedom From Hunger Campaign, which is the main subject of our debate. But I state very strongly&#x2014;and here I agree with the hon. Member for Middleton and Prestwich (Sir J. Barlow)&#x2014;that a campaign of this kind will be only of limited benefit unless it is a catalyst for something much bigger. The whole purpose of the Freedom From Hunger Campaign Committee is to capture the imagination of people so that the country can embark on permanent schemes which will have a long-term impact on the problem. Otherwise, the projects which are being sponsored by various groups throughout the country, useful as they will be, will only be scratching the surface of the enormous human problem with which we are concerned.<br/>
This long-term action has got to be by Government and by voluntary action, and it has got to be undertaken in this country and in all the other richer countries.


I reject completely the Joint Parliamentary Secretary's view that what we are doing is satisfactory in relation to our resources. What we are doing at the moment does not measure up to the requirements. In fact, our Government and the Governments of the other richer countries in the West, and in the Communist world as well, have a duty to stop thinking in terms of what they imagine they can afford and to start thinking in terms of what the situation demands.<br/>
We are discussing this problem against the background of the United Nations Development Decade, which has been referred to by many other speakers. During the 1950s the average national income of the underdeveloped countries went up 3 per cent. a year. The population went up by an average of 2 per cent. a year. Income per head on average went up by 1 per cent. a year. That is an average in which we are generalising about something like 2,000 million people. In many cases their living standards went down and have been doing so for a long time.<br/>
The objective of the Decade is that by 1970 we should have an average rise in the national incomes of these countries of 5 per cent. a year&#x2014;by no means an impossible objective. It is something that we can achieve and it is an objective for which the British Government and every other Government voted at the United Nations. But none of the Governments concerned has measured up to the real challenge that has been presented since they recorded that vote.<br/>
Let me take one of the figures to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, relating to the contribution which we are making to the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance and the Special Fund. He said that we had increased that contribution by 25 per cent. in the current year. But when we voted for the Development Decade resolution we went on to vote, in the same session of the General Assembly, for a consequential resolution which called on us and all the countries concerned to increase our contributions to the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance and the Special Fund by 50 per cent. in 1962 and by further amounts in 1963 and the succeeding years.<br/>
In fact, we were content in 1962 to keep our contribution to the same figure as

it had been for some years previously, and then only to increase it by 25 per cent. this year. We are not the only defaulters. I am not suggesting that we have a worse record than other countries. The countries in the richer parts of the world have in general failed to meet the challenge, and they have to meet it in a much bigger way.<br/>
There are overwhelming arguments in support of that contention, of which the most important is the moral argument&#x2014;the simple fact that it is unfair and wrong for this great gap to exist between the standard of living of one-third of the human race, on the one hand, and two-thirds, on the other, a gap which is growing and is intolerable to anyone who applies his conscience to this matter.<br/>
But there is also the argument of enlightened self-interest. We are a trading nation, and our future trade depends on prosperity in the rest of the world. The International Labour Organisation has a motto, "Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere". That again is part of the framework of the subject that we are discussing.<br/>
The other part of our enlightened self-interest is in terms of the international situation. Not only is the gap growing between the standard of living of some countries and others, but people in the poorer countries are becoming more aware of this and more discontented about it. The political situations which result from it are becoming more turbulent and will create more trouble. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rowley Regis and Tipton (Mr. A. Henderson) referred to Abraham Lincoln's remark that the United States, one hundred years ago, could not survive half-slave and half-free. That is right. The world today, in terms of communication, is a smaller place than the United States was one hundred years ago, and the threat that this represents to our security is thereby all the greater.<br/>
There is one other aspect of the problem to which I should like to make a brief reference. That is the question of the disposal of food surpluses. I am glad that one of the steps the Government have taken has been to make a contribution to the world food programme of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. We have been told that we were making this contribution to the value of 5 million


dollars to be spread over three years. It is about a year ago that I raised this question in an Adjournment debate. At that time the Government said that they would do nothing. Since then they have reversed the decision, and this is very welcome. But this is a very poor contribution.<br/>
Consider what other countries are doing. Canada, with a much smaller population than ours, is contributing as much as we are. West Germany is to provide 8 million dollars against our 5 million dollars, and the United States is to provide 50 million dollars worth of aid to this programme. That is a genuine contribution to the Freedom From Hunger Campaign. There should be more Government studies of this problem and of the use of food surpluses. Even in this country, which is a food-importing country, we are becoming embarrassed by surpluses of some commodities. The Price Review reflected that fact in relation to milk production and other commodities.<br/>
We are getting into a period of a growing paradox, when certain richer countries are embarrassed by food surpluses while the rest of the world lacks food. As the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said, this problem cannot be solved simply by dumping food surpluses in the hungry countries. He referred to Mr. Orville Freeman's remarks in this connection. If we were to distribute food surpluses round the world, they would not make much of an impact in solving the problem of hunger.<br/>
A lot of thought has been given to this problem in the F.A.O., particularly by Mr. Sen, who has defined the way in which food surpluses can be used constructively. He has pointed out that capital development is held up by the inflationary position arising from extra wages paid to the workers on capital projects. Suppose large numbers of workers are engaged in building a dam or some other large capital project. They want to spend their wages on extra food and other consumer goods. This creates a pressure on local markets. It may create an inflationary situation. It may even create a strain on the balance of payments situation of the country concerned.<br/>
It is in that sort of situation that the gift of food surpluses can have a real

impact and be of real help in the development of that country. There is no doubt that the recent five-year plans in India have been helped by the gifts of food surpluses from the United States under their PL480 programme. This is an idea which can be developed constructively so that the food goes in to coincide with the capital development. It is not helpful if the food is simply dumped in such a way that it depresses the price which the local farmers get for producing it and discourages them from taking the steps which are needed. If it is related to the situation which I have mentioned, it can be helpful.<br/>
There are other possibilities. Surplus food can be related to welfare food programmes, such as food for expectant mothers, or for school meal programmes, in these countries. It can be related to the short-term setbacks in food production following land reform. A developing country often has to postpone plans for land reform because it cannot envisage the loss of production involved in the short term even though it may increase production in the long term. It can be related to the creation of food reserves to deal with famines or bad harvests, and things of that sort, and to the creation of stocks of grain to feed animals.<br/>
There are special ways in which food surpluses can be used throughout developing countries on a bigger scale provided that we and other richer countries go in for this in a big way and carry out a lot of study and research on it and make the right contributions. The F.A.O. has given a lead in this programme to which we are making this modest contribution which I hope will be increased in future.<br/>
I have already given one example of the many ways in which our national effort must increase. It must also increase in the form of capital aid in technical matters. I particularly believe that there is a case for a British peace corps on the lines of that in the United States to mobilise volunteers to work in the developing countries. Our efforts to arrive at commodity agreements to provide stable markets for these countries must increase.<br/>
The Freedom From Hunger Campaign will be a wonderful thing provided that it sparks off more long-term programmes. The danger is that many people in the country will make this one-and-for-all


gesture and will regard this as a temporary piece of charity. They may have a bread and cheese lunch and give the proceds to the fund or they may give one hour's pay, as many of us have done. That is all very well in its limited way. But this campaign will be of permanent value only if it sparks off long-term plans and brings about change in the attitude of this country and of other richer countries towards the poorer countries of the world. Nothing else will measure up to the challenge of the times in which we live.</p>

<p>I listened to the hon. Member for East Ham. North (Mr. Prentice) with great interest, but I regret that in his opening remarks he implied that there was a lack of interest and sincerity on the Conservative benches in this matter. May I remind him that World Refugee Year was inspired by a young Conservative Member of Parliament, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not denigrate the work done in that respect. There no party political bias in this matter. The appeal is universal. Certainly it is national, and, therefore, to bring party politics into it would be a profound mistake.</p>

<p>That is a slight variation of what I said, but the taunt is the same.<br/>
I do not think that if this appeal is couched properly and is properly planned it will merely be a matter of our giving one day's pay and a tea party and we shall be finished with it for ever. It would be wrong if that were to happen. That would be a hypocritical act and would be an attempt to buy off our consciences so that, having seen a distressing photograph of a little child, we might be able to say that we had done something.<br/>
When I was a small boy I gave my pennies towards the missionary funds on Sundays. Small children all over the country regularly gave subscriptions innocently believing that they were doing

a Christian act and making a little sacrifice which to them was important. In my mature years, I find that generally the money was not used nor was it sufficient in quantity for the basic purposes to which it should have been put. I am satisfied that if more money had been applied to the education of children in Africa and other places our problems today arising from the "wind of change" would not be so difficult. Now, in the second half of this century, we are again faced with precisely the same problem.<br/>
I am genuinely worried that in the postwar period money which has been made available to certain Governments has in too many cases never found its way to the people who really needed it. The generous and big-hearted aid of the United States has sometimes been used to support corrupt Governments in the countries to which it went.<br/>
There is a certain arrogance in mentioning it, but it is hard economic common sense that one of the great problems of these countries is that they create too many families. They are building up the problem themselves. We must try to educate these people to have smaller families. Family life is profound and essential, but there comes a point when it adds to the problems and difficulties in some of these countries. We shall have to be extraordinarily careful in this matter. I say without offence to the religion of the people in India that that nation is making a bold and imaginative approach to this problem. This is something to which we in Great Britain should pay attention in all that we try to do to help these people.<br/>
As the hon. Member for East Ham, North, said, the Government's contribution clearly is inadequate. But the whole campaign is inadequate and savours too much of the soup kitchens of the hungry 'eighties in this country. The idea seems to be that we have to keep these people alive because we are worried about them, that they are under our feet and that we have to do something about it. We should not approach these problems in the soup kitchen spirit. We should give these people employment. They and their children do not need soup kitchens. Anything of a temporary and palliative nature will not touch the problem.<br/>
What we must send out to these countries is men as well as money. It seems


to me that many of these countries will never on their own build up a self-reliant economy which will support them. An example of this is India. There are more Englishmen working in India than there were when it was one of the Dominions in our complete and absolute control. The brains of this country have been going oat to help India to build up its economy. In some countries, which are not even as advanced as India, irrigation is more important than food. Food is essential, but it is important that irrigation engineers should go to these countries and properly survey the land and get the Government's co-operation in irrigation schemes.<br/>
Labour is another thing which can be used in these countries to great effect. I saw a film several months ago about Chinese who were working on an irrigation scheme. They were using mass labour in substitution for machinery which was not at their disposal. If we ask people to do something for themselves we are not denigrating them; nor are we reducing their dignity. In fact, we are enhancing it. If they feel that they are helping to build something for themselves we are doing something positive for them and their character.<br/>
The same applies to agriculture. I am advised by experts in agriculture that if the land in these countries were used properly and intelligently it could produce a large volume of food for the people in them. I believe that that is true. Many of our energies should be directed towards that end.<br/>
The same also applies to what I call gradual industrialism. It is not necessary to build vast steel works. We must first teach people in these countries to repair their old agricultural machinery and tractors. The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence), who is an engineer, will understand what I mean. Once a man starts to use the tools of engineering in a fitting shop he can make very good progress. I have often been impressed by the extraordinary intelligence about machinery that the people in these countries have. I do not like to call them natives because that is liable to be misunderstood.</p>

<p>I did not wish to appear to be patronising. What we must try to do is not to give these people charity but to lift them up to independence. This is a long-term task of great importance.<br/>
The Government have been criticised for what they have done, but it seems to me that to have a campaign for one week is not enough. It must be a dedicated and continuing effort, because there is so much in this country today that is done for us that we now have to learn to do something for other people abroad. We have conquered poverty in our nation. There is a lot of money in the hands of a lot of people that is, perhaps, not used as wisely as it might be. When the results of their contributions and efforts are brought back to them visually by television and other means, they can see that the money is used wisely and well, so that we do not need to get back to the time when the small boy put his pennies into the missionary box and never had more than the barest of pictures of what was done with it.<br/>
When Governments do something for other Governments, there is the subtle inference that we are trying to influence them. They feel, "You are doing it because you have to and because it is expedient". But when the people themselves help people in other countries, it is an entirely different matter. The aid is not suspect but is taken at its proper valuation.<br/>
When people of our country help people of other countries they are reaching out the hand of friendship. If there is one thing that the world needs today it is the hand of friendship from one to the other. I hope and believe that as a result of this debate the people will realise that to make a contribution of one sort once only is simply not enough.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Esher (Sir W. Robson Brown) will also realise that it is simply not enough for the Government to be interested in this campaign for one week only. As one of my hon. Friends has said, the big thing about the Freedom From Hunger Campaign is that it has touched something in the British people which many of us had begun to feel had become completely lost.<br/>
When there is so much cynicism abroad and when the world is so full of selfishness it is refreshing to find countless thousands of ordinary people being moved by old-fashioned morality, if I may put it that way&#x2014;feeling, as it were, for their fellow men. The big thing about this campaign is that it strikes the right kind of chord. It brings out the best impulses in people. That is why not only the scheme is worth while, but the Government's contribution is so miserable.<br/>
Over the last few weeks, we have been dealing with Estimates amounting to nearly &#x00A3;2,000 million for the three Services&#x2014;the Army, Air Force and Navy; and they have been passed with very little ado, with few complaints and with hardly anybody saying that we could not afford them. When we compare those figures with the miserable sum of the present Estimate, we are revealing something of our real values.<br/>
The object of the campaign is to try to bring immediate help to people who are dying daily in their thousands from poverty and disease. If any of the nations which are the beneficiaries of this aid were to be attacked or threatened by Communism tomorrow, there would be a readiness to pour millions of pounds into those countries in the shape of tanks, guns and aircraft.<br/>
It should be realised, however, that where somebody dies from disease, it is just as bad as dying from Communism. Life has ended. Life is being ended unnecessarily every minute of every hour of the day for tens of thousands of people, people who could be alive, who could live a natural existence, if only the resources of the developed nations, their scientists, their technicians, their "know-how" and their ability to produce were being poured into those countries as they are being poured into militarism.<br/>
I remember 1926. The hon. Member for Esher has referred to soup kitchens. We had soup kitchens in the mining areas in 1926. Many of us would not have had a breakfast had it not been for the soup kitchens. It was the poor who helped the poor. It was not the rich who helped us.</p>

<p>I remember Arthur Cook, the miners' leader, in 1926, when a

million miners and their wives were literally being starved to death because the wages for which they were asked to work were not sufficient to justify a reduction. The miners did not strike for more pay in 1926. They struck merely to keep that which they had.<br/>
Arthur Cook used a wonderful phrase which I have never forgotten. At a great meeting in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke, Central (Dr. Stross), he said, "You cannot grow the flower of peace in the garden of poverty". What Arthur Cook said in relation to industrial peace in Britain in 1926 applies in the international sphere in 1963.<br/>
We cannot grow the flower of peace in a world which is two-thirds poverty-stricken. This is where the real danger to peace lies, because hungry men occasionally become angry men, and angry men become irresponsible. When they become irresponsible, it is surprising how much we are prepared to devote to disciplining them, which would not have been necessary had we been prepared to act and help generously before their hunger drove them to rebellion.<br/>
One of the things that disturbs me about this kind of situation is that there is nobody in the House of Commons, on either side, who, if he could hear the cries of hunger and see the bodies of the victims day after day, would not say that we must do more. There is a tendency, of which we are only occasionally reminded, to shut these things out of our minds. I do not want us to shut this problem out of our minds, because I want the chance for future generations to inherit our earth.<br/>
I do not believe they will be able to inherit it unless we do something about this problem because I believe that this is a problem which can ultimately engulf and destroy the world. Just as Britain could not this century have gone on with the disparities which there were in this country in the last century between those at the top and those at the bottom, so the world cannot go on in this century with great disparities between the rich and the poor nations, with nothing or very little being done about them.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Middleton and Prestwich (Sir J. Barlow) about the importance of


commodity prices, the prices for the exports of the underdeveloped countries. I quite agree that it is very necessary that we should do something to see that they get a fair return for the raw materials we take from them. It is very important, when we are discussing territories for which we have responsibility or have had responsibility in the past, and when we talk about their trade, that we should also remember that if the prices which they get for the commodities they export go down, then they have that much less money with which to buy goods from us. That is partly the reason why Commonwealth trade has tended to decline. It is not because those countries wanted to take less, but because they have been getting less for their exports and have had their imports reduced by that much, thereby affecting our trade.<br/>
This is a very big issue. I think it is the biggest issue confronting the world. It is certainly the biggest issue confronting the West, and I say that unless we can deal with this problem, and unless we can deal with it reasonably quickly, then all talk about containing Communism becomes utter nonsense. Wherever there is poverty, hunger or disease of the magnitude that these evils exist in some of these territories, men will say, "Any system or philosopsy which will get us quickly out of this, which will relieve us of this disease and poverty, we will subscribe to, and any such system we will embrace".<br/>
That is why I hope that the Government next year, when they are deciding how to apportion their resources, will decide to do a little more in this direction, and a little less in that other direction which I mentioned, because I am quite sure that in this direction they will be able to do more to defend those things for which they are supposed to stand than by devoting &#x00A3;2,000 million to defence, which, in the days of nuclear weapons, no longer exists.</p>

<p>This discussion has been conducted in the wide terms of food, and I had hoped that some little part of it might have been in the rather tighter context of protein. In hungry areas such as the Nile Valley and Northern Nigeria no one has complained of the shortage of carbohydrates. The

problem is the shortage of proteins. This is not my personal view only but the view of Professor Richie Calder with whom I shared a platform ten days ago and who has made a life study of this problem.<br/>
Because other hon. Members want to speak on other subjects today I shall confine myself to just one positive suggestion. In November, 1962, at Lavers in the south of France, a French subsidiary of B.P. and a team under a man called Champagnat discovered a process whereby straight-chain hydrocarbons can be converted into proteins, valuable in animal feeding. This is a discovery of immense significance, perhaps one of the most important of the last twenty years.<br/>
It may be asked, where does this tie up with freedom from hunger? B.P. is a company, the majority shareholding of which is owned by Her Majesty's Government. The suggestion I have is this, that the Government make full inquiry into how this process, by which one changes straight-chain hydrocarbons into protein, is being brought to this country, and that an inquiry be made especially into whether protein can be manufactured on such a large scale, first of all, not for humans at ail but for animal feedingstuffs. Because, suppose we were able to deliver animal feeding-stuffs of high protein content to developing countries, that would give them the take-off into economic growth which is really essential and would give them a helpful capability of supplying health-giving food for industrial populations.<br/>
So this seems to me one of the absolutely crucial matters. To save time, as other hon. Members want to raise other subjects, I will sit down now, asking for an assurance that that will be looked into. The scientists of B.P., I know, will co-operate. I ask for this inquiry particularly with a view to the practical study of the manufacture of protein as a possible means of providing employment in oil refinery areas where there is unemployment, such as the north-east of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. I ask that there may be a full investigation.</p>

<p>This Vote contains reference to the need to vote &#x00A3;350,000 in order that the cartoon by Leonardo da Vinci shall be retained in this country and to a second and much smaller expenditure on a further grant, a grant in aid, to the British Academy, and this increase of &#x00A3;35,000 is required to finance the continuation of salvage work on sites shortly to be submerged in Egypt and the Sudan.<br/>
We have just listened to many eloquent and moving speeches on the tremendously great and important problem of the need of the world to have more food. The loss of these treat works which are to be drowned in the Sudan is due to the fact that it is essential that the world shall have more food in this, one of the most fertile and ancient valleys the world has known and where, perhaps, our civilisation&#x2014;certainly that of this part of the world&#x2014;began.<br/>
When we consider this matter of the salvage of sites in Egypt I am compelled to say that many of us felt more than sorry that we had to face the drowning of the Temples of Abu Simbel. The hon. Baronet the Member for Cambridge (Sir H. Kerr), who is in his place as he always is when these subjects are being discussed, will remember that the Arts and Amenities Group's two deputations did their best to see whether help could be given to save them, but the total sum required was very large, some 70 million dollars, and they did not find it possible to persuade the Treasury or the Minister of Education to find what we thought was needed, namely, an extra &#x00A3;2 million to buy those remarkable pieces of apparatus, the jacks which would have lifted the whole of this cliff 170 ft. into the air and mounted it to safety.<br/>
That cannot now be helped, but when we are dealing with the other item, the item of the &#x00A3;350,000 we must vote for the Leonardo cartoon, I think it is worth while in a few words to remind the House what has really happened. In the short debate which

we shall have on this subject many questions will be asked&#x2014;and I hope that most of them will be answered&#x2014;because of the serious embarrassment caused to many people when it was thought that Britain might lose this remarkable work of art.<br/>
As we were aware, an approach had been made by the Royal Academy to the Governnrient&#x2014;a private approach, I believe&#x2014;asking them to buy the cartoon, but the Government refused. We then received a declaration from the Royal Academy to the effect that it proposed to sell the cartoon by public auction. I appreciate that had that been done there would have been a so-called safeguard concerning the activities of the Reviewing Committee for the Export of Works of Art. However, that safeguard could not have had any effect until after the cartoon had gone to auction&#x2014;where it was expected to fetch at least &#x00A3;1 million from foreign buyers.<br/>
It was at that time&#x2014;with not much time left before the possibility of our losing it&#x2014;that the hon. Baronet the Member for Cambridge and I saw the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. and learned Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd). We did not ask him for money, just to be allowed time so that he and the Prime Minister would use their influence with the Royal Academy and allow the nation a period in which to buy the cartoon for Britain. We wanted to give the nation time to see if it thought highly enough of this work of art to purchase it.<br/>
I wish to pay tribute to the serious way in which our representations were received by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer and to the immediate action taken by him, for within a few days of our visit we knew that we had about five months in which to retain this work of art&#x2014;not a great time in which to organise and mount a great campaign to enable the people of this country to buy it for themselves. The Chairman of the National Art Collection Fund took it upon himself to mount this campaign and nothing I can say can be praise high enough for the work he did, for he forced himself to go on, and though not a well man, refused to go into hospital until he had achieved his object.<br/>
I think it fair to say that all of us who were interested in this matter were rather disappointed to find that few large sums were forthcoming. Naturally, the National Art Collection Fund helped with a large sum, as did the National


Gallery itself and one of the trusts, but, by and large, it was surprising to see just how few were the large sums contributed. I am dealing with this aspect now because I hope that the Financial Secretary will address his remarks to the question of what will happen in future should a similar situation occur. Why did we not get wealthy private benefactors to come forward with assistance? Hundreds of thousands of people who paid to see the cartoon in the National Gallery and those who gave money and silver articles raised a considerable amount. It has been impossible to trace the donors because no receipts were given, but by the end of the period allowed about &#x00A3;350,000 had been raised, about half the sum required.<br/>
At that stage it would have been possible to have pleaded for a further extension of time, but by the time the &#x00A3;350,000 had been raised summer was upon us, along with the Long Recess, people were on holiday and it was at this stage, following representations made by Lord Crawford, that the Treasury did something for which I must commend them; they offered to give the rest of the money. It was in this way that the cartoon was saved. We are tonight being asked to give the Treasury permission to have that money.<br/>
The exercise of raising the necessary money was, I suppose, the greatest manifestation of public patronage of any kind I can remember. The nation was alerted and the public came forward to keep this remarkable work of art in Britain. It is said that the location of a work of art is not important so long as the public has open access to it. In other words, whether it be in Berlin, Paris, New York or London, so long as lots of people can see it, that is the important thing. I suppose that that is accurate in some ways, but that philosophy surely should not mean that we should be prepared to lose treasures of this type without making an attempt to retain them in this country.<br/>
In this case we are dealing with a success story, for the cartoon was retained here. But the Economic Secretary must be aware that there are about 100 irreplaceable great works of art which are not in the possession of any of our national galleries but are in private

hands. The directors of our great institutions know where they are, but I hope the Economic Secretary will say that he considers that we should now quietly proceed to negotiate to try to buy them. If so, must not the Government review the present machinery so that whenever a work of art of this type is offered for sale the sort of embarrassment we suffered in this case will not arise again?<br/>
Had this happened in the United States there would have been no such embarrassment because private benefactors would have come forward with the money. The Government would not have had to come to the rescue and a great campaign to raise money nationally would not have been needed. Benefaction in the United States is marked and profound, but there are reasons for that. The British Treasury has not allowed our wealthy citizens to have the sort of advantages their counterparts enjoy in the United States. Our fiscal policy does not permit such advantages, and I am wondering whether the Economic Secretary has thought about this matter recently.<br/>
As we know, the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries has been pleading for some years for a change in Government policy in relation to death duties and certain taxes when gifts of articles of this type or gifts of money are made to galleries and museums. I will not go into the details because we are well aware of them. We have discussed this topic on Finance Bills for some years, although we have not succeeded in persuading the Government of the need for a change in policy in this respect. I hope that the Economic Secretary will say that some thought has been given to this matter.<br/>
It is interesting to note that a grant is made to institutions and allows provincial galleries to purchase works of art more easily than they would otherwise be able to do. Is there any likelihood of a change in Government policy along these lines which would ensure, on an area basis at least, that conservation would be possible with the assistance of the Treasury?<br/>
The Economic Secretary knows, of course, that there has been some criticism of the Treasury for administering the arts in the way it does, whether it be great institutions like the British


Museum or the giving of these grants-in-aid. Certain views have been voiced. I am delighted that my colleague, the hon. Member for Cambridge, is in his place, because he and several of his colleagues have given a view recently on this which is inimical to the Treasury. They would like the Treasury to surrender its responsibilities in this matter.<br/>
I wholly disagree with that view, but I know that many of my right hon. and hon. Friends agree with the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues who wrote an interesting pamphlet called <i>Government and the Arts,</i> which, strangely enough and rightly enough, has a reproduction of the Leonardo cartoon upon it. Many other hon. Gentlemen on the benches opposite agree with me that we should avoid a Ministry of Fine Arts like the plague.</p>

<p>I am obliged to you, Mr. Speaker. You have been most kind in allowing me the freedom to go as far as I have.<br/>
The Economic Secretary is responsible for seeking this grant from us. If I disliked the hon. Gentleman, I suppose that it would be possible for me to accuse him of having forced us into this embarrassing situation and to ask him never to do so again. However, I must leave the matter where it is by saying that where we on these benches see the Government being generous to the arts they can look to us to support them wholeheartedly. For ourselves, we proclaim gladly that, in turn, we shall nurture and cherish all that is good in the arts and that, in particular, we want to encourage the living artist who lives among us today.</p>

<p>I am delighted that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Dr. Stross) paid such a warm tribute to Lord Crawford and Balcarres. Both the hon. Gentleman and I saw a good deal of Lord Crawford during the period of the Leonardo appeal. Aided only by a

tiny staff, and working through 12 hours of the day, he bore almost single-handed the entire burden of the work. Seeing him at work, I was reminded of the pictures of St. Sebastian, as conceived by the old masters, pierced by a hundred arrows, but his face still lit by a seraphic smile.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of the difficulties with which the Government are faced from time to time over the policy of helping the arts. The Leonardo appeal illustrated very vividly the trend that has already become familiar, and will become more and more familiar as the years go by. It is obvious that the day of the private patron is over.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that most of the money provided for the cartoon came from the pennies, shillings and half-crowns of ordinary people. Wealthy men, perhaps largely owing to existing tax laws, made no great single contribution. We have to accept the fact, when faced with demands for the purchase of works like the Leonardo, that, whether we like it or not, the Government of the day are becoming more and more the Maecenas of the arts.<br/>
Realising the issues raised by the sale of the Leonardo and its purchase in this way, my hon. Friends and I&#x2014;and I am glad to see my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) here, because he did the bulk of the work&#x2014;came to the conclusion that the machinery for handling the Government's relations with the arts at present was not satisfactory.<br/>
We made a modest proposal that there should be some co-ordination and that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Public Building and Works should be the co-ordinating figure. But this little mouse of a proposal created as much uproar in certain artistic circles as a barging Brontosaurus. "'Barmy,' Sir William Emrys Williams snorted and roared with the ferocity of a bull in a Spanish arena when it first sees the red capes of the bull fighters." Even Lord Cottesloe, who couched his remarks in the more mild and muted tone suited to the gilded and gothic splendours of the House of Lords, followed his example.<br/>
They were afraid of things that were never intended. It was not intended,


even after the purchase of the Leonardo by the Government, to lay down standards of taste. We merely tried to question whether the administration was the best possible. But both these two gentlemen pictured from our proposal some flushed and harassed Minister standing at that Box in the House and facing cries of "Disgraceful" and "Resign" from both sides of the House because he had not supported equal proportions of representational and non-representational art. They were misguided.<br/>
I will quote a far more serious authority on the need for co-ordination, when the Government come to deal with situations such as the purchase of the Leonardo, namely, Lord Bridges, the former head of the Treasury. Lord Bridges at one time was the veritable "Dalai Lama" of Whitehall, a figure whom Ministers and civil servants fawned upon and whose greeting or slightest nod of approval threw them into the ecstatic convulsions of a courtier who caught the eye of Louis XIV on the terrace of the Palace of Versailles.<br/>
In the Romanes lecture on the arts at Oxford he said that although the Treasury was performing its functions well at the present time in dealing with grants to the arts, he was not quite certain what might happen during a period of astringency, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer could not very well advise other Departments to go about in rags when his own spoilt children were clothed in purple and fine linen. This great Whitehall figure suggested that perhaps there should be a shift of responsibility and more coordination.<br/>
The grant for the Leonardo, and the interest shown by the people in it, illustrate more and more that we are coming to an age of leisure. More and more, the Government are becoming the patrons of the arts. They will be responsible for grants to the galleries and will set the standard by which an increasingly leisured society will draw its inspiration. I do not say that at once a girl prodigy at Roedean will begin to write poems as beautiful as those of Sappho, or that in suburban gardens we shall see statues moulded by some local Epstein. But we are moving into a period where people will more and more find that real happiness in life exists within themselves.<br/>
That is why the Government should consider very carefully, following the purchase of the Leonardo, their whole policy towards the system of the purchase of works of art and see whether administrative actions would not be more valuable through co-ordination&#x2014;possibly in the way suggested by my hon. Friends and myself.</p>

If it were at all possible for the Under-Secretary to do something, we could probably see how we could divide the money and it might help a certain repertory theatre in which I have an interest.

<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Sir H. Kerr) and the hon. Member for Enfield, East (Mr. Mackie) on keeping within the rules of order, one rather longer than the other, on this rather difficult subject. I join with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Dr. Stross) and with my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge in congratulating Lord Crawford on the tremendous amount of work he did to make the Leonardo cartoon appeal a success and to raise more than half of the


sum required. It is also correct that I should pay tribute to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) who, in a summer which was busy in the financial and economic sense, took a tremendous interest and a tremendous lot of trouble to make sure that this difficult operation went successfully. In many ways he found it a recreation from his more onerous duties in the Treasury, and we are all in his debt for what he did to save this great picture.<br/>
I fully recognise that the Treasury cannot disclose its hand in a matter like this until very late in the day. If it were to guarantee the money, or in any way to cover it at the beginning, the private contributions would clearly dry up immediately, and only those who feel that the State should pay 100 per cent. of the cost of a picture such as this could ask for that. Personally, I envisage this as a combination, a partnership, of the State and private contributors to put up the money for pictures such as the Leonardo, and it would be quite wrong if the whole cost were to fall on the Treasury. The people must demonstrate their wish, with their contributions, to keep a picture of this sort in the country. Otherwise, as a nation we must admit that we cannot afford to hold it, and we must let it go.<br/>
I disagree with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central who suggested that we should tackle this problem by buying up the pictures which we know to remain in the country and which we do not want to leave it. That would be quite the wrong approach. If every good picture in the world were in a museum, I do not think that it would be an advantage. There must be some movement from some homes to museums and from some homes to other homes. We should work towards making the pictures available to the public, but not necessarily have them all in national ownership.<br/>
The whole of this operation was carried out under the ultimate threat of export control through the machinery of the Waverley Committee. The Treasury would not have had nearly so much influence in the matter if it had not been for the possible refusal of an export licence at the end. I have always believed that this machinery is fully justified by United States tax concessions and by the policies

of other countries, which have the effect of forcing up the value of works of art and distorting the market in works of art and making conditions not normal market conditions. The machinery works very well and I should like to go on record as saying that in this extremely difficult problem we have got somewhere near the right solution.<br/>
We must not do anything which would damage the market in works of art which we have here in London and which is probably the finest in the world. We would be very wrong if we were to extend the principle of export control. Indeed, I should like it to be used as an absolute minimum. It could be said, and I think with some force, that the limits of values under which things can be exported without the approval of the Export Committee should be raised. That would keep more cases from going before the Committee. It could also be argued that the period by which export can be delayed should be reduced. At present it is three months, which is a little long to keep a foreign purchaser waiting until he can take the picture away if permission is eventually granted. Two months might be a better period.<br/>
I am concerned with the whole question of Parliamentary control of grants to the arts in relation to this item of &#x00A3;350,000. I find it slightly strange that it should be my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary who is responsible and who is sitting on the Front Bench to answer the debate. I have the greatest respect and affection for him, but I am still surprised that he can spare the time from his many duties connected with the national economy and the state of our affairs and our taxation problems to answer the debate. I hope that he is continuing also to find the time to keep in close touch with our many museums and galleries and theatres and operas and all the many artistic activities for which he is responsible. I am sure that he has seen the Leonardo two or three times since it has gone into the National Gallery and that he is always popping in to make sure that it is being properly looked after. I congratulate him on one thing&#x2014;he has not allowed it to be stolen, as in a previous case of this sort. I hope that he is not finding these duties too onerous.<br/>
We must have some sort of Parliamentary control if we are to vote sums of money, in this case &#x00A3;350,000 and in some cases nearer &#x00A3;8 million or &#x00A3;9 million annually for the arts as a whole. Some of us have been accused of trying somehow to bring the arts within the control of Ministers and of Parliament. Surely the function of this debate arises because expenditure on the arts is already within the control of Parliament and Ministers. I have never had any difficulty about asking a Question to do with the arts. If we are to provide money for the arts, it is right that we in the House of Commons should at least be able to probe and have some degree of public accountability. I do not think there is anything wrong with that and I am surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Cottesloe, finds it so difficult to accept the proposals that there should be some public accountability to the representatives of the taxpayer.</p>

<p>I admire the hon. Member's ingenuity, but the advantage of the noble Lord was that he was not talking about a specific Supplementary Estimate. We must bear in mind the limits of the debate. Hon. Members cannot raise the whole matter of policy within the realm of a Supplementary Estimate simply by saying. "In relation to this particular purchase".</p>

<p>I apologise, Mr. Speaker, if I have erred a little far in my desire to scrutinise this Supplementary Estimate for &#x00A3;350,000. You have been kind enough to allow me to make my point.<br/>
All I should like to say in conclusion is that the whole question of the Leonardo fund and the grant which we are now discussing and the ever-growing expenditure on the arts have raised in our minds the question of how we can best control it and how we can best administer it. If in flying this kite we have done no more than promote discussion, thought and interest, I am not in the least ashamed of it, and I hope that this will form a subject of later debates in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, East (Mr. Mackie), I am not a Scotsman representing an English seat but a Welshman represent-

ing a Scottish seat. Bearing in mind your admonition, Mr. Speaker, I rise with considerable trepidation to approach this Supplementary Estimate in the interests of Scotland. That is what I shall try to do, and I shall try my best to keep in order, confident that I shall not be allowed to break the rules of the House to any great extent, or to stray too far from the path of virtue in that respect.<br/>
I am concerned about this contribution of &#x00A3;350,000 from the Treasury to the Leonardo appeal fund. Some of this money is Scottish taxpayers' money. The Leonardo cartoon is now in the National Gallery in London. As Scottish and Welsh taxpayers have paid towards the acquiring of this cartoon, it should occasionally go to the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh and to the gallery in Cardiff. We could have a rota.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said that it was desirable that the State should acquire works of art and that it did not so much matter where they were as long as they were available for people to see and study them. The important thing with young people is that they should not merely see works of arts but should understand them. I cannot see our schoolchildren from Aberdeen coming down to the National Gallery in London to see this cartoon. If it were occasionally moved to Aberdeen or to Edinburgh, schoolchildren could make visits to it.<br/>
This is not very difficult, especially when it is remembered that the "Mona Lisa" has been moved from Paris to New York and that the Americans have not even bought it. As the sum of &#x00A3;350,000 represents taxes from all the taxpayers of the United Kingdom, the Leonardo cartoon should not be placed only in the National Gallery in London but should make a visit to the capital of Scotland and to the capital of Wales.<br/>
I have always thought that one of the best of the B.B.C's television programmes was "Sketch Club". I have followed it closely. I have grandchildren of my own and I have always thought that the presentation of art in this way to children is one of the finest things which can be done for the present generation of children. Appreciation of music and visual and other arts in all their forms


is to be encouraged among primary and elementary school children. We are living in a scientific society, a society of mechanical processes and mechanical forms, in a formalised civilisation, and to make living within that society a little more easy and a little more generous appreciation of art is most important. If we lose our artistic sense, as we have lost it in so many things, it will be bad for the people, bad for them as individuals and bad for society as a whole.<br/>
I see that we are to spend &#x00A3;95,000 on raising ancient monuments in Egypt. I do not know how far that sum will go in preserving these wonderful works of art which would otherwise be submerged as a result of the building of the Aswan Dam. This sum of money seems hopelessly inadequate. I do not know whether other funds are also available. I have seen these works only on television, but they seem to be huge and how &#x00A3;95,000 will be sufficient for the work of raising and preserving them I do not know, especially in view of the frightful cost of minor works in this country. I should like the Economic Secretary to explain what part this &#x00A3;95,000 can play as a contribution in salvaging these sites in Egypt and the Sudan. It seems to me to be a fiddling sum in the nature of what must be a tremendous task, and I should like to know from what other sources funds are being contributed to save these works.</p>

<p>I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Sir H. Kerr) "'<ob/>" This is one thing that I can certainly say and I hope that I may be able to remain within the terms of order: he spake indeed with "winged words".<br/>
The words he expressed were attractive and honey to the ears of many of us. I want to pursue what he has said. If I may divert for a moment to what the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) was saying: that if, in fact, the cartoon will travel well and in safety, which is always a difficult matter with a cartoon of this kind, then I share his view that she can become a travelling maiden. There was great concern about one journey to the United States and I think that what we must recognise is that

this is a matter for the art experts, to whom we must leave decisions of that kind. In the British Museum Bill, which is before the House, there is power to arrange for these travelling exhibitions. Indeed, many of us, on another opportunity, will be able to discuss the matter in the House.<br/>
I want to pursue from the converse side these two matters. I certainly think that I can happily say that I shall be in order on these matters because they arise directly from these two points. In the case of Abu Simbel, this country and other countries are being asked to vote money to save very valuable works of art on an international basis. In the case of the Leonardo, no one seemed to think that it was worth very much or anything at all until, suddenly, it was to be exported from this country. Then there was a tremendous wave of almost national fervour among a certain section of the community, and, as a result, there was a hurried whip-round for money with the regrettable feeling that, in any event, if the target was not reached the Government would probably be sufficiently forced into having to find the balance. I want to address myself to these two matters.<br/>
I entirely agree that the machinery is not satisfactory. I entirely agree that we are now entering an age of leisure and that our young people are at least beginning to become very conscious not only of the heritage of the past, but also <i>avant garde</i> in their consideration of what I would call the modern arts. The very strong art market in this country today shows there is also a very wide sphere of what I might call investment buyers. I do not share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge that there is no room for a large increase of patronage other than State patronage.<br/>
I think that a major duty of this House is to give far greater encouragement, each one and all of us, to local authority patronage within our own constituencies. I also believe that many of us on both sides of the House can give far greater encouragement to industrial patronage. I think that many local authorities should do likewise. It is not all Tory ones that do it. In Bermondsey, recently, the local authority introduced a very fine statue on the boundaries between Bermondsey and elsewhere by a


well-known sculptor as a contribution to sculpture.<br/>
There is no reason why those who are developing very fine new architectural buildings should not incorporate into those buildings both magnificent sculpture and internally very fine modern art. I do not think that they will be encouraged to do this unless industrial and local authority patrons think that they are going to get some credit for it&#x2014;such is human nature.<br/>
If this had been approached in another way, it would not be the Government's job to find any of the money for the Leonardo cartoon. I do not criticise them for having done so in the event, but I think that if the approach were along different lines it ought not to be necessary for the central Exchequer to have to carry a grant of this kind.<br/>
How, then, do I suggest that this problem should be approached? I think that it should be of a more national nature, along the lines which the Americans have been successfully pursuing over many years. First, I think that it is necessary that the museums and the galleries should encourage their own patrons. At present, we have the National Arts Collection Fund, the Friends of the Tate, contemporary art societies, and similar bodies. The Friends of the Tate, for example, are dedicated to assisting in the purchase of pictures for that admirable gallery, but it seems to me that if the British Museum in its new clothing, the Victoria and Albert, and others, really set out to attract patrons who would become known as the patrons of those museums, those patrons would then seek to encourage the purchase of pictures and to assist in the improvement, design, and attraction of those museums.<br/>
As an illustration perhaps I might refer to one museum in America which I know very well. It is the one in Philadelphia. The board of patrons there consists of leading local accountants and bank managers, and the president is the head of one of the best-known firms of lawyers in the United States. As a result, everything is clone to encourage people, almost as a status symbol, to become patrons of the local museum, and it is a position of great honour to be the president of that museum. The board has the best advisers, and encourages leading industrial, commercial, and professional citizens

to become interested in the arts and to play an effective part in the running of that museum.<br/>
If the local authorities in this country want to improve their provincial museums, the best way to begin is to encourage the local mayors and other citizens to take an active part in the running of them and to take an effective interest in the arts. If this were done and encouraged at all levels, I believe that in this case the Royal Academy would have had a sufficient number of good patrons who would have been able to go to the big industrial patrons and get &#x00A3;700,000 without much difficulty, and it is the more likely that they would have succeeded in so doing if they knew that the Government were not going to help them, because there is nothing like the spur of private endeavour to produce results.<br/>
It is said that we deserve only what we are prepared to pay for, and there is a good deal in this. I think that I am in a minority in my view, but I believe that one day it will be the majority view. I take the view that those who enjoy the pleasures of the museums would do so all the more if they had to pay a small charge for their pleasure. I know that this is not universally accepted, but if, for example, a man goes to the Tate Gallery, he has to pay his bus fares there and back&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. I dislike having to interrupt the hon. Member, but he knows my duties. He must relate his observations to these two grants.</p>

<p>What I am seeking to argue is that if the public make no contribution to the pleasure of seeing these museums, and, therefore, the Leonardo, they are not entitled to ask the Government to pay by way of grant what they are not prepared to contribute. I say no more than that. I think that that makes my point, and if a person is prepared to pay his fare to go to Piccadilly to see the Leonardo, there is no reason why he should not pay a moderate entrance fee to the museum for that pleasure.<br/>
It would be easy to exclude students from this provision and I ask hon. Members to bear in mind the fact that the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who discussed this matter with me and others


in this House, was definitely of the view that it would assist the Treasury considerably, when it was considering matters of this kind, if it knew that the public, as well as industrial and local authority patrons, were willing to make some small contributions to which there might then have to be added a benefice by the Government.<br/>
I ask the House and my hon. Friend to bear those observations in mind, because I do not think it right that members of the Treasury Bench should have to come to the Dispatch Box and say that they propose to make a further grant each time some major work of art is about to go out of the country. I hope that we may get a different outlook, and that we may be able to encourage a new type of patronage, particularly industrial patronage.<br/>
If the Chancellor at some suitable time is able to support the views I have expressed, and if those who want to assist in the golden age of leisure show by their material offers that they really want to assist the arts, we shall get a climate of opinion in the country which will make it easier to secure what at the moment only a minority feel strongly about, namely, the opportunity to enjoy the great pleasures which the arts can provide.</p>

<p>I profoundly disagree with the hon. Member for the Isle of Thanet (Mr. Rees-Davies). I hope we shall never see the day when a charge is made for entering our museums. The hon.

I hope that he will long live to be in a minority, and I hope that for a long time we shall not change the existing state of affairs in which entrance to our museums is as free as we can possibly make it.<br/>
I also disagree with what was said by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley).

<p>That is the point on which I disagree with the hon. Member. I think that the Economic Secretary is the right Minister. He is a good Minister, and from experience I can testify that he is very sympathetic on this subject. I therefore think that he is the ideal Minister to be made responsible for explaining the grants which the Treasury wishes the House to endorse, and in a moment I shall put one or two questions to the hon. Gentleman which I think will explain what I have in mind.<br/>
I wholeheartedly support these grants. I disagree with the hon. Member for the Isle of Thanet. I think that the Government are right to recommend the House to make this contribution of &#x00A3;350,000 for the Leonardo cartoon and also to make a grant for salvage work on sites in Egypt.<br/>
I express the hope&#x2014;and I hope that the Minister will confirm this&#x2014;that in making this grant we are not acting in an exclusive spirit. It would be unfortunate if we fell into a situation in which we thought that only a certain amount of money was to be spent each year in grants for the preservation of works of art. No one can foretell precisely two years ahead, one year ahead or even three months ahead what demands are likely to arise upon the Treasury, as matters of urgency, for the preservation of works of art, whether they be works that we wish to keep in this country or overseas monuments which we seek to preserve, as in the case of the temples in Egypt, which are of world interest. It is equally important that we should make provision for being able to bring to this country from abroad works which are of special interest to this country.<br/>
My object in speaking in this debate is to invite the Minister to agree that the Treasury will always be sympathetic in inviting the House to vote sums of this kind whenever, in the opinion of the Treasury, the preservation, conservation or the bringing to this country of some work of outstanding importance is involved. In support of that I give two illustrations. I would not have minded if the grant had been higher. I have been urging the Minister to make a grant of


about &#x00A3;170,000 for the purchase by the Trustees of the British Museum of a unique work of art&#x2014;a famous ivory cross the whereabouts of which had been unknown for centuries, and which only recently came to light in Switzerland. It is of outstanding interest to students&#x2014;</p>

<p>I have the impression that the matter of the ivory cross would necessitate a further and different Supplementary Estimate. I cannot get away from that difficulty.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-03-20a.477.1" hansard_membership_id="4492" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29295" speakername="Mr. Fletcher" colnum="477" time="">
<p>I entirely agree, Mr. Speaker. But I submit that I can relate it to this Vote by asking the House to register the view that in agreeing to this Supplementary Estimate we are not thereby excluding the possibility of the Treasury's asking for similar grants&#x2014;either now or at a later stage&#x2014;in respect of opportunities to purchase articles of equally great national interest. In this connection, an occasion arises from time to time when some work of art is available for purchase. It may not be in this country, as in the case of the famous <i>Codex Sinaiticus.</i> The question may arise whether this country should acquire a certain work of art, or whether it should go to the United States or some other country. I hope that the Minister can assure us that the fact that we are being asked to agree to this appropriation of &#x00A3;355,000 does not exclude a willingness on the part of the Treasury to invite the House to make similar grants if and when opportunities arise for the acquisition of works of national interest or national importance to this country, whether or not they had their origin here.<br/>
The question of the salvage work to be carried out in Egypt raises a matter of principle. It does not seem possible for us adequately to discuss the appropriateness of agreeing to this grant without anything being said about the policy involved. Obviously it is for the Treasury to recommend the spending of money in retaining in this country, or bringing to this country, outstanding works of art such as the Leonardo cartoon, but I hope that the test that we apply will not depend on the question whether the work of art is in this country at the moment. That would unduly limit the scope of the grant.<br/>
As I conceive it, the Treasury has a duty from time to time to consider whether it should acquire from overseas

works of art, like the <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i> or the ivory cross&#x2014;which the Minister knows about and which now, unfortunately, has gone to New York, although the Minister was prepared to recommend that we should purchase it. I may be expressing a view different from that of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Dr. Stross), whose speech I did not hear, but if there is to be a choice between preserving works of art that are in this country, or which, for various reasons, ought to be brought here, and preserving works of art in, say, Egypt, I think that we should choose to preserve the former.<br/>
I have no prejudice against Egypt. The salvage work that has been done by our art experts in the last year or two in connection with various monuments on the Nile is of great importance, but in this context I ask myself what the present position is, for example, with regard to the proposal of the Egyptian Government for the preservation of the two great temples at Abu Simbel. As I understand it, at the U.N.E.S.C.O. Conference, the appropriate committee of which met in November last, certain recommendations were made at the behest of the Egyptian Government to a number of States, or contributory nations to U.N.E.S.C.O., in connection with the raising of a large sum of money&#x2014;it was either 70 million dollars or 80 million dollars&#x2014;to finance a scheme put forward by Italian engineers to lift these monuments bodily from their present situation on the banks of the Nile to a position in which they would be above the new high level of the waters of the Nile and still visible for visitors.<br/>
I have always entertained very grave doubts both about the technical possibilities of carrying out the project to jack these monuments up the cliff and also&#x2014;assuming that the project is technically feasible&#x2014;about the value of reciting the monuments in an artificial location. I am not sure whether they would then be of the same aesthetic value to people who have the good fortune to visit Egypt to see these monuments. As I understand the position, the grant does not include anything in respect of the Abu Simbel temples. If that is so, the question arises whether this is the final decision of the Government or whether it is an interim decision. All


the member States of U.N.E.S.C.O. have to decide whether they propose to make a contribution. Some have already done so. India and Pakistan have decided to contribute and one or two European nations have agreed to do so. The United States has yet to reach a decision. We may find ourselves in a position of having to face the odium of being the only nation which does not propose to contribute, and as a result the future of the temples may be prejudiced, or we may be shamed into falling into line.<br/>
The Government may be taking the line of least resistance and saying that in the circumstances we are not prepared to contribute to the cost of preserving the Abu Simbel temples. If that is so, it will probably seal the fate of these temples, because if we, as a matter of policy, decide not to contribute, it would seem to be unlikely that the United States or the Soviet Union, or the other major potential contributors, will take any further interest. That may be the policy of the Government and if it is I shall not be unenthusiastic about it. The Government may adopt that policy and prefer to spend such money as is at present available on works of a more national interest,&#x2014;such as the Leonardo cartoon or the ivory cross to which I have referred, and which is now in America&#x2014;than on preserving some Egyptian monuments which many people in this country may not see.<br/>
I think that we are entitled to hear a declaration of policy from the Government. The Abu Simbel temples are not unique. Egypt is rich in archeaological treasures and I shall not quarrel with the Government if they adopt that policy; subject to a provision that the money which will be saved for the Treasury may be available in future to be used to preserve other works of art which will, no doubt, call for preservation in the future. I hope that such action on the part of the Government will enable those hon. Members who are interested in these maters to urge more successfully on the Government the desirability of spending money to preserve, conserve or acquire other objects in the future.</p>

<p>I wish to support the expenditure proposed on these matters under discussion

and to announce my agreement with hon. Members who have argued that the machinery used to take these decisions requires examination. I support the decision that was taken by the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer in respect of the Leonardo cartoon. But decisions in matters of this kind depend on the personality of the Chancellor of the day. I do not know the attitude of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary or of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It seems to me regrettable that in matters of this kind, about which I feel deeply, the decision should depend on the view of the Minister of the day.<br/>
This is not a matter of party politics. But the all-party deputations which have waited upon Chancellors in the past have been told that there is speculation about how the country would react to any decision involving the expenditure of public money on works of art. I think it time that the political party which I support did some modern thinking. I am tired of the kind of thinking which is not in tune with the feelings of the country at the present time.<br/>
There is not the slightest doubt that the country, particularly the youth of the country, is becoming tremendously interested in the arts. That is all to the good. Except in the decisions about the Leonardo and the salvage work being done in Egypt, however, I have not seen any absolutely modern policy on the part of the Government of the day. I am very glad that the Leonardo cartoon was finally acquired for this country. Probably many people will be horrified when I say this, but when the appeal was made no one actually explained what the Leonardo cartoon was.<br/>
A great many people have a desire for the preservation of works of art. Many take great pride and pleasure in local museums and art galleries as well as in the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery, which now houses the cartoon. Yet a large number of people, when they saw the way in which this matter was presented&#x2014;and the Government did not enter into it until the public appeal had been launched&#x2014;did not know what a cartoon was. They were used to cartoons in <i>Punch</i> and did not know whether we were spending public money on something which was worth while or not. That aspect of the situation, the gathering together of the great forces in this country


today in support of a realistic and up to date policy for the preservation of things which are great and for purchasing things which are great, is very important indeed.<br/>
In spite of what the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. Fletcher) said, I add my word of support to my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Thanet (Mr. Rees-Davies). If we are to ask the general public, through the Treasury, to spend money on works of art and a large number of people are not yet convinced of the desirability of purchasing works of art, those people would be very much happier if we charged an entrance fee to some of our great galleries. I hope that, as my hon. Friend said, a more modern policy will be followed in that direction.<br/>
Local art galleries may make purchases and promote appeals to stimulate small local authority to help to develop an interest in the arts in their own areas and to look after their own museums. The objection is that, exactly as in the case of the Chancellor and taxpayers, local councillors are afraid of ratepayers. If the ratepayers could have the satisfaction of knowing that those who want this done will contribute to the finances by paying for entry to museums, that would help a great surge forward in interest in local galleries and museums.<br/>
I hope this matter will be looked at in a more realistic way than that of "hit or miss". Someone announces the sale of a work of art such as the Leonardo cartoon and then everybody gets excited. If those concerned had done their job in relation to the Royal Academy years before&#x2014;had found how it was getting on with its expenditure and the development of its art school&#x2014;we would not have had this question suddenly thrown at us. We suddenly find the possibility of the sale of the Leonardo and then everyone gets excited.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend suggesting that the Royal Academy should have accepted public funds for its art school? It has consistently refused to do so.</p>

<p>I would not comment on that because I do not know enough about the thinking of the Royal Academy. The Royal Academy would not need to accept public funds or to take a decision on the matter, but, in the ordinary course of national life and life in London, I presume that even the

Chancellor of the Exchequer knew that difficulty was arising in regard to the maintenance of the Royal Academy art school. We should have been made aware of that. Perhaps the Chancellor did not know about the Leonardo cartoon. How can I know whether he did or not? Those of us who mind about these things would like to know that we shall not be faced with an agonising decision and have to wonder right to the last moment whether or not we shall be able to persuade Her Majesty's Government to find the money.<br/>
I have a great deal of sympathy with what the hon. Member for Islington, East said about the ivory cross and I have a great interest in the preservation of the Abu Simbel temples on the Nile. There is not only the particular question of preservation of those temples, but also the question of how they fit in to world history. We go from the preservation of those temples to the history which is written of the great days in Egypt and the great works of art there which many people have enjoyed and wanted to go to see. We get from the preservation of the temples to literature and a whole variety of things which interest the world as a whole.<br/>
I have no idea what the present Chancellor of the Exchequer thinks about works of art. Probably, as he is a modern man and a young Chancellor, he is very go-ahead. I hope he will be. It is very limiting to be able to discuss only these two Estimates. I should like to say a great deal more, but I do not want to get out of order. I hope that in future we shall be told by the Treasury what its attitude is towards all these great matters. I hope that the present Chancellor and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury&#x2014;I hope I have got his title right, but it is difficult to remember with all these translations from one office to another&#x2014;will remember that now, after years of work, we see developing in this country a tremendous interest in art, music, arch&#x00E6;logy and the whole wide field of arts of all kinds.<br/>
I hope that the Treasury will not sit back and wait for all-party deputations to try to persuade the Chancellor that he will not get cracked on the head if he decides to spend some public money. I have great pleasure in sup-


porting these Estimates, I hope that we shall hear from my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary what the modern policy of a modern Chancellor will be towards these questions.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Dr. Stross), the hon. Baronet the Member for Cambridge (Sir H. Kerr) and the hon. Member for the Isle of Thanet (Mr. Rees-Davies) all mentioned in the course of their speeches the pointer that this Estimate gives to us as to the future of the proper patronage of the arts.<br/>
Only one of those hon. Members, however, made any constructive suggestion for an alternative. He was the hon. Member for the Isle of Thanet, who said that we ought to encourage industrialists and local authorities to become patrons of the arts. This morning I received through the post a Bill promoted by the hon. Member to give four more days' racing on the greyhound tracks. I do not know whether he regards them as industrialists. I gather that the proprietors may be even philanthropists who are anxious to provide for the adequate exercise of greyhounds.<br/>
I support his Bill, and I would do so with the more fervour if I had an indication from the greyhound track proprietors that in the event of their getting this extra opportunity for profit some of the money would go to the patronage of the fine arts. I hope that thought will be passed on by the hon. Gentleman to his friends, no matter what they may describe themselves as or what he may think they are.<br/>
I welcome these two grants, and I particularly welcome the way in which they have been received by the House. I should, however, like to sound a warning. The price of all these articles is now fixed by the amount that a wealthy American will be prepared to pay for them, and the more the efforts of this kind the higher the price will be, because these gentlemen across the Atlantic are determined to get the articles. If one of them had thought it possible to get the Leonardo for the equivalent of &#x00A3;330,000, such a sum would not have stopped the man who had that particular kind of interest.<br/>
Very often, now, when the trustees of these bodies are considering what price they should pay for a certain work of art&#x2014;particularly if they have to ask the Treasury whether they can get a supplement to the annual Vote&#x2014;they have to ask themselves what will be the highest bid from America. Personally, I do not want to see money sent from America merely to preserve these great works of art in private collections there, but I welcome the fact that the Treasury has responded to the magnificent lead given by the National Art Collections Fund and by the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres in starting a fund to try to preserve this particular work of art in this country.<br/>
I am a little surprised at the line taken by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence). I heard the same argument the other night&#x2014;Scotland contributes so much to taxation. I have not yet heard of any Scotsman who pays any tax other than that demanded from him by this House, which he cannot escape paying. If they said, "In order that such-and-such a thing shall be preserved, we will agree to a special tax being levied on Scotland" I could understand it.<br/>
I regard these as national collections. If they can travel round, so much the better, but let us face the fact that a great many of these precious things are so fragile, need such arrangements with regard to air conditioning, and so on, that all of them cannot be sent round the country. Nevertheless, they should be made as available as possible in places where they can be exhibited without danger to their structure or their continued existence.<br/>
I welcome the fact that the Government have had the courage to make these grants. I hope that they will note what I have said about the possibility of getting into competition with American millionaires who want to reconcile their consciences over the way in which they have amassed their money with the way in which they use it for the public benefit, and so are prepared to make great sacrifices for their future in the next world and their reputation in some American pork butchery place in the present world.<br/>
Apart from anything else, I think that the Government have here recognised the truth of what this debate started


on&#x2014;the difficulty there will be in future of getting big private contributions for the preservation for these works of art. I am quite certain that in future the Government will from time to time be faced with the problem of having to meet sudden demands that arise through the possible loss abroad of one or other of similar works of art.<br/>
I hope that the Government, no matter which party may be in power, will not fail in their duty to the cultural life of the country when such a crisis confronts them.</p>

<p>First I want to say how much the Government welcome this debate, and how grateful we are for the contributions that have been made by so many hon. Members. I am sure that we particularly appreciate the most gracious things that have been said, and especially those most deservedly said about what was done by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for the Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) during his period as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The hon. Member for Stoke on Trent, Central (Dr. Stross) particularly referred to him.<br/>
I very much agree with my hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Thanet (Mr. Rees-Davies), who said that our mutual hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Sir H. Kerr)&#x2014;whom I know has to be out of the Chamber for a moment&#x2014;spoke with winged words. But I have a point of difference with my hon. Friend. He criticised slightly the versifiers of Roedean, suggesting that they were not up to the standard of Sappho. Having spent a fortnight being educated at Roedean, and regarding myself almost as an old boy of the school&#x2014;I hasten to explain that it was taken over by the Navy during the war, which explains my presence there&#x2014;I regard this as a fearsome slur on an honourable institution, and hope to discuss the question with him in due course.<br/>
We are grateful for the support that these two grants have received, particularly for the support of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede). Perhaps I do not need to take up time in justifying these sums but, I shall, instead, try to answer some of

the questions and points that have been raised. If I cannot answer them all it is because I must keep within the rules of order. Perhaps we can look forward to a fuller debate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward) said, on another occasion&#x2014;and we shall look forward to that&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am not too sure that two swallows make a summer.<br/>
This debate seems to me to give a flat contradiction to someone who said the other day, "The people who govern us"&#x2014;he meant Parliament as a whole&#x2014;"are not really interested in art. Any obeisance to art is a gesture." I am sure that that is very far from being true and, in particular, I would assure my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth that the present Treasury has a warm sympathy for the arts, as I hope to indicate later.<br/>
I was particularly asked about the Leonardo going on tour. The right hon. Member for South Shields pointed out the difficulties in that&#x2014;the fragility of the cartoon, and so on. Even when the "Mona Lisa" toured it did not do so without very great controversy. None the less, I am sure that there are great advantages in touring, and one of the things we are doing in this House at the moment in passing through all its stages the British Museum Bill is possibly to foresee the development of loans between our various national and local museums and galleries. I believe that to be a wholly worthwhile and important development.<br/>
Much has been said by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) and by my hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Thanet about local expenditure. The House will have observed the publication of the recent Report of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries resulting from the Commission's survey of about 875 provincial museums. On behalf of the House as a whole, and certainly on behalf of the Government, I want to say how grateful we are to Lord Rosse and his colleagues for their work. The Government intend to consult the interests concerned about this matter, bearing in mind the principle, which I believe to be important,


and to have been very much to have been in Lord Amory's mind when this inquiry was established, that the upkeep of local museums and galleries in terms of normal expenditure is, and should remain, the responsibility of local bodies.<br/>
The truth is that local authorities have a glorious opportunity to do something really worth while for the arts. I know that this has been discussed quite recently, and it is right to point out that many local authorities live up to their responsibilities and take these opportunities. I hope very much that more of them will do so.</p>

<p>I will certainly bring that to the attention of the Leader of the House. It is a valuable point to which I am sure my right hon. Friend will give due weight and consideration. I refer to it in passing because the subject of lending to local museums and exhibitions have been mentioned. The matter is much more fully covered in column 36 of Written Answers in today's HANSARD and I will not pursue the subject any more.<br/>
The question of admission charges was raised. There are two schools of thought on this subject. It would be appropriate for me simply to say that the Government have an open mind, and I think that the Government should preserve an open mind until such time as there is clear opinion one way or another. There is much to be said in favour and equally a great deal to be said against.</p>

<p>Surely it is the Government's job to lead. No one will ever consider waiting until public opinion is for or against in this matter. It is a lead that is necessary.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-03-20a.488.1" hansard_membership_id="3616" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14278" speakername="Mr. du Cann" colnum="488" time="">
<p>I am all for leading and I certainly would be very ready, if my hon. Friend would be willing to come with me, to lead her anywhere.<br/>
On the other hand, I think that it would be quite wrong for the Government to force any local or national museum or gallery into a policy which is actively resented. I do not think that that is a Government responsibility. Broadly speaking, it should be up to those individual institutions to make up their own minds on the point.<br/>
I turn to the basic matters, Vote D and Vote P, the British Academy grant in aid and the contribution to the Leonardo Appeal Fund. The grant in aid to the British Academy has by agreement with the Academy been fixed in recent years on a triennial basis. I make the point <i>en passant</i> that we are endeavouring to fix a number of grants on a forward-look basis for reasons which I shall explain in a moment. I believe this to be an important development in policy.<br/>
This provision which is agreed during the triennium is being augmented only in exceptional circumstances. In 196263, the level of the basic grant was raised from &#x00A3;68,000 to &#x00A3;90,000 a year, a substantial increase. Within this the British Academy makes grants to a number of bodies such as the British Schools in Rome and Athens and the Council for British Archaeology and the Egypt Exploration Society. In 1960&#x2013;61 and 1961&#x2013;62, special grants totalling &#x00A3;20,000 were approved to enable the British Academy to increase its subvention to the Egypt Exploration Society so that the latter might undertake important archaeological work on sites in Egypt and the Sudan which were threatened with being permanently submerged beneath the Nile when the High Aswan Dam was completed.<br/>
This work has proved successful beyond all expectation. When the opportunity arose to continue it for a further three years the Government agreed to make a special grant not exceeding &#x00A3;25,000 for this purpose, the first &#x00A3;5,000


to be provided in the current year. I was able to announce this in the House on 5th December. In answer to the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East, this work has nothing to do with the raising of the temples and monuments at Abu Simbel, but I was asked particularly by the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. Fletcher) what our policy was is relation to that matter. The hon. Member posed a number of hypothetical questions which I agree are extremely important.<br/>
This matter has been discussed in the House on other occasions, and in particular my right hon. Friend the Minister of Education has made it plain that there is no question at the moment of joining, so to speak, in the appeal made by U.N.E.S.C.O. In this, as the House knows, we are by no means alone and I certainly could not give in this debate any indication or undertaking that money would be available for this purpose. This is an entirely separate matter.<br/>
I turn to the detail of the Leonardo appeal I was entirely delighted with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and other hon. Members, and particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), who has explained to me that he cannot be here during the remainder of the debate. I was delighted that they paid a warm tribute to Lord Crawford and Balcarres. The work that he did was simply splendid. It was a great public duty which he undertook cheerfully and willingly in difficult personal circumstances. I know how most grateful everybody is to him for that.<br/>
This figure of &#x00A3;350,000&#x2014;and I hope that this illustrates the point of sympathy to my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth&#x2014;is certainly the largest special grant ever, just as the &#x00A3;800,000 is, we believe, the highest price yet paid in this country for a single work of art. As hon. Members have said, the Leonardo appeal was unprecedentedly successful, given the short time in which it had to be organised and carried through. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge said that the age of the private patron is over. Perhaps there is truth in that, although my hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Thanet does not agree and goes further in saying that it should be far from being true. The amount of interest aroused and the

thought of people contributing their sixpences, shillings and half-crowns are, to my mind, extremely romantic and very important.<br/>
Out of this, however, the important question arises whether thought should be given to the question of works of art of major importance held by public and semi-public bodies and what the position with regard to them should be in future. It has been decided that the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art, specially augmented, should be invited to consider the position with regard to the sale of works of art and antiques of national importance and to advise what changes if any might be desirable in the principles and procedures governing the export of such objects. This inquiry is now in train. It will take time. It is not an easy matter, but I am sure that it is right to have the inquiry. While I have the opportunity, I should like to pay a warm tribute to Lord Cottesloe, the Chairman of the Reviewing Committee, another devoted public servant of the arts.<br/>
I have been asked especially about the export of works of art. As the House will know, present arrangements stem from the recommendations of the Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Waverley. I will not spend time discussing the criteria, but in the ten years of its existence the Reviewing Committee has had 59 cases referred to it and in 44 cases it recommended that an export licence should be withheld. The number of cases coming before the Committee does not necessarily indicate the effectiveness of the control. I believe it to be very effective indeed, in the sense that it is designed to safeguard as far as possible all the various interests concerned in the export of works of art of national importance.<br/>
In its ninth Report, published last October, the Reviewing Committee made certain recommendations for improving the system. These recommendations are under consideration in the Treasury, and we shall consider them most carefully. They also present certain substantial difficulties but we shall feel it right to pay very strict attention indeed to what has been suggested.<br/>
I now turn to the question of ministerial responsibility for the arts. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury described me as a strange animal


to find here. I was a little disappointed in that. On the other hand, the hon. Member for Islington, East, with the courtesy that is so typical of him&#x2014;we have done a number of things together, and I look forward to doing so in the future&#x2014;said that I was an ideal Minister. My word&#x0021; That, indeed, is high praise. It is the first time that I have ever been called ideal by anybody, even by my wife, and I am deeply grateful.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tyne-mouth expressed, I think, a feeling which I believe hon. Members always share in relation to individual Ministers, namely, how to bring matters to their attention. If she has a good case and presents it in her usual inimitable, clear and determined style I am sure she will always be received with sympathy, whoever the Treasury Ministers might be.<br/>
There is a serious point here, and that is whether or not it is appropriate for Treasury Ministers to look after the arts or whether we should have a brand-new Ministry. Opinions vary about this, as we have seen this evening. Some of my hon. Friends, in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge, think it right that we should have a new Ministry. I think the important point is that the Government should keep an open mind on the subject until opinion becomes clear one way or the other. But in spite of what my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury said about Lord Cottesloe's remarks in another place, it seems to us that those concerned with the management of the arts value very highly their connection with the Treasury. This seems to be clear beyond a peradventure.<br/>
I am not at all sure that it would be right to say in general that the arts should develop under strict Government and ministerial control. I am sure they do much better without strict Government control. No Minister can be an arbiter of taste, and surely it would be wrong to suggest so. At any rate, at present the arts seem to be flourishing under their own impulse and I am sure that most of us believe that is the correct way at the present time.<br/>
I think what is really in my hon. Friend's mind is the idea that the

Treasury, which has the normal responsibility for controlling expenditure, will be mean towards the arts, and he wishes to avoid that situation. I understand that feeling. But I can assure my hon. Friends that in spite of what is said outside, so to speak, by some of those who come in daily contact with us, it seems to me that&#x2014;and I am sure they would confirm this; indeed, they have done so publicly and privately&#x2014;that the present system is one which appears to work well.<br/>
As to being frightened of approaching the Treasury, or anything of that sort, art is not made tongue-tied by authority at present. It is interesting, incidentally, to observe on this general subject that the current issue of the <i>Museums Journal,</i> in its leading article, states:
<q>Anything approaching a Ministry of Fine Arts has hitherto been treated with suspicion and, indeed, repugnance and will continue to be so regarded in many quarters.</q>
That is a very widely-held view.<br/>
I observe that my old friend Kingsley Amis, the distinguished novelist and university man, is quoted as saying:
<q>I find the thought of the Arts and the Government getting together absolutely horrific. The further they stay apart the better.</q>
Sir Oswald Sitwell is quoted as saying:
<q>Arts should be patronised by as many people as possible but nobody should direct them.</q>
There is truth and force in those observations.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of that. It lends added weight to the point. As I say, we must keep an open mind on the subject. I do not believe the system is bad. It is not true to say that it does not work; it does.<br/>
I turn to the question of expenditure in general. I think that one of my predecessors, Mr. Simon as he then was, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury, in an earlier debate quoted the motto of Pericles&#x2014;"We will cultivate the arts without extravagance." I hope that we are not extravagant, but I hope that it is the feeling of the House that we approach the whole of this problem with


generosity and sympathy and with the aim of giving practical help. At any rate, support for the arts ran at about &#x00A3;1 million before and immediately after the war. It will run next year, if Parliament so wills, at about &#x00A3;11 million.<br/>
The amount for the arts is consistently increasing, a point which will be reassuring to my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth. This becomes apparent when one examines the British Museum Bill which we are discussing. We propose to spend &#x00A3;10 million on one new library and &#x00A3;1 million on another. We are also making an allocation for the establishment of a National Theatre. The Government contribution on capital cost alone must be at least &#x00A3;1 million, which justifies the point that great progress is being made and will continue to be made.<br/>
Adverting to the long look to which I referred, in a number of grants normally carried on Class VIII, Vote 16, notably the basic grant to the British Academy, certainty and assurance are being given to various national institutions in relation to their expenditure in the future. This refers particularly to the Arts Council whose grants have been fixed for the next three years ahead, giving an annual increase year by year of approximately 10 per cent. There are other bodies which I could quote, such as the museums and galleries, which we are currently reviewing with the same principle in mind: we are engaged, with the help of the Standing Commission, in working out a building programme for museums and galleries over the next eight years. This is the policy, continuing and developing help for the arts in the future. I am talking primarily about these special grants.<br/>
The right hon. Member for South Shields was very much on the point when he talked about rising costs. This is a very important matter, and a very difficult one, but I should like to say a word about the way the system works. The trustees of the national collections are expected to rely for the purchase of new acquisitions in general on their regular annual purchase grants. However, the Government are ready to look sympathetically at requests for special grants in exceptional circumstances. They then expect the trustees of the applicant institutions to contribute what they can from their annual Exchequer grant, sup-

plemented by what they can provide from trust funds, private subscriptions, appeals to the general public and charitable foundations. One might describe the matter as a sort of combined operation, involving the institutions themselves with their ever-increasing funds, private sources, and, last, but by no means least, the Government, and the system works well enough.<br/>
Before the debate I was taking out the figures of the total of special grants to museums and galleries since the end of the war. The total figures are about &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;28 million out of a total price figure of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;12 million. In other words, the total of these special grants is approximately 60 per cent. of the total cost in the cases where the Treasury was asked for money. I hope again that my hon. Friend feels reassured, for this is basically the system. Here is this money available for these institutions.<br/>
This is a situation where, in general, the amount of money is increasing. But should special situations arise, should these institutions come suddenly and beg for money, there is a wise provision which, with the approval of the whole House, arranges for contingencies. If these contingencies arise we are ready&#x2014;this is in reply to the hon. Member for Islington, East&#x2014;to look sympathetically at any proposition which is put before us. I share the hon. Gentleman's disappointment that we have not always had the successes that we would have wished, but it is right that the House should take some pride in the fact that we have made a number of very important acquisitions over the years since the end of the war. I do not doubt that we shall make more as time goes on.<br/>
I have been asked about tax concessions. My hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Thanet feels particularly strongly about this subject and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central wished me to say something on it. It is a difficult subject because tax concessions in this respect plainly would involve a number of problems. One is the difficulty of discriminating between various worthy bodies, whether charitable bodies like the R.S.P.C.A., on the one hand, and museums and galleries, on the other.<br/>
Sometimes situations arise in which, as a matter of equity, they have to be considered, and it is difficult to separate


one from the other. Gifts of money or gifts in kind are different from specific gifts such as objects, pictures and paintings. A concession to enable gifts to be set against Surtax would give rise to exactly the sort of difficulties which we had in relation to covenants. It has certainly been the policy of this country to support public collections with monies voted by Parliament. This proposal would mean a specific policy change.<br/>
There is another very important and valuable concession, and that is that the national collections, in common with charities generally, already enjoy exemption from estate duty on gifts <i>inter vivos</i> after one year.<br/>
It has been said that the Treasury should not have a closed mind on this subject. We certainly do not have a closed mind. We have certainly been thinking about it, although it is right to point out that the superficial attractions of the idea seem, perhaps, less important than some of the real technical difficulties.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge and other hon. Members spoke of the creative use of leisure by the mass of our people. Certainly, they have more leisure, and it is vital that we do all we can to encourage them to use it wisely and pr&#x00D2;perly. My hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth spoke of the developing interest in the arts and said that we ignore it at our peril. How right she is. I entirely agree with her. It is the policy of the Government and I believe of the House of Commons as a whole in a bipartisan way to develop our artistic culture in all its aspects. We have a superb national heritage. It is in trust for the nation to manage and to develop it well. It is certainly our determination to succeed in doing this for the pleasure and profit of this generation and, perhaps, more especially for those to come.</p>

<p>It is not for me to criticise the House on how it runs its affairs, except to note that the Vote which follows this one is of over-riding public interest. Therefore, if I do not address myself at great length to this Vote, it is not because I could not dilate on it for a long time, but because we have been rather fortunate in this respect lately. Last Friday, by the luck of the Ballot, we were able to have a full day's debate on it when certain hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle), dealt at length with the question of accommodation here. I understand that we are promised another debate on accommodation which will cover not only the buildings which are being erected at the top here&#x2014;I do not wish to anticipate that&#x2014;but also the Parliamentary precincts which will be built opposite.<br/>
I cannot help but feel that these Estimates for small over-spendings would have been far better dealt with had the Stokes Committee's Report on House of Commons Accommodation been implemented. Paragraph 55 of that Report recommended that a Parliamentary
<q>Commission should itself deal with matters of general principle, the consideration of the draft Estimates, the allocation of accommodation and matters affecting the principles governing the appointment and employment of the staff.</q>
I should have thought that the great Mother of Parliaments would have been far better employed in bringing these Estimates before a Commission rather than that we should deal with them in this way and at this hour when one is only too conscious of the anxieties of our colleagues to bring matters of wider importance before the House.<br/>
We touch here on the control of the Palace of Westminster. I notice that the hon. Gentleman the Parliamentary Secretary always refers to the authorities of the House when he has a sticky debate to answer. I looked up Sir Harold Emmerson's book on the Ministry of Works. The Commissioner of Works, who had great functions in the past, now merely has the custody of Westminster Hall. That is not much good to him now, although in the old days when it was used as a court of law rents could be obtained by letting stalls


for the sale of goods in that place. We appear to have got away from that.<br/>
I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary only one question. It concerns the pilot scheme across the road in St. Stephen's Club. It appears that the Ministry of Public Building and Works is no longer responsible for the cleaning of the club. I do not know who is doing that now. It is, after all, part of the Parliamentary precincts. There is a pilot scheme for the accommodation of Members over there. There are secretaries already there. It seems that the Estimates before us are rather silent on this point.<br/>
The Vote is a very narrow one. We are considering an additional provision of only &#x00A3;24,000. I understand that better progress has been made with the Victoria Tower than was expected. I do not know whether other work can be expedited, but I will be satisfied if the Minister will be able to assure me in the debate which will not be so narrowly drawn that his Department in future, if it has to call off any great schemes, will not do so by the device of the Written Answer. It was an absolute affront and almost an impertinence to a Committee on Accommodation set up by Mr. Speaker to do that&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am speaking about the scheme at the top, the big scheme which will start this summer. Although the Committee sat for a long time and gave its services over a long period, we were not treated with civility. The Minister did not come to the House and say that, owing to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's pay pause, he proposed to call the scheme off. We had the incivility of being fobbed off with a Written Answer to the Chairman of the Committee. There was a "stooge" question. I hope that the Minister will treat Committees set up by Mr. Speaker as responsible bodies and will afford them the civility which disinterested public servants deserve.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell) has spoken very briefly and, as I know that the House

is anxious to debate the next subject, I shall reply only briefly. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish me at this stage to enlarge on his remarks about the authorities of the House. It would take far longer than I have at my disposal to enter into a worthwhile debate about it with the hon. Member. In any event, I should be overstepping the bounds of my responsibilities if I attempted to do so.<br/>
The hon. Member asked a specific question about the cleaning of the St. Stephen's Club. That was formerly on the House of Commons Vote, but now that the National Economic Development Council is the main occupier of the building, it is catered for by other Votes, although it is still the responsibility of my right hon. Friend's Department.<br/>
I also assure the hon. Gentleman that it is my right hon. Friend's wish to treat the House with every courtesy, and I have taken note of what the hon. Member has said about the way in which certain building work was altered. When I spoke to him this afternoon, the hon. Gentleman was kind enough to let me know some of the points which he intended to raise, but I agree with him that it might be much better to raise them in the wider debate on accommodation which we will be having later. It would be much more convenient for the House if that were done. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his courtesy tonight.</p>

<p>We have very little time&#x2014;about fifty minutes&#x2014;to deal with this important subject. I hope that, in the very near future, the House of Commons will be enabled to have a full day's debate on what is an extremely important subject and one which worries many people.<br/>
The Vote which is now before us raises many matters about which we could speak&#x2014;for example, buildings, food, medical services, work, punishment, the


segregation of prisoners into different types, young prisoners, borstals, the treatment of women, and, of course, the whole of the prison system and the way in which we treat criminals. I shall, however, be brief because I know that the Minister wishes to speak and some of my hon. Friends, in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Durham (Mr. Grey), who has recently visited Durham Prison, would like the opportunity to say a few words.<br/>
I remember visiting Durham Prison with my hon. Friend some time ago, when I went particularly to see the girls who were in the borstal attached to the prison. I am pleased to know that what I then regarded as a scandal&#x2014;that borstal girls were in the same building as the male prisoners&#x2014;has now come to an end. I understand that the borstal girls are now elsewhere in the country.<br/>
If I do not mention various items contained in the Supplementary Estimate, the reason is not that I consider them to be unimportant but that I wish to be brief. I have visited several prisons. One of the things that most people find on visiting prisons is the immense variation in conditions&#x2014;in the case of women's prisons, for example, the variations as between Holloway, on the one hand, with its old building, and, on the other hand, an open prison like Askham Grange.<br/>
I shall mention only two or three matters. First, buildings and staff are mentioned in the Supplementary Estimate. These aspects are particularly important in the local prisons where the overcrowding is extremely bad. It is much worse than in the other prisons, because the governor of a local prison cannot say, "We do not have room for you" as the prisoners come in from the courts. He has to make room for them. The regional and the central training prisons, on the other hand, take the prisoners as they come from the local prisons.<br/>
I believe that we could relieve the overcrowding in the local prisons if we could take out of those prisons the young prisoners and those on remand. That means that we must get ahead with the building of remand centres. In the section of the Vote dealing with buildings, I see that &#x00A3;790,000 less than expected has been spent because the building programme has not gone ahead as quickly as was

hoped. That may be the reason why we have only one remand centre.<br/>
We all remember that in April, 1961, the former Home Secretary, now First Secretary of State, said that we would soon have many more remand centres. We have only one at present, and because of the shortage of staff in that one, and because of the shortage of teachers for the younger boys, some of the boys are shut up alone for fifteen or sixteen hours a day and sometimes more. I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman when he anticipates that we shall have more remand centres, because I believe that it is only through having more remand centres that we shall relieve the overcrowding in some of the local prisons.<br/>
There is an item here about medicines. I was very pleased to hear recently that the right hon. Gentleman agreed to set up a Committee to bring forth a report about the whole of the prison medical system. I get a lot of letters from prisoners. Apart from letters in which prisoners point out that they did not commit the crimes for which they are in prison, I think the largest number of letters I get from prisoners are complaints about the medical services, and I hope, therefore, that the Committee which is sitting will not be too long before it produces its report. I was pleased to hear the right hon. Gentleman say last week that women in Holloway and other women's prisons were not compelled to take the V.D. test, but I hope that it will be made clear to them that they can refuse this test and not just have to object on their own without knowing what their full rights are.<br/>
Medicines, of course, include drugs. I feel very strongly that in this day and age when we have so many drugs it is a scandal that we should see in the Report of the Prison Commissioners that such things as straitjackets are still used in our prisons. I should have thought, for instance, that if anybody should be in a state of hysteria he could be more easily dealt with by modern drugs than by being put in a padded cell or in a straitjacket.<br/>
There is an item for public utilities and cleaning. I think that one of the worst features of our worst prisons is the degradation which prison life, and particularly the toilet facilities, brings to a great many of the prisoners. I do


not know whether it is true or not&#x2014;I would ask the right hon. Gentleman to say&#x2014;but I saw in a newspaper article about the new borstal which has been built and is now open in Bulwood in Essex, an article written by someone who visited the borstal, that the toilet facilities there leave a great deal to be desired and that, in particular, there are no toilet facilities for use by the girls and young women at night time. I have not yet visited that borstal, but I hope to do so in the very near future.<br/>
There is another point I must raise. I see there is an additional requirement for mail bag canvas and other materials for the manufacture of goods for other Government Departments. When are we going to get rid of mail bag sewing by hand in our prisons? Surely there are many better things which could be done by our prisoners in occupying their time than sewing mail bags by hand. It must be the most soul-destroying thing, and surely does not fit a man to go out into life.<br/>
While I am on the question of work, I think that the women in our prisons work far harder than the men, because there always seems to be work for the women prisoners to do. I hope that we shall look at the whole question of jam-making which goes on and which is very useful. Nevertheless, I think that the women in Holloway probably have to carry heavier weights than is good for them.<br/>
I want to mention only one other thing and I hope that I shall keep in order in mentioning it. I see an item about pay and allowances and other staff expenses, and that would affect the whole of prison welfare and some of the aftercare. We have seen in the newspapers today photographs of men who have been serving long-term sentences of preventive detention leaving prison, and anyone who has seen those photographs will agree that they did not see any great jubilation on the faces of the men being released. There was just absolute bewilderment because the most frightening part of a long-term sentence is the day of release. I receive many letters&#x2014;and I have no doubt other hon. Members do too&#x2014;from prisoners saying how absolutely frightened they are to face the outside world.<br/>
I have always been interested in the hostel scheme, which I have seen working at Wakefield and Askham Grange, by which long-term prisoners, in the last few months of their sentences, are allowed to go out to work and return to the prison at night. This is of inestimable value. I have seen women prisoners travelling on their bicycles a few miles to York where they work in the chocolate factories. On their release many of them continue to work in those factories and to live in York. This is a valuable scheme which was begun a few years ago.<br/>
The Dartmoor reconviction rate is twice as high among those who are not in the hostel scheme as it is among those who have gone through it. We have all heard of the tragic case which, I understand, will be raised by other hon. Members, of George Thatcher, who was participating in the hostel scheme at the time when he committed a murder. Maybe he was not the type of person to have been selected for the hostel scheme. I do not know. Maybe there should be a stricter watch and supervision over the free time of prisoners who are participating in the scheme. But what I should not like to see is any attempt to bring the scheme to an end, for I believe that it has worked well in easing the problems facing long-term prisoners when they are released. It has been a valuable scheme and I hope that nothing will be done to destroy its value.</p>

<p>He would have been released in two or three months. In this case perhaps it is not a question of the hostel scheme having failed but a question of the whole of the prison system being at fault in that a man had been in prison for so many years but was coming out no better than when he went in. I agree that this was a tragic happening. Unfortunately, time does not permit me to go into many of these matters in detail and that is why I hope that we shall have a full debate on another occasion when we shall be able to discuss these matters at length.</p>

<p>This is, as the hon. Lady the Member for


Leeds, South-East (Miss Bacon) said, undoubtedly a very important subject. I listened with interest to her remarks, particularly when she described the degradation of the toilet facilities in prisons. The most inexpensive yet most effective way of reforming our prisoners and helping those who are incarcerated in prison as a punishment would be to put in proper lavatorial facilities. I cannot see any reason in this day and age why a person who is being punished by the State must be forcibly subjected&#x2014;because there is no alternative&#x2014;to the habits of an animal. The "slopping" system should go as quickly as possible.<br/>
While I have said that this would be a comparatively inexpensive, although essential reform, I am not one of those who would advocate enormous expenditure on our prisons now. I am not complacent, but I am content with the level of expenditure on our prisons at the moment. That expenditure is about &#x00A3;5 million a year on building and alterations and the &#x00A3;26 million scheme started in 1959 is taking about &#x00A3;4&#x00BD; million a year.<br/>
We must analyse all this and be careful that we know the answers. We must know why our prisons are being filled up at the rate at which they are at the moment. I believe that one of the sources of crime is bad housing, and if there are to be priorities, as indeed there must always be priorities in these matters, I would rather see money spent on housing than on prisons.<br/>
I agree that there is discomfort in prisons. Of course, no one enjoys being in them. I concede without hesitation the harm that can be done by having a number of men, for example, sleeping together in the same cell. I concede also the humiliation and the oppression of mind caused by these conditions. But these are at the moment one of the elements of punishment. I think that it is very easy to become over-sentimental in these matters.<br/>
The reasons for sending a man or a woman to prison are many. Primarily, they fall into three categories. The first reason is to punish them, the second to deter others from doing the same, and the third&#x2014;which I am not sure is not as important as any of the others&#x2014;is to reform them so that when they come out they will become good subjects of society.</p>

<p>Surely the modern conception of imprisonment is not primarily punishment but correction spiritually, morally and educationally?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-03-20a.504.1" hansard_membership_id="4724" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29230" speakername="Mr. Gardner" colnum="504" time="">
<p>I agree. But I do not think that we should lose sight of the punitive element, and I think that the hon. Member will agree with me there. It is something that we cannot overlook. If we are to make our prisons as comfortable as home, and give the prisoners all the facilites that they could have outside, there will be little distinction between prison and the outside world except loss of freedom, which I agree is a very considerable thing.<br/>
One aspect of punishment that particularly interests me, and I am sure concerns the House as a whole, is the punishment of young girls. It is something which also particularly interests the hon. Lady the Member for Leeds, South-East. There has been an appalling increase in the crime rate among young women. I should call them young girls really, because the age group with which I am concerned is that between 14 and 17.<br/>
Since 1938 the crime rate in this age group has risen by nearly four times. In 1938 the number of young girls between 14 and 17 who committed offences was about 912; in 1961 the figure had risen to 3,305. If one compares this figure according to the number of offenders per 100,000 of the population, in 1938 it was 90 and in 1961 it was 310.<br/>
I mention this subject because it is essential when we consider the amount of money being spent on prisons and borstals that we keep these young girls in mind. It is essential that we should be satisfied that the very best is being done for them by deciding which particular form of treatment or punishment they should be given. It is essential that classifying centres&#x2014;a very important step in the decision which is eventually taken about where a young girl should go&#x2014;should be operated on the most effective and efficient basis. There is only one classifying centre for girls in the country at the moment and that is working at half-strength because of lack of staff.<br/>
The punishment given to a person, particularly to a young girl, is of paramount importance for the country's future. We


all know the immense influence which women have upon society, and if these crime rate figures continue to grow and we are not careful, we shall get a criminal class of women whose influence on society might be profound. I urge upon my right hon. Friend the need when deciding upon priorities of expenditures on our prison and borstal system to deal with women criminals at the top of the list.<br/>
I am grateful to hon. Members for their patience in listening to the case I have attempted to make. I know that there are many other hon. Members who wish to add their quota to the debate. I conclude by hoping that this subject of young women criminals will achieve a very high place in the list of priorities.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. and learned Member for Billericay (Mr. Gardner) will forgive me if I do not follow him into that subject. I wish to deal with allegations which were made in the House on 12th March concerning Durham Prison. When the Home Secretary recently suggested that one or two hon. Members might visit a prison, I had no idea how soon it would be that I would take the opportunity of visiting that prison, although the circumstances surrounding my visit were very sad.<br/>
Perhaps I have been successful in catching your eye, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, because of a speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Exchange (Mrs. Braddock). In all kindness and fairness to her, I have to say that I wish that she had mentioned her allegations to me before raising the subject in the House. It is an act of courtesy that when an hon. Member's constituency is involved the hon. Member wishing to raise the issue informs him of his intention to do so. My hon. Friend is a personal friend of mine, and I have no bitterness in my heart about her action, but if she had told me what she intended to say the harm which has been done might not have been caused.<br/>
I visited Durham Prison on Monday of this week. I met all types in the prison. I met the governor, the medical officers, the prison officers and the prisoners themselves. It took me three and a quarter hours to get in and out

of that prison. I have never had such an exhausting time before.<br/>
I can assure the House that the allegations which were made on 12th March were absolutely untrue, and it is because they were untrue that I ask the Home Secretary to agree to a full-scale inquiry into them. All these allegations are connected with brutal treatment. There are some with which the right hon. Gentleman could deal at once.<br/>
It was alleged that five of the warders at Durham Prison were transferred from Liverpool Prison because of their part in the inquiry at that prison. That allegation was not true. Only one of the five warders who were moved to Durham Prison took part in the inquiry at Liverpool Prison. One went to Durham on compassionate grounds and the other four were sent there on promotion. To suggest that they were moved to one prison because they were responsible for some upheaval in another is definitely untrue and malicious.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, South-East (Miss Bacon) has already widened the scope of the debate. We are here concerned with the recruitment of prison officers. If this kind of thing is to be said about prison officers, how are we to recruit them?<br/>
I am taking this matter up now because it is perhaps the only opportunity that I shall have of hearing from the Home Secretary whether there should be an inquiry into Durham Prison and all the aspects of prison life there concerning the governor, the medical officers, the prison


officers, and the prisoners themselves. I think that there should be an inquiry in the interest of all concerned and of the country. A slur has been cast against this prison which, I believe, ought to be removed.<br/>
I have tried to put myself in order, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, and I promise that I shall not be too long, but there is another case that I should like to mention. If it is said that warders are brutal when they are not, how shall we be able to staff our prisons? If we allow them to be maligned, and if ex-prisoners are allowed, in Press interviews, to make all kinds of malicious statements and there is no means of countering the allegations, what position will the country be in when it wants to launch a campaign to recruit prison officers?<br/>
The position has been jeopardised by the accusations that have been made. There is not one statement that has been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Exchange that can stand up to the truth. This is very unfair when we think of all the things that a prison officer tries to do inside a prison, in difficult circumstances.<br/>
There is another aspect of the matter. Is not this a sad reflection on every religious denomination in Durham? Ministers of every religious denomination visit and are in close contact with the prison. If we say that cruelty occurs in the prison, we are condemning these people. because they must obviously know about it.<br/>
In view of the malicious and outrageous statements which have been made, and of the fact that great resentment is felt by some of the prisoners in the prison, by the prison officers, by the medical officers, by the governor himself, and by people outside the prison, nothing short of an inquiry will satisfy. I hope that I shall be permitted to tell the House what happened on Monday night.<br/>
Within half an hour of a television interview, a person whose name I shall not mention&#x2014;I dare not&#x2014;rang me and said, "I was in Durham Prison. I am ashamed of what I did in the past, but now I have a decent job. I am working for a good employer, but he does not know my past, and I do not want him to know it". This man is now afraid that his future has been jeopardised.<br/>
I feel very strongly about this. I am grateful for being allowed to go rather wide in my remarks, but I felt that this was the only opportunity to make known the views of the Durham authorities and of some of the prisoners, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be in favour of a full-scale inquiry into the whole matter.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Grey) for his vindication of the prison service in his constituency. What he has said will be of real value to the prison officers throughout the service. This is a matter which has caused widespread distress among prison officers and people who wish the service well, and I think that the House and the country should be grateful to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
I shall confine my remarks to Subheads C and H. Under Subhead C we see that there is to be an increase of 212 staff. I welcome this increase, but I hope that my right hon. Friend will write me a letter as soon as he can answering the nine and a half points which I raised in my speech last Tuesday and which he left unanswered and deal with this question of additional staff which is of great importance.<br/>
I said last Tuesday, and I repeat now, that promotion prospects for the staff are far too slow. Until there is a more attractive career structure for the uniformed grades they are bound to want to press, and quite rightly so, for all promotions to the non-uniformed grades to be from the lower grades.<br/>
With regard to the non-uniformed grades, it is essential that there should be mobility and an improved career structure there also. I believe that the new arrangements which the House approved last Tuesday will enable the Home Secretary to allow manoeuvreability and mobility between one branch of the prison service and another, and I hope that further changes within the prison service, and indeed the probation service, will further improve recruitment in the years ahead.<br/>
Dealing with Subhead H, the hon. Member for Leeds, South-East (Miss Bacon) rightly deplored the continued sewing of mail bags. As I said last Tuesday, this grave shortage of work in the prisons is extremely distressing. A discharged prisoner faces a crisis when he


goes back to employment. If he has been spending his twenty-four hours a day in prison with a lack of work, he has formed a very unsatisfactory view of work. It is essential that we should do all we can to improve the real working conditions in prisons.<br/>
There are two requirements: first, more staff&#x2014;and I welcome the increase under Subhead C&#x2014;and, secondly, more realistic work. This can come only from the good offices of the Government and the trade unions. I therefore hope that my right hon. Friend will get closer to the trade unions in this matter of encouraging proper work in prisons. The hon. Lady deplored the sewing of mail bags by hand in prison, and so do I. But prisoners must be offered something relatively simple. I hope that the hon. Lady's condemnation of the jam factory in Holloway Prison was not coloured by the book which has been written by two young ladies who may not have been used to manual work. Conditions in Holloway may have been an eye-opener to them.<br/>
Item (3) of Subhead H is in respect of
<q>Additional requirements for mailbag canvas and other materials for manufacture of goods for other Government Departments and for prison use.</q>
I hope that the other Government Departments will give a proper accounting for the raw materials that the Prison Commissioners buy for them and that the matter will be put upon a proper commercial basis. I notice that the former Assistant Postmaster-General, who is now at the Home Office, is present. I hope that the Post Office has not been getting its mailbags on the cheap in the past.<br/>
I notice that in Item (1)&#x2014;"Farm Supplies"&#x2014;there is apparently a decreased provision of &#x00A3;10,000. This does not surprise me, because the farming activities of the Prison Commissioners have been extensive and successful. I hope that my right hon. Friend will do all he can to improve recruiting, and also work conditions in prisons.</p>

<p>I am reluctant to rise now, but there are only 12 minutes remaining, and I want to

take the opportunity of answering as many questions as possible.<br/>
In reply to the hon. Member for Leeds, South-East (Miss Bacon), I shall always welcome opportunities for debating prisons and the prison service in Parliament. It is a great responsibility, not only for the Home Secretary but for every one of us, that we have 30,000 people in detention. We should never forget them. We must always be thinking how we can improve the prison system not only in its deterrent but in its reformative aspect.<br/>
One of the necessary things is to recruit more prison staff and good prison staff. I am glad to say, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Maid-stone (Mr. J. Wells), that the strength of prison officer staff increased by no less than 550 last year, thanks to excellent recruitment, We now have two training centres open. This improved recruiting is continuing in the current year, and it is that, together with the vigorous building programme on which we are engaged, which will do more than anything else to put right some of the admitted shortcomings in our prisons now, especially with regard to work.<br/>
I set more store by providing prisoners with a full week of work than by almost anything else, but we cannot do that so long as we have to run a number of our prisons on a one-shift system of prison officers, and we cannot do it until we have enough workshop space. Hon. Members mentioned the question of mailbag sewing by hand. This is dreary and monotonous work, but it is, nevertheless, rather popular work in some prisons, because the prisoners sit close to each other on a bench and they can talk. They prefer that to working on machines by themselves, when they cannot chat to their neighbours. I am not saying that it is a good thing to have prisoners sewing mailbags by hand, but, until we have more workshop space and room for more machines, this kind of thing must continue.<br/>
I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Maid-stone, whose speech I very much appreciated, that I set great store by the work of my Advisory Council on Employment for Prisoners under the chairmanship of Sir Wilfrid Anson, who takes a great interest in the subject. I ask


my hon. Friend to believe that the real difficulty at present is not the shortage of work for prisoners to do, but the shortage of space in which they can do it.<br/>
The hon. Lady the Member for Leeds, South-East asked about the building of remand centres. I am glad to say that in addition to the Ashford remand centre which is open, and which I have visited, we have six remand centres under construction and two more out for tender, so that we have a programme of nine altogether which will be coming into operation from next year onwards.<br/>
The hon. Lady referred to the hostel scheme. A case which is now <i>sub judice</i> brought the hostel scheme into prominence. Neither I nor any hon. Member can say anything about that case. But I wish to impress on the House that I set great store by the hostel system. I do not think that we should be deterred from carrying on with it. We should be seeking to perfect it all the time and if defects become apparent, we should seek to put those defects right.<br/>
The hostel scheme operates for men sentenced to terms of imprisonment of more than four years. These people will find it very difficult to stand on their own feet when they come out of prison unless they have some transitional experience. On a certain date they will come out of prison and be free to go straight or to commit crime and nobody can exercise control over them. The idea of the hostel system is that between six months and nine months before the date when, after many years in prison, they will be released, they shall do work for outside employers but live in a hostel. They are subjected thereby to far closer after-care than prisoners discharged in the normal way. I am glad to say that of the prisoners who came out of hostels up to 31st December, 1961, 86 per cent. had not been reconvicted by the end of 1962. I am not saying that is a perfect record, but I am sure that the facts show this to be an experiment which we should not set aside.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leeds, South-East asked about the use of the restraint jacket. That matter was dealt with by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) in reply to an Adjournment debate recently. The essential point is that

we cannot use sedatives to restrain prisoners without their consent. This situation does not arise in respect of mental hospitals, which deal with statutory patients. There, the position is quite different. I can assure the hon. Lady that restraint jackets are used as little as possible.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Gardner) asked whether we could get rid of the slopping-out system as quickly as possible. I wish that we could. But the problem is a practical one. It would be quite impossible to provide water closets in the cells in the old prisons. The point of policy was carefully considered when the new prison building programme began. But it was decided not to provide lavatories in the cells in the new prisons. one reason being that it did not seem desirable to provide them in rooms to be used throughout their sentence by prisoners as bedrooms. Nobody wants to sleep in water closets.<br/>
I understand that the Swedes put water closets in the cells in some of their new prisons and decided to take them out again as a result of experience. We certainly are not accepting the slopping-out system as something which is ideal and which should remain for all time. In many ways it is disgusting, but there are real practical difficulties in finding a better alternative.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Billericay also referred to crime among young girls. Crime among young girls, although it has greatly increased, is far less than crime among young boys of a comparable age. I think that my hon. and learned Friend had in mind, when he spoke of classifying arrangements, classifying arrangements for approved schools rather than for prisons. It is my policy to keep girls under 21 out of prison altogether. That is one reason why we have opened a detention centre at Moor Court, in Staffordshire. Our reward for that was that we were immediately attacked in the Press on the ground that detention centres are not suitable for girls, but they are more suitable than prisons. I hope that I shall have the support of the House for this policy.<br/>
I turn to the speech of the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Grey). I should like to say how much I appreciate his


action in having gone to visit the prison in his constituency immediately after the reference was made to it in this House last week. I repeat that if hon. Members will visit prisons when they have an opportunity and, if they think fit, let me know afterwards&#x2014;formally or informally&#x2014;the impression that the prisons make on them, they will be performing a public service, not just to me but to the prison service. I am quite sure that it is right that there should be as many visits as possible by responsible people and I and other Home Office Ministers are seeking to act in that way.<br/>
The hon. Member mentioned the speech of the hon. Lady the Member for Liverpool, Exchange (Mrs. Braddock). I noticed her remark last week saying that there were five prison officers at Durham who had been involved in an inquiry concerning Liverpool Prison and who were now in Durham Prison. I have taken some pains to go into the facts. The facts are that there are nine prison officers at Durham Prison who, at one time or another, served at Liverpool. Of those nine, live were not at Liverpool at the time of the events which were the subject of the inquiry and not one of the other four was among the prison officers referred to in the Liverpool inquiry.<br/>
I certainly think that the allegations which have been made from various quarters about events in Durham Prison deserve investigation. Durham is not a prison from which complaints and adverse reports have been coming in; there is no reason to think that it has a bad record of any sort. But serious allegations have been made and I have decided that an inquiry into these allegations is necessary.<br/>
I have considered what form that inquiry should take, because I take the hon. Member's point that it should not be carried out by the Prison Commissioners and I have reached this decision: I am going to act in accordance with Rule 194 of the Prison Rules. I am calling on the visiting committee of Durham Prison&#x2014;as the House knows, a visiting committee is an independent committee of justices, quite independent of the prison, the Prison Commissioners and the Home Secretary&#x2014;to arrange for an inquiry to be held and a report to be made to me. When I receive that report I shall, naturally, con-

sider whether it is a report which t can publish.<br/>
I was anxious to have the opportunity of making that statement tonight because I do not think that allegations of this sort should be bandied about and certainly not made on television without their being taken seriously and without a full and proper inquiry being made by independent people into the facts underlying them.<br/>
Meanwhile, may my last words be that I would beg nobody lightly to say anything which will cast slurs on the prison service as a whole. No doubt there are "bad eggs" in the prison service&#x2014;there are "bad eggs" wherever one looks&#x2014;but, in general, the prison service consists of devoted people who are doing their very best according to their lights. We ought to be thankful that there are more and more men who are willing&#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Undertaking between the Secretary of State for Scotland and Messrs. Bremner and Company, Shipowners, a draft of which was laid before this House on 7th March. be approved.</q>
This draft Undertaking is a small measure from the financial point of view and follows very closely Undertakings that have been debated on earlier occasions, but, as I know that the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) will agree, it is a matter of considerable importance to the area concerned. It deals with the sea transport services to the south Isles of Orkney&#x2014;Hoy, Hotta, Fara and Graemsay, which lie to the south and west of Scapa Flow. The services run between these islands to the mainland piers of Orkney. at Stromness and at Scapa.<br/>
The company which operates this service, Messrs. Bremner and Company of Stromness, is well-established and well-known in the islands. It is a small private company with two working partners. It has been operating there since before the war, and has been assisted by the Scottish Office since 1947 when a contribution was made under the Congested Districts (Scotland) Act powers to supplement the Post. Office mail contract. During 1957 things became rather difficult for the company when its old ship the "Orcadia" had to be scrapped and at the same time the naval base at Scapa closed down. This removed a considerable part of the company's revenue at a time when it faced considerable capital expenditure in providing a new vessel.<br/>
The service obviously had to continue. As this was before the Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act, 1960. had been passed, arrangements were made for the Admiralty to charter to the company its motor fishing vessel "Hoy Head", and the Scottish Office agreed to meet the company's losses on this ship, using the powers of the Secretary of State under the Congested Districts (Scotland) Act, 1897.<br/>
This arrangement got over the immediate difficulties, but the "Hoy


Head", after adaptation to carry passengers and freight, was suitable to carry only 36 passengers. This was adequate for most of the year but not for the summer tourist season. To cope with the summer increase and to provide a relief vessel during surveys it was decided that a second ship must be obtained. The Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act was by then on the Statute Book and in 1961 the Secretary of State was able to acquire and charter to the company a second vessel, the "Watchful" which can carry 91 passengers and therefore, with the "Hoy Head" is adequate to cope with summer traffic. The Watchful" is not normally used in winter except when she replaces the "Hoy Head" while that ship is undergoing survey. It has also been found useful to use her for similar purposes in the North Isles of Orkney.<br/>
When the original arrangements were made with the company in 1957 it was thought that the cost to the Exchequer would be about &#x00A3;5,000 to &#x00A3;6,000, and so it was. Since 1961, however, finances have been more difficult. Wages and other costs have risen and have not been covered by increased charges. Moreover, the second vessel, the "Watchful", has added to the costs. Subsequently, the company's financial returns for 1961, unexpected repairs to the Hoy Head ", and a poor summer season for the "Watchful" in 1962, made it clear by the latter part of last year that payments in 1962&#x2013;63 would have to be in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;13,000.<br/>
New arrangements were obviously needed, and, rather than continuing to use the powers of the Congested Districts (Scotland) Act of 1897, it was obviously better to bring these arrangements into line with arrangements made for the other islands under the 1960 Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act. As the House knows, however, Section 2 (3) of the 1960 Act provides that the Secretary of State cannot make advances totalling more than &#x00A3;10,000 in any one financial year to any person, except in accordance with an Undertaking, a draft of which has been laid before Parliament and approved by a Resolution of this House. That is what we are now asking the House to do.<br/>
This draft Undertaking brings the arrangements with Messrs. Bremner into

line with the other agreements that have been concluded under the 1960 Act. It will enable the Secretary of State to meet the company's needs for assistance over &#x00A3;10,000 in the current financial year and, if necessary, in subsequent years. The Undertaking, of course, has been under discussion with the company since last year, and there have been negotiations. The Undertaking follows broadly the same lines as the agreements with David MacBrayne Limited and with the Orkney Islands Shipping Company Limited, which the House approved on 11th December, 1961. Therefore, perhaps I need not detain the House by saying very much about the detailed provisions since they repeat in effect what the House has already discussed and approved in the other agreements.<br/>
I shall not summarise the Clauses unless the House wishes me to do so, except to make a brief reference to Clause 12 which provides an incentive to efficiency. There is a variation here, not in the form but in the proportions. The arrangements are the same as for MacBraynes, but hon. Members will see from the Undertaking that if losses turn out to be higher or lower than estimated, the difference is to be shared between the company and the Secretary of State in the proportion of 25 per cent./75 per cent. If I remember correctly, the proportion in the case of MacBraynes is 50 per cent./50 per cent.<br/>
These proportions have been taken because obviously in a very small company like this a higher loss might be crippling. For the same reason, a maximum ceiling and floor is set at &#x00A3;1,000. Above this sum all losses are borne by the Secretary of State and all profits are taken by him. This looks complicated, but it amounts to this, that if the company does better than expected, it may earn up to an extra &#x00A3;250 and if it does not it stands to lose up to the same amount. If the company went on making extra losses or extra profits year after year, it would show that there was something wrong with the original estimates, and Clause 12 (2) provides that if similar results are shown in two consecutive years a recalculation shall be made in the grant.<br/>
I hope that what I have said gives a sufficiently clear account of this small


measure to enable the House to approve it and to enable the Secretary of State to continue this new form of assistance which successive Governments have given to this company.</p>

<p>Regarding the proportion of 75 per cent. and the limit of &#x00A3;1,000 above which the loss is met by the Secretary of State, is there any ceiling limit over that sum of &#x00A3;1,000? Could it go to &#x00A3;3,000?</p>

<p>I thank the Under-Secretary of State for this draft Undertaking and also for the way in which he has introduced it.<br/>
My constituents are grateful for the help advanced to these services. As the Under-Secretary said, they are important in that they are the only means of transport for passengers and most freight up and down the Scapa Flow. They are, therefore, the equivalent of, and as importan: as, roads on the mainland.<br/>
In passing, to allay any fears of hon. Members, and possibly in particular of the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), this is a very limited operation. The figures in question are small and, I think, can be estimated with a fair degree of certainty.</p>

<p>I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says. I should, first of all, like to say that, grateful as we are for this help, it seems to me that the whole situation underlines once again the lack of any strategy, so to speak, for services in the Highlands or, indeed, Highland development. One of the troubles of these services is that the population in the area is falling and so is trade. One reason why we are having this draft Undertaking is that losses have increased owing to a rundown to some extent in trade in the area.<br/>
I am afraid that this is a situation which can be paralleled in many parts of the Highlands, and what we need is an

overall policy to reverse this spiral of falling population and falling trade with the consequent need for more assistance to build them up.<br/>
This service consists of two vessels. As the hon. Gentleman said, one of these, the "Hoy Head", has passenger accommodation, but it is extremely limited because only about fifteen passengers can get under cover on the boat. Having made frequent trips in it, which I have much enjoyed, I cannot say that it is of transatlantic standards. In fact, there is close competition between the oil drums and the passengers on the deck. The other vessel is slow. I do not complain about this situation, but these vessels will not go on for ever, and, unless some general upthrust can be given to the area, we shall be in difficulties in future. There are also difficulties about piers. This is another common difficulty in Highland development. We may improve the services, but unless we have adequate piers we shall not meet the whole difficulty.<br/>
The service is run primarily by two partners, and, lest the House feels that they are being unduly generously treated, I should point out that they get a very small management fee&#x2014;I think that the Under-Secretary of State will confirm that&#x2014;and undertake a good deal of the work themselves. This is not an operation which is conducted by two wealthy men in striped trousers sitting in an office. They do their best to run the concern efficiently and to give service in conditions which are not always easy and with boats which are licensed only for work within the Flow or to and fro between the mainland of Orkney and the inner islands. There is a slight difficulty here, because the Under-Secretary of State mentioned the possibility of using these boats between some of the northern islands of Orkney, but they could be used only between Kirkwall and the nearer Northern Isles because I do not think the Board of Trade would permit them to go far out. They are therefore confined to this service, which handicaps their profitability.<br/>
I am grateful for what the Government have done. I hope that the time will come when they review the whole situation in the Highlands again, but meantime I hope that this will ensure that


my constituents will be able to travel between the islands on their lawful purposes and to continue their trade.</p>

<p>There was almost an air of abashment and shame about the Under-Secretary of State when, after hearing the large sums involved in the Estimates which we have just passed, he dealt with a matter which means life or death to the economy of a part of Scotland involving an annual cost of about &#x00A3;13,000. I remember the long debates we had on the Highlands and Islands Bill in the Scottish Committee and our determination to ensure that Parliament carried out its function of scrutinising expenditure. We wished to be sure not only about the wisdom of that expenditure but that the spirit of the Bill would be carried through.<br/>
I do not know whether the spirit of the Bill, now that it is an Act, is carried through. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) has been a very considerable benefactor from it. He has been able on two occasions to indulge his occasional passion for nationalisation because the other company which links the Northern Isles is one of the instruments of the Secretary of State. I refer to the North Orkney company which replaced the steam navigation company, which is financed by the Secretary of State. We are here once again dealing with the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, but this time with the South Isles. I do not think that anyone would object to this. One appreciates the difficulties in this part of Scotland and that what the Government propose here is absolutely essential. I only regret that we do not always have a similar enlightened policy in other parts of Scotland. I would even think that the Liberal Party could have extended its occasional generosity in this connection when it voted for the Second Reading of the Transport Bill.<br/>
The Undertaking is an interesting one. It is not exactly the same as the MacBrayne one&#x2014;far from it. There is a curious definition of how long it will run. Its term is five years from 1st April, 1962&#x2014;the Under-Secretary got it in just in time to cover this year&#x2014;and it is terminable with three months' notice on each side, either before or after the

terminable date, strangely enough. It seems to be able to perpetuate itself beyond 31st March, 1967. I do not know whether this was one of the flaws in the Undertaking. There are some considerable flaws in it. I do not know whether we will get another apology from the Secretary of State before we have finished, but it is worth noticing that one or two things need to be explained.<br/>
The financial commitment appears to be the annual grant and, of course, the management fee, of which the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland has spoken. At one time, the figure was running at between &#x00A3;5,000 and &#x00A3;6,000; now it is going up to &#x00A3;13,000. Then there is the revaluation and allocation of any additional loss or unexpected surplus. We can ignore that one for the moment. The company is, however, liable to gain anything up to &#x00A3;250 or to lose anything up to a similar figure, but any loss over that sum, no matter how big, will be borne by the Secretary of State, who, equally, will derive the benefit of any greater surplus.<br/>
The approved capital expenditure, which is to be met by grant, is to cover the possibility of further chartering. I was surprised to hear the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland speak about the difficulties of one of the ships which was rather slow. My impression is that power already exists in the Undertaking for the Secretary of State to replace the ship by a better one if he sees fit. There is no need for a further undertaking or for the Government to seek further powers for that purpose.<br/>
In paragraph 12 (3), there is a financial commitment outside the other commitments in respect of the survey costs. Have the Government anything in mind in respect of this capital expenditure? I notice from the Estimates for next year that capital expenditure in respect of Highlands and Islands shipping is rising from about &#x00A3;450,000 to &#x00A3;1,100,000, although it is fair to state that the figure is as low as &#x00A3;450,000 because the Government failed to spend &#x00A3;212,000 on the replacement of ships. That is an interesting comment in view of the state of our shipbuilding industry. The Government were late in placing the orders. I wonder whether that figure includes any capital expenditure for this service. It may well be that the justified complaints


of the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland could be met within this figure.<br/>
Considerable interference will be caused to the freedom of Bremner and Company, because the Secretary of State now has furl power over the approved services. Incidentally, I should like to know from the Under-Secretary what are the services outwith the approved services which are not covered. It appears from the Undertaking that if the company decided to alter or to add to its existing services, as apart from approved services, it must tell the Secretary of State, who, in the light of what the Company proposes to do, could decide to take those services within the approved services. The company is, therefore, carrying on other services quite apart from the approved services.<br/>
The company can introduce any additional service or alter any service without the written approval of the Secretary of State, but it requires the written authority of the Secretary of State to discontinue any service. If he decides that a new or additional service is required, then he can order it. Here is a wonderful field for Questions by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Orkney and Shetland to ensure that his area is properly looked after, although at the present rate of progress he will have to wait a couple of months before he gets the Secretary of State's reply&#x2014;and then he can depend on it that he will not get the Secretary of State: he will get an Under-Secretary.<br/>
There is freedom, I notice, to experiment with excursions and temporary services without giving prior notice to the Secretary of State so long as they do not last more. than six months&#x2014;a wonderful dispensation from the Secretary of State's generosity.<br/>
Another point which I think important is one which was stressed at the time when the Bill went through, and that is that if this is to mean anything at all. then the Secretary of State has got to exercise his powers in respect of fares and rates, passenger fares and freight rates, in the spirit of the Act. There was an Amendment put down by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) and accepted by the Government so that under all these agreements any fares or freight rates would be fixed by

three criteria, the general level of other transport charges&#x2014;whatever that may mean in the light of the situation as we know it in the Orkneys&#x2014;the amount of the grant, and thirdly the effect on the economy of the area.<br/>
I sincerely hope that it will be such within its limited scope as to do nothing to further the serious decline which has taken place both in trade and in population over the past years&#x2014;since long before ten years ago&#x2014;in Stromness which is in the centre of this area and which probably was as heavily populated as Kirkwall but has declined over the century, as also there are islands which have become more or less depopulated.<br/>
So I hope that the Secretary of State will interpret this Undertaking in the spirit Parliament intended. I hope he will use it properly, and use his authority, if necessary, to bring fares down and to encourage experiments with services to enable this to be done. I would think that in certain areas there is a case for no freight charges at all. I think Parliament had better face this, and I think it will face it, considering the kind of thing for which we have already voted money today. With all due respect, if we vote &#x00A3;350,000 for something which is culturally desirable but which is not, as this is, a matter of life and death for certain people, then when the matter is one of life and death we have got to give it at least the same financial priority, and the Secretary of State should not be afraid to face that.<br/>
There is one very important question I want to come to. What goes on in these islands, and what is related to this? We have got this strange and mysterious phrase appearing in this Undertaking:
<q>If the Contractors shall at any time during the continuance of this Undertaking after receiving not less than two weeks' notice in writing from the Secretary of State unreasonably refuse or neglect to maintain any of the Approved Societies &#x2026;</q>
What are the approved societies doing in this? The Under-Secretary of State wil find those words on the last page of the agreement. How did the Secretary of State manage to get approved societies into this Undertaking related to approved services of Bremner and Sons? I do not know.<br/>
The Secretary of State does so many strange things and he has got so many


strange powers&#x2014;unknown to the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Sir G. Nabarro). He has got the power to own ships, he has the power to buy ships, he has power to build ships, power to run ships and power to charter ships. He is assuming strange powers and it would be interesting to know what these "societies" really are. If they are approved, then who approved them and what does it all mean?<br/>
I hope that we shall get an adequate explanation of this. We may even get an apology. I do know how this affects the validity of the Undertaking or whether or not a new Undertaking will be necessary. I have no doubt that the Secretary of State will tell us that this is another of his celebrated misprints. Be that as it may, someone in the Scottish Office should make it his business to ensure that this kind of error does not creep in. It could easily lead to misunderstanding.<br/>
I have one other, more specific matter to raise concerning another variation. This Undertaking in respect of David MacBrayne Ltd. and the Orkney Islands Shipping Company Ltd. contained a clause stating what would happen in the event of hostilities. Evidently we have decided in 1963 that there are not likely to be any hostilities because, it appears, the clause "In the event of hostilities" has disappeared. Such words appeared in the past, and I should like to know why they are not now inserted. It may be that the fact that the whole matter can be terminated at any time within three months enables the Government to dispense with such words.<br/>
On the whole, my hon. Friends and I welcome the Undertaking and the fact that it regularises something that is carried on rather fitfully. It is beneficial to the islands concerned and is of value to the inhabitants there, their trade and farming traffic, and is helpful to tourism. Although it could have been made even more helpful, we certainly will not vote against it tonight.</p>

<p>I would like to begin by referring to the last remarks of the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross), about societies. I congratulate him on his proof readiing. I certainly

would not have made a good proof reader, because I read this document with considerable care and did not spot that one. It is, as he said, a misprint for "services".<br/>
The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) asked about our general strategy, while the hon. Member for Kilmarnock asked about the dates and duration of the Agreement. It is of a relatively short duration, for five years, and we do not know if this pattern of service will be developed very far in the future. As can be seen&#x2014;in view of changes or developments which might take place&#x2014;there is the three months possibility of terminating the Agreement. The sort of thing one might consider is the Orkney Islands Shipping Company Ltd. experimenting with a hydrofoil. Such an innovation or improvement could be brought in with reasonable expedition.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland also mentioned piers. He will appreciate that substantial improvements have been agreed to for the Longhope Pier and it is hoped that work will start before long. About &#x00A3;34,000 is involved in this. Regarding the management fee, as the right hon. Member rightly surmised, that is not a very great sum, &#x00A3;1,000 and, in addition, one of the working partners will get a salary relating to certain stevedoring work which he takes on.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock asked about replacements. This is covered by the 1960 Act and does not come within the Undertaking. The large increased sums he referred to in the Estimates relate mainly to the three ships building for MacBrayne's. We do not envisage anything very large on these services.<br/>
I do not think that there is any other major point. In general, the tone of the debate has been to welcome this very small agreement and an acceptance that it is flexible enough to take account of any improvements in the services that may become possible to meet the needs of this area.</p>

<p>Last Christmas Eve there was a serious bus accident in St. Helena, as a result of which 10 people were injured, six of them seriously and four moderately. Later the same night one of the injured persons died. Before I deal with the aftermath of the accident, perhaps it would help if I gave some details about the island and the medical services there.<br/>
The island is small, having an area of 47 square miles and a population of just under 5,000. It is one of the remotest of British Colonies, being 4,500 miles from this country and 1,140 miles from the nearest point on the African Continent. It is made the more remote because there is no airfield and ships call there only infrequently.<br/>
However, there are compensating factors. It is a very attractive island, with one of the best climates in the world, and the inhabitants are very pleasant people. They are of mixed European, African, Indian and Chinese descent, but they are English-speaking and they try and live as far as they can on a European standard.<br/>
The St. Helenians have great loyalty to this country, and we have a very special kind of responsibility towards them. This is because Britain was responsible for populating the island. It was of vital importance to us, before the Suez Canal was opened, as a watering and victualling station. Now it is unimportant, but since we created its community we have a special responsibility towards it.<br/>
I turn now to the medical services. Since August last there has only been one doctor on the island. He is Dr. John Noakes. There is provision in the establishment for two doctors, but when this accident occurred Dr. Noakes had been working on the island alone for over four months. The doctor who left in August had given six months' notice.<br/>
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will be good enough to say what steps were taken by his Department to

fill this vacancy, of which it knew in February, 1962. My information is that insufficient steps were taken and that advertisements appeased in the medical journals only two or three times. Be that as it may, Dr. Noakes was left with a practice of nearly 5,000 people on this island, together with a 58-bed hospital to look after,<br/>
A general practitioner in this country has an average of 2,500 patients on his list and also has the hospital services, with consultants, and so on, behind him. To assist him on St. Helena, Dr. Noakes had a matron, Miss Grace Sim, the first St. Helenian to qualify as a State-registered nurse. Matron Sim is a first-class nurse and has been a tower of strength during the recent emergency. To give some idea of the hospital side of Dr. Noakes' work, in 1962 there were 755 in-patients at the hospital. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will be able to tell the House what qualified staff is in St. Helena at present, apart from Matron Sim.<br/>
Before I come to the accident itself, I want to deal briefly with the question of drugs. The House will recall that a United States aircraft from Ascension Island and a United States vessel took certain essential drugs and medical supplies to St. Helena immediately after the accident. In his Answer to my Question on 26th February, the Under-Secretary gave details of the drugs which were taken, and I am informed that they were largely drugs which should be in ample supply in St. Helena in case of emergency, for example, streptomycin and anti-tetanus serum.<br/>
Can the Under-Secretary say whether the drugs were in stock in Ascension Island, 700 miles away and, if so, how did they come to be in stock in Ascension Island, with a population of fewer than 300, and not available on St. Helena with a population of nearly 5,000?<br/>
On my return from St. Helena in the summer of 1958, I wrote a report for the Colonial Office, and in paragraph 30 these words appear:
<q>There is a serious shortage of drugs in stock. Neither does the money provided enable this shortage to be remedied. &#x2026; It is quite extraordinary that this shortage should be permitted to continue on a remote Island where the possibility of obtaining additional supplies presents obvious difficulties.</q>


Shortly before my visit, a man died from tetanus because of the lack at that time of anti-tetanus serum.<br/>
Drugs on St. Helena have to be bought on a very tight budget. I do not know what this year's estimate is, but that for 1958, when I was there, was &#x00A3;1,200 for a population of 5,000. On this occasion, I am informed, the letter of order was sent by the medical officer for St. Helena, Dr. Noakes, to the Government of St. Helena, at the Castle, in Jamestown, but was put on one side because it was a holiday period, with the result that the next boat was missed. If this is true, it seems to be a very serious matter, because it is because the stocks were low when the accident occured that additional drugs had to be brought from Ascension Island.<br/>
I now come to the accident on Christ. mas Eve. It was this which presented Dr. Noakes and Matron Sim with a fearful problem which they tackled with success and great courage. Dr. Noakes had to attend to his normal work during the day with frequent calls at the hospital and to stay at the hospital all night keeping the injured people alive. One operation took him 12&#x00BD; hours. He kept them alive by intravenous therapy and antibiotics. There being no anaesthetist on the island, he used a local anaesthetic. As there is no blood bank, he had to obtain blood donors from the street, and the House can imagine the difficulty of cross-matching blood in those circumstances. In all this he was helped by Matron Sim and assistant nurses and neither he nor Matron Sim had a wink of sleep day or night for more than seven days. This joint effort by a British doctor and a St. Helenian nurse is deserving of the highest praise.<br/>
I now turn to a matter upon which I should like the Under-Secretary's comment. After the accident occurred, the medical officer reported it to the Governor. The Governor called at the hospital on Christmas Day, but did not go to see the patients themselves. I understand that the medical officer told the Governor that he needed help, which, in any event, was perfectly obvious, but that the Governor did not report the accident for seven days. I believe that the cable reporting it arrived in the Colonial Office on 31st December. Will the Under-Secretary confirm whether that

is true? If it is, why did the Governor take seven days to report the accident and to ask for surgical assistance?<br/>
I want to pay this tribute to the Colonial Office: when the accident was reported, it lost no time in taking the necessary action. Dr. R. P. Boggon, of St. Thomas's Hospital, was flown to Ascension Island and then taken by sea to St. Helena and was there by 5th January, which I understand to be a record journey from this country to St. Helena. But he did not arrive until 13 days after the accident occurred. He was then able to relieve Dr. Noakes of some of the strain which he had been suffering.<br/>
I am not at all happy about the way in which St. Helena is being administered. I am not satisfied that suitable officials are sent there. It is a small place and it is not regarded as important. It is remote and, therefore, officials can act in a slack and incompetent way, because by the time news filters through to this country it is diluted and stale. If this is true, it is very serious, because St. Helena is nothing more nor less than a microcosm of Victorian imperialism at its worst.<br/>
It is common knowledge on the island that the wife of one of the senior British officials who heard of the accident during a Christmas Day party was heard to say, "I am sorry for the so and so's; they have lost a good cook". That is the worst possible attitude for a British official to take in this day and age. Very little is needed to make St. Helena a very happy community. I hope that some effort will now be made to improve matters. I should have thought that the Colonial Office would have wished to nurse St. Helena carefully, ready for the time in the not too far distant future when she will be the only responsibility left to the Colonial Office.<br/>
There are some other matters which I want to mention. I shall try to summarise them in very brief questions. First, &#x00A3;500 per annum is allowed for the purchase of food at the hospital regardless of the number of patients there. Why is this? Should not the budget be elastic to meet the requirements from week to week and month to month? Secondly, what provision has been made


to provide better housing in St. Helena? When t was there, hundreds of the inhabitants were living in the most appalling hovels. They wanted better houses, and I should be glad if the Under-Secretary will say what progress is being made in providing adequate housing conditions for the people. Thirdly, what are the employment prospects there? This is one island where unemployment is consistently high. Can the Under-Secretary say how much on average is paid out in poor relief, which is their equivalent to unemployment benefit in this country?<br/>
What is the present position with regard to assisting those who wish to emigrate to this country? The young St. Helenian wants to come to this country either to live or to obtain some suitable training, because the outlet which he used to have to South Africa has been closed to him by the policy of <i>apartheid</i> there. The St. Helenian is a proud and independent person and no longer looks to South Africa. Can the Under-Secretary say what assurance is given to the young St. Helenian to emigrate to this country and to those who are suitable for various types of training to come to this country to train for various callings and professions? Many difficult problems remain to be solved in this small island, and they can be solved with a little effort and good will on the part of the Colonial Office. I hope that the Under-Secretary and his right hon. Friend will take the necessary steps to help this island and its charming people to overcome their problems.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to the hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes) for raising this matter in the House. We have all too little opportunity, I always think, to debate the problems of the smaller and more remote Colonial Territories, and especially those places like St. Helena, which are very difficult for hon. Members or Ministers to visit; I believe the hon. Gentleman is perhaps the only Member of this House who has ever been to St. Helena. I am conscious of the fact that his background knowledge about the island, obtained from his own personal experience, is rather preferable to mine, which is based simply on Colonial Office

files, which I am afraid are sometimes rather impersonal.<br/>
The islanders of St. Helena ought to be very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the great interest he has consistently shown in their welfare since he visited the Colony. It is for this reason, particularly, that I take very seriously any criticisms that he has felt obliged to make tonight, because I know perfectly well that they are not actuated by any party political motives, or anything of that sort, but are actuated by his sincere anxiety for, and interest in, St. Helena.<br/>
Indeed, his report following his visit there in 1958 was of great value to the Colonial Office, and I am glad to say that we have since been able to take up some of the points he made in it, the most important of which have been the subsidising of the flax industry and the introduction of elected members to the Advisory Council.<br/>
This evening the hon. Gentleman has concentrated mainly on the serious motor accident on St. Helena on Christmas Eve, and on various criticisms that arose from it. The information that I have confirms that the senior medical officer, Dr. Noakes, the matron, Miss Sim, and the nursing staff, only two of whom are fully qualified over and above the doctor and the matron, did an extremely fine job under very difficult circumstances indeed.<br/>
Nine people were seriously injured in this accident. Many of them had multiple injuries, including fractures, one leg amputation, broken skulls, and so on. There is no doubt that the emergency placed a great strain on Dr. Noakes, and I think that the hon. Gentleman is right in saying that there should always be two doctors working on St. Helena. This is, of course, the normal practice, except for leave periods.<br/>
I am very much concerned indeed about the gap of six months between the departure of the second medical officer and the arrival of his successor. I understand that there were genuine difficulties in recruiting a replacement, and indeed there is almost always bound to be difficulty in recruiting people for these smaller and more remote territories. In this case there was an added delay because the candidate who was first elected unfortunately fell through at the last minute and the whole process had to begin all over again. As


the hon. Gentleman knows, the Department of Technical Co-operation advertised this post on several occasions in medical journals over a period of several months. and it was also advertised in South Africa.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman criticised the Governor for not notifying us in London of the need for an extra doctor to help cope with the emergency until a week after the accident happened. As the House knows, there is a convention, and a good one, in this House that Ministers should always defend Governors, and this, therefore, one would wish to do anyway. But quite apart from that, in this case I wish to defend the Governor simply on the facts, which I think speak for themselves, and they are these: the accident occurred on the night of Christmas Eve. The Governor visited the hospital on the morning of Christmas Day, the 25th, and discussed the whole situation with the Senior Medical Officer. As Dr. Noakes obviously had a great deal on his plate, so to speak, at that moment, the Governor told him that he would not interfere with his work, or his rest&#x2014;if he had had no rest&#x2014;by paying frequent visits to the hospital, but would be available at any time if his help was needed in any way, and that Dr. Noakes must not hesitate to keep in touch with him. No requests were made from the hospital except for extra drugs which were supplied by air drop. The Governor was ready to see the patients himself, but he did not do so because he understood that they were too ill to be seen by outside people. In the meantime the hospital was visited from time to time by the Government Secretary.<br/>
On the evening of the 29th the Governor himself went to the hospital again and came to the conclusion, without any request from Dr. Noakes, that a relief doctor was needed. That was not so much to help the injured, because that crisis had already been resolved; it was really to help Dr. Noakes, who had been under very great strain and was clearly in need of a rest. The Governor then first tried to get a doctor from Ascension Island, because that was obviously the easiest and quickest source of help. This is a sad story. Normally there are two medical officers on Ascension, but it so happened that one had just gone to the United States for the New Year. He had just left as the request

came in. It was then that the Governor approached us and, as the hon. Member kindly said, we got someone there rather quickly.<br/>
I hope that it will be clear to the House from what I have said that the relief doctor was called for as soon as it became apparent to the Governor that help was needed. I must point out that although the strain upon the senior medical officer had been great, the fact is that, much to his credit, he got through this crisis. I have heard no corn-plaint that any patient was deprived of necessary treatment&#x2014;and certainly no one died as a result of lack of attention. So no irreparable damage was done. The damage consisted of the great strain that Dr. Noakes was under during that period.<br/>
I should like to take this opportunity&#x2014;because it is only fair to the Governor to do so&#x2014;of saying that I have been impressed not only from reading Colonial Office files but also from other sources of information that I have had from the island, by the fact that the Governor has had a great deal of success in establishing very good relations with the islanders, including both the flax exporters and the General Workers' Union. I want to pay that tribute to him.<br/>
The hon. Member also referred to the question of drugs. The senior medical officer had foreseen that supplies of drugs and dressings might need replenishing at about the end of the year, and had indented to us for them. They should have arrived on the pre-Christmas mail ship, but they did not. There is really no excuse for this. I think it is better to be frank with the House. I do not like Ministers to make excuses when there are no excuses to make. They were simply omitted from the assignment. I can only ask the House to accept my apologies for what might have been a very serious omission.<br/>
In fact, despite the extra demands resulting from the accident, there was never an actual shortage of drugs, because the Americans&#x2014;to whom I have already expressed my gratitude in the House&#x2014;arranged for an air-drop of essential supplies within twenty-four hours. We are greatly in their debt for this very prompt assistance, and also for flying out the relief doctor to Ascension and then bringing him on by boat to St. Helena.<br/>
I hope that that covers most of the points raised by the hon. Member arising from the accident.<br/>
I quite agree that there is some very bad housing, from what I have been told, especially in Jamestown, but the Government are trying to improve it. In 1960 they set up a Housing Committee&#x2014;which was a new body&#x2014;consisting of the superintendent of works, councillors from each district, and a social welfare officer. The Committee did a very good job and advised on housing problems. In the past ten years the Government have built 39 houses, mostly from colonial development and welfare funds and are at present building 18 detached cottages in Jamestown. As the hon. Member knows, the Government make loans to house-owners for repairs and, in some cases, make free grants of material and labour, or they issue material at cost price. They are trying, but the housing picture is not all that good.<br/>
I now turn to the question of employment. According to my latest information, about 180 men are now unemployed on St. Helena, which is the lowest for a long time, mainly due to the re-opening of three mills. That has been a great help. In addition, 30 per cent. of the men on relief are older people whom it would have been difficult to employ in any case, and about 10 per cent. are only temporarily stopped&#x2014;being between jobs, as it were. Over the past five years about &#x00A3;275,000 of C.D. and W. money has been spent, and this year &#x00A3;58,000 of this money will be spent. That does not sound very much. But it is quite good <i>per capita</i> by any standards and means that C.D. and W. funds have been spent at the rate of &#x00A3;45 per head over the last five years and &#x00A3;100 per head per annum given in grant aid. I was rather encouraged by a letter from the Governor, who said that this was one of the occasions where C.D. and W. help was really noticeable. The projects had provided for the needs of the people. and there was no one who did not daily get some direct benefit from them. One likes to think that the money voted by this House is well spent.<br/>
The island is pretty well equipped for medical buildings and schools, and development money is being concentrated mainly on agriculture and public works, especially road building and so on. Over

the past five years &#x00A3;44,000 has been spent on public works. I must confess, I do not know whether the Treasury would consider this right, but the public works have been chosen as much for their employment potential as for the actual benefit in development terms for the island. There is now a new 10-mile road being built, and the 18 cottages which I mentioned, and there is a new scheme for a slipway at Ruperts Bay.<br/>
As an employment measure, and it is really only that, the Government guarantees the price of hemp at a level at which it is possible for the millers to continue to operate the mills and the guaranteed price level has recently been raised from &#x00A3;56 15s. to &#x00A3;68 F.O.B. St. Helena. A contract for sales below the guaranteed price made in 1962 led to the reopening of two mills, and a recent rise in the price of hemp has led to the opening of a third mill. In fact, the price of hemp is higher than it has been for several years, and this is a great help in relation to employment
The statutory Poor Relief Board pays out about &#x00A3;3,500 a year. The Government grant&#x2014;the rest comes from rates&#x2014;has been increased since the hon. Member's visit there from &#x00A3;500 to &#x00A3;2,000 a year. That board makes payments according to need. Single people may receive up to 12s. 6d. a week front the board and widows &#x00A3;1 10s. 3d. according to the number of children of school age. There is also relief work for men who are employable but unemployed. They do three days a week for 30s. at 10s. a day. There are additional grants from charitable funds in the hands of the Government, and there are food subsidies in St. Helena, Customs duties have been abolished on everything except luxuries. Money is worth substantially more than in the United Kingdom.<br/>
Emigration was another point mentioned by the hon. Member. Many young women leave the island under a private domestic agency scheme, which as the hon. Member knows, is run by a St. Helenean. The Government sponsors a scheme for men who are found jobs in the hotel industry here and pay part of their passage money if they cannot raise it themselves. I understand that thirty-two men have come here under that scheme in the last three years, but only one this year. That is because


employment prospects in the island were better, and that is a good thing.<br/>
There has been recruitment of men in St. Helena to the Army here without the necessity to come for interviews. I believe that four have taken a preliminary test in St. Helena and are due to arrive here shortly.<br/>
I hope that I have covered all the main points the hon. Member put to me. I am sorry that this is not a complete answer to St. Helena's fundamental problem which arises from her changed position on the trade routes of the world. There have been some quite marked improvements in social and economic conditions on the island since the hon. Member's visit five years ago. I realise that there i5 still much more to be done, and I am not in the least complacent about the progress we have so far made. I appreciate very much the hon. Member's interest in this Colony. It does a tremendous amount of good. I know how much it is appreciated there, and it is good for me and my office. I think it wonderful that people should go to a Colony and continue to take an interest in it thereafter. I wish that applied to all hon. Members who visit Colonies. I am quite

sure that as long as I hold this office the hon. Member will keep me up to date and up to the mark about ways in which to help this island and its people.</p>
