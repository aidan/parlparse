<p>The Department's information on this subject is mainly derived from the working of the employment exchanges and the difficulties which the exchanges may experience in filling particular vacancies. As the hon. Member will appreciate, the circumstances vary from case to case, but the principal

difficulties at present experienced (apart from those due to seasonal causes) are with regard to vacancies in certain of the most highly skilled branches of the building and engineering industries. The difficulties in the building industry are mainly in respect of bricklayers and plasterers, and, to a smaller extent, of carpenters, joiners and masons; and in the engineering industry in respect of precision workers, including fitters, turners, tool makers, tool setters and machinists.</p>

<p>Is the hon. and gallant Gentleman aware that the unions of these two trades very gravely question whether there is any shortage of labour; and, as this is a disputed point, and one does not want to have too much controversy about it, is it not due to the House that the Ministry should take some steps with the employers and the trade unions to come to some common agreement as to whether there is really a shortage of labour in skilled trades or not?</p>

<p>I am quite sure that any employer who is in need, certainly in urgent need, of skilled workmen will avail himself of every possible opportunity of getting those skilled workmen.

<p>My hon. Friend's question does not state the full circumstances which the Justices in this case had to consider, and unless those circumstances are understood they are exposed to unwarranted criticism. Hill had previously committed a much more serious theft, but instead of sending him to prison he had been bound over and placed under the supervision of a probation officer earlier this year. The present offence was a breach of the conditions of his probation, and to deal with him again under the Probation of Offenders Act would hardly have been appropriate. In these circumstances the Justices, after making arrangements for his wife to be assisted, decided that they must impose a term of imprisonment on him. After inquiry and full consideration, I have decided, without reflecting on the course which the Justices thought it their duty to adopt, that the prisoner should now be discharged.</p>

<p>My attention had not previously been called to this case. I find on inquiry that the defendant pleaded guilty to six charges including embezzlement and falsification of accounts. I understand that the Justices took a serious view of the matter, but it was represented that the defendant would have an immediate opportunity of obtaining further employment, and having regard to this the Justices decided to deal with the case by fines, and imposed fines of &#x00A3;2 on each charge and allowed three months for payment. If the sum due is not paid within the time allowed, steps will be taken to bring the defendant before the Court with a view to inquiry as to his means in accordance with the Money Payments (Justices Procedure) Act, 1935.

<p>asked the President of the Board of Education whether he is aware that certain schools in the County of Derby are prevented from availing themselves of the milk provision owing to the refusal of head teachers to arrange for supplies; and what steps the local authority should take with his approval in such cases, with a view to realising the recommendations of Circular 1443?</p>

<p>I have no information that head teachers in Derbyshire have refused to arrange for supplies of milk on payment under the milk-in-schools scheme, and I should of course regret any such refusal. The scheme, however, is a voluntary one, and requires for its efficient working the whole-hearted co-operation of all parties concerned. As regards the second part of the question, the Derbyshire local education authority exercises its powers under Section 84 of the Education Act, 1921, to supply free milk to under-nourished children, in accordance with the recommendations of Circular 1443. This has no connection with the voluntary arrangements referred to above.</p>

<p>It is not possible to give the cost of an increased rate of old age pension applicable only to non-contributory pensions. Among other reasons is the fact that a large number of contributory pensioners could satisfy the conditions for a non-contributory pension if there was anything to be gained by their so doing. The cost of increasing all pensions' to persons over 70 (or 50 in the case of blind persons) from 10s. to 15s. a week would be about &#x00A3;22,000,000 a year at the present time.</p>

<p>The Public Assistance Order, 1930, requires local authorities to prescribe dietaries for the children in homes maintained by them. These dietaries do not need my sanction, but specimen dietaries for children's homes are included in a report by the Advisory Committee on Nutrition which was circulated to local authorities in 1932.


Differences in the cost of feeding can be accounted for to some extent by such factors as the size of the home, and the proportion of occupied to unoccupied beds. Special inquiries are being made into cases in which there are wide divergencies from the average cost. I am arranging for copies of the advisory committee's report and of the costing returns to be placed in the Library.</p>

<p>The Medicine Stamp Duty is governed by a series of statutes considerably more than a century old. These Acts are in many respects out-of-date and unsuited to present day conditions and they produce a number of anomalies which makes the administration of the duty extremely difficult.

<p>As stated by the Royal Commission on Tithe Rentcharge in their report, no statistics are available showing the annual values computed according to Schedule B of the land subject to tithe rentcharge, and it is not possible to give actual figures. The Royal Commission in


their report estimated that with annuities at the rate of &#x00A3;91 11s. 2d. per &#x00A3;100 (par value) tithe rentcharge, the total annual amount which would be remitted on the basis of the excess over one-third of the Schedule B value of the land would be &#x00A3;200,000, and I see no reason to challenge that estimate. It is clear that, if the remission were increased from the excess over one-third to the excess over one-quarter of the Schedule B value, the amount of increased remission would be greater than that represented by the arithmetical proportion of one-third and one-quarter.

<p>I presume my hon.

<p>I presume that my hon. and gallant Friend refers to the agreements which affect the import facilities accorded in the United Kingdom to certain foreign agricultural and fishery products. His Majesty's Government propose to open negotiations with the countries concerned with a view to modifying these agreements. The primary object in these negotiations will be to render possible certain changes in our agricultural policy at the earliest practicable date. We intend to proceed with the negotiations as rapidly as possible as soon as the necessary preparatory work can be completed.

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
I hope I may be allowed to appeal to the Committee to bear in mind the very considerable extent to which this Bill is being and has been modified to meet the wishes of hon. Members as expressed in Committee. The Clauses relating to trespass and wages, both of which were


adopted in Committee and which appear now as Clauses 12 and 35 of the Bill, were put forward originally by private Members. Two new Clauses, one referring to the power of local authorities who maintain aerodromes, and the other to the giving of warning of obstructions near aerodromes, are put down in response to the proposals of hon. Members. Two additional Sub-sections which it is proposed to add to Clause 1 are being added in compliance with hon. Members' requests. The same remark applies to the modifications of Clause 2 which appear in my name on the Order Paper and to a new Sub-section which it is proposed to insert in Clause 4. Finally, the provisions in regard to the limitation of liability in Part III of the Bill and the Second Schedule have been modified in important respects to meet representations made in Committee.<br/>
In asking the Committee to give the Government credit for meeting hon. Members' wishes to the material extent that, I have outlined, I would also like to express my appreciation of the very great help we have received from all sides of the House during the consideration of the Bill. The Clause, a. Second Reading of which I am now moving, is moved with the object of meeting a general desire that in the interests of safety there should be some legislation to provide for the illumination of obstructions in the vicinity of aerodromes, so long as that legislation does not put the burden of the cost of illumination upon the shoulders of the owner of the obstruction. The effect of the Clause is that if any building, structure or erection is, in the judgment of the Secretary of State, dangerous either during the hours of darkness or under conditions of low visibility, to aircraft making use of a licensed aerodrome, and if the proprietor of the aerodrome cannot come to some amicable arrangement with the owner of the obstruction for the lighting of it, the Secretary of State will have power to authorise the proprietor of the aerodrome to enter and light the obstruction at the aerodrome proprietor's cost. There is also provision that if it is not possible for an amicable arrangement with regard to compensation to be reached between the two parties, the whole matter shall be referred to arbitra-

tion so that a settlement which is fair to both parties may be arrived at.<br/>
The Clause provides for the possibility of some other means than lighting for the giving of satisfactory warning of obstructions, and I think the Committee will agree that that is a wise precaution in view of possible future developments. It specifies no radius within which the obstruction must be so as to come within the compulsory lighting or warning provision, nor does it lay down any minimum requirements as to the height of the building which would make it subject to the provision. This is also a precaution which the Committee will approve, because the height of a building is not always the sole criterion and very often the situation of the obstruction is equally important. The difficulty of providing for any radius is seen now, because the international regulation for the lighting of obstructions in the vicinity of aerodromes is being amended to raise the former limit of 500 metres to 1,000 metres; and other such changes may occur in the future. It is not advisable therefore to specify any radius in the Statute. Any obstruction which is in fact dangerous to aircraft using the aerodrome and which cannot therefore, in the nature of things, be very far distant from it, will come within the terms of the Clause. In all cases in which a local authority's or statutory or public utility's building or erection is concerned, the Secretary of State Will of course consult with the appropriate Government Departments before approving an order. I hope the Committee will agree with the proposed new Clause as I think it complies with the requirements expressed by hon. Members in previous discussions.</p>

<p>I think the Committee as a whole wishes to acknowledge the degree to which the Government have met criticism at various stages of the Bill, but I want to assure the Under-Secretary that so far as the Labour party are concerned we are not completely satisfied with these words, and we reserve to ourselves still the right to express a number of views that may be regarded as of a dissentient character, and perhaps to carry certain Amendments to a Division. I rise to put two points shortly. The new Clause seems to me to be extremely involved.


We must all recognise the desirability of providing measures of safety in the case of night flying and under conditions of low visibility. The first question I ask is, in what way is it proposed to deal with the question when you have built-up areas to consider? There may not be very many such areas in the country but there are at least two near London. I refer to Croydon and Hendon, where it is not only a question of single buildings but&#x2014;</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1936-06-25a.1989.0" hansard_membership_id="11820" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20398" speakername="Sir P. SASSOON" colnum="1989" time="">
<p>This provision does not apply to Hendon or Croydon or to any aerodrome in possession of the Secretary of State. It applies only to licensed aerodromes.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1936-06-25a.1989.1" hansard_membership_id="9426" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29419" speakername="Mr. MONTAGUE" colnum="1989" time="">
<p>That, of course, takes away a good deal from the substance of my question. But in other parts of the country where licensed aerodromes exist on rising land the point is one that the Under-Secretary might consider, and he might communicate his views to the Committee upon it. Another point is this: This Clause provides very considerable penal arrangements in respect of people not carrying out its provisions. I suppose that it is retrospective so far as existing buildings are concerned? It seems to me to be rather a foolish system, rather the wrong way of going to work, to allow buildings to be put and then to provide power
<q>to execute, instal, maintain, operate and, as occasion requires, to repair and alter such works and apparatus.</q>
I do not suppose it will be possible or even desirable to have building restrictions in this Bill, but I do suggest that this method of leaving so much to the judgment of the Secretary of State ought to be modified. Could there not be some machinery for consultation with the local authorities on their building by-laws with respect to future buildings? Cannot local authorities at any rate have some idea of what principles are in the mind of the Secretary of State on this important question?</p>

<p>I want to ask one question. Under this Clause is there power to compel electricity companies to put their high tension cables underground instead of on pylons near these licensed aerodromes? At Felixstowe the other day I saw an aeroplane fly into one of these high tension wires. Has the Secretary

of State power to make electricity companies put their cables underground where there may be danger to the flying man?</p>

<p>I am sure that the Committee would desire to reciprocate the few kind words that the Under-Secretary spoke to us at the start of his speech. I think we have convinced him that he has a Bill that is really worth while, and that he has been put in charge of one of the star turns of the Session, though he may not have realised it when he first took up the Bill. I can only say that we recognise that during the Committee stage the Under-Secretary has met us on many points. While he has not entirely satisfied us, he has shown a desire to meet this side of the House that is very welcome. With regard to the point now before us, I want to carry on the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague). It is evident that when an aerodrome is laid out, unless we are very careful we shall be involved in the kind of difficulty that confronted us the other night when we had this kind of point raised on the Birmingham Corporation Bill. I suggest that there should be some clear understanding, if not in the Bill, at any rate in the administration of the Secretary of State, between the owners of licensed aerodromes and town planning authorities, because it will be a very nasty thing if a licensed aerodrome is laid out in what is now practically virgin country on the edge of some big town or city, and then, within the danger zone, buildings are allowed to be erected. I think there should be very close co-operation between the Secretary of State and the Minister of Health in this matter, that there should be some understanding between the two Departments in regard to the compensation for which the local authorities will be responsible, if they sterilise the land, or restrict its use, or in any way interfere with its free use by existing owners, and that that compensation should be borne by the proprietors of the aerodrome in whose interest the restrictions are imposed.<br/>
I can only say that I join with the hon. and gallant Member for Hertford (Sir M. Sueter) in asking that there shall be some arrangement made between the Secretary of State and the Central Elec-


tricity Board for dealing with such things as the 132,000-volt lines that are strung about the country at the present time. I am not sure of their great advantage to the public and that they may not constitute in the near future one of the most serious hindrances to the free development of aerodromes in appropriate places. There again I hope there will be the closest co-operation between the Secretary of State and the other Government Departments which have to deal with these matters. While I think the Committee ought to allow this Clause to be read a Second time, I hope we may have an assurance from the Under-Secretary of State that the co-operation to which I have referred has been considered and will remain a matter of primary interest to his Department.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may save time if I say a few words now, because it is not my intention to seek to move the Amendment which stands on the Order Paper in my name. I am not quite satisfied that the drafting of this Clause is as good as it might be. We had a declaration from the Under-Secretary of State that there should be consultation between the Secretary of State and the appropriate Ministry so far as public utilities are concerned, but I would like to make a few observations on the Clause as a whole. When we examine it, we find that it is a rather extraordinary Clause. That we should take proper precautions that people are not involved in unnecessary danger is quite fit and proper, but, it is rather an extraordinary thing that we should confer upon the proprietor of a licensed aerodrome, which is not anything of any great importance when all is said and done, the right to go to the Secretary of State, who, in turn, may authorise them to trespass on the land of all the people round about and decorate their buildings with all kinds of coloured lights that he may think fit. It is the most glaring invasion of private rights.<br/>
I remember, when we had an Electricity Bill before this House some two years ago, the amazing indignation that came from the benches opposite because there was in it a Clause enabling a local authority or an electricity undertaking to fix brackets to the walls of people's houses in order that they might have a con-

venient way of hanging the wires conveying electricity. That was thought to be an intolerable invasion of private rights, and so violent was one hon. Member opposite that in the end that Clause was knocked out as a gross invasion of the rights of private property. The Labour party, in the interests of private property, had the Clause knocked out. Here we are conferring upon a gentleman who runs an aerodrome&#x2014;the fact that it is licensed does not necessarily make it an important institution&#x2014;the right to go wandering, as the Secretary of State may authorise, all over people's property and putting up lighting fittings of the kind he thinks fit, without any consultation or any "By your leave." Quite honestly, it may be necessary to have certain powers, but really we ought not to have a long Clause like this appearing on the Paper&#x2014;it is true that the Under-Secretary of State said it was in response to pressure&#x2014;which, in the text of the Bill, would occupy nearly two pages. It comes to us on what is really the Report stage, though technically it is the Committee stage, without any of that opportunity which exists in advance when a Clause of this importance appears in the Bill as originally printed.<br/>
I cannot see anybody putting up an aerodrome near my house, and, therefore, I cannot see them coming to my small garden to hang up a lot of lights, so that I have no particular self-interest in this matter, but I can visualise circumstances in which an aerodrome is to be put up in what is already a substantially built-up area and the proprietors proceeding to decide on what buildings they are going to place a series of warning lights. The real question at issue should be whether the aerodrome should be allowed to come there at all, having regard to the fact that large numbers of other people are already in possession and that there is no particular reason why their rights should be interfered with. If this were a question of national defence, I might be more impressed, but, so far as I can understand, it has nothing to do with national defence.</p>

<p>I should be nervous about the national defence if I thought that casual aerodromes which are


normally used for other purposes were to be used for war purposes, because there would be no stores or equipment such as would be required. If, on the other hand, the primary purpose were that of national defence, I should vote quite cheerfully for this Clause. I understand these aerodromes will be used by fewer than 750 aeroplanes, belonging to private people consuming in the aggregate about a thousandth part of the petrol consumed in this country by the owners of motor cars, and really we ought to be quite certain about what we are doing, representing in principle, as it does, a very grave invasion of the rights of property, which do not have many defenders in these days. It is only to be justified, in my opinion, if there exist very urgent grounds of national necessity, and if this kind of Clause is necessary because aerodromes have been situated in the sort of places with which the Clause concerns itself, that is an indication that these aerodromes have been wrongly situated. I cannot imagine any aerodrome in these days being deliberately placed in the kind of situation envisaged by this Clause, and I really, therefore, think we ought to look at the Clause with very great care before we finally commit ourselves to the decision that it should be read a Second time.</p>

<p>I think the Under-Secretary of State was fully justified in putting forward the view that the Air Ministry has done everything possible to meet suggestions that have been put forward from all parts of the House, and I fully appreciate that he has tried very hard to incorporate in the Bill many ideas put forward during the debates. We are not completely satisfied, but there may be further opportunities for discussing individual points. With regard to this Clause, I think it might go a very great deal further, but I think we ought to give it a Second Reading. I am not so concerned as is the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams) about what he calls this gross invasion of the rights of private property, the right of a man to do what he will with his own.</p>

<p>This Clause is a very great improvement on the form of the Clause before, which laid it down that these lights had to be put up at the expense of the private owners outside. It is quite right that the aerodrome owners should be the people who should have to do that. I want to ask the Under-Secretary of State to give us a definite assurance on this point: It is clearly of the utmost importance, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) pointed out, that there should be close co-operation between the town planning authorities and the people who are going to license aerodromes, and it will be more important in the future than it has been in the past, because if you license an aerodrome which may now be absolutely isolated, in a few years' time all the land around may be covered with buildings of a considerable height, and I think we want to take a far-sighted view of the development of aviation in this country and try to agree, as I imagine could be done without any further legislation, upon joint action and consultation between the Air Ministry and the town planning authorities. I hope my right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will say something on that point.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams) is such a powerful advocate of private interests that sometimes I think he allows his enthusiasm to carry him too far. It is not here a question as between the private interests of the owner of a house and the private interests of the owner of an aerodrome. On the one hand, you have certainly the liability cast on the owner of the house, but, on the other hand, look what a great service the great airway services are rendering. It is not only for the benefit of a few private owners of aerodromes; it is for the benefit of one of the most important things in the modern world, namely, air transport, which surely is entitled to impose these very reasonable obligations, at the expense of the owner of an aerodrome, on the owners of surrounding buildings.</p>

<p>I find in the returns on the subject that licensed civil aerodromes amount in number to 99, 44 being private and 55 public aerodromes, whereas the Royal Air Force aerodromes number 30, and aeroplane stations are 20, so it seems to me that what we are considering here is more a question of real basic accommodation for civil aviation than anything else. I know, however, that should certain events that would necessitate these aerodromes being used for national purposes take place, there would be no hesitation in taking them over for national purposes. I went last week-end to a place where it had been rumoured that there was likely to be an aerodrome. All round the area little jerry builders have been putting up houses such as should not be allowed if it were known that an aerodrome was to be constructed. There ought to be a certain amount of open space outside the border of aerodromes. There is also a rumour now that the owners of the houses will get compensation because of the noise and inconvenience which will be caused when the aerodrome is working. It is such thinks as these that have to be foreseen. The attaching of a light to a building is a small thing in comparison.<br/>
A point has been raised in regard to pylons and the wires that they carry. In 1926, when the electricity Bill was being discussed, I stressed the importance of this question in relation to aeroplanes. Technical men will tell you that there is great difficulty in insulating 5,000 volts when it is near the earth. Some of the text books published recently say that wherever you have over 500 volts near the earth there is no material that will completely insulate it. The air gives the nearest approach to insulation. If something is to be done in regard to these

wires, which are a serious danger to air transport, the Government will have to make provision now. If they do not we shall come up against some serious snags in relation to claims for compensation. I hope that before the Clause passes some kind of guarantee will be inserted in order to protect both sides in this matter, because the public are interested in the pylons and the wires, whereas the airmen do not want them.</p>

<p>I find myself in complete disagreement with a good deal of what has been said in this Debate. My hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams) spoke as if he imagined that all night-flying aeroplanes are run by private owners, while my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ripon (Major Hills) said that there were a number of air services running at night up and down the country. So far as I know, the only night services in England are those that operate between Croydon and the Continent. The difficulty is that we have no night ground organisation in this country, with the exception of that of Government aerodromes, and I doubt whether, according to the actual law of the land and of the law of Continental night flying, even that would pass if it were carefully examined. As a whole, we are years behind countries on the Continent in the facilities we give for night flying. This new Clause is but a small start in that direction. We have in this country great difficulties in flying through fog. We have probably a worse fog belt than airmen of other countries have to contend with, and we have other difficulties because of the small country in which we live.<br/>
It is certain that if we are to develop night flying services, which will be of such enormous importance to this country, we are bound to have obstructions within a reasonable range of aerodromes properly lighted. With the new methods of landing in fog a large area is necessary, and the aerodrome, both inside and outside, must be free of obstruction. The least we can do is to cause something to be done to the obstructions, either by lighting or by some other means, which will warn pilots when they are near them. That is the reason this new Clause is a great advance from the point of view of night flying in this country.<br/>
I cannot agree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon when he belittles the value of aerodromes which have been put up at enormous expense by private enterprise, through which the owners are losing thousands of pounds a year, and which, as my right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary knows full well, are of enormous potential military value to this country for its protection. My hon. Friend really over-states his case when he belittles work of that sort. I believe that this new Clause will seldom be used. My experience shows that if you go to somebody who is responsible for an obstruction, and you say to him, "This obstruction is causing danger to the life of your fellow-countrymen; will you allow us to put a red light on top of it?" the permission is given. I have never known a case where it has been refused. Although the Minister is taking powers to do it, I do not think that, save in very exceptional circumstances, the powers will ever be put into operation. I congratulate the Minister on the Clause.</p>

<p>The Committee will appreciate that it is something in the nature of a paradox when I rise to support the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams) but I am in-dined to support his point of view this afternoon. When I was a boy I always understood that an Englishman's home was his castle, but evidently that is not so now. The observations of the hon. Member for South Croydon should have some weight. It was only because the Committee brought pressure to bear on the Under-Secretary that he brought in this Clause. The first idea was for the proprietors of aerodromes simply to put their red lights or warning notices wherever they liked, without saying "by your leave." The Under-Secretary has met that point in this new Clause. The arguments that have been made this afternoon by certain hon. Members might just as well have applied when railways were being built. Those who wanted to run railways through the land of this country had to pay very heavily for the right to do so. Therefore, why should not owners of aerodromes, who are concerned with what is only another form of transport, pay adequate compensation for putting their warning notices on private property? In the Orders that the Minister may be called upon to make,

will he put in some provision to compensate an owner for any damage that is done to his property by reason of a warning signal being placed on it? Subsection (2) says that compensation shall be made to the owner of the land. Does that also apply to any hereditament which is not land?</p>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister three questions. The first is connected with the old story of the gasholder at Heston. I have raised this question on innumerable occasions and I have been given the same answer, namely, that the Minister has no power to do anything. If this new Clause passes, will he have the power to insist on a light being put on that gas-holder, although it is more than 2,000 yards away from the outside edge of the aerodrome? The second question reinforces the question which has been asked with regard to the cables that carry the grid. Will the Minister have power to insist that, where these cables pass within 2,000 metres of an aerodrome, they are adequately lit? The third question is with regard to payment. I understand that under this proposed Clause the owner of an aerodrome, whether an individual, a company or a municipality, has to pay the cost of installing and maintaining the lights. I visualise a case where the owner, possibly a municipality, is not prepared to spend any more money because the aerodrome has lost a great deal of money. In a case like that is it possible, where there is some obstruction, for the Minister to step in and instal a light and maintain it?</p>

<p>I would like to emphasise the point which has been made, that one of the most effective ways of meeting the question of safety is not only to light the obstructions, but to prevent unnecessary obstructions being created in the vicinity of aerodromes. Co-operation between the Air Ministry and the town planning authority is essential to meet that object. I am afraid that a town planning authority is unable to lay down any conditions for any part of its area


unless it has a town plan for the whole of its area. That is a serious obstacle. Town planning is still in its infancy in Great Britain, and it is at places where town planning has not made very much headway that many of the new aerodromes are to be established. It would be a more effective Clause if the Minister had consulted the Minister of Health to find out whether it would have been possible to arm town planning authorities with powers to lay down conditions where aerodromes are being established. I agree that this new form of transport ought not to be cluttered up with restrictions and limitations such as were imposed on railway transport, and from which we are still suffering. I am afraid that we have gone too far in the Bill to make such an Amendment, but perhaps, if it is possible, the Minister will consult the Minister of Health to find out whether some such restrictive powers could be conferred on town planning authorities so that where they had no town plan they could impose a partial plan in the vicinity of an aerodrome.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. A. Bevan) voiced an anxiety which has been expressed by several speakers as to the position of aerodromes in future in relation to town planning. That is a very important consideration, although it goes a great deal beyond the scope of this particular Clause, but I would remind the hon. Member that when an aerodrome is decided upon by a local authority an application for a licence must be made to the Secretary of State.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1936-06-25a.1999.2" hansard_membership_id="1248" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12332" speakername="Mr. BEVAN" colnum="1999" time="">

<p>The local authority has to get a licence from the Secretary of State, and in considering the application he will, of course, bear in mind the whole question of town planning in the neighbourhood and act in close consultation with the Ministry of Health or any other Department that may be concerned. As we have found ourselves confronted with the necessity of making Regulations of this kind because of what

has occurred in the past we shall try to avoid similar difficulties being created in the future. I therefore give the assurance that in connection with the grant of licences for aerodromes in the future the Air Ministry will consult with all the appropriate Government Departments.</p>

<p>There will be consultation not only with the appropriate Government Department but with the local authority too. That is as far as I can go in meeting the apprehensions of hon. Members on that point. The hon. and gallant Member for Hertford (Sir M. Sueter) raised the question of pylons, a most important one from the point of view of safety. We have been in consultation with the Ministry of Transport for some time now to see how and in what directions the danger arising from pylons in the neighbourhood of aerodromes can be avoided. The hon. Member for Springburn (Mr. Hardie) joined with the hon. and gallant Member in this discussion and displayed a wide knowledge, among his many other accomplishments, of all the technicalities of voltages and electricity, and put forward some important points. This Clause will not, of course, give us the power to compel the Ministry of Transport to put underground all cables now carried on pylons, but it will give ample possibility for pylons in the vicinity of an aerodrome to be lit, as indeed they are at certain places&#x2014;near Dagenham and elsewhere.</p>

<p>No, this Clause does not go as far as that. The hon. Members for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams) and Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) raised the question of the invasion of the rights of private owners. I sympathise to a certain extent with the attitude they have taken up, but one must not look upon this problem as concerning only users of aeroplanes and the owners of aerodromes, because there is also the


question of the safety of people living in the neighbourhood of aerodromes. If the putting of a light on a building will prevent an aeroplane, when there is low visibility, such as is only too often the case in this country, from colliding with a house, the owner of the house and those who live in it will benefit just as much as the owner of the aeroplane. The Secretary of State will naturally be very careful to see that a licence is not given for an aerodrome in a locality which is unsuitable, and a proviso has been specially inserted in the Clause to meet such a contingency.</p>

<p>I agree that we must take reasonable precautions not only in the interests of those who travel in aeroplanes but of those who are on the ground, but my point was that reasonable compensation ought to be paid to private persons if we are taking away their rights.

<p>The position at Heston is exactly where it was when I spoke about it last, and as that was not so very long ago I do not feel too ashamed to say that. As my hon. Friend knows, there are certain technical difficulties. We are trying to overcome them. We are very anxious that that gasholder should be illuminated, and I hope it will be illuminated as soon as possible. This obstruction is a good deal larger than most obstructions, and while I do not say that puts it in a different category from the others, it is distinctly an obstruction which ought to be lit in the interests of safety. I would also deal with the point which my hon. Friend put

as to its distance from Heston Aerodrome&#x2014;whether it was too far away to come within the terms of this Clause. As I said in my opening remarks we have been careful not to specify any distance in the Clause, because an obstruction which is some distance from an aerodrome may be as dangerous as one which is close to it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
When the Bill was under consideration in Committee I promised to move on the Report stage an Amendment to Section 8 (2) of the Act of 1920 to secure that a local authority would be empowered to carry on at an aerodrome subsidiary businesses such as the sale of petrol, oil and spare parts where permission to do so had been granted by the Secretary of State by an order made in respect of that particular aerodrome. The result of


the new Clause will be that in future any Order will not be of general application but will apply only to the particular aerodrome in question. The effect of repealing Section 8 (2) of the Act of 1920 and the substitution of this new provision is by no means revolutionary. All it does is to substitute <i>ad hoc</i> authorities for the general authorities hitherto given in respect to the carrying on of subsidiary businesses, and obviously it is a more satisfactory method. It denotes no change of attitude or spirit on the part of the Air Ministry in regard to this question of the supply of oil and fuel at their aerodromes by local authorities but merely enables our intentions to be better achieved.<br/>
It was the intention of Section 8 (2) of the Act of 1920 that local authorities should be able to step into the gap and provide services and facilities at their aerodromes where private enterprise had failed to do so. This power was never intended to cover a general system of municipal trading. If that had been the intention the statutory provision would have been drawn in far wider and more explicit terms. The flaw in the provision which is now being repealed is that an Order issued in respect of one particular aerodrome applied automatically to all aerodromes belonging to local authorities. That was clearly an unsatisfactory system. It might be necessary at one aerodrome and wholly unnecessary at another for the local authority to carry on these subsidiary businesses. Under the new Clause it will be possible to deal with each application on its merits, and of course, the Ministry of Health will be consulted in every case.</p>

<p>The Amendments which have been ruled out of order might not be of so much consequence to the critics of the Clause so long as we are able to discuss the general principle involved, and I propose to offer one or two observations in reference to municipal trading in relation to the Air Ministry. I fail to see why municipal trading should be a matter of reference to the Air Ministry with or without reference to the Ministry of Health. It is all very well for the Under-Secretary to refer to the Act of 1920, but we are not discussing that Act. We are discussing this Measure, which will become an Act of Parliament. The time has gone by when the little prejudices against municipal trading by hon. Members opposite, who want civil aviation, and want to do the best they can to make the country air-minded, should be enforced and substantiated in the body of this Measure. That is practically what the Clause amounts to.<br/>
Municipal trading is already under considerable limitation. I fail to see why the existing law should not be left alone, although I would like to extend the powers of municipal authorities. In these days, municipal government has developed from the comparatively incompetent methods of the earlier municipal governments, and big cities and towns are being given tile power to establish aerodromes and are invited to assist the national objective of making the nation air-minded. Hindrances should not be embodied in a Bill of this character against providing a hotel upon an aerodrome or providing other facilities for the owners of aircraft and the users of aerodromes. To say that such facilities might mean a charge upon the rates is beside the point. In any kind of commercial enterprise there is a certain amount of risk, but there is no more risk attached to municipal aerodromes than to any of the other multifarious, municipal trading schemes, which are exceedingly successful.<br/>
Surely it can be left to local authorities to decide in their wisdom whether it would be desirable for them to engage in this small amount of municipal trading, keeping whatever profits there may be within the municipality, and certainly keeping the control of the trading and the future development of the enterprise in the hands of the general public. It is because we feel that it is exceedingly undesirable, whatever restrictions the House might regard as necessary for municipal trading, that it should be left to the Secretary of State for Air to decide this matter in respect of aerodromes, that we intended to move the Amendments, and that I offer these criticisms.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable thing that we have twice had requests from the opposite benches for an increase in the number of municipal aerodromes. There must be some form of prejudice in that type of man who desires a municipality to enter upon all kinds of responsibilities and risks, and at the same time would use the power of the municipalities as an opportunity for private enterprise to make profits. We were told that if the Amendments were embodied in the Clause there might be a charge somewhere. Not many days ago a question was answered in the House showing that no kind of air service paid. If an air service does not pay, aerodromes cannot. It is prejudice which it is very difficult to understand. If the municipality is to take full responsibility, if it is to act as a complete aerodrome authority, why not make the aerodrome complete under that authority?<br/>
What hon. Members seek to do now is to destroy the organisation, which always depends upon one controlling centre. There are stations that I know where there are always comings and goings, and there are bound to be running repairs required for that service. Why should they not be provided by the authority which has provided the aerodrome? This arrangement would provide a great lever for keeping down prices and keeping prices level, because municipalities are not out to make profit, as is private enterprise, in the provision of those services. I hope the Under-Secretary will see that he is going the right way to put impediments in the way of municipalities by saying that municipalities shall not have


the right to spend money in that way. If civil aviation is to have the advance that it should have in this country, no such impediment should be put in the way of anyone who is taking full responsibility for an aerodrome. I make a last appeal to the Under-Secretary to give careful consideration to the Clause before he lets it go. Otherwise he will find himself up against a growing opposition by municipal authorities, and they will be justified in their opposition.</p>

<p>I have very considerable sympathy with the speech that has just been delivered from the other side, not because the Under-Secretary is not trying to do his best to make local authorities responsible for aerodromes. He and the Air Ministry have done their best to ensure that municipalities shall see far enough ahead to provide municipal aerodromes, but I think we must give them the whole picture. If a local authority is to embark upon this enterprise, it should do the whole thing. Looking back upon the history of transport in England nothing is clearer than that when we gave the local authorities the power to trade in transport and only gave them the power to trade in tramcars, we upset the transport development of this country. The Under-Secretary has the right idea, and in another place, or at some later stage, perhaps he will be able to get these aerodromes provided with enthusiasm behind them. That is what we want in the country. It would be advisable to give local authorities the power to trade in as free a way as they can to provide facilities for making their aerodromes popular.</p>

<p>The remarks of the hon. and gallant Gentleman remind me of an experience. I am a member of an urban district council which had been asked by certain surrounding local authorities to engage in considering the provision of a new aerodrome in the immediate vicinity of London. It was desirable that that aerodrome should be established, and no less than four county district councils, one borough council and three urban district councils and consultations on the matter. We were faced with the fact that land is very expensive in the vicinity of London and that, for a good many

years after the actual provision of the site of the aerodrome, there would be a substantial loss that would have to be borne by the rates. We were stirred up in our efforts by the visits of a lady who has some notoriety as an airwoman. Among her many visits to the locality was one to a rotary club, where she made a speech calling on the district to rise to the occasion; and the eloquent peroration of her speech was to the effect that, if the municipality would only provide the aerodrome, it would be such a fine thing for Messrs. So-and-So, mentioning the name of a great firm of aeroplane manufacturers, who, apparently thought that, if the aerodrome was established and we provided the site at our expense, they would be allowed to come in and have a monopoly for doing all the profitable part of the business. That eloquent but unfortunate peroration killed the whole thing stone dead, because in this wicked world you could not expect members of a municipality, who have to face the ratepayers trienially at elections, to undertake the task of providing a site on which private enterprise might make a profit while they were making a substantial loss.<br/>
I would point out to the Under-Secretary that there is ample protection, because, before the municipalities can invest any capital in this business, they will have to go to the Ministry of Health for a loan, and the municipal finances will be quite adequately protected against undue risk by that ordinary precaution. It seems a pity to put the people who provide municipal aerodromes in a worse position than those who provide private aerodromes, and I imagine that in the vicinity of the great towns great difficulty will be found in getting aerodromes provided of anything like adequate area unless they are provided either by one municipality or by a combination of municipalities. It would be very regrettable if it should be thought, in starting this service, where the good will of the municipalities is, as I understand it, very earnestly desired, that there was any differentiation against them in this matter.<br/>
I had hoped that the Minister might have been able to accept our Amendments, but, as they cannot be moved, he cannot do that, I think that, if we had


had an opportunity of dividing on the Amendments, even had we been beaten, we might not have found it necessary to divide against the Clause. My hon. Friend the Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague) gave no indication of his views with regard to dividing against the Clause as it is printed, but it seems to me that it would be very difficult for us, holding the views that we do with regard to municipal trading generally, and particularly with regard to the municipal trading so jucidly explained by the hon. and gallant Member for Wallasey (Lieut. - Colonel Moore-Brabazon), to accept the Clause in present form without a Division, and I hope the Under-Secretary will feel, if we divide against it, that that is not because we do not recognise that he has met us to a certain extent but because this is one of the cases where, if we have half a loaf, we are at last entitled to say that we would have preferred the whole loaf if it had been possible to get it within the Rules of Order of the House.</p>

<p>This seems to be a Clause which gives the Secretary of State power to put some kind of control&#x2014;I think a proper control&#x2014;upon what might otherwise be general municipal trading in which the municipal authority would be able to compete in trade with its own ratepayers. I think it is right that the Minister should have some authority to put a check upon that without interfering with the proper right of the authority efficiently to run its municipality. What is the kind of business which appears to the Minister to be ancillary to the carrying on of an aerodrome? I hope that the Under-Secretary and the Solicitor-General will give us some idea of what businesses will be and what will not be within the meaning of this wide and almost incomprehensible expression, "ancillary to the carrying on of an aerodrome." We know that at many of the larger aerodromes there are refreshment houses, newspaper stands, and so on. Are we to understand that these are businesses ancillary to the carrying on of an aerodrome? There are a few cases in this country where local authorities are licensees carrying on hotels, but I think it was stated recently by the Minister of Health that in every one of these

cases special circumstances were brought to his notice but for which no such business would have been permitted.<br/>
Who is going to decide in the present case? Is the Minister to say what in his opinion is ancillary? Is he to lay down a list of businesses which, for all time, he will consider to be ancillary, and in respect of any one of which the local authority concerned may apply for his authority to trade? Does it mean that at any moment the Minister may say&#x2014;and I gather that his decision will be final&#x2014;that a given business, unconnected though it may be at first sight seem to be with it, is so related to the carrying on of an aerodrome that in his opinion it is a business which is ancillary to the carrying on of an aerodrome? If he is going to have this unlimited power, it is going to mean a tremendous extension, which I am sure he does not intend, of municipal trading at these aerodromes. I hope we shall be told what generally is going to be the definition of "ancillary" for this purpose. It is a word which in many legal connections in this country has never been free from doubt, and, while we applaud the Minister's action in not giving to municipalities a complete inroad against private enterprise in this case, we hope there will not be any such extreme construction of this remarkable word as will give some unintended right which he never had in mind.</p>

<p>I think the real significance of this Clause lies in the statement of policy made by the Under-Secretary when the matter was raised in Committee. He said that it would be the deliberate policy and intention of the Government for the future so to administer the matters which we are now discussing as to give the utmost possible benefit to private enterprise, and to check the development of municipal enterprise. I think it would be desirable to give local authorities the widest opportunities of trading in ancillary matters. I would much rather see the present law allowed to continue, so that, if it were considered right that a particular service should be operated by one authority, equal permission should be given to others throughout the country if they cared to take advantage of it. There is a certain controversy now between the principles of strict individualism and municipal


trading, and I must say that I find myself on the side of municipal trading. I hope that the Government will be pressed not to exercise their authority, as they declared they would, against municipal trading.</p>

<p>We have had a classic example of how the interests of private enterprise are set up against the public interest, in the speech of the hon. and learned Member for East Leicester (Mr. Lyons). We have heard from time to time pleas that municipal authorities should undertake the building of aerodromes, and we on this side have listened sympathetically to those pleas. Hon. Members opposite are delivering speeches all over the country saying that this country is quite unprepared in the air to meet the necessities of modern warfare, and one of the purposes of this Bill is to facilitate and regulate civil aviation as one of the foundations for air defence. But here we have a suggestion that the development of civil aviation should be restricted to prevent a municipal authority from selling chocolates as against a private person who might want to sell chocolates. I never heard a more fantastic suggestion.<br/>
The Under-Secretary, in moving the Clause, said that there was not a very substantial difference between it and the language of the principal Act, but the language of the principal Act makes it necessary that an Order having general application should be made, whereas this Clause would make it possible for the Minister to make an Order with respect to a particular aerodrome. I do not regard that as a step forward; it makes the local authority a servant of the Minister, and if it were included in other Acts it would give rise to a storm of indignation. If local authorities need special powers which are not exercised by other local authorities, they have to promote a Private Bill and get those special powers, or to adopt powers in adoptive Acts. The hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams) shakes his head, but that is a perfectly general description of the relationship between the local authorities and the State. Here is a suggestion that the Minister should have power to treat each local authority separately.<br/>
The local authority must first make an application to the Ministry of Health for a loan, and protection for the ratepayers can be provided there. The local authority would have to justify all the capital expenditure required on every part of the aerodrome. The local authority would have to plan the aerodrome as a whole, and, in planning the aerodrome as a whole, would have to take into account restaurants, refreshment rooms, waiting rooms and so on, both at the aerodrome and also, as is done in connection with many other services, in the town, because many of these aerodromes are a long way from places of business. If an ordinary transport company now provides a restaurant and waiting room at the gathering point for traffic, are the local authorities to be prohibited from doing that? Is it to be said that, if they have a waiting room, and perhaps a refreshment room, on the aerodrome itself, they cannot have them in the town or in the city where the passengers embark on the omnibus or car to go to the aerodrome? Is not a waiting room or a refreshment room there just as much a part of the general organisation of the aerodrome as the aerodrome itself? Would it be regarded as not coming within the meaning of the word "ancillary" to allow the authority to have a licensed bar at the aerodrome?<br/>
I would like to know exactly what the meaning is, and what the position of the local authority is to be. It is going to be encouraged to embark on a vast capital expenditure, approved by the Ministry of Health; then there is to be another inquiry by the Secretary of State for Air; and then an Order will be made allowing these things to be done. But after that, any such Order may be varied or revoked by a subsequent Order of the Secretary of State. So the local authority may be encouraged to embark on capital expenditure in the first instance and is then completely at the mercy of the Secretary for Air. Any private interest can bring pressure to bear on the Minister and say, "Here is a local authority carrying on a business of an extremely profitable kind," and it can urge him to revoke the Order and allow them to carry on the business. If I know the complexion of this Government and governments of the same kind, they will be extremely sensitive to pressure of that kind and will after a time revoke the


Order and allow the business to be carried on by the private concern.<br/>
We understand also that it might be possible for the local authority to make provision in the original plans for stands or stalls, and ultimately they would lease them to private concerns. The hon. Member asked if it was fair that a local authority should use the rates in order to carry on unfair competition against those who have to pay the rates. Here is an instance where the local authority is asked to incur a vast capital expenditure on what is known beforehand to be a heavily losing concern. What the hon. Member is suggesting is that the ratepayers as a whole should provide the expenditure in order that particular ratepayers might be able to make a profit. It is absurd for the Minister to suggest that one of the reasons why the Clause has been adopted is in order to protect the ratepayer. It is not. It is in order to protect private interests. He may say that we are pressing the matter because it is strictly in accordance with our Socialist principles to do so. On the other hand, ought he to set the interests of this small class of persons against the national interest? Ought he not to be able to say to local authorities, "If you are prepared to build an aerodrome you should be complete masters in your own house. You should organise the aerodrome as you wish and you should carry on any ancillary business you care to, without any interference from us."<br/>
I have been a member of a local authority for many years and, if it was suggested to me that we should raise a large loan to build an aerodrome and establish businesses and then find ourselves entirely under the orders of a State Department not making any contribution to the capital outlay, I should regard it as an absurd proposition. I know of no provision of this kind in any other Statute. It is a piece of sheer financial irresponsibility. I admit the claim that, if a local authority is to spend money part of which the State provides, the State is entitled to have a say in the administration, but here is the reverse principle. Here is a local authority spending its own money and the State saying, "You are to be our instrument in determining how it is to be spent." If the Minister desires to promote the creation of municipal aerodromes, he had better not hedge them round with limitations merely in

order to satisfy the claims of reactionary private individuals.</p>

<p>I have listened with considerable interest to arguments of hon. Members opposite and I am in entire agreement with them. It has been my privilege in the last few years to travel extensively by air, and Imperial Airways, where they have been encouraged to set up aerodromes, have also been encouraged to set up these ancillary services. Here we have municipalities setting up aerodromes but being discouraged&#x2014;that is the only word one can use&#x2014;by this Clause from providing these ancillary services. I would ask what are the intentions behind the Clause, and I would particularly refer to the second sentence, that any Order permitting local authorities to institute these ancillary services may be varied or revoked. I feel that this interpolation wrecks the whole purpose of the Clause. Assume that facilities are provided not only for food and drink but also for sleeping accommodation, which is often necessary, and the business becomes profitable. I am not questioning the right of private interests to get business, but you may get terrific pressure from hotel and other organisations, not only on the local authorities but through Parliament. We know that such pressure has been exerted in other matters. The question is whether this sentence is going to be used to put municipalities in a worse position than other interests. I look with considerable sympathy on municipal trading and I hope it will extend.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that the Amendment in my name was not in order, but I gather that that is not so. I share the view that has been expressed in more than one quarter of the House that, if the Clause is passed as it stands, it will cause grave concern to municipalities. I had understood that the Government desired to encourage the


establishment of municipal aerodromes up and down the country. I cannot conceive a Clause which would have a more depressing effect than this on the possibilities of that development. The London County Council, of which I am a member, is disturbed at its wording and, while we did not anticipate going to the extent of voting against it, we felt that a reasonable Amendment might be made which would go at least some way towards allaying the fears of municipalities. The Under-Secretary assured the House&#x2014;I am convinced that they needed little assurance on the point&#x2014;that he had been most amenable to reasonable criticisms that had been made of the Measure. When I heard him say that, I hoped that at this late stage of the Bill he was not going to lose his reputation, and it encouraged me to put this Amendment on the Paper.</p>

<p>I feel that, if we substituted "desirable and expedient" for "necessary," it would remove some of the objections which municipalities have to the Clause. The word "necessary" seems to me too restricted and too rigid. It might very easily lead to very unhappy results in its interpretation. "Desirable and expedient," it seems to me, may provide all the necessary safeguards for those who fear that this might conceivably open the door to a flood of municipal trading. We are not particularly wedded to the actual words, but we suggest that the word "necessary" is much too rigid, and we find confirmation of it in several parts of the Bill. Where powers are sought to make roads or put up buildings and do other works of the sort, the word "necessary" is not used. In Section (1) of the Act of 1920 it was used and it is found to have been too restrictive and it is to be altered and the

expression "desirable or expedient" substituted.<br/>
There are many ancillary purposes which a municipal aerodrome will find it necessary to develop, and one feels that municipalities ought not to be placed in the position that they are only entitled to develop those services where a dead loss is certain before they start, and, if municipalities are to be encouraged in this direction, it is desirable that those ancillary services which will lessen the loss that would otherwise be incurred should be allowed and encouraged. Such services as the sale of refreshments, and, in special cases, the provision and maintenance of a hotel may be ancillary. As has been pointed out, most of these aerodromes will be some distance removed from populous neighbourhoods. It will be necessary to supply petrol and lubricating oil, to repair aeroplanes and supply spare parts, and, as the service develops, other ancillary services may be necessary. The Under-Secretary of State might reasonably accept this alteration in the form of words and make it a little more easy for these municipal services to be developed on the lines that municipalities would desire. I commend the suggestion to the Under-Secretary, and hope that he will find it possible to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I cannot do what the hon. Gentleman the Member for Deptford (Mr. W. H. Green) suggested, and I think that when one looks at what this proposed new Clause does, it may be that a good deal of the arguments this afternoon have been founded upon a misapprehension. It is not a restricting Clause; it is an enabling Clause. It is a Clause enabling local authorities to do something which they have no statutory right to do at the present time. This is neither the time nor the place to enter into any general discussion as to what local authorities ought or ought not to be permitted to do in the way of invading the realm of private trade. That is a matter of very general interest that certainly would not be appropriate on this occasion. The position is that upon the Committee stage there were a number of Amendments from hon. and right hon. Friends on this side of the House purposing to restrict the powers of local


authorities, so that they should not be allowed to deal in fuel and various articles of that kind. Those were restricting Amendments, and my right hon. Friend the Attorney-General resisted them, and stated that we were not prepared to accept them. It was pointed out that there was an alteration considered desirable in the existing law, not by way of further restrictions, but by way of clearing up a position which was anomalous. I will explain in a little detail what this Clause really effects. By the Act of 1920 local authorities are empowered to establish aerodromes, and Section 8, Sub-section (2) says:
<q>A local authority providing an aerodrome under this section shall have power to carry on in connection therewith any subsidiary business certified by the Air Council to be ancillary to the carrying on of an aerodrome.</q>
The House will note the significance of the words "an aerodrome," the reason for inserting which I am at a loss to understand. The effect of that Sub-section has been that, where a local authority has established a local aerodrome, if it were desired to get a certificate to permit it to carry on in connection therewith any subsidiary business certified to be ancillary, it had to satisfy the Air Council that such subsidiary business was ancillary to the carrying on of an aerodrome. That is to say, that, far and wide over the country as a whole, the certificate might apply that such a business is ancillary. What has been the result in actual practice? The Act has been in existence for 16 years, and it has only been invoked on one occasion. I do not know how it comes about that it has not been invoked on more occasions, but one reason which occurs to me is that there may be a considerable difficulty in satisfying the Air Ministry that a particular business is ancillary to the carrying on of an aerodrome.<br/>
It may very well be&#x2014;it is no concern of the Ministry whether it should be or should not&#x2014;that this Clause may or may not increase the number of applications made for certificates or orders. We are providing in this Clause that when the application is made by a local authority, it shall be considered in relation not to aerodromes in general, but to the particular aerodrome in respect of which the application is made. It follows from that,

that it is not possible to give an answer in completely general terms to many of the questions which have been addressed to me, for instance, by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for East Leicester (Mr. Lyons) and by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan), who both asked whether certain premises would be ancillary. The answer is that we no longer propose to do what was done under the 1920 Act, and say that such and such a business is ancillary to all aerodromes, but the matter will have to be considered upon the circumstances in each case.<br/>
Some of the examples that would, in given circumstances, be ancillary are provisions for the sale of petrol and oil, which might be ancillary in cases where there were not reasonable conveniences in the neighbourhood, the sale of spare parts, where the same considerations apply; the doing of repairs to aircraft and to engines, and, in certain circumstances, the provision of hotel accommodation where otherwise there would be no accommodation for passengers. I ask hon. and right hon. Gentleman opposite to consider the proposed new Clause in the light of the instances I have just given. As I read the existing law, which is contained in the Act of 1920, it would be almost impossible to certify that some or all of those particular businesses were ancillary to the business of carrying on an aerodrome in every case.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has pointed to the present law as being an inducement to municipalities to come forward, but the difference between this Bill and the Act of 1920 is that, under the existing Act, once a certificate is granted by the authorities he has quoted, it remains permanent, and does he think that under the Bill there will be an inducement to local authorities to start anything when they know that it might be revoked by a subsequent order of the Secretary of State?</p>

<p>I have not overlooked that point. When I heard it raised from the benches opposite I realised that it was a point of substance, and perhaps I had better deal with it right away. It is true that the Act of 1920 does not provide for the revocation or the withdrawal of a certificate once given. The view is that those certificates are in their nature revocable documents, and that it was not necessary to specify that they should be revoked. Doubt has been cast upon that view, and there has been a suggestion that there might be difficulty in revoking such an Order. Therefore, power is taken in the present Clause to revoke Orders where necessary.<br/>
I absolutely appreciate the point that has been made that it would be almost impossible to ask a local authority to undertake expenditure in connection with sonic business of this kind and then to allow it to be at the complete mercy of the Secretary of State in regard to the withdrawal of an Order he had made. One cannot imagine any Secretary of State acting in a captious way like that, but there is some safeguard in the first Sub-section, because he may make an Order authorising the local authority,
<q>subject to such conditions (if any) as may be specified in the Order, to carry on that business.</q>
It would be possible under Sub-section (1), and indeed a prudent local authority could ensure it, to include among the conditions inserted in the Order a condition giving a reasonable tenure at any rate, so that the Order might endure for a certain period of time. That appears to me to provide material for a practical safeguard. You must have some power to revoke an Order that is made, because the circumstances in which an Order was made might entirely disappear and an aerodrome might cease to be used. Is it then proposed that you should, by virtue of an Order of this kind, leave the authority in possession of a business which had no longer any relation to aerodromes at all?</p>

<p>It may be, I do not know. I think it was the hon. Gentleman himself who asked whether a licensed bar would be ancillary

to the business of all aerodrome. It might be that a licensed bar would be ancillary in a given instance, but if for reasons of town planning or other developments the aerodrome was abandoned and the bar remained, it would cease to be so. Is it suggested that in those circumstances the local authority ought, by virtue of a provision of an Air Navigation Bill and not as a matter of general policy, have power to continue the provision of alcoholic liquores?</p>

<p>I am not at all sure that that would necessarily follow. If the business at the time the order was made was ancillary, I am not at all sure that the hon. Gentleman is right that, if the business to which it was ancillary disappeared, the power also would disappear unless there was power to revoke. However, a point of substance has been raised about this power of revocation, and I will give an undertaking that it shall be looked into before the Bill reaches another place, with a view to seeing whether, consistently with retaining the power of varying, because it is both varying and revocation that are necessary&#x2014;one does not want undue rigidity ill a matter of this kind&#x2014;we cannot do something to ensure that there shall be some security of tenure, at any rate on the part of local authorities who are granted power in this form. For the reasons that I have advanced, I submit that this is not a Bill which is invading the rights of local authorities, and is not an attack upon the powers of trading, or upon the general issue, which remains entirely untouched. The Clause deals with the simple, narrow and restricted area of local trading which has been placed in rather an absurd position by an earlier Act. I hope that in these circumstances the hon. Gentleman will not think it necessary to divide the House. As regards the Amendment, perhaps I shall be in order if I deal with it&#x2014;</p>

<p>No. It was for the convenience of the House generally that the hon. Member speaking on the question "That the Clause be read a Second time," said that as he was then dealing with the subject of his


Amendment he would not make a second speech but only formally move his Amendment after the Clause had been read a Second time. When that has been done the hon. Member will formally move the Amendment and it can then be discussed by the House.</p>

<p>I should very much like to assent to the suggestion that you have made, that we should now dispose of the Second Reading of this Clause, but in view of the fact that the Solicitor-General has not met us either on the major aspect of our complaint or in regard to any substantial details of them, I am afraid that we shall have to say a few further words about the Clause before we allow it to go to a Division. It was once said about an eminent lawyer Member of this House that he was very great on a small point, but very small on a great point. The hon. and learned Member fulfilled the former of those qualifications in his speech. He endeavoured to rebut our complaint by the suggestion that the words "an aerodrome" were broader than the words "the aerodrome," or <i>vice versa.</i> I was not able to follow his reasoning. It appears to me that the powers he is now taking are very much more restrictive to the enterprise of local authorities than the powers as they stand in previous legislation. He made a great point of the fact that this is an enabling provision, that it is giving something which did not exist before and that we ought to be satisfied with it. I agree that it is an enabling provision, but if we think it right to enable a local authority to do something, surely it is wise to enable them to do it adequately. Our main complaint about the Clause is that it does not enable them to do it adequately.<br/>
If we could detach ourselves from the hidden complex which is to be found in the way the Government Front Bench looks at every trading question as between local authorities and private enterprise, it would appear ridiculous that when a local authority finds it necessary to start some enterprise it should be hedged about with every form of restriction and difficulty which does not apply if that same enterprise is being entered upon by some profit-making concern. That is a farcical position, if we can only take prejudice

out of it. Why is it necessary for the Under-Secretary to be so anxious that when a local authority starts an aerodrome it should not start any enterprise which might compete with private enterprise near by? Look at the safeguards in the Clause. First, the enterprise must be ancillary to the aerodrome. That is a strange word. What does "ancillary" mean? It means almost anything that the Under-Secretary or the Secretary of State wishes it to mean. The same drawback and vagueness of the term which may prove useful in a restrictive sense to the Secretary of State to-day will prove equally useful in an expansive sense to the Secretary of State probably in some future years.<br/>
The word "ancillary" is one of those very vague words which we frequently find in Statutes. I believe the derivation is from a Latin word meaning hand-maid. Anything which can be taken to be subsidiary, or subservient, or helpful, and comes within the function of the term "hand-maid," can be carried out by the local authority as being ancillary to the conduct of an aerodrome, but that is only the first test that has to be passed. We then find that it is necessary that the local authorities should be empowered to carry it on. It must not only be ancillary, but it must be necessary for the local authority to carry on this ancillary enterprise at the same time. Not only must is he necessary and ancillary, but it must even then be subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State may impose. When it has been proved necessary, when it is ancillary, when it has been subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State may impose, even then he has power to revoke or vary.<br/>
The position is really farcical, and I cannot understand why the Front Bench opposite persists in that attitude. The trouble is that in their morbid jealousy of the activities of local authorities they are being driven as the years pass into ever more ridiculous position, until the whole attitude they adopt about the activities of local authorities and State enterprise will collapse and bring the Government down with it. I have no wish to make a bigger issue of this point. This is the type of observation which we could make on half the proposals that the Government bring forward, for the simple reason that half the proposals we


have debated on the Floor of the House, certainly in this Parliament and in the last few years, have been proposals which have endeavoured to maintain a, semblance of private enterprise without concealing the principle that State and</p>

<p>I hope the right hon. Gentleman will make a <i>beau geste</i> and accept this minor Amendment. The word "necessary" is much more restrictive than the words "desirable and expedient," and if the new Clause came before the courts for interpretation a much more restrictive meaning would be placed upon it than the meaning given to it by the Secretary of State. The word "necessary" means almost as much as the word "imperative." On the other hand, "desirable and expedient" can he inserted in the new Clause without destroying the degree of restriction which the Government desire to maintain.</p>

<q>(<i>c</i>) no subsidy shall be paid under any such agreement unless the persons intended to be subsidised shall agree to co-operate reasonably with the owners of other British air-transport services and not to use their subsidised position in any way which the Secretary of State may consider to be detrimental to such other services.</q>
On the Second Reading and during the Committee stage there was considerable discussion as to the granting of subsidies to new companies and the object in moving this Amendment is to get something fairly clear from the Minister on


the point. From the taxpayers' point of view it is infinitely better, once a subsidy has been given to any particular company, that every effort should be made to see that duplicate services are not run by another company to the detriment of the taxpayers' money. Originally, four or five companies were working between London and Paris and they were merged into one large company and subsidised under the name of Imperial Airways. There are other instances where subsidies have been given to a merger company, the Cunard-White Star lines, and the railways during the War. The Government have generally considered that it is in the public interest when public money is given by subsidies, that the merger interests should be secured as far as possible. That is particularly necessary in the aviation world. You may have one company operating a service to a given place with an aerodrome and the cost of upkeep, and another company wishing to fly to the same place and having to build another aerodrome. It appears to those who support this Amendment that the taxpayers' money is well expended in Imperial Airways because there has been a merger, and they work on the lines I have indicated. If we are to give subsidies to new companies or to other companies running in competition to the same places, then a great deal of the money&#x2014;it is not a large sum&#x2014;which is to be devoted to the development of civil aviation will not be put to the best advantage.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of once again appealing to the Government to use their good offices to bring together British Airways and British Continental Airways. They both run between London and Stockholm. They are both financed by British capital, and they are both run by British pilots. One gets a subsidy and the other does not. While we are satisfied as to the way in which the subsidy is granted, it is not in the best interests of British flying that these two companies should be competing, and I would urge that everything should be done to bring these two concerns together by the Under-Secretary himself calling a conference and himself

presiding over it, to thrash out a scheme which will result in the elimination of a great deal of wasteful competition. The right hon. Gentleman really has got the whip hand. He has offered the subsidy to one company, but it cannot be granted until this Bill becomes law. Is it possible for him to hold his hand until he has done everything in his power to bring these two concerns together?</p>

<p>I agree that any union of companies which can be brought about by the activities of the Secretary of State is of benefit to the Air Service. The duplication of services is a disadvantage to the public. But there is a danger in this Clause. The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Everard) confined his argument to the new companies which are starting under a subsidy. These, I understand, are the Scandinavian services and the South Atlantic services. The companies which fly these services will be put to great expense. They will have to make aerodromes, build up their services, and spend money on making a connection, and I see a danger that some duplication might take place under the Clause. I admit that the Clause is carefully drafted and that the people who are to have the advantage of using the facilities are to co-operate reasonably, and that the Secretary of State is to be satisfied that their co-operation will not be detrimental to existing services. But still I see a danger of getting a duplication of services. There is a danger of our going back to the position as it was before the Imperial Airways merger.<br/>
In the matter of transport the State has decided that competition in transport is not in the public interest. In the early days of railways Parliament was much more willing to grant running powers to rival interests than it is now, and in the case of roads, which at first were free to all who desired to run competing services, the State has now wisely regulated the traffic and does not allow the interloper to butt in at profitable times, run a service to a race meeting or a fair and skim the cream of the traffic. The State, through the Traffic Commissioner, is very wise in doing that, because the regular services would not be so efficient if they were liable to be attacked by an outsider in that way. Although I wish to help civil


aviation as much as I can, and do not want to see competition on these new services which the State is going to subsidise, I suggest that there is a danger that if the Clause were passed in this form, the very object which it seeks to obtain might be jeopardised.</p>

<p>I would like to say a few words in support of the Amendment, because I believe there is a point of substance in it. From information which I have received, I believe it to be the case that Imperial Airways, for example, use their privileged position to: make things difficult for people who try to operate services on the same route. They certainly do not welcome competition, and they have great powers which E am not satisfied are exercised as fairly and impartially as they ought to be. I think that before these great sums of money are given to any company, assurances ought to be received&#x2014;and steps ought to be taken to see that those assurances are carried out&#x2014;that everybody will have an equal opportunity on those routes, whether subsidised or not. I do not say this as any criticism generally of Imperial Airways which, as I have said before in this House, have done admirable work. That, however, is no reason why they should misuse any of the powers given to them. Apart from that, this is an issue which will tend to arise more and more as we make further agreements concerning other parts of the world. My right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Air is at the present time dealing with applications from five different firms to run a service to South America, and he told me yesterday that the applications had all been sent back for certain reasons to those who made the tenders. I am bound to say that at any rate one of them has received no information whatever, so that, in fact, the statement which the right hon. Gentleman made seems to have been incorrect. I should be glad if he would be good enough to look into that point. When the subsidised service is run to South America it is conceivable that there may be other people willing to run a service without receiving a subsidy. If that be so, assurances ought to be given that the subsidised service will not use its powers

in any way to the detriment of other services.</p>

<p>I would like to support the Amendment if I could, but from the wording I cannot see how it would be applied. The words "shall agree to co-operate reasonably" present enormous difficulties which might have been removed if the Mover had inserted certain definite things which were to be within the power of the Secretary of State for Air. That which seems reasonable to an unsubsidised company may not seem reasonable to a subsidised company, and the fight which is now going on between the two is such that it brings some disgrace&#x2014;if I may use that word&#x2014;into the development of civil aviation, which we are trying to assist. If we are to have co-operation in British air transport, it seems to me that this is not the way to obtain it. One cannot ask a company which is not subsidised to co-operate with a company which is subsidised. What we ought to do is to put civil aviation on a national basis. It is absurd to subsidise one company and expect unsubsidised private enterprise to compete with it. If civil aviation is to be developed on a basis which will leave no room for such Amendments as the one which is now before us, every part of it must he under national control, and if that were the case all the difficulties which arise out of one company competing with another would be removed. We have heard to-day about the ever-increasing difficulties in air transport due to private enterprise. It has been pointed out that air transport does not pay, but those who say that always advocate that the corporate body shall spend some money on it. The demand for municipal aerodromes is illustrative of that. While it is known that air services do not pay as services, the municipalities or the nation are always asked to step in to assist in some way. Why not be reasonable and say that since civil aviation has to be assisted in that way, we will now enter into the business on a national basis and so complete the job?</p>

<p>I apologise that unavoidable circumstances precluded my being in my place at the time when you


called upon me to move this Amendment. With regard to the point which the hon. Member for Springburn (Mr. Hardie) raised, much as I would like to follow him, I do not think this is the time and opportunity to discuss national ownership of civil air transport. We are at the moment faced with the problem of dealing equitably both with subsidised and unsubsidised civil air transport companies, and I think that is the problem to which we must exclusively devote our attention. I suggest there is good reason for introducing this proviso in that Imperial Airways, Limited, which are clearly the largest recipient of these subsidies, appear to my hon. Friends and myself to be taking a view which is logical enough to them, but which appears to us not quite to embrace the conception of a subsidised company in civil air transport held by many hon. Members.<br/>
It boils clown to this main question: Are we subsidising Imperial Airways, Limited, for the benefit of the shareholders of that company, or are we subsidising them in order that we may develop British civil air transport throughout the Empire? I believe the latter is and has always been the intention of this House. Therefore, it is right that we should examine the attitude of Imperial Airways towards other civil aircraft operators who are not in receipt of subsidies. I will give two instances of the policy which Imperial Airways adopt. I would call that policy a hard commercial policy, but I would not in any way suggest that it is an improper policy. I would suggest that probably the Air Ministry have been at fault in the past in not making abundantly clear what are the general responsibilities of a subsidised company to other unsubsidised civil air transport companies. Therefore, if we can elucidate that position so that we may be clear in future, we shall have gained much by this new proviso.<br/>
First, there is the question as to whether there shall be reasonable co-operation between a subsidised company and an unsubsidised company so far as the reception of passengers and freight is concerned. I have here a memorandum, dated 11th February of this year, in which Imperial Airways made it abundantly plain to all their staff what was the atti-

tude of the company. The Memorandum says:
<q>If they," (that is, the unsubsidised companies) "ask us to carry loads of freight which, for some reason or other, they are unable to accommodate, we politely regret that owing to lack of space we are unable to assist them. With regard to any passengers they may not be able to carry on their services through cancelled services, we are not prepared to accept them straight from the companies concerned with a view to carrying them on behalf of those companies.</q>
That may be very much in the interests of the shareholders of Imperial Airways in that the air-travelling public will begin to realise that if, for any reason, the services of these unsubsidised companies are curtailed, or postponed, Imperial Airways will do nothing to assist those passengers to reach their destination. That is indicative of the attitude of this vast company with its strides right across the surface of the Empire. Here possibly is another little incident which is more intimate to the responsibilities of my right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Air. Last Monday, unfortunately, an aircraft of one of the unsubsidised companies crashed in the middle of Croydon aerodrome owing to the fact that the pilot omitted to wind down his undercarriage, which was of the retractile type. This is what the managing director of that company wrote by way of apology to the chief aerodrome officer at Croydon Aerodrome on the following day:
<q>With regard to the unfortunate accident which occurred late last night, when one of our machines came to grief in the middle of the aerodrome, we very much regret that we were unable to move the machine for many hours and that it had to remain right in the middle of the aerodrome during most of the night. We did our utmost to get the machine away as soon as possible, but as Imperial Airways were the only people who had suitable tackle for lifting and drawing the machine out of the way of other aircraft, we called upon them for assistance. They actually started the work, but when it was discovered by the officials of Imperial Airways that they were helping our firm, which is under their boycott, they immediately instructed their men to discontinue the work. It was too late at night to obtain any assistance beyond that which your own aerodrome staff were able to give us, and after many hours, with the help of several motor cars, we managed to tow the machine out of the way and to a position of safety. Unfortunately, our machine was severely damaged during this procedure. Regretting the inconvenience caused.&#x2026;</q>


That machine was not only a danger to Imperial Airways, but was a danger to all aircraft using Croydon aerodrome that night. It seems to me very serious that the civil air transport company which we have subsidised in this country should so fail to understand its general responsibilities to the country that it should allow a state of affairs such as I have read out to continue. I particularly wish to emphasise the fact that foreign aircraft operating companies regard their own capital cities as their own particular purview and responsibility. That is to say if any aircraft, German, British, French or Belgian crashed at the Tempelhof Aerodrome at Berlin, as any hon. Member who has been there and has seen the efficiency of that air-port will agree, the Deutsche Lufthansa, the German subsidised transport company, would immediately strain every nerve to have that aircraft removed in the shortest possible time.<br/>
These are not by any means all the incidents that I could bring to the attention of the House to show how necessary it is that this point should be cleared up as to the general responsibilities of subsidised air transport companies to the country, and thus to all other air transport operators. Hon. Members have talked frequently about the inability of certain air transport companies to use certain booking offices. That is another indication of the general trend of policy of our great subsidised company. I appeal to the Under-Secretary, if he cannot accept this Amendment, to give us a definite indication of the attitude of the Government towards all subsidised companies&#x2014;I do not speak only of Imperial Airways. I ask him to tell us whether he will call upon all these companies to behave, generally, in a manner which will assist the reputation and the development of British civil air transport. The point was made by the hon. Member opposite that there was a possibility of the word "reasonably" being misunderstood, but I do not think there is any fear of that. The word "reasonably" is to be interpreted by the Secretary of State in relation to what he considers to be "detrimental to such other services." I hope, in view of the strong support which I know is felt throughout the House for this proposal, that my right hon. Friend will be able to assist us in this matter.</p>

<p>I am sure the House is indebted to the hon. Member for Duddeston (Mr. Simmonds) for bringing before us information which is of grave importance when we are considering the principles upon which State subsidies should be granted to civil aviation companies. He made it clear that Imperial Airways, which is the company receiving the largest amount of subsidy&#x2014;up to a maximum of &#x00A3;1,500,000 a year&#x2014;is not only pursuing a policy of non-co-operation with other and smaller companies, which are not receiving subsidies but has embarked on a policy of boycott with regard to them. Indeed we have been confronted with examples of situations in which they have pursued a definitely anti-social policy. Here is the case of a machine which crashes in the middle of a Government aerodrome and because it belongs to a company which is a humble rival of Imperial Airways, they make no effort, in the interests of public safety, to remove the wreckage. It is precisely as if a hangar, outside the danger-zone of Imperial Airways property, at one of these aerodromes, were to burst into flames and Imperial Airways refused to help with fire-extinguishing apparatus.<br/>
Suppose the right hon. Baronet went on a, journey, incognito, and made the first part of that journey in an unsubsidised machine and endeavoured to continue it in an Imperial Airways machine. Apparently, if Imperial Airways knew that he had been giving his patronage to an unsubsidised company, they would refuse to carry him for the remainder of the journey and he might have to stop for a week, perhaps in the middle of the desert, until a service was provided for him. However reluctant the Minister may he to do anything which would arouse the displeasure of Imperial Airways, he must recognise that in this case a vital principle is at stake. I understand that those who move this Amendment are not tied to the words and I think that the words could be improved. I do not anticipate that the word "reasonably" will raise any difficulty of interpretation. It is a word which is being interpreted every day in the courts and is perhaps one of the words which gives rise to least trouble in the courts.<br/>
The second part of the proposal, however, may require some modification. One


difficulty is that the company receiving the subsidy is merely required to "agree to co-operate reasonably." I do not know whether that implies that failure so to agree, would involve the sanction of withdrawal of the subsidy. It should be made crystal clear that the provision will apply, if a company in receipt of a subsidy maintains an anti-social policy in the conduct of its services&#x2014;which we have shown to be possible&#x2014;or has a lesser degree of guilt in maintaining an attitude of non-co-operation or boycott towards its rivals, or has a still lesser degree of guilt in withholding its cordial co-operation from unsubsidised companies. The principle which we want to establish is that such a company should look upon these other companies not as rivals but as younger brothers, if I may put it in that way, engaged in the same great pioneer work of building up the civil aviation of this country. I sincerely hope that the right hon. Baronet will recognise the importance and reasonableness of the proposal and accept this Amendment, or something like it.</p>

<p>I wish to endorse all that has been said by the last two speakers. I have here the bills of a private flyer who had to land at various Imperial Airways ports between here and India. I do not think anyone will disagree with me as to the importance of encouraging private flying in this country at the present time. This pilot had to land at Gaza and there he was charged, in addition to the half-crown landing fee, no less than &#x00A3;1 for services in connection with the clearance of the aerodrome. He had to land at Gaza to clear the Customs and he was only on the ground for 30 minutes and all that the station superintendent had to do was to telephone to the Customs officer, approximately a mile-and-a-half away. For that, as I say, a fee of &#x00A3;1 was charged, and at every station where he landed on an Imperial Airways landing ground, the same extraordinarily heavy charges were made. In view of the fact that we pay a very sufficient subsidy to Imperial Airways and that in many cases the service of their aerodromes is provided for them. I think the least we might expect in return is that they should do all in their power to encourage anyone who has to use those aerodromes.<br/>
I should also like to mention the case of the Railway Clearing House and the subsidised lines. As hon. Members know, the Railway Clearing House is a body formed in order that railway companies might have certain power in regard to the sale of tickets on their lines by agencies. That has been extended to cover the booking of tickets on various air lines and the position to-day is that Messrs. Pickfords, Thomas Cook &amp; Son, Dean and Dawsons and other companies, are unable to sell tickets for some of the air lines of this country, and I think I am right in saying that they cannot sell tickets to people abroad for any British line other than Imperial Airways. I think it is an appalling situation that we in the House should allow that system to continue, when we all recognise the importance of encouraging civil aviation and when so much lip service is being paid to the importance of civil aviation. To quote one instance, the Blackpool and West Coast air services established the pioneer air service between Liverpool, Blackpool and the Isle of Man. I think I am right in saying that they were two years in advance of any railway air service but from the moment the railway services began to run their air line and they actually took over the aerodrome which had been provided by the pioneer company, it was impossible for any ticket to be issued by Cooks or any of the well-known travel agencies for the Blackpool and Liverpool lines. I think it is most important that we should have an assurance from the Under-Secretary that an end shall be put to that disgraceful state of affairs and I hope that, in addition to giving that assurance, he will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I suppose a case can be made out for the contention that the resources of a great company which has practically a monopoly should not be put at the disposal of its rivals. For instance, if a vehicle belonging to another undertaking breaks down on the road, it can be argued that there is no necessity for London Transport to get out their breakdown gear to clear the wreckage. But what shows itself clearly in this discussion is that unless we get a national spirit in these subsidised companies, the sooner they go the better and the sooner we go the whole hog and have a nationalised Imperial service the


better. If companies which are taking the British taxpayers' money are to behave like ordinary companies, competing one against the other, with no Imperial or national ideal, then they will go. We may pass Acts of Parliament thinking that we are going to have these subsidies for many years but things will change. Everything can be wiped out by the power of this House. Although it may be difficult for the Under-Secretary to accept this actual Amendment it is high time for him, speaking with the authority of the Government, to say clearly to all these undertakings which are accepting public money that they will have to behave themselves as the representatives of an Imperial interest.</p>

<p>I very much regret that I cannot accept the Amendment for reasons which I shall presently explain, but I am in full sympathy with the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Everard) who moved it and those who have supported it, in their desire to ensure that there shall be no abuse by subsidised companies of their position in any way that would be detrimental to British civil air aviation. Perhaps I may explain some of the difficulties in the way of accepting the Amendment. In the first place, I am advised that a provision of this kind would not be suitable for statutory enactment on various grounds. It would, for example, be extremely difficult to define what is and what is not reasonable co-operation. It might also be difficult to define what is detrimental to other services. In the second place, I would ask hon. Members to bear in mind that in this as in other matters there are, generally speaking, two sides to the question. A great many instances have been brought to notice to-night about various acts of unfriendliness by Imperial Airways towards other companies. I do not think that I can take up the time of the House or that hon. Members would wish me to in going into all these cases. I am sure that the House will agree that there is nothing to be gained by pursuing charges and counter-charges when we are all in substantial agreement on the matter. That would only make the position more difficult.<br/>
We all wish to ensure that between subsidised companies and unusubsidised companies there should be reasonable

co-operation in the interests of British civil aviation, and that there should be no tendency on the part of a subsidised company to abuse its position. I can assure hon. Members that the desire of the Air Ministry is to see fair play in this matter, and it is the policy of the Government that a subsidised company must not take an unfair advantage of its position. The Air Ministry is prepared to examine any representations from other companies which are brought before it and are <i>prima facie</i> reasonable, and, if the grounds of complaint are substantiated, to call on the company concerned to fulfil the understanding upon which the subsidy is based. The Air Ministry will make it perfectly clear when they grant a subsidy that it is given on the direct understanding that the company does not abuse its position. We think we shall thus ensure by effective administrative action, that while there shall be no interference with the free play of legitimate commercial competition, subsidised companies shall not snake use of their position in an unfair way because they are recipients of Government grants. I think that after this explanation and of the difficulty of framing a proviso such as this, hon. Members will realise that I have gone as far as I can to meet their desires.</p>

<p>It is a little more than that. Imperial Airways is a semi-State undertaking which is in a special position. If we are to make our present service efficient and satisfactory to the public, the Government must see


that the balance is fairly held between the various interests concerned. They must not be merely negative, but positive. It is true that these tourist agents under pressure are inclined to give a monopoly to the railway services and to Imperial Airways. We have to face facts. I understand that we want the country to be air-minded, and if anybody wishes to travel by air he goes to these agents. The Minister should make it clear to Imperial Airways, the railways and the tourist agents that if these kind of things are going on the Government will find it necessary to reorganise the whole of their policy and to change their attitude to Imperial Airways. There is a lot to be said for monopoly and a lot for competition, but at present we are in danger of having the worst of both possible worlds.</p>

<p>I do not think that the House should part with this matter in that way, because the statements made by the hon. Members for Duddeston (Mr. Simmonds) and Frome (Mrs. Tate) were very categorical, and it seems to me that they reveal a shocking state of affairs. I can recollect nothing like it since the days when insurance companies had their own fire brigades and a brigade was not

allowed to put out a fire which occurred at a house insured by a rival company. It is said that the firemen of one company went up to watch the fire to make sure that it did not accidentally go out. These statements are extremely serious because in one case, unless there is some answer to it, it seems that the people who prevented the removal of a wrecked aeroplane were acting against ordinary, common humanity. That involves the public interest. It is obvious that some unsuspecting person might attempt to land on an aerodrome and be severely injured in the process because somebody had refused to help, if the statement made by the hon. Member for Duddeston is true, and there has been no reply to it.<br/>
We understand that to remove that spirit the Under-Secretary proposes to address a stream of platitudes to the offending company. It was my experience as a schoolmaster that platitudes, while extremely gratifying to the person who utters them, have little effect on the party to whom they are addressed, and I sincerely hope that the right hon. Gentleman will arm himself with something more effective. [An HON. MEMBER: "Sanctions."] I would not trust them with sanctions. I imagine the answer of the right hon. Gentleman would be "I will try sanctions." There should be some fight behind the sanctions on this occasion, and it should be made clear that a repetition of the policy outlined this afternoon will be met with the withdrawal of the subsidy, and that what the House wishes is that there should be a widespread desire on the part of all concerned with this industry to help one another, especially to help private flyers in any difficulties which they may encounter in the course of their flying. I could hope that somebody speaking on behalf of the Government would say that they propose, in view of the instances which have been brought before the House, to arm themselves with effective powers to make it clear that if people who get subsidies attempt to make those subsidies into monopolies they are to be appropriately dealt with, and that they should regard the receipt of a subsidy not merely as a benefit but as conferring on them certain responsibilities with regard to any dangers that may be encountered by less fortunate people.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 3, at the end, to insert:
<q>(<i>c</i>) the intention of the Secretary of State to consider proposals for an air transportation scheme covering the route involved in the agreement shall be publicly advertised and reasonable opportunity shall be given for the presentation of competing offers; the Secretary of State may however in the case of Imperial Airways, Limited, be authorised to omit this action provided that public notice thereof is given.</q>
Perhaps I may explain the circumstances under which I have put down this Amendment. When the Bill was before the House on 25th May, in Committee, I moved an Amendment which in terms was very similar, and after considerable debate the Solicitor-General was good enough to say that, while he could not accept the actual wording of the Amendment, he would, subject to certain alterations, give an undertaking on behalf of the Government to put down an Amendment on the Report stage. I am quite certain that he had every intention of honourably carrying out that pledge, but I understand that certain technical drafting points have arisen which seem to make it difficult to find a suitable form of words. Therefore, as a contribution, and only as a contribution, to the subject of finding the right terms, I have put down my Amendment. I understand that the difficulty is the exclusion of the right already granted or to be granted to Imperial Airways, by which they are to be the sole contractors on certain routes. Obviously, where that has been done, it would not be fair to insist on competition and to call in other people. I do not know whether these particular words meet the case, but I attach some importance to the words at the end of the

Amendment, "provided that public notice thereof is given," because if that were done, that, I should have thought, would prevent any possibility of the Air Ministry attempting, in any case highly improbable, to get round the understanding by granting to Imperial Airways some agreement to which they were not really entitled and which ought to be subject to competition.<br/>
The Government may say&#x2014;and I quite appreciate the point&#x2014;that they have made a new and a very specific declaration that it is their intention to give public notice such as is referred to in my Amendment wherever competition is to take place. I agree that that meets the point now, but it is not statutory, and it may be that in the future the Air Ministry will not be staffed with such a far-sighted statesman as is the case at the present moment. It might be staffed by a man with a more restricted view of their responsibilities, and, as he would be quite entitled to do, he might say that in future they could not give any public notice when a contract was to be made. I hope the Solicitor-General and other hon. Members will assist in the task of finding a form of words which will carry out the undertaking which the Government gave and which I know they are anxious to implement, but if it is not possible to do so, I quite appreciate that it may be necessary to release the Government from their undertaking.</p>

<p>As it is owing to my perhaps over-exuberant observation on the Committee stage that


this matter arises, perhaps I ought to explain exactly how the situation stands at present. On the Committee stage the hon. Gentleman who has moved this Amendment moved an Amendment which had two limbs to it. The first was to provide that each agreement made for the payment of a subsidy should be laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than 14 days, and that if either House during that period carried an Address against it, it should have no effect. That was the first limb of his Amendment. The second was that the intention of the Secretary of State to consider proposals for an air transportation scheme covering the route involved in the agreement should be publicly advertised and reasonable opportunity given for the presentation of offers on a competitive basis. As regards the first limb of his Amendment, that is to say, the laying of the agreement on the Table of the House and the power of the House to annul it, no specific undertaking was given. All that I said was that it would be looked into; but, as regards the second limb, it divided into two parts by me, and what I said was that the Government could not accept the final part dealing with the presentation of offers on a competitive basis. I will quote my exact words. I said:
<q>My right hon. Friend is not prepared at the moment to accept the words in the second part of the Amendment. The hon. Member suggests that a reasonable opportunity should be given for the presentation of offers on a competitive basis. We do not wish to incorporate in an Act of Parliament anything that will suggest, even in the remotest degree, that we ever intend to allow this new service to get into the state of competitive chaos which exists in the United States.</q>
I made is perfectly clear that we could not accept the latter part of his Amendment, and the same considerations apply to that part of his present Amendment which deals with reasonable opportunity for the presentation of competing offers. I do not recognise any undertaking or any obligation on that question. But I went on to say:
<q>We will endeavour to avoid that, and for that reason we do not like the words 'competitive basis' at the end. Subject to that, it is the intention of the Government before the Report stage to frame an Amendment which will carry out the meaning which my hon. Friend intends to attach to the Clause."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th May, 1936; col. 1731; Vol. 312.]</q>

That was an undertaking that before the Report stage we would endeavour to put into words as a statutory necessity that the Secretary of State should publish his intention to make proposals. Having given no undertaking to the hon. Gentleman about laying the agreement on the Table, we have now put on the Paper&#x2014;and it will be moved in an Amendment at a later stage by my right hon. Friend, so that it would not be in order for me to discuss it now&#x2014;an Amendment providing that every agreement shall be laid on the Table of the House and that the House shall have an opportunity of annulling it, so that we are according the power for which he asks. This is the undertaking that has been given by the Secretary of State in absolutely explicit terms:
<q>In order that in future there may be no conceivable ground of grievance or misunderstanding, my Noble Friend proposes that so soon as a decision has been reached in principle that a new service shall he inaugurated or a new route opened up in an area not covered by existing arrangements, publicity shall be given to that decision, whether by announcement in this House or through the medium of the Press, so that all who are or may be interested shall have an equal opportunity of submitting proposals.</q>
There has been that absolutely explicit undertaking by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>It is an undertaking which I do not imagine any Secretary of State in future would consider he was entitled to overlook, but supposing that the danger that the hon. Gentleman pointed out, were to arise, it is met by our acceptance of the first part of the Amendment, because we have provided that he can annul, by an Address of the House, any agreement which is put on the Table. So that we have complete control. If the Secretary of State brings forward an agreement in respect of a route which has not been made public in the way in which the undertaking suggests, all that the hon. Gentleman or anybody has to do is to move to annul the agreement under the powers that will be incorporated in the Bill by the next Amendment on the Paper. I venture to suggest, therefore, that in these circumstances it is unnecessary, in the first instance, for any provision of this kind to be put in an Act of


Parliament. It would be merely cumbrous and repeat something that exists.<br/>
I recognise that there was this undertaking, but that is not the sole answer I would desire to give. Not only have the Department and the draftsmen been into this matter of implementing this undertaking, but, needless to say, I was sensitive of the undertaking I gave and I have been at some pains to consider whether it was practicable to carry it into effect. I am satisfied that, on the material we have at present, no draftsman could satisfactorily frame an Amendment. Let me explain in a little more detail why that state of affairs exists. At the present time there are agreements under discussion between the Ministry and Imperial Airways. There are drafts in various forms and skeleton proposals; there are understandings, and nothing more. There are also existing agreements and prospective agreements which will be effective if this Bill comes into operation, but may not take effect for some time. These will cover all the different parts of the Empire routes, and until a position has been reached when a new service has been inaugurated or a new route opened up in an area not covered by existing agreements, it will be impossible to draft a Clause which will exclude potential existing arrangements in respect of which there is an honourable undertaking.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the final words are not satisfactory because they deal with Imperial Airways, and there is no agreement with Imperial Airways. There is only an intention to deal with them. There is also at least one agreement with another company, so that that case would not be covered. It would not be satisfactory to incorporate in an. Act of Parliament something which ties the Government down in a way that was very much objected to on the Committee stage as being even a possibility of entering into an agreement with Imperial Airways. It is a possibility, at any rate, that the agreement might not be concluded. I am not saying that it is a practical possibility, but in a technical sense it is a possibility. For these and many other reasons, the

limiting words which the hon. Gentleman has put down, no doubt as a result of a conversation he had with me, do not, I think, meet the position. For the reasons that we cannot do it in practice at the present time, that in any case we are, by accepting the first part of the Amendment, doing everything that can reasonably be expected, and that to-day I have reiterated with full responsibility the undertaking which has been given, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acquit me from my largeness of promise on the last occasion, and will not press his Amendment.</p>

<p>I must confess to some disappointment that it has not been found practicable to frame a form of words which covers this point. If that be so, I cannot dispute it because I am not in a position to suggest words. I fully appreciate that the hon. and learned Gentleman has done his utmost to carry out the promise that he gave and has found it impracticable. He has met me on the other point where no other promise was made, and, while there is no question of any bargaining, I believe that he has done his best, and I ant willing to accept the position and ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 8, to leave out Sub-section (3), and to insert:
<q>(3) It shall be a term of every agreement made in pursuance of this section between the Secretary of State and a company that no subsidy shall he payable under the agreement unless such directions (if any) as may be given by the Secretary of State for securing that one or more of the directors of the company shall be a person or persons nominated by the Secretary of State are complied with.</q>
<q>(4) A copy of every agreement made in pursuance of this section shall, as soon as may be after the agreement is made, be laid before each House of Parliament and if either House, within fourteen days from the day on which a copy of such an agreement is laid before it, resolves that the agreement he annulled, the agreement shall thenceforth be void, without prejudice, however, to the making of a new agreement.</q>
<q>In reckoning any period of fourteen days for the purposes of this sub-section no account shall be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued, or during which both Houses of Parliament are adjourned for more than four days.</q>


The new Sub-section (3) puts in proper statutory form the proposal that has been accepted that the Secretary of State shall be entitled to appoint one or more representatives on the board of any subsidised company. The new Subsection (4) meets the object of the proposal made that subsidy agreements should, after being made, be laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than 14 days.</p>

My proposal is that the Minister should be obliged to nominate a director to the board of any company in receipt of a subsidy rather than that it should be left to his discretion to do so.

<p>It does read, but it does not read quite as well as it might have done, for the Clause itself does not read as it is intended to read. I shall, I think, show the right hon. Baronet that, whether he accepts my alteration or not, he will have to make a drastic alteration to his Amendment before it goes on the Statute Book. The Amendment is intended to empower the Minister, if he thinks fit, to nominate one or more directors and to require the company to accept his proposals. He has power under the Amendment to nominate all the directors of the company and the company may be compelled to accept that. It will be necessary for the right hon. Gentleman to make some Amendment to the Amendment because it says,
<q>for securing that one or more of the directors of the company shall be a person or persons nominated by the Secretary of State.</q>
If he requires that eight directors of Imperial Airways shall be nominated by the Secretary of State, the company will have to accept that proposal. I believe

that the reason this mistake was made was that, in drafting this Amendment, the right hon. Gentleman noticed that it was within his discretion to nominate directors and, feeling that he would always be able to avoid the necessity of nominating directors, he was not quite so punctilious in examining the Amendment as he would otherwise have been.<br/>
The principle in the Amendment that I am proposing to the Amendment is that, where a subsidy is paid, the Secretary of State shall nominate one or more directors, and that the number shall be proportionate to the size of the board and the company. That is the respect in which the wording of the Amendment to the Amendment is not as precise as it might have been. We have not been encouraged on this side to devote the large amount of time and thought to the drafting of our Amendments that we should have devoted had we found that they are treated with more respect and receptivity by the right hon. Baronet. I do not say that in a personal sense, but I consider that he has not been sufficiently willing to meet sound principles when they have been put forward.</p>

<p>This is a concession which the right hon. Baronet gives with one hand and takes away with the other. When we were discussing the Clause we said we wanted to establish the principle of no subsidy without a Government director on the board, and what the right hon. Baronet has given us is an Amendment to give him the power to nominate a director if he thinks fit. We know how that will operate in practice. There will be a small company receiving, say, &#x00A3;20,000 a year subsidy. They will meet at the Air Ministry to discuss the amount, and four or five hard-boiled city men will say, "Of course, you are not going to push a Government director on to us in this case, are you?" and the Minister will say, "I do not think it is necessary because the amount is so small." We do not want to put that power in the hands of the Minister. He has shown himself at every stage of this Bill to be suffering from a prejudice against the State being introduced into civil aviation at all. The least principle he can concede to us is that where a subsidy is paid he must nominate a director.<br/>
We have heard in the discussion on new Clauses to-day that companies in receipt of subsidies have not shown their responsibilities to the public in the way that they ought to have done. It has been shown that the largest of the companies in receipt of a subsidy has maintained a policy of non-co-operation bordering on boycott against companies endeavouring to develop civil aviation without the subsidy. What were the two Government directors doing on Imperial Airways when these matters were being discussed? It is not sufficient that the right hon. Gentleman should have the discretion to appoint directors. It is not even sufficient that he should be required to appoint directors. He should be required to appoint them and see that they carry out their job. I suggest, without imputing any personal neglect on the part of any directors of civil aviation companies in receipt of subsidies, that they should be instructed what their duties are, namely, to look after the principle that, if a subsidy is being received by civil aviation companies, the public interest must be put, at any rate, equal to the private interests of the companies.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman accepts the Amendment to the Amendment, as I hope and believe he will, I trust that he will see that persons of the right type are made directors of these companies. It is no use making it a sort of retired job for military officers. I make no complaint against the Government directors of Imperial Airways; I have never met them; but I believe they have been appointed principally for the purpose of looking after the strategical factors involved in the development of civil aviation. Let us make certain that in future appointments of directors the Government will appoint men who know something about civil aviation and commerce and will not look upon it as a plum by which some gallant soldier can augment his pension. I hope the Minister will accept this very reasonable proposal on the lines on which he indicated he would accept it during the previous Debate.</p>

<p>We are trying to establish the principle that where the nation gives money the nation ought to have representation, and further to that point

arises the character of the representation. We want to get away from the "money-bug" type of directors, the gentleman who is not necessarily an ex-naval or ex-military man, but of the type that is about the City of London, always waiting for a chance to make money. The type of director we want ought to have activity, plus knowledge. I have come in contact with many hon. and right hon. Members in this House, and judging their knowledge by what they say I think, on looking at their directorships, that they are not being paid for what they know, but what they can do. We want to guard against any of this interloping business, against appointments being made on the grounds of friendship or business contacts. We want to put this matter on a purely business basis and to appoint only men who have knowledge of the subject, because we cannot expect to get things done if the people in charge do not know what they are doing. That it what is wrong in so many cases at the present time. The Directory of Directors clearly shows that. If we could get rid of this incubus which is simply sucking the life out of many industrial concerns to-day a great many things would immediately improve. I hope the Under-Secretary will say that he is prepared to grant what we are seeking, in order to leave things more clean, if I may put it that way.</p>

<p>I am afraid that I cannot accept the Amendment of the hon. Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Garro Jones) which asks for a great deal more than was asked for by the right hon. Member for Stirling and Clackmannan (Mr. Johnston). He did not ask that it should be mandatory upon the Secretary of State to appoint a director, only that he should be entitled to do so. We have gone as far as we could to meet his request and have carried out in detail the undertaking we gave on that occasion, because when my right hon. Friend said that he proposed later to put down an Amendment he said that it must be regarded as non-mandatory and that it would be left to the Secretary of State to exercise his discretion in each case. In my submission it would be absurd to make this mandatory. Many of these are small companies, even if they are limited


liability companies at all, consisting of two or three people with only a small amount of capital, and to make it imperative for the Government to nominate a representative on the board of such a company when, possibly, it is to receive only a small amount of subsidy, on one specific occasion, for carrying out a single service, would be so absurd a proposal that it could not be accepted either by this Government or by a Government which took, perhaps, a stronger view about the desirability of having Government representation on the board. Even if this Amendment were accepted the gap would not be stopped, because this Clause deals only with a company. How about a partnership? How about a concern run by only one person with a few aeroplanes? To be logical the Government would have to be empowered to introduce somebody into the partnership. I think the concession which has been made by my right hon. Friend to meet the case put forward by the right hon. Member for Stirling and Clackmannan is a very real one, and will meet that case, and I hope the hon. Gentleman's Amendment will not be accepted.</p>

<p>I can assure the Solicitor-General that we are not prepared to admit that there is the absurdity which he appears to find in this Amendment. The suggestion of the right hon. Member for Stirling and Clackmannan (Mr. Johnston) was tentative in character, and I am sure he would accept this Amendment. The Solicitor-General ought to give better reasons for rejecting it than he has so far put forward. He talks about small companies and about two or three persons working in partnership, and says that it would be ridiculous for the State to insist upon a representative of the public being upon the board in such cases. I would point out that the Under-Secretary's Amendment speaks of "the term of every agreement,"&#x2014;does not say that the appointment to the board shall be permanent, but that it shall be made in respect of work done or services rendered for which a subsidy is given by the State. If there is any justification for giving a public subsidy the work will be of importance and it will be carried out by companies of some substance, and this argument about little tinpot companies receiving public subsidy is not a reasonable one

to put forward. It does not meet the case for the Government to say they have complied with the tentative suggestion put forward by the right hon. Member for Stirling and Clackmannan. We have gone much further in the discussion of this Measure since then. We appreciate the extent to which the Government have given way to criticism and have met the Opposition and other sections of the House, and we feel there is nothing absurd, unreasonable or illogical in asking that this power should be made mandatory rather than left to the discretion of the Minister.</p>

<p>I realise that there is a good deal in what the Solicitor-General said about the hon. Gentleman's Amendment, but is not this a case to be dealt with on the same lines as he dealt with an Amendment of mine, and that is that there should be a declaration of the Government's intention, which would be to a large extent binding. I think we are entitled to ask from the Government an assurance that when they are dealing with companies of a substantial size and with a good deal of capital it is their intention to exercise the power to appoint one or more directors. In the case of the service to South America, for which tenders are now being asked, I should like to know whether the Government have any intention of exercising this power of appointing a director on the board of the company whose tender is accepted. I think we ought to get an assurance from the Government, because otherwise we may be furnishing them with a power which they have not the remotest intention of exercising. If the hon. and learned Gentleman would give us such an assurance it would go a long way to reconciling some of us to his inability to accept the hon. Gentleman's Amendment.</p>

This Amendment, taken in conjunction with the one that follows, is in accordance with an undertaking given in Committee. The hon. Member for Central Bradford (Mr. Leach) moved an Amendment to provide for the appointment by the Secretary of State of an independent member of the Board, and I have put it down as an official Amendment.

<p>An Amendment was moved by an hon. Gentleman on the other side of the House to leave out "(if any) as may" and to insert "to," and that is what we have been talking about.

<p>The hon. and gallant Gentleman has not quite followed it. Unless the original Subsection had been omitted, it would not have been in order to move an Amendment that the proposed new Sub-sections should be inserted in place of the old one. The House agreed to leave out the words,

<p>Surely what happened was that the original Sub-section (3) was left out, and then the right hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary formally moved to insert the other words. An Amendment was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Garro Jones), and that was the Amendment on which the Division took place. That Amendment was declared by you from the Chair defeated. I suggest that you did not put the question that the proposed new Subsection be there inserted.</p>

<p>I am somewhat in the hands of the House. If hon. Members wish to raise points upon individual Amendments, we had better take them separately.

<p>I should like to ask one question. Under the new board which is being set up, there are, so to speak, four panels. There are four instructors,

four nominees of the operators, and four nominees of the insurance companies. I understand that these 12 are to elect four other members outside those interests. Is this particular person, who is to be put in independently of those interests, to be one of the four to be elected by the other 12, or is he an extra one, appointed by the Secretary of State himself?</p>

<p>I rise to thank the Under-Secretary for having come to an agreement with those who were trying to put the case of the professional pilot, and to welcome very much the way in which he has inserted the provision into the Bill, but I cannot pass by this Amendment quite so rapidly as he has done. There is a great deal of misunderstanding, certainly among those outside the House who are concerned with the carrying out of this great Bill, first of all, as to how this original body was set up. We have had only a very short sentence, given to us a few weeks ago by the Solicitor-General. According to the OFFICIAL REPORT, he said:
<q>In August, 1934, letters were sent to the principal aviation interests inviting them to form a representative committee to frame a scheme for the consideration of the Secretary of State, and a committee was formed under the chairmanship of Mr. Handley Page for this express purpose."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th May, 1936; col. 1759, Vol. 312.]</q>


That is all that we were told. Those of us who have to find out things as best we can have more or less come to the conclusion that two very big organisations in the country, one the Society of British Aircraft Constructors&#x2014;</p>

<p>I hardly think that we are entitled, on this Amendment, to deal with that matter.</p>

<p>I will not go beyond your Ruling, but, if the pilot who joins this board is to be of any independent value, he must be nominated by someone other than his employer, because otherwise he becomes merely a delegate or nominee. I will not go over the speech I delivered when the Under-Secretary saw the point and very kindly surrendered, but I would ask him to give us a little further information as to who is going to nominate this independent pilot. I have mentioned the Society of British Aircraft Constructors in order to draw the attention of the House to the fact that they were approached as a body, and have nominated their people. Coming to the operators, we must guess, because we do not know, but in all probability Imperial Airways will hold the field and will nominate people to represent them as operators. We know now that there are to be four independent persons, and I presume that the pilot referred to in the Under-Secretary's Amendment is to be an independent person, but I am not in a position to say to my own pilots&#x2014;I have the honour of representing the Guild of Air Pilots&#x2014;that the distinction has been conferred upon them or upon some other body, for the nomination will be of an independent character. I do not see any sense in nominating a pilot who is a servant of one of the operators or one of the constructors if we are to get a fair deal and if the pilots' point of view is to receive proper consideration.<br/>
I think we are entitled to ask the Under-Secretary definitely whether he is going to appoint the pilot in question. I do not mind if he does, but, if the pilot is appointed by his own employer, he will not dare to say that a machine is badly constructed or flies badly, because he would lose his job. Therefore, I ask for a definite statement from the Under-Secretary as to how the nomination is going to be made, and I press this point because I think it is only fair

to the public, seeing that it is the pilot who takes care of the public. The operator stands on the ground, and so does the constructor, but the pilot does the work. It is the pilot who takes care of the lives of the human beings who entrust themselves to his care, and, if he is not independent, he might just as well not be on the board at all. If the Under-Secretary cannot see his way to reply now on this point, I shall raise it again on the Third Reading.</p>

<p>The question which the right hon. and gallant Gentleman has raised is a very important one. The Under-Secretary will remember that he has just said, in reply to a question, that the person appointed by the Secretary of State as an independent person would be in addition to the members of the last of the four sections comprising the board, and the Clause itself says that he shall be appointed by the Secretary of State. It is very significant that as regards the pilot there is no indication as to whether he is to be in addition to the 16 or whether he is to be just one of those four who are co-opted by the other 12, and I think we should have an assurance upon that point. I should like to take this opportunity of adding my thanks on behalf of the Opposition to the Under-Secretary for meeting us on these two points so well as he has. So far as that goes, it makes the Bill a better Bill than it was.</p>

<p>I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for the Drake Division (Captain Guest) on having persuaded the Under-Secretary to include a pilot in this body. I represent the Royal Aeronautical Society, and I put before them the question whether they wished to be represented on such a panel. They said that they did not. I think that the claims of societies to be represented on a panel like this are really as substantial as those of the pilots, but from a Parliamentary point of view we are in a, little difficulty, because, in setting up statutory bodies of this kind in a Bill like this, it, is usual to state in the Bill itself who is to represent what. Here, however, we have a very extraordinary state of affairs, in which the Secretary of State may by


Order proceed to delegate to a body appearing to him to be substantially representative. In other words, he will look about for a body which happens to coincide with his desires. That would be a very extraordinary thing if it had not happened that, long before this Bill was adumbrated, the industry itself had set up a body, rather similar to Lloyds' in the insurance world, which was actually dealing with risks and issuing certificates of airworthiness. That disappeared, but some of the gentlemen who were on that organisation met and decided that the organisation should go on. In re-forming that organisation, it has, of course, to be re-formed according to the desires of the Minister, because otherwise it would not be a body appearing to him to be substantially representative, and I take it that obviously it will include a representative of the pilots in addition to the fourth section, which itself is additional to the three other sections which are the foundation of the panel.</p>

<p>My right hon. and gallant Friend appears to take a rather different view from myself. He draws attention to the fact that the pilots are not mentioned as an association, but I would point out that none of the other associations is mentioned in the Bill; there is no mention of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors, Imperial Airways or anyone else. The whole thing is being organised, I understand, by this authority which has been convened by the Secretary of State, and is now busily engaged in setting up its own organisation, with representatives of different bodies. The whole question seems to me to boil down to this: Is this extra representative to be additional to the 16? There is already to be a 17th representative; will he be the 18th, or is the Secretary of State going to have some say with the board in order to earmark one of the last category of four in the 16 as this particular pilot? It does not seem to make very much difference really. I have the greatest confidence in my right hon. Friend, and know that the pilot will be someone who will be independent.<br/>
Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I have no objection to making the num-

ber 18 instead of 16. But I think it would be a pity to put in the name of any particular organisation. If that were done, the Royal Aero Club, of which at the moment I have the honour to be the chairman, would, I am sure, expect to be included, and no doubt every organisation would expect its name to be put into the Bill. The only point that really arises is whether this person is to be nominated by the Secretary of State or is to be co-opted by the other members of the body. I have no feeling in the matter at all, but I should imagine that it would be better that he should be nominated by the Secretary of State as an extra member.</p>

<p>The desire was expressed in Committee that a person should be on this board as a pilot. It may well be that on the list that the Minister receives from the various bodies there will be someone nominated who incidentally may be a pilot. He will not have been appointed because he is a pilot but because he represents one of these three major interests and happens to have the requisite amount of professional service as a pilot. I do not think that the recognition of such a person as fulfilling the requirement of this Amendment would be quite carrying out the spirit of the discussion that we had in Committee. I think it was the sense of the Committee that we should have a person who would be more or less nominated by some such body as that of which the hon. Member for the Drake Division (Captain Guest) is the president, who could be regarded as representative of pilots and who would be speaking for them. I hope it may be possible that this person may not be taken from the persons representative of other interests but may be an 18th member who shall be on because he is a pilot and for no other reason.</p>

I was, therefore, surprised to find to-day that it did not meet in any way with his approval. It is obvious from the discussion that we have had that the sense


of the House is that we should have a representative of pilots on the board&#x2014;definitely a representative of independent pilots&#x2014;and that if the other groups on the board were to nominate him it might lead&#x2014;although I do not agree&#x2014;to the appointment of someone who was sufficiently under their control for him not to be able to bring to bear the full measure of independent assistance and experience that might be necessary. I am, therefore, willing to meet my right hon. and gallant Friend to this extent that he should be an independent member nominated by the Secretary of State.</p>

<q>Provided that this section shall not apply to any person engaged upon trade


union business with persons employed in connection with the aerodrome.</q>
When I raised this question on the Second Reading, the right hon. Baronet's reply was that the question of trade union representatives on aerodromes was a matter between the trade union and the contractor doing repair work or erecting buildings and so forth. That is all very well and, if it were just a question of the contractor and the trade union, it might be left where it is. But it is proposed in the Bill to give a third party the power to control entry upon the aerodrome, and it is very necessary that that power should be given, but we are very much concerned about the possible misuse of it. There is the possibility that people with certain prejudices in connection with trade union matters will use the power given them to make it difficult for trade union representatives to carry out business which in many trades is regarded as quite normal. I speak particularly of the building industry, where the attendance of a trade union representative upon the job is a regular thing. My experience with regard to this matter has been at service aerodromes. When I was at the Ministry the matter was very urgent and many trade unions were raising the question of the attitude of certain commanding officers with regard to the entry upon aerodromes of trade union representatives and the manner in which they should conduct themselves. All that we desire to do is to safeguard the position and not to interfere with discipline and control of the aerodrome grounds, but we desire that the common and normal method of trade union representation and control shall not be interfered with merely as the result of the prejudice of other persons who previously had not been able to exercise any influence in that direction.</p>

<p>I am sorry to have to interrupt the harmonious trend which we have been pursuing lately in accepting practically all the Amendments put before us, but I am afraid the Government cannot accept this Amendment, and for very good reasons. It would be entirely anomalous to insert in a Clause which deals with trespass that one particular type of person should not be dealt with if he is a trespasser. If he is a trade

union official going about his duty, he is not a trespasser, but if he is trespassing on land forming part of an aerodrome, it is a little difficult to see why such an entirely anomalous provision should be made in favour of one class of person. If that is not class legislation with a vengeance, I really do not know what is. You might say, for example, that* lawyers entering neighbouring aerodromes should not be dealt with for trespassing on land forming part of an aerodrome. Where is the matter to stop? If trade unions were thought by Parliament to require some special kind of provision, it ought to be in some general Act dealing with the matter, but it is most inappropriate that a provision of this kind should be put in a special part of this Bill.</p>

In other words, any such person engaged in trade union business cannot be guilty of a trespass. There are plenty of circumstances in which he would not be guilty of trespass and would not come under the Clause, but to give him a general licence, as the Amendment would do, to commit trespass, I am sure, is not what the hon.

<p>When we were dealing with the matter before, the whole question of trade union representation was brought into the picture and the history of the fight for the rights of men to stand at the gates was gone into, and I am surprised that we are wasting the time of the House going over that matter again. This is not a case of ordinary trespass. We dealt with that matter in the last Debate. Trespass was defined that night, and the Attorney-General Lad to submit certain things which meant a great change from what was done in the Bill at the time. We ask for this Amendment because of the practice of a great many organisations and employers, who insist on preventing their workers from exercising the right to organise and their representatives from seeing

whether the conditions under which they should be employed are being carried out, and whether or not the proper wages are being paid. We have, as working-class people, always to fight against that kind of organisation.<br/>
The Amendment is a purely working-class claim. The Attorney-General, on the last occasion on which he spoke, said that there was no such thing as trespass in Britain. The law of trespass does not exist so far as a person moving about is concerned, but it does exist if that person moves about in a way that he does some damage, which is quite a different thing. In this Bill, for the first time as far as I am aware, the Government seek to prevent what has always been the custom, namely, the right of the secretary of a trade union or trade unions to have access to the place where his members are working. I can see tremendous difficulties arising if this part of the Clause is not changed. This kind of work will be such that it will require specialists in many cases, and if something goes wrong and for some reason or other the men refuse to work, what will be the method of dealing with them? If you leave the matter as it is, you cannot expect the secretary of a trade union to come and attempt to deal with the difficulties. The idea seems to be in the mind of the Solicitor-General that if the proposal in the Amendment were accepted these men would always be running about the aerodrome. There would be nothing of the kind. The man who looks after trade union business goes to the place where his men may be when he is wanted. He is not always running after them. I hope that it will be seen clearly that on the question of trespass nothing can be brought against the Amendment. The rights of trade unions have been long recognised and the Government should not pinprick in this way. Let us get the thing through in the proper spirit.</p>

<p>I entirely agree with what the Solicitor-General has said with regard to the Amendment, and I am rather surprised that during the moving of the Amendment no legal supporters of the Opposition were present. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh, yes."] Then I am rather surprised that not one of them got up to speak about it before the Solicitor-General spoke. However, as


the Labour party have their legal defenders here I shall wait and see what they have to say to the Solicitor-General. The hon. Member who moved the Amendment referred to cases where representatives of trade unions had tried to approach commanding officers on certain service aerodromes, and he wanted the House to understand that in those instances they were not received very well by the commanding officers. That is a general statement. He knows as well as I do that if such things did occur and the trade union representatives were on lawful business they had a remedy, as any legal adviser would explain. If a trade union representative goes to an aerodrome on lawful business, he is not trespassing. If, however, the words of the Amendment were inserted in the Clause, then undoubtedly, as the Solicitor-General explained, we should be licensing a certain class to be trespassers. That, as the Solicitor-General said, would be class legislation of the worst type. I am sure that the Labour party would not desire such a thing, because from what I recollect of their speeches they do not want class legislation. Why, therefore, should we make the mistake of falling into an error now? Those who drew up the Amendment did not, I should imagine, consult the legal advisers of the Labour party, otherwise they would not have needed to ask the Solicitor-General to explain what was meant by the law of trespass.

<p>I should like to put to the Solicitor-General the position which the Amendment postulates. Does he suggest that in the circumstances related by the Mover of the Amendment a trade union organiser entering the property of an aerodrome is in precisely the same position as a trade union organiser entering the property of a private person? A trade union organiser is placed at a disadvantage because trespass is here made a criminal offence, whereas if he enters the property of a private person the trespass may be a civil offence. Therefore, there is a vast difference in the situation created

between trespass on to an aerodrome under this Clause and on private property not covered by a Clause of this character. We suggest that a trade union organiser should not only have the same facilities as are offered to him by private employers, without much trouble, but that he should have facilities extended to him so- that in no circumstances could it be suggested that he had broken the criminal law. As a general rule trespass is a civil offence and not a criminal offence. I respectfully submit to the Solicitor-General that a trade union organiser going on to the property of an aerodrome is decidedly at a disadvantage and may be subject to interference by some truculent person, unless this Clause is amended, and he may be brought before the magistrates and fined &#x00A3;5.</p>

<p>The only Clause that I can recollect that is anything like this one is a Clause that operates in regard to railways, where it is made an offence to trespass on a railway. In that case the penalty is only 40s. I have always understood that that Clause was inserted to make it a rather expensive form of committing suicide if you change your mind after you have started on the project. I suggest to the Solicitor-General that trespass, generally speaking, is not an offence. We all know that owners of property put up notices: "Trespassers will be prosecuted," but everybody knows that that is a prophecy which will never be fulfilled unless a person incidentally commits some damage. He may then be proceeded against. There is also the case that he may be trespassing in pursuit of coneys. That offence, I understand, is not one of trespass, but that he was in pursuit of rabbits. It is desirable that this point should be placed clear of doubt.<br/>
The occasion when a trade union representative is likely to be refused admission to an aerodrome, when he is engaged on trade union business, is likely to be at a time when feelings are rather heated, and some of the people who may subsequently have to deal with him&#x2014;I do not want to say more about it than this&#x2014;may also be feeling some of the heat that ha? been engendered by the strike at the aerodrome. It is, therefore, very important that it should be made absolutely clear of doubt that if a man


goes there on trade union business and not merely because he is a trade union official, he is not committing an offence.<br/>
The Solicitor-General may have led the House to think that the Amendment would guarantee exemption to any person who was a trade union official, no matter what might be his business at the aerodrome. That is not so. It does not exempt a trade union official simply because he is a trade union official. It says only that if a person is there doing trade union business he shall not be a trespasser. The position is entirely different from the one stated by the Solicitor-General, and I hope the Government will see their way to remove all doubt by accepting the Amendment. If the Clause means no more than the words say, then all that the Solicitor-General can say against it is that it is unnecessary. If it is unnecessary and if people have the right to go to an aerodrome on trade union business without being trespassers, there can be no great harm in making certain of it by putting it into the Bill.</p>

<p>Is it not possible for the Solicitor-General, having regard to what has been said, to accept the Amendment? If he cannot accept the Amendment he might accept other words with a similar object. The words in the Clause are: "If any person trespasses." That phrase infers that no one has any legitimate right to be present on that particular ground. If it is the intention of the Government that in regard to aerodromes and the performance of work there should be proper co-ordination, then, the workpeople and those connected with the workpeople should have all the facilities which are essential for proper co-operation. Surely, it is not the intention of the Government that any protective Clause which gives access to workmen is to prevent any official legitimately engaged in trade union work from having access. The officials connected with aerodromes and the type of labour there are of a highly technical class and are men who will be required for co-operation.<br/>
If we are going to give exemption to any organisations of labour from the law of trespass it should be contained within the Bill. The Solicitor-General is not so dense as not to know the point which is

now being argued. I agree that the wording of the Amendment does not carry out exactly what is intended, but the Solicitor-General is aware that we are contending for a right of access for those who are entitled to go to these particular places to deal with the men in legitimate hours. It is not intended to deal with a man who is wandering about an aerodrome at night time, when the men are not engaged in their business, and who, when a policeman comes up and says "Who are you? ", replies "I am a trade union organiser," and who, when the policeman says "I am going to lock you up for trespass," says "You cannot do that because under the Act I am exempted." No one is so silly as to suggest that such a thing should be included in a Clause of this description.<br/>
Let me tell the Solicitor-General my opinion about it. I think that in any organisation of men in aerodromes or any other places, if you want to avoid revolt, if you want to have satisfactory arrangements, true co-operation and a better understanding, in critical times, if you want to get better workmanship from the men in their jobs, the thing to do is to create friendly relations between the men inside the workshops and the men who have the right to organise labour. I am not a trade unionist unfortunately, but I say that any man who has any authority as a trade union official is a very valuable man when it is a question of dealing with the conditions of employment. You very often find that the boss on the job is not always able to control the men as well as those who have a sense of responsibility as trade union officials. The Amendment is moved in a spirit of co-operation. It is not moved in the interests of a "nosey parker," because ways and means can be found to send him about his business. But there is the legitimate trade union official who has a right to see after the well-being of the workmen, and I hope the Government will consider the Amendment from the standpoint of co-operation and better relationships. It may be badly drafted, but the Solicitor-General no doubt can frame words which will give protection to the legitimate organiser of labour who should have a right of access in order to deal with the men.</p>

<p>I want to submit a few ideas on this question in the hope that the Government will reconsider their


attitude. These are the days of organisation. The employers are well organised, shop-keepers are well organised in chambers of commerce, the legal profession is well organised. All interests are well organised and, therefore, it is essential that the workers should also organise themselves. They have organised themselves relatively well in certain sections of industry. They appoint their representatives. In modern methods of production, particularly in aerodromes, production, takes place on one side of the aerodrome and experiments take place on the other. They are also used for commercial purposes. It will be possible for mechanics to leave their workshops and then play a part in the experiments in the aerodrome. Friction might possibly occur between the representatives of various interests and, therefore, it is essential that the representatives of the men should have access to all parts of the aerodrome in order to negotiate difficult questions which may arise. I have been employed in modern large-scale industry and I know the value of this kind of thing. Unless you have an authority, a card, it is not possible to have access to some places, but if you are acting in a representative capacity on behalf of the men and can show your authority you can have access in that capacity.<br/>
I am hoping that the Government will reconsider their attitude so that the legitimate grievances of men employed on aerodromes may be ventilated. They can only be ventilated if their representatives have the right of access to all parts of the aerodrome. Those who have had any experience of meeting the police know how they are treated. Unless you can show some card of authority you are treated as an average member of the public, and the police are, of course, entitled to treat you in that way. But, if you can produce a card showing that you are acting in a representative capacity, they treat you as such, and you can go wherever your duty may take you. Therefore, seeing that military men with a military attitude and mentality will be in charge of aerodromes, and knowing how they react to these kind of things, it is most important, in order that friction may be prevented, that the workmen should have their legitimate interests represented by their trade union

organiser. I hope the Minister will reconsider his attitude.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister why, in this particular Measure, the Government are asking for this provision when it is not asked for in any Department of State? At the present time we are able to visit aerodromes and even Government establishments, where there are supposed to be many secrets. Now, when it comes to the people to whom we are handing out the subsidy, the condition is being laid down that if any person trespasses on any of the land forming part of an aerodrome licensed in pursuance of an Order in Council under Part I, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;5.</p>

<p>It deals with these aerodromes. I am asking that those who are engaged upon business in connection with the working conditions of the employ&#x00E9;s of the aerodromes shall have the opportunity of being able to consult with the people concerned so that the grievances, if they are real ones, may be remedied before they develop into serious difficulties and give us the trouble which we so often have by reason of the long-continued existence of grievances. It is a short-sighted policy and it is not in the interests of the country that there should be denied to these people the opportunity of consulting together and of meeting the managements of the undertakings in order to point out to them what is happening, and even suggest what might be remedies for the difficulties. I am trying to find out why it is that the demand is being made at this time for a penalty for trespassing. Why is this condition asked for now when it is not asked for in any other case? In the interests of the country and of obtaining better working conditions for our people who are employed in these undertakings, I hope this Amendment will be accepted.</p>

<p>I would like to add my view on this matter, and I do so because of an experience I had at the General Election in connection with an undertaking somewhat similar to those


which are being considered in this Bill. In my constituency there is an Admiralty dump with a considerable amount of ground attached to it. On that ground there are the homes of the men who are employed at the dump, and it may be that you will have an aerodrome with ground around it on which the houses of the employ&#x00E9;s of the aerodrome may be built. To get to the Admiralty dump in question, one has to leave the main road and go along a road leading to the dump. On the private road, as well as within the precincts of the homes of the workers, meetings were addressed by representatives of the parties, but when I went there at the General Election the police were present to prevent me from getting on to the ground to which I am referring. I could not speak to those constituents of mine.</p>

<p>I want to draw the attention of the Under-Secretary to the fact that there might very well be an aerodrome at which it is very difficult for those who are employed to get in touch with the organiser of the trade union other than at their work, and it is therefore essential if proper attention is to be given to the conditions under which the men have to work that the organiser should have access at any time in order to meet the representatives of the men and the management. Therefore, I want to add my word of support to those who have already spoken. During the War I had experience of trying to get on to forbidden territory in order to settle grievances, and I very often succeeded in getting on to it. I know that while I succeeded in getting there to settle a grievance in my particular way, others, who were <i>bona fide</i> representatives of trade unions, could not get there. They were not prepared to take the measures I took, and were legal and constitutional. I managed to get to Rosyth and to do my particular job among the men and sailors who worked there, but the trade union organisers could not get there. The same situation might arise in connection with these aerodromes.</p>

<p>I am certain I should get on to them, but the important thing for the Under-Secretary to understand is that the trade union official, who has the responsibility of looking after the interests of the men and very often stopping trouble before it goes too far, should have open access. My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Sir R. Young) knows that he and his colleagues often had to come to calm things down after the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) and myself had been on the job. It may be essential at any moment that a trade union organiser should be able to go right on to the aerodrome to take up a particular grievance. If he is not able to do so, I am sure the grievance will be taken up. Let there be no mistake about that. Consequently, I suggest that in order to get the best results from the point of view of the men, the general organisation and the aerodromes, the representatives of the men should have access at any time to the management and to the employ&#x00E9;s in the aerodrome.</p>

<p>I can only speak again by leave of the House. Of course it would depend entirely on the circumstances. As the hon. Member for the Scotland Division of Liverpool (Mr. Logan) said it is most important that there should be good will in these matters, and one hopes that in every case there will be good will between those in control of the aerodromes and the trade union representatives. In that case no question of trespass would arise. One hopes that in such a case as the hon. Gentleman has in mind there would be no question of trespass. This Clause is only to deal with cases in which there is exclusion of certain people because the will of the owner of the aerodrome&#x2014;the local authority or whoever it may be&#x2014;is that these people should not come on the premises.<br/>
It has been pointed out that if Parliament passes this Clause it is taking a somewhat unusual step. Trespass is not


a criminal offence but if we pass this Clause we are going to make it a criminal offence&#x2014;for a very good reason, namely that people who trespass on aerodromes are putting in peril members of the public who are travelling on aeroplanes, just as it is made a criminal offence to trespass upon railways. In those circumstances people who are, in the true sense of the word, trespassers, must be kept off the premises by a provision of this kind, whether they happen to be trade unionists, or parsons who come there to look after the cure of the souls of the workers, or doctors or anybody else. All persons who go there against the will of the proprietor must be treated in the same way, whether they are trade union representatives or anybody else. For those reasons I am sorry that the Government cannot accept the Amendment which, as I have said, would be class legislation of the most invidious kind.</p>

<p>Can the hon. and learned Gentleman give the assurance for which I asked? I gathered that a trade union official who went to an aerodrome for the purpose of getting into touch with members of his union would not be regarded as a trespasser. If that be the case, will the Minister give instructions that action is not to be taken against such a person as if he were a trespasser?</p>

<p>As I have explained, it depends on circumstances. Normally, of course, he would not be a trespasser, if there was ordinary good will between the aerodrome proprietors and the trade union. These are licensed aerodromes, and in most cases probably the proprietors will be local authorities, and one assumes that in most cases there will be good will and that no question of trespass will arise. But I would not care to make the general statement that in no circumstances would the entry of a trade union representative be trespass. I want to be frank with the House, and I give an instance. Suppose the aerodrome authority, be it a local authority or any other body, were involved in a trade dispute and desired to exclude trade union representatives from the premises and made plain their intention to do so. It would, in my opinion, be trespass in that case if a

trade union representative, notwithstanding that exclusion, attempted to go upon the aerodrome.</p>

<p>What the hon. and learned Gentleman has just said is not quite a candid statement of the position. He has said that a person would not be a trespasser on an aerodrome unless he went there notwithstanding an exclusion. That is not the fact. He would be a trespasser unless he had permission to go on to the aerodrome, which is a very different state of affairs. Any person going on the aerodrome without permission or invitation from the controlling authority would, of course, be a trespasser. An inspector of the Air Ministry must go there by virtue of the authority given to him under the powers of the Secretary of State, otherwise he would be a trespasser. In case of an accident, a doctor, unless invited to go upon the aerodrome by the management, would be a trespasser. If the hon. and learned Gentleman went there for a view of the aerodrome after the accident, unless he had been invited by the management he would also be a trespasser and any trade union official, unless he could show that he had been invited either expressly or impliedly to attend, would be a trespasser and liable to exclusion. If this Clause is passed in its present form it would be necessary for such an organiser to get, either a general permission to go on the aerodrome at all times to interview members of his union or else an express permission to go there at particular times.<br/>
The question raised is whether, in view of the desirability of the swift and satisfactory settlement of grievances, it is not desirable that a trade union organiser should have the right when on trade union business but not on other occasions, to go upon an aerodrome without having


to get, on each occasion, express permission which might very well be refused. If we are making it a criminal offence for the first time for people to go upon aerodromes, it is desirable that we should exclude from that provision special persons such as trade union organisers. There may be other classes of persons in the same category. For instance a postman, if he is not to be a trespasser under this Clause, would have to get permission on each occasion to go there or else possibly a general permission from the Postmaster-General. A taxicab driver would have to get permission to go there with a passenger or else he would be a trespasser. All people who have not express invitations or licences to go on an aerodrome will be trespassers and you will have not class legislation permitting certain people to go on an aerodrome, but class action stopping certain people from going there. The other people who are technically trespassers will not be interfered with but the trade union organiser, if his presence is not accept-</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1936-06-25a.2082.0" colnum="2082" time="">
<p>able to the management, will be excluded. It will be very handy to be able to rake up this Clause in order to get him off the premises, in much the same way as other provisions have been raked up out of the laws of the past in order to stop people making speeches which were inconvenient to the Government of the time&#x2014;as in the case of Tom Mann and others. The danger of this type of legislation is that it may be used hereafter selectively. If this provision is enforced in every case in which there is a technical trespass, well and good, because it will be repealed in a year because of its absurdity. But if it is to be used selectively, in order to give a power over trade union officials which otherwise would not exist, then it is the worst type of class legislation.</p>

<p>I bog to move, in page 11, line 19, to leave out Sub-section (1), and to insert:
<q>(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, where a person or his estate is liable to pay damages by reason of loss or damage which, after the commencement of this Part of this Act, is caused on any one occasion to persons or property on land or water by, or by a person in, or an article or person falling from, an aircraft while in flight, taking off or landing, then, if the loss or damage was caused without his actual fault or privity, his or, as the case may be, his estate's total liability to pay

damages by reason of the loss or damage shall be limited in accordance with the provisions of the Second Schedule to this Act.</q>
<q>Any reference in this Act to the total limit of liability appropriate to an aircraft shall be construed as a reference to the total amount to which a person could, in the circumstances mentioned in this Sub-section, limit his liability to pay damages in respect of loss or damage caused on any one occasion by that aircraft, whether to persons or to property; and any reference in this Act to the limit of liability for property claims appropriate to an aircraft shall be construed as a reference to the amount to which a person could, in such circumstances, limit his liability to pay damages in respect of loss or damage caused on any one occasion by that aircraft, if that loss or damage were only loss of, or damage to, property.</q>
In order to explain to the House the purpose of this Amendment, it is necessary for me to travel outside what would


strictly be the bounds of order, because the Amendment is not comprehensible without reference to the amended Schedule which appears on page 1110 of the Order Paper. The Amendments of which this is the preface, the whole series of them culminating in the Schedule, are designed to carry out what was felt to be the general opinion of the House at the time of the Committee stage in respect of the Clause which limits liability for damage in certain circumstances. From all sides it was felt that if possible the limits of liability in respect of personal injury should be raised and I desire to pay a tribute to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Thorn-bury (Captain Gunston), who was, I think, mainly instrumental in raising the point. An undertaking was given by my hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General that the matter would be looked into before the Report stage and that if it proved possible to do so without, of course, ca using great increases of premium, which would be contrary to policy, he would do what could be done to improve the limits of liability in respect of personal injury.<br/>
The effect of this first Amendment is to make a fundamental alteration in the structure, but in nothing else, of Clause 13 as it is in the Bill. Instead of having, as there, the limits of liability in the Clause, we have transferred them into the Schedule, and the total effect of the Amendments will be this, that there is no alteration in the position of airships, where the limit of liability remains at &#x00A3;25,000, and there is no alteration in respect of balloons which have been left at &#x00A3;5,000. In respect of gliders, which are the poor man's aeroplanes, and it is very important to keep the insurance down, we propose to double the limit of liability. It was &#x00A3;1,000 under the Bill, and it is proposed that it should be &#x00A3;2,000, but so that only one-half of that could be available in respect of loss of, or damage to, property, which means that there is a complete &#x00A3;1,000 in any case available for injury to the person and possibly another &#x00A3;1,000, ranking, of course, with the claims of property.<br/>
Then, in respect of other aircraft, no change is made in respect of aircraft over 10,000 lb. in weight, in respect of which the limit remains at &#x00A3;1 for each pound of weight, as it was in the Bill,

and the maximum of &#x00A3;25,000 remains what it was before; but in respect of the intermediate classes of aircraft, where they do not exceed 5,000 lbs. we have increased the limit of liability to &#x00A3;10,000; where it, used to be &#x00A3;5,000; that is, an increase of &#x00A3;5,000, and there again there is a provision that only &#x00A3;5,000 of that shall be payable in respect of loss of, or damage to, property, so that the whole of the extra &#x00A3;5,000 is available for injury to the person. In the case of aeroplanes between 5,000 and 10,000 lbs. in weight, the limit is again &#x00A3;10,000, and the limit in respect of loss of, or damage to, property is &#x00A3;1 per pound of weight. I do not propose to go in detail into the way in which this works out, because that was very fully gone into in the Committee stage, and hon. Members who took an interest in this Clause will be familiar with the working that was provided in the Bill as originally framed, which is retained under the present proposal, but the net effect is to make, in respect of those two classes of aeroplanes, a further &#x00A3;5,000 available for personal injury, and in respect of gliders an increased amount available of &#x00A3;1,000, and to leave it at the other figures in respect of the remaining classes.<br/>
Inquiries have been made, and it has been ascertained that these increases can be made without any very substantial increase of premium, which is a very important consideration. That could not be said if an increased risk to property were covered, because that immediately attracts a very much higher premium. It may be said by some of my hon. Friends&#x2014;I apprehend that it is more likely to be said from this side of the House&#x2014;that we ought perhaps to have increased the limit of liability as regards property. The answer that I make to that is that the provision of &#x00A3;5,000 for property losses covers at any rate any pretty substantial house and contents, and, in the case of a mansion or very substantial house, it is open to the owner to insure himself at a comparatively small rate of premium. I understand that something between 1s. 6d. and 1s. 9d. will cover all risks, including fire. In any case, the proposals are very much more generous than in the Convention and than in the Bill, and they are a genuine attempt to meet what was felt to be a widespread feeling in the House.


I hope that, with that explanation, the House will allow us to have the Amendments, the first of which I am now moving.</p>

<p>This first Sub-section as on the Paper is so incredibly drafted&#x2014;I know that it follows almost the wording of the other Clause, but it was not worth while discussing the draftsmanship of that Clause when the principle was still under discussion&#x2014;that it can only be hailed as a paradise for the lawyers. First of all, it does not make English at all. If the hon. and learned Gentleman will look at the third line, he will see that it says:
<q>&#x2026; is caused on any one occasion to persons or property on land or water by, or by a person in, or an article or person falling from &#x2026;</q>
What does that mean? It means absolutely nothing. Whether there is a "by" omitted after the second "or" I do not know, but, if so, it would then read:
<q>&#x2026; by, or by a person in, or by an article or person falling from, an aircraft while in flight &#x2026;</q>
It would then have some meaning. I imagine, therefore, that there must be some error in the form in which this appears on the Paper. There are some other more serious matters about the meaning of which I should like to ask the hon. and learned Gentleman. What is the meaning of "any one occasion"? Does that mean one flight? Suppose an aeroplane is flying over my house and drops something on somebody in my garden, and then drops something on somebody in the next garden. Is that two occasions or one occasion? This matter is very important because if one occasion means one flight, then damage done when taking off and landing would be the same accident for the purposes of this Amendment, and that might extend

from Land's End to John o'Groats. It seems to me that "any one occasion" is a very unhappy phrase. It apparently contemplates a single accident, and that all the damage will be done simultaneously.<br/>
Take the unhappy case of an aeroplane disintegrating in the air, as one did a year or two ago over the south of England, where one of the wings came off first, then the engine detached itself from the aeroplane, and they fell scattered over a large area. Would the damage in that case be on one occasion, or would there be different occasions, namely, the occasion on which the wing fell to earth, the occasion on which the engine fell to earth, and the occasion on which the rest of the aeroplane fell to earth? It strikes me that unless something is done to clarify this provision, it will possibly lead to a great deal of litigation as to whether, when there is an accident, the occasion on which several persons have been injured is the same occasion, or whether each person or bit of property injured is a separate occasion. I suggest to the hon. and learned Gentleman that something must be done as regards that. In regard to injury to persons or property, I notice that it says "on land or water." Is there any particular reason why persons in water should not be protected? Take the case of an aeroplane passing over a bathing pool where many people are bathing. The people in the water are apparently not included. The people on the land will be, and anybody who is in a boat on the water will be, but anybody who is in the water will not be included at all.<br/>
One next comes to the extraordinary expression,
<q>if the loss or damage was caused without his actual fault or privity.</q>
Will the hon. and learned Gentleman tell us what is the criterion of "privity"? Suppose an hon. Member owns, as some hon. Members do own, a private aeroplane and it is being driven by a private pilot to whom a salary is paid, and some accident occurs. Is that an accident which is with the privity of the person who owns the aeroplane? It clearly would not be his fault. Suppose, to take another case, there is an aeroplane taking a party to some race meeting and some member of the party is so unwise as to throw an empty champagne bottle out of the aero-


plane. Would that be with the privity of the owner, or would it be necessary to show that the owner has either drunk some of the champagne or handed the bottle to the person who threw it out; or would the mere fact of being in the aeroplane with the person be sufficient to make him privy to the throwing of the bottle out of the aeroplane? I am not aware&#x2014;perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman is&#x2014;that this phrase has been used before or has any particular legal significance as regards responsibility for accident. The use of a vague word of this sort seems to be well calculated to stimulate activities not in the air, but in the law courts, which, presumably, is not the main objective of the hon. and learned Gentleman in proposing this Amendment. Therefore, I suggest to him that before this provision becomes law, he should get someone to tidy it up and make it intelligible, which it is not at present, and to see that there are as few uncertainties in it as possible, and therefore as few opportunities for himself and myself and others to make money out of it.</p>

<p>I should like to thank the Solicitor-General for having so kindly adopted the suggestion which I put forward the other night. I must say that when I listened to the speech of the hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps), I thought, "What wonderful people lawyers are!" None of the suggestions he made ever entered my mind when I made my suggestion the other night. My suggestion, when the House was in a difficulty, was that the value of life was more than the value of property. No doubt the mind of the hon. and learned Member for East Bristol does not run on those lines. I feel that if it is necessary in order to get compulsory insurance to limit liability, we ought to try to get greater compensation for the loss of life than for the loss of property. It is on those grounds that I thank the Solicitor-General. May I ask him one or two points arising out of the Amendment? As he pointed out, if a man who owns a glider crashes and kills anybody, the total limit is &#x00A3;2,000. If there is damage to property not more than &#x00A3;1,000 will be paid for it. Suppose a glider kills a man and the damage to property is only &#x00A3;200, may we take it that the balance of &#x00A3;1,800 will be paid in respect of the life?</p>

<p>With regard to a machine weighing 5,000 lbs., I suppose the same thing will apply. If eight people were killed and only &#x00A3;200 damage was done to property, I take it that &#x00A3;9,800 would go in compensation for the loss of life?</p>

<p>Will my hon. and learned Friend further explain the point, because, although the Amendment is a distinct advance on what was proposed on the Committee stage, I do not understand the intention of the Government in this limitation. I appreciate that it is better to have a certain limit for which insurance can be effected than to have no limit which cannot be covered by insurance, but why limit the total liability? One can understand the limit being placed on the total sum for which compulsory insurance can be effected, but I cannot see any reason why, in limiting the total sum which must be compulsorily covered by insurance, that figure should be taken as the extreme limit of liability. Why should a person who suffers damage have his ordinary rights under Common Law restricted in this way? I am sure that the Government even at this stage will review the matter. It is right to limit the total amount for which insurance must be compulsory, but it is wholly wrong to limit the liability in the case of a person who may have ample means although not insured beyond the figures in the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. Member opposite, in his references to the speech of the hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps), treated his criticisms of the wording of this Clause rather as if they were an attack on the principle which he supports, and he claimed that lawyers are wonderful people. So, in a very limited sense, they are. They are wonderful because people rely on them to do their best for their clients, and if a client is an insurance company it does involve lawyers arguing with solemnity that a, person in the water is not on the water and that therefore all his dependants must starve until


they can find a job. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that the Government should somehow get into this Measure the correct wording to ensure that it will do whatever it is that they want to do, and therefore I think that in criticising the words we are not in the least attacking the principles put forward by the hon. Member. As to the principle of the limitation of liability, or torts, in some way, like the hon. Member for Hulme (Sir J. Nall) I do not like it, but under the present system it may be necessary, to enable commerce to be carried on, to introduce some such principle, and, of course, it has been operated under the Merchant Shipping Act for a good many years. I have no doubt that while the present system lasts it will continue to be applied in the interests of any great group of industrialists who have sufficient influence in this House to protect their pockets in this way. But so far as the wording goes we are not being meticulous; we are only trying to protect the public from ourselves in fighting for a better wording of these Statutes.</p>

<p>I share the apprehensions of the hon. Member for Hulme (Sir J. Nall). I do not see why there should be any limit of liability at all in the case of personal injury, in particular where death results and an action is brought by the dependants of the deceased. I am not, however, going to labour that point, and I want only to put to my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General one question which concerns the last part of the second Amendment. It deals with an application made to the court under the last preceding Sub-section and says:
<q>the court may stay any proceedings pending in any other court in relation to the same matter and may give such directions as the court thinks proper for the joining of persons interested as parties to the proceedings, for the exclusion of claims which are not brought before the court within a certain time, and".</q>
I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General would say why it is necessary to have that power to limit the time. In cases where the accident has resulted in death a number of the actions will be

brought under Lord Campbell's Act, and already there is a limit of time, a limit of six months in which the executors of the deceased or the administrators can bring proceedings, and a limit of 12 months within which the widow can bring proceedings. Why should there be any further limitation of time in cases of fatal accidents?</p>

<p>If I may speak again by the leave of the House I would like to say that I do not wish to follow the hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps), who was perhaps unfortunate in the adjectives he used about me when he accused me of lack of candour. But I think I am entitled to say that he was present during the Committee stage, and these exact words were before us then, and he did not then think they were worthy of either comment or amendment. Also, it might have been suitable if he had thought fit to put down some Amendment on the Report stage indicating what he desired. I am afraid that one must look upon his intervention as being extemporaneous and unconsidered. Nevertheless, it is worthy of attention, and, being worthy of attention, I think I may say that in one respect at any rate he is right. I think the Clause would be better with the word "by," which is a drafting Amendment which I shall move if the House will permit me to do so. The other Amendment which is suggested I do not think is necessary. If the hon. and learned Member would like it he can have "in" as well as "on" in regard to water, but I have no doubt whatsoever that the circumstances he referred to would be included in the phrase "on the water." I do not think it is necessary, but if he would like it in the case of a glider landing on a bathing party, he can have it. As to "privity," I am not prepared to agree with him about that. It is a word which has a construction. I think he has overlooked the Merchant Shipping Act, from which this Clause is taken and in which that word appears.</p>

<p>No, certainly not. Quite clearly the one occasion is the occasion of one accident occurring to the aeroplane. It is that occasion that I am taking as an instance. The single occasion is the accident of the fall. Let me deal with another incident which I apprehend would be more than one occasion. Supposing that in the course of a flight over a distance of two or three miles a pilot were carelessly to jettison spanners at intervals. That would be more than one occasion, and in respect of each of those occasions the damage would only be limited in accordance with the Clause. I do not think there ought to be any difficulties in any court in interpreting those words. With regard to the point made by the hon. Member for Hulme (Sir J. Nall), and I think also by the hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot), that there was no reason to limit the liability, at any rate where personal injuries were concerned, to the amount by which the insurance is affected, that again, is a point which has never been raised before. The Clause in its present shape has been remodelled so as to meet every reasonable criticism that was made against it on the Committee stage, and that point is one which has not been raised before. I do not know whether it be the case that it would involve an increased premium or not, but that might be one of the reasons why it has not been considered. All I can say is that it has not been considered, and that nobody up to this moment has suggested that it should be. Therefore we have pursued the error of our ways.</p>

<p>I followed the observations of the hon. and learned Gentleman very carefully, and there seems to be some confusion between two of his statements. If I understand him aright, if an aero-

plane fall upon a row of houses and four or five people are thereby injured, that would be regarded as one occasion. His other statement, in regard to a bag of tools being thrown overboard&#x2014;</p>

<p>No. Not a bag of tools, but the tools one by one. Suppose there were a trap door open, and the airman dropped a spanner in Surrey and a winch somewhere else; that would be more than one occasion, and in respect of each occasion there would be a right to a claim, and a claim to limit the liability under the Act.</p>

<p>I appreciate the distinction which the Solicitor-General has now drawn, but surely there must be a limit to one occasion. May I give an illustration, which is quite a likely thing to happen, in reference to the fall of tools, showing the unsuitability of the words "one occasion"? If a bag of tools fell on to the floor of an aeroplane and dropped out at intervals, a second or two between each separate tool, could that possibly be described as one occasion? Which would be the one occasion, the five separate tools being one group, a sequence of five, or would each tool be regarded as one occasion? I put this case only because it illustrates the unsuitability of the words which are used, and which are not adequately defined. I hope the Solicitor-General will not think it is too late to make an Amendment in this regard.</p>

<p>I am bound to say I view with regret the insertion in the Bill of a Schedule fixing limits of liability. I understand that this is on the basis of the Merchant Shipping Act, but I always understood that that was one of the most

unsatisfactory Acts that had ever been passed. The hon. and learned Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Croom-Johnson) shakes his head, but what he would regard as a satisfactory Measure might be regarded by laymen as being very unsatisfactory. I regret this provision because the Road Traffic Act imposes no limit of liability, and I should have thought that in these days we should be more likely to take that as a precedent than the Merchant Shipping Act. I sincerely hope that this will never be quoted as a precedent for inserting limits in the Road Traffic Act or similar legislation. I had hoped that we should have divided against the earlier Amendment to insert the new Sub-section (1), but I realise that, as we did not do that, it is difficult now to raise the question in an effective form. I want, however, to utter my protest against reference to the precedent of the Merchant Shipping Act when the precedent of the Road Traffic Act was in existence and would have been more in accordance with modern ideas.</p>

<p>I regard this Schedule and the Clause relating to it as most important provisions which will have to be considered in relation to the Road Traffic Act and liability on the roads. It is well known that the question of damages in relation to road accidents is becoming extremely chaotic, and for that reason I hope the Minister in charge of the Bill will review this matter, in the light of what I said earlier, before the Bill goes to the other House. I cannot see the slightest reason why the liability should be limited in this way. It was made perfectly clear that the reason for limiting insurance to a certain maximum was because it would be impossible to insure for unlimited liability, but it seems to me that the whole question of this Schedule and the Clause relating to it should be reviewed, and that it could be considerably simplified if the basis were converted into one of compulsory insurance within fixed limits and the question of liability left open.</p>

There is the ordinary flexible small airship, like the S.S. airships and the coastal airships that we had in the War; there are the semi-rigid airships of different types; and there are the rigid airships. If a rigid airship like the "Hindenburg" were forced down, with 5,000,000 cubic feet of hydrogen, on a city like London, and if that were fired, a great deal of damage would be done, and I cannot understand how it could be limited to &#x00A3;25,000. I should like the Solicitor-General to explain how that figure is fixed.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends do not seem to appreciate the fact that the liability is only limited in cases of pure accident. If the damage occurs through the fault of the owner, then the liability will be assessed by a jury in the ordinary way, but where the owner is in no sense responsible for the accident&#x2014;and, of course, responsibility has a very wide extension&#x2014;the same principle which obtains in the case of ships at sea has been adopted. It is not really a question of insurance, which is quite a different matter. The principle here is that, in case of accident where no fault or privity rests upon the owner, it is reasonable that there should be a limit to the sum which that owner should pay in damages.</p>

<p>I should like to utter a word of regret on behalf of some of my friends of the Light Aeroplane Club at the fact that the Minister has altered the original figures that appeared in the Bill. This part of the Bill is based on the recommendations of a committee upon which my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Wallasey (Lieut.-Colonel Moore-Brabazon) and I, among others, sat. I should like to read a short paragraph from our report which shows the position that we were in.
<q>After careful consideration we have arrived at the conclusion that it would be in the general interests of the community to introduce a scheme of compulsory third party insurance, or adequate alternative indemnity, against the damage caused by civil aircraft to persons or property on the ground provided that the liability is limited as proposed in paragraph 84.</q>
In paragraph 84 we said:
<q>We consider, from the evidence which we have taken, that the lower limit of 600,000 francs (&#x00A3;7,700) proposed in the Con-

vention at Rome is too high. In order that premiums may not constitute an undue burden on private flying in this country, the lower and upper limits should not exceed &#x00A3;5,000 and &#x00A3;25,000 respectively.</q>
After very careful consideration our figures were arrived at, very largely on the basis of the Rome Convention, which was a Convention of all the great flying Powers of Europe, but some of us would have considered quite seriously whether or not we could accept the principle of third party insurance if we had realised that the figures were to be as high as they are in the Bill. Although it is true that under the provisions of the Bill, a private owner is to receive some relaxation of control, nevertheless, if he has handed himself over to the insurance interests entirely, he is going out of the frying pan into the fire. We are very anxious, particularly from the point of view of the light aeroplane club movement, that no embarrassment should be put on an already extremely difficult financial undertaking by way of increased premiums, but we regret that this alteration should have been made, entirely contrary to the findings of the committee.</p>

<p>I should like to ask my hon. Friend whether the members of the committee considered the effect of raising the insurance in regard to life, because the House felt that the limit was much too low in regard to life. I put forward the suggestion that it ought to be increased and the Government accepted that suggestion. Now my hon. Friend complains that his committee has been thrown over. The House had a very long Debate about it. An object falling out of a machine might break through a glasshouse or a roof or something like that, and might not hit a person. But if a man was hit and was killed he might leave a widow who might have very little money to support herself, and we felt that we could raise the liability with regard to life without hitting the aeroplane industry. We felt that the premium could be increased by such a small amount that it would not prevent people from flying. I would remind my hon. Friend that the Solicitor-General has admitted it. He said that, after con-


sulting with the insurance people, it was probable that the premium would need to be increased by only very little. Surely it is worth while increasing premiums by that very little, if you are to get the whole of the country behind you. We all want to help the development of flying. The whole feeling was that we would not get the assistance we would like if the limited liability was kept as low as it was. I again thank the Government for accepting the Amendments, the effect of which will be not to limit flying but, by getting the good will of the country, to help flying.</p>

I hope that that is so. I ask the Solicitor-General whether that is really true, whether he has discussed the matter with the interests involved, and whether he has had any negotiations whatever with the insurance companies in older to prevent an undue rise in premiums.</p>

<p>The points raised by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Hertford (Sir M. Sueter) and my hon. Friend the Member for Hulme (Sir J. Nall) really have been answered by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Everard). The reason why we get any limitation in the Bill at all is that the Gorell Committee recommend that there should be compulsory insurance and that there should be a limitation of liability. The recommendation is that every aircraft should be insured against this liability for an amount calculated on a pound for pound basis. That was the origin of these proposals. But there was also another origin. Broadly speaking, it followed the scheme of the Rome Convention. It does not follow it literally, and in many respects it is a good deal more generous than the Rome Convention. We have not ratified it yet, but it is undesirable to have two codes of law which are completely in conflict operating in the same areas if you can possibly avoid it. It may very well be, even now, with these more generous scales that we have provided for in the Bill, it will pay anybody to be hit by something falling from a British aero-

plane coining from Paris over the Kent coast, rather than hit by a French aeroplane going back to Paris, because the terms provided in that Convention are not as generous. I have said enough to indicate that this outline, whereby there is a limitation of liability of fixed figures, does not come so entirely out of the blue. It was matured by the Committee, and was considered under the Rome Convention.</p>

<p>Did they consider the question of rigid airships being forced down, as the R. 101 was forced down, and so firing a great area of buildings? I cannot understand how they selected the sum of &#x00A3;25,000.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. and gallant Member for Hertford (Sir M. Sueter) that in any one of these cases if you cared to look at it as a pure matter of logic, great damage might be done. For instance, any aeroplane that came down in the City of London might do damage which would be incalculable. The sum of &#x00A3;5,000 or &#x00A3;10,000 which is here provided would be quite irrelevant in cases of that kind. For reasons which were explained on the Second Reading risks of that kind could not be insured against without burdening aeronautics with such premiums that it would not be possible to carry on. Therefore the principle of limitation had to be faced; there was nothing else to be done. The same argument applies to airships, of which my hon. and gallant Friend spoke. Of course, the damage might in certain instances be fantastically high, but if you are not going to cripple airship development entirely by incurring high premiums you must do something of the kind here proposed. This is the best compromise at which we have been able to arrive.</p>

<p>I had hoped that those who have been engaged on this subject would have brought forward something much more fair and that the statement which has been made by the Solicitor-General would have been preceded by more reference to human life as apart from property. I think that the human life side should be given more consideration and that those who have property should take out their own insurance. As the Clause is now drafted there is a limit. Suppose we get to the stage where we


carry more individuals and consequently more people may be killed. What will be the position then? Take the case of a, subsidised company carrying 30 or 40 passengers in one aeroplane. When we consider the amount of &#x00A3;25,000 or even &#x00A3;50,000 we are faced with this difficulty, that while the damage to property may in the City of London amount to &#x00A3;2,000,000 or &#x00A3;3,000,000 the question of life loss is even greater than the question of the sum of money represented here. I look upon this as a futile method of trying to make a calculation. How can you calculate the amount of damage done by a measurement of that which does the damage? It is a mathematical impossibility. Since you cannot do that, we should put life before property. Let us make a calculation on the basis of human life lost and let property stand by itself and insure itself. There is reference in the Schedule to balloons, whether fixed or free.<br/>
What is meant by the phrase "whether fixed or free"? Does it mean that if it is free it will do more damage than if it is fixed, or does it mean that if it is fixed it will do more damage than if it is free. I am afraid that those who drafted this Schedule have not been thinking out clearly what may take place. I can understand the fixed one. A balloon with a heavy basket underneath may do more damage than a glider in full flight out of control. The matter must be straightened out if we are to prevent the many legal trials which are bound to take place, and which will mean a great deal of unnecessary expenditure. Wise men always try to keep the laws out of the hands of the lawyers, but so far their wisdom has not succeeded in preventing lawyers from getting on top. I hope that something will be done to rectify what I consider a great blunder in the Bill.</p>

<p>I have a very lively memory of what happened in Committee. The Solicitor-General is quite right when he says that the alteration in the figures has been made in response to a promise made by the Government in Committee. The charge made against the original Bill was that it was unreasonable there should be any limitation on the liability of a company in respect of loss of life.

There was some argument against a limitation of liability in respect of property, and the Government gave a promise that they would raise the figures. I suggest that they have gone the wrong way to achieve their object. The reason given is that if there is no limitation at all the premiums will be so high as to put an intolerable burden on an experimental and developing industry. The hon. and gallant Member for Thornbury (Captain Gunston) put the point that there was far less liability in respect of loss of life than in respect of loss of property. By raising the maximum liability you will also raise the premiums. I am not moved to deep emotion about property, but if the possibility of loss of life is much less than the loss of property I should have thought that you could make the liability for loss of life unlimited, reduce the maximum liability in respect of loss of property, and thus keep the premiums down.<br/>
It seems to me that we are making the worst of both worlds. We are not keeping the premiums down, because we have to put the maximum figures up to cover both categories, whereas we could put the figures lower, leave the liability in respect of loss of life non-rigid, and thus meet both cases. I think the Solicitor-General should make inquiries from insurance companies to find out whether if the maximum figures were lowered&#x2014;I do not mind that&#x2014;and the liability for loss of life was unlimited the premiums would be materially affected.<br/>
I put to him the specific point: Will not the insurance companies tell him that by raising the maximum figures he is, in fact, increasing the premiums more than they would be increased if there were unlimited liability for loss of life? The point has been made from various sides of the House and in Committee that on this matter we have not got exact information from the insurance companies and that the Government have not informed themselves on the matter sufficiently to enable them to put a proper Clause in the Bill. There is a very great amount of feeling on this matter, and therefore, I would ask the Solicitor-General to consider between now and the time when the Bill goes to another place whether it would not still be possible for him to meet the recommendations of the


Committee and also our requirements that there should be no limit of liability in respect of loss of life.</p>

<p>I am certain that inquiries have already been made as to whether these increases would involve increased premiums. The answer is that they would. I followed the hon. Member's point. Some inquiries have already been made as to whether in the circumstances to which he referred there would also be an increased premium. I do not wish to mislead the House. I am not suggesting that even in those circumstances we should be prepared to alter the scheme, because there are the other considerations that were given, one of which is that in the case of internationally competing aircrafts it would be a dangerous thing to put British aircraft at a complete disadvantage compared with the aircraft of other countries. However, the matter shall be looked into with a view to seeing whether there is anything that can possibly be done.</p>

<p>We have the right to hope, in any case, that the reflections which may occur to us on Third Reading will have some influence upon the Amendments that will be put down in another place.

With every respect to the Leader of the House I submit to him that, having spent the whole evening on the details of this Bill, our minds are changing upon it and that we ought to have an opportunity of considering afresh the whole scheme of the Measure. If we discuss it now, it will be impossible to see the wood for the trees. Our minds are still preoccupied with the details and it will be impossible for us to have that wide survey of the principles of the Bill which is appropriate to a Third Reading discussion.

right hon. Gentleman would be meeting the wishes of the House if he postponed the Third Reading to a more suitable time, when justice could be done to the important matters involved.</p>

<p>I also appeal to the Government to postpone the Third Reading. I do so from no desire on the part of the Opposition to hold up Government business. The Measure, although it has many controversial aspects, has been generally supported in all sections of the House. I do not think that the Solicitor-General or the Under-Secretary can complain about the progress made on the Report stage. The other point raised by my hon. Friend seems to be important. It is a growing practice to take the Third Reading of a Measure immediately after the Report stage. The purpose, it seems to me, of the various stages is that after the alteration of Bills and the reporting of those alterations to the House there ought to be time for consideration in the minds of Members of the Bill in its new form, and that cannot be done without some time in between the Report stage and the Third Reading. For those reasons I urge on behalf of the Labour party that this reasonable Motion be accepted.</p>

<p>When the Leader of the Opposition was asking the Prime Minister about business a few days ago and raised this very point of the Third Reading following the Report stage the Prime Minister told us that he would review the situation as it arose and that if the Report stage slipped through he would ask us to have the Third Reading. I do not think that anybody can say that the Report stage has been unduly delayed, and here we are at 11 o'clock, and I am certain that if the Prime Minister were here he would not consider this a reasonable hour to start the Third Reading. It is true that Members on the Government Front Bench think that this is a Measure like others, and that the only thing to do is to get it through, but there are many people who look on this as something of tremendous importance to this country. I know that aviation is a nuisance, but for the first time we are considering civil aviation. This is not an armament but some great influence for the peace of the


world, and after a gruelling day to be faced suddenly with the Third Reading is unfair on those who are interested in this Bill.</p>

<p>May I join hon. Members and ask the leader of the House whether we cannot postpone the Third Reading to some other opportunity? We want to study all these Amendments which we have passed and go into them carefully.</p>

<p>I hope that the Home Secretary will agree to the appeal that has been made to him. I am sure that Members who, like myself, have sat through the Debate will agree that no one can suggest that there has been the slightest obstruction. There has been quite as much speaking from the Government side of the House as from the Opposition, in a friendly endeavour to make this Bill the best possible Bill in the interests of the country, and in his opening remarks to-day the Under-Secretary thanked Members in all parts of the House for the way suggestions had been made in Committee and had enabled him to put these various Amendments on the Paper to-day, and it is hardly fair to expect Members, many of whom would desire to speak on the Third Reading, to start such a discussion flow. I sincerely hope that the Home Secretary will recognise the spirit in which he is being met by Members in all parties.</p>

<p>I admit at once, as far as I have followed the earlier stages of this Debate&#x2014;and I have been following them both inside and outside the House&#x2014;that our discussion has been carried on in a perfectly reasonable way, and I quite admit that important changes have been made in the Bill in the course of the Report stage. The object we all have&#x2014;and certainly the object which the Patronage Secretary and I have, in the absence of the Prime Minister&#x2014;is to get the business of the House properly dealt with, and at the same time to realise what is the programme we have to fulfil. When I was asked by the Leader of the Opposition just now what proposals we had regarding the rest of the business to-night I understood from him that he was of the view that we might perhaps take the Third Reading on receiving an assurance

that nothing else would be taken. It was on the assumption that that was the foundation of his intervention at that moment that I gave the answer that I did. I perhaps should have been more prudent and have first got from him a specific statement. But that is neither here nor there.<br/>
This is a matter for the House as a whole, and, of course, hon. Members interested in this most important subject in several parts of the House would prefer that the Third Reading were taken on another occasion. Very well, but I must make it quite plain to the House that while we will certainly meet what I think is the real wish of the House to-night, it is quite impossible to undertake that there shall be time given for the Third Reading such as might have been, I think, taken now, and it may be that we shall have to take the Third Reading by making some special arrangement. I hope not, but the Cattle Order down for to-night, which would have been taken if we had had any idea that this was the view of Members of the House, cannot very well be taken now to-night. Therefore, though, of course, we will do everything possible to meet the general wishes of the House with regard to this Third Reading stage, I am sure hon. Members in all parts of the House will realise that we must get through the business to which we are potentially committed, and that it means a further loading of the programme for some future date. That is a matter which will be discussed, I am sure, through the usual channels with every desire to meet the general convenience. Having given that warning to the House, I am prepared to agree that we shall not ask for the Third Reading tonight, and at the same time, of course, I shall not seek to retract the assurance which I gave across the Floor, apparently under a misapprehension, namely, that we would not to-night endeavour to take the Cattle Order.</p>

<p>It is a very difficult thing in an overloaded programme to see how everything can be fitted in, but we warned the Government at the time that they had a very heavy programme in trying to take both stages of this Bill and also the Cattle Order to-night. The Cattle Order is a very important Order,


and it is a matter which raises debate on all sides of the House. So does the Third Reading of this Bill, and the right hon. Gentleman will remember that I specifically pointed out that it would be difficult to take the Third Reading immediately after the Report stage, I think it is clear that it is the general view that we should take the Third Reading on another day. At the same time it is not the Opposition's fault that the programme is overloaded. There have been many hours lost this Session, not in any way owing to the fault of the Opposition, but because of the way in which the Government business has been handled. I think both these matters are very important, both the Third Reading of the Air Navigation Bill and the Cattle Order, and we must try to get them taken at a proper time.</p>

<p>May I thank the Government and the Patronage Secretary for having given way to the feeling of the

House? It is not so much that one is disinclined to talk on the Third Reading late at night, but it is hard to do so after a prolonged Debate on the Report stage. I would like to register my thanks to the Leader of the House and the Patronage Secretary for the action they have taken.</p>
