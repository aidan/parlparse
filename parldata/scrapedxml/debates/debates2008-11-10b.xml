	<p pid="b.471.5/1">I have met representatives of the horse racing and bookmaking industries on a number of occasions and discussed the horserace betting levy. I would like to pay tribute to both industries for their flexibility in agreeing the 48th levy scheme without the need for Government determination, and for their commitment to continue the work on modernising the levy.</p>

	<p pid="b.471.6/1">I thank the Minister for that response. We welcome the fact that an agreement was reached on the levy, but it happened at the eleventh hour, in the 59th minute. Each year, wrangling over the levy holds up the modernisation process. Is there nothing that the Minister can do to push that process along, and to concentrate the minds of the industry to make progress so that the Government are no longer a part of it? Will he consider setting up a forum for those of us who want to contribute to the debate that will allow us to do so, and which will prevent others in the industry from running away from the problems or from stifling debate?</p>

	<p pid="b.471.7/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his work on the all-party group on racing, which helped us to deal with these complex issues. He was right to say that the deal took place at the eleventh hour, in the 59th minute, but that was better than last year when the Secretary of State had to determine it. It is important that those in the industry recognise that they have to work together, and I was pleased to see the issues raised by Sir Philip Otton's report, which was commissioned by the levy board. The hon. Gentleman may be right, and I am due to receive a report on modernisation from the levy board on the <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-30">30 April</phrase> next year, but in the mean time, all of us who have the interests of racing and betting at heart may want to consider the issues at stake. I will get back to him on the setting up of such a working group.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.0/1">I welcome the agreement between both organisations, and look forward to a sustainable future for both of them. Will the Minister remind them that horse racing is a community sport, with many families going to race courses to enjoy a day out? I hope that they will keep that at the back of their mind&mdash;or at the front&mdash;when having discussions in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.1/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for his work with local race courses. He is right to say that racing is a universal sport that everyone can enjoy, but it is a commercial entity. Complex issues affect the sport, and sports betting, and we need the industries to work together. It should not be left to the Government at the eleventh or twelfth hour to resolve the issues. The industries should consider those issues in a commercial and practical way, while remembering that the sport is there to serve the people. My hon. Friend's points will be well noted by both sectors.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.2/1">Did the Minister see the article in the<i> Racing Post</i> last week that suggested hundreds of betting shops are likely to close in the near future if things do not change in the industry? Would he agree that there was little for bookmakers in the last-minute agreement? If the bookmaking industry is going to survive and thrive in this country, any future levy settlement will have to be much more in their favour.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.3/1">I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for his work on the all-party group on racing. He hits the nail on the head: this is a complex, commercial issue involving two sectors that rely on each other. I do not want to comment on who won or lost. It is important that both thrive, and that they recognise the issues that they face. On the back of the successful discussions, they can deal with those complex issues, while recognising that they are inter-dependent.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.472.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="472"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0001.htm#0811107000388">
	<p pid="b.472.4/1">Can the Minister confirm that the levy will produce about &pound;100 million in the present year? The British Horseracing Authority is seeking a sum adjacent to &pound;150 million, while the bookmakers' representatives believe that they should pay only &pound;40 million because of the costs of Turf TV, to which they contribute. Racing is socially, culturally and economically important. Will the Minister say whether betting exchanges are likely to pay their due share towards those costs?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.472.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="472"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0001.htm#0811107000389">
	<p pid="b.472.5/1">I pay tribute to the work that my hon. Friend does for his local race course. There are many issues facing betting, as I said earlier, and he tempts me down a course of saying what I think about the negotiations. I am not prepared to do that, other than to say that I am glad that they were successful. I have asked for further work to be done on the matter of betting exchanges. It is clearly an issue when people can bet from abroad and pay no contribution towards the levy.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.6/1">I do not know whether you are a betting man, Mr. Speaker&mdash;[<i> Laughter.</i>] You are smiling. I do not know how I should read that, but I suggest that you take no advice from this Government, who have not had a lot of luck with the horses recently. We have just heard that there is still a problem with the levy, and we know that the on-course bookmakers dispute rumbles on. I think that we were promised in 1999 that the Tote would be sold off, but that option has been kicked into the long grass. When will the Minister's Department take these matters seriously, and ensure that racing stays on the back pages, not on the front pages because of unresolved problems?</p>

	<p pid="b.473.0/1">We might not have been lucky on the horses, but we were certainly lucky with by-election last Thursday, given the win that we had.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/2">It is important to do the right thing by the industry and the sectors. As I understand it&mdash;the hon. Gentleman will tell me if I am wrong&mdash;the Opposition supported our decisions on the sale of the Tote, the levy and on-course bookmakers. I do not know why he feels that he should chide us when he supports our actions.</p>

	<p pid="b.473.3/1">At present, 83 per cent. of households can receive digital terrestrial television in the Yorkshire ITV region; 94 per cent. in the Granada region; 91 per cent. in the Tyne Tees region, and 51 per cent. in the Border region. After switchover, it is expected that the figure will rise to 99 per cent. for the Yorkshire, Granada and Tyne Tees regions, and 98 per cent. for the Border region. We do not have regional figures for digital satellite or cable coverage, but 98 per cent. of UK households can receive satellite services, and approximately 49 per cent. have access to cable.</p>

	<p pid="b.474.8/1">On ITV, as we move towards a full digital television world, the basis on which we have regulated ITV hitherto changes. It is important to understand that the financial case changes for the regional programming that we have received for many years. However, I agree with my hon.

	<p pid="b.475.1/1">May I welcome what the Chair of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport has just said? I do not expect him to read all my speeches, but if he reads some of them, he will see that since I took on this job, I have spoken many times about the importance of maintaining standards, particularly in a changing world. People can look online for all kinds of information, gossip and so on, but TV needs to uphold standards in this changing world. That is incredibly important. I welcomed very much what the chairman of ITV said last week about the importance of the watershed. I note that one newspaper&mdash;<i> The Sunday Telegraph</i>, I think&mdash;did a survey that found a spike in programmes containing heavy use of swearing immediately after the watershed. I do not think that that is acceptable. The watershed is there as a guide to broadcasters. The public clearly understand that programmes can reflect the language that is used, but that there should not be gratuitous use of bad language on television.</p>

Should they complain to the BBC management, the BBC Trust or Ofcom? In view of that, does he agree that it is absolutely essential that viewers should be represented by an independent body that champions the needs of licence fee payers, and not by an organisation that defends the BBC as an institution?</p>

	<p pid="b.476.3/1">Let me say quite clearly that the episode to which the hon. Gentleman refers was a serious lapse of broadcasting standards, and, indeed, of the editorial controls designed to uphold those standards. Furthermore, the BBC management was too slow to recognise the seriousness of the situation. However, I would refer the hon. Gentleman to the statement issued by the BBC Trust on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-30">30 October</phrase>, which set in train a whole range of actions to ensure that there would be no repeat of that episode. One example of those actions is the review of the BBC's editorial guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.3/2">On the hon. Gentleman's wider point, I think that it is clear to the public that the BBC Trust can and will take the issues that are referred to it and challenge the BBC on them. It already has a record of doing that on behalf of the licence fee payer. It is also true to say that Ofcom has a role to play in taking a wider view of broadcasting and ensuring that standards across the board are upheld. Those two roles are complementary, and they are working well. Indeed, in this case, the regulators have set action in train and done their job.</p>

I also agree that, if it is to do that job effectively, it is important for there to be proper transparency and disclosure of information that can have a bearing on public opinion in relation to the BBC. However, I would refer him to some of the strong actions that the BBC Trust has already taken since it came into existence. An example is the King report, which looked into news reporting across the four home nations. There should always be disclosure of information, where that is in the public interest, and if the hon. Gentleman would like to write to me to suggest further areas in which that could be improved, I shall give the matter my consideration.</p>

There are plenty of children watching TV programmes on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights after 9 o'clock. I have watched Jamie Oliver reporting from Rotherham, and I have watched quiz shows, and I hear f, f, f, f.

	<p pid="b.479.4/1">I am interested to hear that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the report, as it was my understanding that his party's stated policy was to examine the case for devolution within broadcasting, whereas, rather embarrassingly for him and his colleagues, the commission has explicitly rejected the central argument it was set up to test. We will give the recommendations due consideration because they are important and they deserve to be given careful thought. <i> [Interruption.]</i> We will&mdash;<i> [Interruption.] </i>If anybody were to do that in the Select Committee that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1703" name="John Whittingdale">the hon.

I think that, on the whole, people get excellent value for their licence fee. The issues the hon. Gentleman identified were looked at when the charter renewal process was taken through by my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood, and there was found to be majority support for the continuation of the licence fee.

It has put forward revised proposals on regional news, and Ofcom is conducting a consultation on them until early December. I am sure that Ofcom will bear in mind the views that the hon.

My constituents, I am sure, are very similar to his, and they depend on the local press in the Leigh area as a trusted source of news. I also appreciate the urgency of these issues. Two respected national newspaper editors are writing about them in today's <i> Media Guardian</i>, presenting a well-argued and persuasive case for ensuring that we appreciate the pressures on the newspaper industry. All these issues will be considered in the round, and that is why I say to the hon. Gentleman that that is the job of the BBC Trust.

Given that today's Select Committee on Home Affairs report on policing contained a specific recommendation to his Department and that the &quot;Tackling Booze Britain&quot; report by my Liberal colleagues asks that there be a minimum price for alcohol sales, and negotiation with the EU, if necessary, can he give an undertaking that this issue will be addressed by his Department, so that we can stop vodka, other spirits and beers being bought for cheaper than almost everything else that is available in many of our supermarkets?</p>

I believe that the Committee's Chair was on the radio this morning saying that he did not see evidence that the Licensing Act 2003 had contributed to fuelling alcohol-related violence, although the Committee did say that it did not believe that the full powers of the Act were being used properly to target and clamp down on problem areas. We recognise that conclusion; indeed, we have said a similar thing ourselves. We will study the Committee's report carefully, but I can say that I agree with that central recommendation.</p>

Gentleman knows that I cannot comment on the Queen's Speech in advance of its publication. However, he will know that the Planning Bill will require us to bring forward a new planning policy statement on the built heritage, replacing planning policy guidance 15 and 16.

There are many incentives: the opportunity to host training camps and to maximise the number of local volunteers. The opportunity is part of the economic development strategy to bid for contracts. Of course, there is the opportunity to win the right to show the Inspire mark, which is a symbol of excellence in achievement by organisations, clubs and individuals around the country.

	<p pid="b.488.3/1">Parts of the costing equation still seem rather vague, not least the &pound;1 billion for the athletes village and the &pound;400 million for the broadcasting and media centre. Will my right hon. Friend tell me whether the formula, under which it was anticipated that &pound;650 million would come from the private sector to underpin running costs, will deliver that sum? Seven tier 1 sponsors have been recruited, which is good news; that is &pound;350 million. However, in this economically pressed time, will we get the other &pound;300 million from smaller firms?</p>

	<p pid="b.488.4/1">Let me separate out two elements from my hon. Friend's question. First, as he will know, the private-sector contribution to the construction of both the Olympic village and the press and broadcast centre is subject to renegotiation in the light of the economic downturn and the reduction in the equity and contingent borrowing available. Again, it is important that the House understands the Olympic village's investment in new homes for the people of east London. Decisions will be taken about the scale on which the press and broadcast centre will be built, depending on the certainty of legacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.488.4/2">The second part of his question was, I think, essentially about the amount of sponsorship raised by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. I can assure him that it is on target to meet its sponsorship goals. It has already raised more money at this stage than any previous Olympic city. However, it would be ridiculous to pretend that the economic climate is as easy and susceptible as it was when we made the bid. In these circumstances, LOCOG is doing an extraordinarily good job of raising money.</p>

	<p pid="b.488.5/1">Will the Minister confirm that if the cost to the public purse soars to such an extent that Olympic projects are put at risk, Ministers will prioritise critical infrastructure investment projects, such as the &pound;91-million north London line proposals, rather than spending money on a massive media centre, more &pound;40-million contracts for management consultants, or adding to the 1,000 members of staff already working on the Olympics?</p>

	<p pid="b.489.0/1">I am afraid that that is a rather half-baked Liberal Democrat analysis of the accounts. Expertise was brought in for the Olympics early on. That is why we are on budget and, so far, on time for all aspects of the development. Without going into the rest of the rather cheap and unsubstantiated points that he makes, I can absolutely confirm that legacy is the basis on which long-term investment decisions about the Olympics will be made. Before we make a major commitment of money, we want to be absolutely convinced that there is a legacy to be realised. Those decisions and judgments will shape the conclusions about the nature of the broadcasting centre that is to be constructed; construction is due to begin next spring.</p>

	<p pid="b.489.3/1">Hosting the Olympic and Paralympic games in London in 2012, and the Commonwealth games in Glasgow in 2014, presents a unique opportunity to realise sporting, business and cultural benefits for the whole of Scotland. Ministers and officials are in regular contact on preparations for both London 2012 and Glasgow 2014. As my right hon.

	<p pid="b.490.0/1">The UK is fortunate to be hosting two great international sporting events within the space of two years, but it is vital that Glasgow in 2014 is not seen as an afterthought. What further steps will the Minister take to improve joint working, and particularly to ensure that companies can benefit from the experience of working on both events? With Scottish companies so far winning only 2 per cent. of the contracts for 2012, despite making up 7 per cent. of UK businesses, the signs are not promising.</p>

	<p pid="b.490.1/1">. A real drive from the Scottish Executive to maximise the benefits to Scotland of the contracts, for instance, would be one way forward, as would accepting my right hon. and hon.

Sadly, however, it seems that the Scottish Executive have declined the offers of help that have been extended to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.492.3/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House is concerned at the increasing difficulties caused by the current economic crisis to many British citizens in maintaining their homes, paying their bills and providing for themselves and their families; believes that these problems originated not just in the global financial system but in unsustainable levels of personal borrowing and house prices which were overlooked by Government policy; is alarmed at the steep rise in mortgage arrears and repossession orders; regrets that, despite receiving &pound;500 billion of taxpayers' money, the banking industry has failed to respond adequately to the needs of its customers or modify sufficiently its behaviour in respect of mortgage interest rates, new lending to struggling small businesses and its bonus culture; notes that the Bank of England has implemented the 2 per cent. cut in interest rates which the Liberal Democrats called for and urges it to make further cuts if the economy deteriorates further; and calls on the Government to introduce an immediate substantial cut in income tax to benefit low income and standard rate taxpayers, paid for by wealthy individuals who profited disproportionately from the economic boom and who do not pay their fair share of tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/3">Having checked that I have switched off my mobile phone, it is a pleasure to introduce an Opposition day motion that stands in my name and in those of my colleagues. Our purpose in bringing it to the House is to give Members an opportunity to review the rapidly deteriorating economic situation and to air some ideas and options about how it might be dealt with in the run-up to the pre-Budget report.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/4">We have noticed a pattern developing in the past few weeks whereby we come up with ideas and, whether they are on housing repossessions, interest rates or tax cuts, within a few days or even weeks, they are rapidly followed by the Conservatives, the Government, or both. We might almost say that the road to Damascus is becoming severely congested as they queue up to adopt our policies in different respects. Unfortunately, some Government Front Benchers do not convert quickly enough, and as a result, they leave themselves feeling somewhat embarrassed.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/5">I am glad that the Exchequer Secretary has been brave enough to come back to the House after the previous such Opposition day debate, because she may already realise that her comments on that occasion have become the stuff of radio and television comedy shows. I shall quote one of her more memorable observations during that debate:</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/6" class="indent">&quot;The Liberal Democrat motion has been much commented on, possibly because it reads like the storyboard for &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, or perhaps even &quot;Bleak House&quot;. According to the motion, we are facing...the 'risk of recession'...Fortunately for all of us, however, that colourful and lurid fiction has no real bearing on the macro-economic reality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/7">It is only fair that we do not isolate the Exchequer Secretary too much, however, because Labour Back Benchers faithfully echoed everything that she said. I do not want to criticise a gentleman in his absence, but I am sure that he will not mind my quoting what he said. He is one of the more distinguished&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Indeed, he is here now. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">The hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase>, who is a very distinguished and respected member of the Select Committee on the Treasury, said on that occasion:</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/8" class="indent">&quot;I do not see how anyone can table a motion that suggests that we are nearing a recession&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-04-02.824"><i> Official Report</i>, 2 April 2008; Vol. 474, c. 824-5</phrase>, 810.]</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/9">Well, things do change in a six-month period.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/10">It is not just Government Members, however; the habit has spread. The Conservative shadow Chancellor is not present, but I remember that when I last spoke about economic matters, he intervened to rebuke me for irresponsible behaviour in respect of interest rates. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-14">14 October</phrase>, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/11" class="indent">&quot;By the way, I do not think that it is particularly sensible either for politicians speaking from the Front Bench to call on the Bank to cut or increase interest rates. Indeed, I make it a practice not to comment on them.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-10-14.708"><i> Official Report</i>, 14 October 2008; Vol. 480, c. 708</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/12">Well, I followed the hon. Gentleman last week around the television studios, where he claimed credit for having anticipated the cut in interest rates. Indeed, there was some mysterious process of intellectual osmosis by which the idea had communicated itself to the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, and for which he wanted to claim full credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/13">Without indulging too much in anecdote, however, I think that it would be useful to record some of the facts of the current economic situation. Those of us who talk to local business groups know that the position is really dire and will feed through to statistics in the coming months, but let us stick initially to the facts. The Government's own figures recorded a decline in output in the third quarter, and that represents a fall over the year. The International Monetary Fund predicts a stagnation of growth this year and a decline of 1.3 per cent. next year, which it believes is the deepest cut in any major western country.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/14">We talked at length about the housing market in our last Opposition day debate. The main market indicator suggests that there has been a 15 per cent. fall from the peak at the end of October last year and that house prices at auctions have now fallen by 30 per cent. since last year. It is worth contrasting that with what the former Financial Secretary to the Treasury told us when we debated this subject a few months ago:</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/15" class="indent">&quot;House price inflation is declining, but it is doing so relatively gradually, and house prices remain higher than they were a year ago.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-04-02.803"><i> Official Report</i>, 2 April 2008; Vol. 474, c. 803</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/16">The Government told us that repossessions were not a problem, but they have doubled since the first quarter of 2007; at the end of October this year, they were 71 per cent. up on the year before. The latest figures suggest that there were more than 4,000 insolvencies in the third quarter of 2008&mdash;a 26 per cent. increase on the corresponding quarter the previous year. The unemployment rate is, mercifully, much lower than during the last recession, but at 5.7 per cent. on the international measure it is up worryingly, although we hope that it will not reach those alarming levels of the early 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/17">Those are the facts, although we will no doubt argue endlessly about the causes. A reasonably fair-minded view is that the problems and the depth of the recession that we now face are partly due to domestic policy failures and partly due to international factors beyond our control. As far as domestic policy failures are concerned, it is reasonable to point out the growing consensus that there was an excessive build-up of personal household credit linked to the boom in the housing market. We warned about that for the first time back in October 2003. Others, including the IMF and the Governor of the Bank of England, also issued warnings; even Conservative Front Benchers eventually spotted that there was a problem&mdash;the shadow Chancellor referred to it for the first time in January 2007. Clearly, there is now an acceptance that that major UK problem was domestically generated.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.3/18">There has also been an international banking crisis, for which obviously the Government are not responsible, at least directly. We should not be too complacent about that, however, because much of the shadow banking industry that originally grew up on the back of sub-prime lending activity originated or developed in the City. Until very recently, there was extraordinary hubris and complacency about the workings of financial markets in the City. A few months ago, the Minister's predecessors were talking to us in loving terms about how the City operated, a bit like little boys who had just discovered an unexploded bomb and thought that it was a shiny new toy. The Minister's predecessors now realise that many of the activities that were taking place were dangerous.</p>

	<p pid="b.494.0/1">It is a great pleasure to intervene on a Member who will single-handedly save so many seats for the Liberal Democrats. Is not the issue about seeing the solutions rather than trying to place blame for what happened in the past? The hon. Gentleman has detailed the damage done to the banks.

	<p pid="b.494.1/1">That is a helpful prompt; I was about to move on to the positive suggestions, and the hon. Gentleman is right to say that we should spend our time and energy on them. He has anticipated one of the points that I was going to make: the British bank rescue plan&mdash;the recapitalisation&mdash;was right, necessary and appropriate, but it is only one half of the solution, and there is the other half to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/2">In talking about where we move from here, we should start with the bank rescue proposal, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. We supported that; it was right and timely. However, we now know a little more about what is going on and can ask more critical questions about how the process is developing.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/3">One of the key questions concerns the nature of the commitments that were entered into between the Treasury and the banks when the recapitalisation programme and insurance of inter-bank lending were entered into. On one of the key commitments, we have debated several times the precise meaning of the statement that</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/4" class="indent">&quot;the Government has agreed with the banks&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/5">on</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/6" class="indent">&quot;maintaining...the availability and active market of competitively priced lending to homeowners and small business at 2007 levels&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/7">It becomes more important that we establish exactly what that commitment meant and what was understood about what would happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/8">Let me put a series of specific questions to the Government. Are they or anybody else actually monitoring the amount of business lending, in particular, that is taking place? Are they monitoring on a weekly or monthly basis how much credit is going from each individual bank into the business sector? I hear anecdotes&mdash;I cannot prove this&mdash;that several of the banks have instructed their managers to cut credit and are incentivising them to do so. One way of proving or disproving that point would be to have evidence, and I hope that the Government are monitoring it very carefully. Do they have any mechanism for telling us what is happening as regards the flow of funds?</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/9">What instructions have been given to the Government directors? Do we know who they are? What were their letters of appointment? What have they been told to do? They appear to have a very simple mandate, which is not to interfere, but that is clearly creating a problem in itself.</p>

	<p pid="b.495.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Government are saying two contradictory things to the banks? Through their regulator they are saying that the banks have to improve their ratios, which means cutting their loans as well as increasing their capital, and through their guidance they are saying that the banks need to increase their loans, which would worsen their ratios?</p>

	<p pid="b.495.1/1">The instructions are indeed contradictory, and we need more clarity. In fact, they are not the only instructions that the banks are being given. As of the other day, we understand that the Government have now told the banks to pass on interest rate cuts&mdash;a third objective. Again, we need to understand the implications. The banks tell us that they are making a loss by doing that; I do not know whether that is true, but we need to understand precisely what the banks are being instructed to do and in what circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.495.3/1">Indeed. The banks are simply widening their spread. That is their objective, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" name="John Redwood">the right hon.

	<p pid="b.495.3/2">What precisely was the understanding on bonus arrangements, which have been criticised in all parts of the House? Quite lavish bonus arrangements have been proposed by Lloyds TSB, which is one of the beneficiaries of the process. Mr. Hornby, who on any conceivable measure could be described as a business failure, is now being very lavishly rewarded by his new employer, Lloyds TSB. How is it possible that the Government reached a very specific agreement with the banks on bonuses only to have them completely disregard it?</p>
	<p pid="b.495.3/3">Let me make various suggestions on the banking programme before we move on. First, it is clear, as we have heard in the previous two interventions, that merely telling the banks that the Government are going to operate on an arm's length basis is causing confusion. The rational response of the banks is to build up their reserves to get the Government off their backs as quickly as possible so that they can pay dividends and bonuses. The Government's ambition appears largely to be limited to getting the taxpayers' money back as quickly as possible. While those objectives seem rational in themselves, pursued in isolation they potentially have devastatingly negative consequences. If the economy goes into a downward spiral and business credit is cut off, that further increases bad loans, which increase the amount of the recapitalisation that will have to take place. Can the Government be absolutely clear about whether they are going to intervene to give the banks more specific instructions?</p>
	<p pid="b.495.3/4">Secondly, can the Government tell us why they are now proceeding, in terms of their approvals, with the Lloyds TSB-HBOS merger? There may well be good commercial and public policy reasons for that, but I think that they are assuming that because it made sense six weeks ago in order to rescue HBOS from collapse, it still makes sense today. There are growing numbers of authoritative people in the banking system who say that it does not make sense. They want to have the options re-examined and they want alternative bids to be looked at properly. Along with Tavish Scott MSP, I have written seeking an appointment with Mr. Hornby and Lord Stevenson to explain why they are not willing to reopen matters on the part of HBOS. There is also a question for the Government, however. Will Ministers explain why they are allowing matters to proceed? The deal may well be beneficial to Lloyds TSB, but why is it in the national interest?</p>
	<p pid="b.495.3/5">Finally on the banking system, what the Government did in broad terms made sense in the context in which they introduced it, but a whole set of other problems are now coming over the horizon that have not yet been discussed. When will the Government discuss them? One of them was raised from the Back Benches a few moments ago: we have had half the policy. The Swedish model had a combination of elements, one of which was recapitalisation, and another concerned the &quot;bad bank&quot;&mdash;the Paulson-type plan, and the Americans have had the other half of the programme, but are the Government going to bring both halves together, and how will they do so? Are they thinking ahead to how the new banking system will operate?</p>
	<p pid="b.495.3/6">We are discussing at the moment a Banking Bill that is valid in many respects, but is limited in what it covers. It does not explain how the banking system, once it has emerged from its massive heart attack, will lead a different kind of lifestyle. One thing that cannot continue is the ambiguous relationship in which banks have what Cruickshank called eight years ago &quot;regulatory privileges&quot;&mdash;they depend on being bailed out, in other words&mdash;while they continue to operate on the maximisation of shareholder value. That contradiction cannot continue, and the Government need at an early stage to give ideas as to how they will deal with that problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.495.3/7">My second point about forward-looking policy concerns housing, which is the sector that has been most damaged. We encouraged the Government to pursue an idea that they had some months ago of buying up empty property and land, which is now available at heavily discounted prices, so that registered social landlords can increase the availability of social housing, thereby providing an injection into the building industry. Although the Government are talking the right language, the feedback that I have received suggests that absolutely nothing is happening. It appears that approval was given for &pound;8 billion of investment in social housing, but that the money is not reaching the social landlords. There are problems with the Treasury funding arrangements and the rental arrangements that operate under Treasury rules, which are preventing progress from being made with the programme. Will the Government tell us how much of the social housing package has reached the social landlords, and how many houses they propose to proceed with in the context of the emergency to which we are told that they are reacting?</p>
	<p pid="b.495.3/8">On repossessions, 10 days ago, at Prime Minister's questions, the Prime Minister told us that the Government have proceeded with fresh instructions to the courts on how to handle repossession cases. We had been urging that, and we welcomed it at the time. The feedback I have received suggests that no instructions have yet been given, or if they have been, they are very discreet. No one is aware of any change in practice being communicated to the courts that process such matters. Moreover, there is an extremely alarming story in the <i> Financial Times </i>today, which says that banks and building societies whose clients are in arrears for a few weeks can proceed to repossession without going to the courts; they simply issue an instruction to the bailiffs to repossess after a few months' arrears. The Government need to tell us how, through legislative or other action, they will prevent a cascade of repossessions from proceeding through the winter, as growing numbers of people find that they are on short-time working hours, losing overtime or losing their jobs, and simply cannot afford their payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.495.3/9">Thirdly, we had a debate on small business a week or so ago, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> introduced. I do not want to go into further detail on the measures involved, but how will the Government develop the helpful ideas they have already set out for accelerating payments to small businesses that are involved in Government contracts? Will that extend to the vast numbers of quangos that operate under Government scrutiny? Will it be used for companies that are subject to Government procurement? The 10-day payment&mdash;the accelerated payment&mdash;is a good principle, but how far will the Government spread it? How far has the programme already gone?</p>

	<p pid="b.497.1/1">Indeed, the Government could take a variety of steps, and the hon. Gentleman suggests one. The small Government loan guarantee scheme has not been updated to take account of current realities. Given the strength of the Government's balance sheet relative to the private sector, the Government could do a variety of things to help. They have made several helpful gestures, but they could go much further.</p>
	<p pid="b.497.1/2">Let me consider the issue of the day&mdash;tax cuts. I approach the matter with caution, given that the Conservatives and the Government seem desperately anxious to run on to the ground that we staked out. Our approach was that there should be tax cuts for people on middle and low incomes, for which people who are relatively wealthy would pay. We argued that primarily on the ground of fairness. At the time, there was no major economic crisis, but the proposal now happens to be appropriate to the context in which we operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.497.1/3">Clearly, people on low incomes have a higher propensity to spend than those on high incomes, who are very wealthy. Our proposal, which the new President elect of the United States echoed at least generally, seems highly relevant. We have advocated a programme whereby income tax should be cut for people on low incomes, either by raising thresholds or cutting the basic rate by the equivalent of 4p in the pound. We are therefore considering an amount of approximately &pound;1,000 for a &pound;30,000 income tax payer. The proposal would be funded in a variety of ways, which we have set out, one of which involves tackling potential tax avoidance and the existing concessionary rates that people pay on capital gains tax. We were impressed with the sensible way in which Lady Thatcher and Lord Lawson devised the capital gains tax rules, and we would like to revert to that, with potentially major Revenue implications.</p>
	<p pid="b.497.1/4">We believe that people who contribute to large pension pots should be incentivised, but that larger incentives should not be given to people who make small savings&mdash;we believe in closing that loophole. We also believe in a much tougher approach to tax havens. Again, the President elect of the United States wanted to go down that road. Specific measures, such as dealing with leading corporations' evasion of stamp duty, which the Government should have tackled long ago, are blatantly obvious. A series of measures could, if implemented, enable us to make a substantial cut in income tax for people on low and middle incomes.</p>

	<p pid="b.498.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, when the proposal was made, it was not intended to be a fiscal stimulus? Indeed, it would not be a fiscal stimulus, because he is describing how revenue would be raised to pay for it. Given that there may be a case for some temporary fiscal stimulus in the not-too-distant future, does not it make more sense to consider a temporary reduction in value added tax, which would relate directly to consumer demand? It seems likely that we will need to stimulate consumer demand in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="b.498.1/1">The measures that I have described would be stimulating for the reasons that I gave: people on low incomes are more likely to spend. The right hon. and learned Gentleman's proposal could have the same effect, but it depends on how it is funded. That gets to the heart of what I am sure that Conservative Members will tell us in the next day or so. As I understand it, the Conservative party proposes funding the VAT cut through parallel cuts in Government spending. Although there may be a case for cutting Government spending generally, in the context that we are considering, the proposal would simply offset a stimulus with a reduction in spending. The right hon. and learned Gentleman must deal with the same problem that the Government have and that we have tried to tackle.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.1/2">If there is to be a tax cut, it should operate under three simple principles. First, it must be substantial; a nominal cut has no effect in such circumstances. The package that I have described would cost something in the order of &pound;16 billion. That is a large sum, but as a share of GDP it is not enormous and is certainly affordable within the parameters that I have described. The second principle is that a cut should be fair and equitable, which was where we started from. The third principle is that a cut should be funded. There are dangers in doing what I believe the Government propose, which is to have an unfunded tax cut, which I understand would be financed by Government borrowing. However, Government borrowing ultimately has to be paid for&mdash;it is deferred taxation or inflation, and that is not a satisfactory way forward either.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.1/3">We need a stimulus that will be funded and is seen to be fair, but which also makes sense in the context of the need to inject demand from people on low incomes, whose income standards are being squeezed. With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to introduce the motion and look forward to hearing the reactions to it.</p>

	<p pid="b.499.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, To leave out from &quot;House&quot; to the end of the Question, and to add instead thereof:</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">&quot;notes that the Government's actions mean that the economy is entering a period of global downturn with unemployment, inflation and interest rates all much lower than in previous slowdowns, and with debt reduced from 43 per cent. of gross domestic product in 1997 to below 36 per cent. last year; welcomes the extra investment in public services and public servants that this has enabled to compensate for historical underinvestment both in infrastructure and services in every region; supports the Government's global leadership and action to tackle both the causes and effects of the financial and economic turmoil on an international level; welcomes the Government's timely support to protect financial stability and consequently depositors, business and the wider economy; further notes that as a condition of this support the Government has demanded support in turn for homeowners and small and medium size businesses; further notes the action that has been taken in the court system and through mortgage interest support to enable people to stay in their homes, and the provision of &pound;360 million to help small and medium size businesses under the Train to Gain initiative; and further notes that Government action to support families, individuals and businesses across the UK through the tougher times ahead includes extra tax credits, cutting income tax, freezing fuel duty, further winter fuel payments and increases in Child Benefit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/3">Let me start by saying that the Government share the concerns of the whole House about the effects of the global economic crisis on British families and business. Over the past few months, newspaper headlines have been dominated by the dramatic events in the international banking sector. However, all of us know only too well that behind every headline there are real people facing worries about staying in their jobs or homes, keeping their businesses afloat or paying their bills every month. The Government have already shown that they are determined to be on their side in the tough times ahead and we are determined to do more to help as the situation unfolds.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/4">Although the recessions that we endured in the '80s and '90s were essentially domestic in origin, this one is fundamentally different. It is undoubtedly caused by global events originating outside our borders. This recession began in the sub-prime mortgage market in America and spread across the world, mostly because of irresponsible behaviour by banks. The twin shocks of the credit crunch and the surge in energy and food prices have hit every country in the world. As one of the most open trading economies in the world, the UK has not been immune to the effects of those shocks. Although the crisis is global in origin, we recognise that its effects are local.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/5">The credit crunch presents us with a once-in-a-generation economic challenge. To meet that challenge, we must first stabilise the global banking system to deal with the legacy of bad debt, which has meant that banks have lost confidence in each other and that global credit markets have seized up.</p>

	<p pid="b.500.1/1">I do not think that that is a fair accusation, given that everybody watching the events unfolding has said that the credit crunch is an unprecedented, once-in-a-generation occurrence. Policymakers the world over, including those in business, are scrambling to catch up with circumstances as they change and with the changed world that events have left us with, so I think that the hon. Gentleman is being rather churlish in his analysis. Hindsight is a wonderful thing after sudden changes in realities that have been so stable. It is easy to look at the new realities as they are being created as if, prior to those events, we all had crystal balls and everybody knew what was going to happen. We did not. In such unprecedented circumstances, it is important that policymakers and political leaders such as my right hon.

I made rather a bad habit of missing the foreign trips taken by the Treasury Committee when I was a member of it, owing to other work pressures.

That new reality will have to be taken into account as we rebuild and reform international structures.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/2">Before taking a series of interventions, I was saying that the credit crunch presented us with a once-in-a-generation economic challenge, to which we are rising by stabilising the global banking system. However, we must also re-engineer the global economic system to cope with 21st-century realities, and the reality that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> spotted in the sub-prime mortgage market during her trip to America is clearly one of the new realities with which we must deal.</p>

	<p pid="b.502.3/1">The Minister is obviously about to discuss the global measures that she considers to be the remedy. Does she think that looking at the global economic system will have any effect on the two things that went wrong here? First, an appalling fiscal problem piled up, the scale of which is being debated but which is plainly making us all very cautious about considering how we can afford a fiscal stimulus now. Secondly, a complete regulatory failure took place here. Nothing happened in the American housing market that did not happen in the British housing market. Our own national regulatory system, as designed by the present Prime Minister, completely failed to function, despite all the warnings about a credit bubble that were well in evidence long before the Government turned their mind to it.</p>

	<p pid="b.502.4/1">I think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is being rather partisan in his caricature of the circumstances. When I say that we have an important job to do in re-engineering the global economic system, that does not mean that we do not have equally important reforms to put in place nationally, or that we do not have equally important reforms to put in place at European Union and G7 level. Those jobs must be done together.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.4/2">Another lesson of the new era in which we find ourselves, following the credit crunch and the way in which it is manifesting itself, must be that, given the extent of the present interconnection, our problems cannot be solved simply by examining national circumstances or national regulators. That does not mean that the Financial Services Authority has not recognised that it needs to change and reform. Indeed, a programme of work is already under way to respond to some of the shortcomings that the FSA's chief executive identified. The reforms in the Banking Bill constitute another&mdash;but only one&mdash;aspect of that. There is much work to be done across the piece, at national and at global level, and all the parts of that work must fit together.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.4/3">As trying to run an economic system without credit is rather like trying to run a car engine without oil, restoring some normality to credit markets has been an obvious priority for the Government. A sound banking system is an essential precondition for the long-term health of the economy, so by definition our initial focus has had to be on the banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.4/4">That is why on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-08">8 October</phrase>, in consultation with the tripartite authorities, the Government announced comprehensive measures to ensure stability in the financial system. By recapitalising banks, guaranteeing inter-bank lending and extending the special liquidity scheme, the Government are demonstrating their commitment to do whatever is necessary to maintain stability. The fact that this comprehensive plan was followed by similar action around the world shows both the global nature of the challenge confronting us and the leadership given by the UK in responding to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.4/5">The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are working with other global leaders and our European partners to ensure that the banks are stabilised and begin to lend again, but they are also focusing on reform of the international system to ensure that it can cope with the realities of an interconnected and increasingly interdependent global economic system.</p>

	<p pid="b.503.0/1">I agree very much with my hon. Friend's comments. I wanted to make the following point to the Chancellor when he made his statement some time ago. Given that the Government have now taken big stakes in a number of banks, with some in public ownership and Government representatives on some boards, was it not also important to put in Government officials at the operational level to make sure that banks and those in banking behave appropriately in the public interest?</p>

	<p pid="b.503.2/1">May I urge my hon. Friend to resist the siren voices of the Liberal Democrats? While they have a certain track record in one sense, they focus exclusively on the short term. Short-term measures are important, but I urge my hon. Friend to continue, as the Government have, not only with short-term measures but with medium-term measures, which the Opposition are overlooking, such as the new Bretton Woods agreement that we need, increasing house building in the UK to address the problem of undersupply and therefore of over-inflation in house prices; carrying on with training for the skills we will need when the economy picks up again; and carrying on with measures such as changes to the pension system so we do not end up a basket case, which Italy will be in about 10 years' time?</p>

	<p pid="b.504.0/1">I always do my best to avoid siren voices, but my hon. Friend is right to point out that, despite all the diverting and difficult things going on in the immediate term, it is important at times such as these to look through the sound and fury to the medium term, and to ensure that, in the areas my hon. Friend mentions, the Government position this country's economy so it can get through in the best possible shape.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/2">The scale of the problem caused by the disruption we have all been experiencing in the global financial system is enormous. As the International Monetary Fund said last month, the world economy is now entering a major downturn in the face of the most dangerous shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s. As a result of the credit crunch, we have already seen falling output in Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Japan and Canada, and we now also hear that the USA is in recession. We are now seeing falls in output in the UK, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/3">Two weeks ago, the Bank of England's financial stability report estimated sub-prime and related losses at almost $3 trillion, and it is clear that there can be no return to business as usual in these unprecedented circumstances. The interconnected nature of our financial institutions substantially increases systemic risk if any one financial institution fails. The capacity of private sector institutions to rescue each other has proved to be limited. Governments around the world have therefore acted on an unprecedented scale to support a financial system that has been shaken to its foundations.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/4">There will be long-term implications for the relationship between Government and the financial sector at both national and international levels. The Chancellor has made it clear that we need to return to the issues of regulation and transparency, and to the design of the international financial architecture, which must be made fit for purpose in a more globally interdependent world. We also need progress on a world trade deal and the rejection of a beggar-thy-neighbour protectionism, which changed the great stock market crash of 1929 into the great depression and the global calamity of the second world war.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/5">Unlike the Conservatives when they were last in government dealing with a recession, the Labour party in government does not believe that unemployment is a price worth paying; nor does it believe that if it is not hurting, it is not working. We believe it right to stand alongside people and use the power of the state to help them through difficult times, and we are determined to help people and businesses with targeted support. Therefore, at the last Budget we gave a tax cut worth &pound;120 to all 22 million basic-rate taxpayers. We delayed the planned fuel duty increase, at an annual cost of &pound;1 billion. We helped 9 million households by making additional winter fuel payments of &pound;50 for the over-60s and of &pound;100 for the over-80s, on top of current payments. Since the Budget, we have also announced substantial help for people to insulate their homes and reduce their energy bills.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/6">It is inevitable that the global financial crisis should have some effect on the number of people who have difficulty repaying their mortgages, but the number of repossessions for the whole of 2007 is about a third of the levels of the early 1990s, and data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that the number of properties taken into possession in the first half of 2008 equates to 0.16 per cent of all mortgages&mdash;less than half the rate seen in the early 1990s. However, we are not complacent, and I recognise that each and every repossession is a tragedy for the people involved.</p>

	<p pid="b.506.0/1">My hon. Friend is treating us to many pearls of wisdom today, and that was another one.</p>
	<p pid="b.506.0/2">In September, we announced a range of new measures to support thousands of vulnerable home owners. Help newly available as a result of these announcements includes a &pound;200 million mortgage rescue scheme that will help up to 6,000 households avoid the trauma of repossession over the next two years. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January</phrase>, we will reform the help available to home owners who lose their jobs, so that their mortgage interest is paid after 13 weeks, rather than after the 39 weeks that they would previously have had to wait for help. We have brought forward &pound;400 million of Government spending to deliver up to 5,500 new social rented homes at affordable prices while the private sector market remains weak.</p>
	<p pid="b.506.0/3">The Government believe that repossessions should be a last, not a first, resort, so we have asked mortgage lenders to review their voluntary arrangements for supporting borrowers who are facing difficulties. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has produced its guidelines, and the Finance and Leasing Association is preparing best practice guidance for lenders, which will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.506.0/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-22">22 October</phrase>, the Prime Minister announced new guidance for the judiciary to halt court action on repossessions unless alternative options to help the home owner have been fully examined. The new court protocols set out clear guidance on the steps that lenders are expected to take before bringing a claim in the courts, to ensure that repossessions are indeed a last resort. Lenders will now be expected to demonstrate that they tried to discuss and agree alternatives to repossession when borrowers got into trouble with their mortgage payments. If a case reaches court, lenders will be required to tell the court precisely what they have done to comply with that protocol.</p>
	<p pid="b.506.0/5">The recent cut in the Bank of England base rate has been widely welcomed. The UK now has its lowest interest rates since 1954, which will provide some welcome relief to home owners who are struggling with mortgage repayments. In the context of responsible lending, we want customers to benefit from the rate cut, and where banks are benefiting from cheaper borrowing, we want that to be passed on to their customers, too.</p>

	<p pid="b.506.1/1">There are serious shortages of affordable housing, and fewer houses are being built at the moment. Government policy instructs local councils to reduce the leasing of private properties in order to house people in housing need, on the basis that that is a temporary solution. Right now, a temporary solution of that sort would help to meet not only the housing needs of a large number of people, but the need to cover mortgage costs of those who have these properties and would like to let them out. There might be a solution that meets the needs of two groups: those facing the loss of their property, and the many who are in housing need.</p>

	<p pid="b.506.2/1">We will be looking to build further on our announcements of help to home owners as the situation progresses, and we will bear the hon. Gentleman's suggestions in mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.506.2/2">Although the world economic climate is uniquely challenging, pessimism about our prospects is neither sensible nor reasonable. We need to be not only realistic about the difficulties we face, but confident that we can get through them. The UK is better placed to weather the global economic storm than it was in the 1970s, 1980s or the 1990s. Following last week's Bank of England actions, the UK has its lowest interest rates since 1954, and we also have low inflation. Both interest rates and inflation are well below the double-digit levels that were a feature of previous recessions.</p>

	<p pid="b.508.0/1">Our labour market has 3 million more jobs than it did when we came into government and we are determined to use the reformed Jobcentre Plus service to help anyone facing redundancy to find new work opportunities as quickly and effectively as possible. Thanks to decisions that we have made since 1997, public debt remains low.

	<p pid="b.508.1/1">We strongly support the sentiment in the first half of the Liberal Democrat motion, which identifies the fact that the asset price bubble and the over-borrowing that has occurred in the UK are a major contributor to the problem that we face. That problem was not simply made elsewhere and inflicted on an entirely innocent bystander&mdash;the Prime Minister. We agree that one of the principal concerns of the Government and this House should now be to get help to families and businesses that are struggling with the short-term challenges of recession.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.1/2">We also agree&mdash;I think that this is implicit in the Liberal Democrat motion&mdash;that the first response to the recession should be a monetary policy and that any targeted tax cuts to support families and businesses must be fully funded if we are not simply to burden future generations with the consequences of problems that we have created but do not want to shoulder. Indeed, the Exchequer Secretary came close to supporting that view when she said that we must look through the immediate challenges to the medium term. That strongly suggests to me that she is beginning to see the wisdom of resisting the temptation to borrow and spend her way out of the recession.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.1/3">We part company from the Liberal Democrats, however, on their prescription, which is that old chestnut&mdash;the easy option of tax cuts for everyman, funded by amorphous wealthy individuals, or as the leader of the Liberal Democrats described them today, top earners. That is too easy. We have reached the point in this economic debate where difficult decisions have to be taken, although I know that is not something the Liberal Democrats specialise in. Who are those wealthy individuals or top earners? They are the usual victims. [Hon. Members: &quot;You.&quot;] Hon. Members are right. According to the Liberal Democrat proposals, every one of us is one of those top earners or wealthy individuals&mdash;anybody earning &pound;40,800 or more.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.1/4">The Liberal Democrats want to increase tax on pensions for people on middle incomes by withdrawing the benefit of higher rate tax relief on pension contributions for those earning &pound;40,800 or more. Those people are headmasters, police inspectors and senior nurses&mdash;hundreds of thousands of hard-working families across the country. The Liberal Democrats want further to discourage entrepreneurship by taxing capital gains as income. They propose another &pound;20 billion of unidentified spending cuts to support their tax cut programme, but they cannot tell us how they will be achieved. In fact, the situation is worse than that; it is not just that they cannot tell us, they will not tell us.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.1/5">Some of us will remember when the leader of the Liberal Democrats was interviewed on &quot;Newsnight&quot; immediately after their party conference. Once he got to &pound;5.5 billion of the &pound;20 billion, Jeremy Paxman asked, &quot;Where's the rest?&quot; His answer was:</p>
	<p pid="b.508.1/6" class="indent">&quot;well, I'm simply not going to tell you the rest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.508.1/7">The Lib Dems bring a whole new dimension to the concept of political transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.1/8">The Liberal Democrats are all over the place on tax. They are also all over the place on the Bank of England. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> claims guru status for having called for a 2 per cent. base rate cut by the Bank of England, but on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-15">15 September</phrase> he told his party conference:</p>
	<p pid="b.508.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The Government must not compromise the independence of the Bank of England by telling it to slash interest rates.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.508.1/10">Then he got on the train back to London and spent the next three weeks going around the television studios calling precisely for a cut in interest rates&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>That is the point: while those of us who belong to parties that are either in government or aspire to be in government studiously try to respect the independence of the Bank of England, the hon. Gentleman apparently regards himself as free to indulge in wildly populist and contradictory demands on our television screens.</p>

May I also remind the hon.

	<p pid="b.510.0/1">The hon. Lady needs to think about that. It is one thing to observe that there is a considerable gap between the level of UK and US interest rates, which was precisely the point that my hon.

	<p pid="b.510.0/2">I want to be a little more consensual, however, and to return to the point where we agree with the Liberal Democrat motion&mdash;at least to some extent. Of course, this is not just a US-made problem, and the sooner the Government can take that on board and accept that this is a problem for which the UK regulatory and policy regime is partly responsible&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.510.2/1">Of course, it is partly responsible. The sooner the Government do so, the sooner that we can start making the interventions that will solve the problem and ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes in the next cycle. Unsustainable debt, the asset price bubble, UK households borrowing &pound;1.4 trillion&mdash;the highest indebtedness relative to gross domestic product of any country in the world&mdash;and the Government operating a pro-cyclical deficit funding policy are at the root of the domestic component of the problems that we are facing.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.2/2">It is too late to do anything about avoiding this recession, but we must at least learn the lessons for the next set of challenges that we face. How do we tackle these problems? Clearly, international co-operation, including a revisiting of the pro-cyclical effect of the Basel II capital adequacy rules, will be part of the solution.</p>

Gentleman not think that it is a bit harsh to say that we have a recession and that there is nothing that we can do about it? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>Well, that is exactly what he said. There is plenty that we can do about it, but it is, of course, politically better to get off on abstract arguments. We could do things with mortgages to keep people in their homes, and we could do things with small businesses to keep them in business and employing people.

	<p pid="b.510.4/1">The hon. Gentleman will read <i> Hansard </i>in the morning and see that I said that it is too late to address the unsustainable debts, the asset price bubble, the over-borrowing by households and the pro-cyclical Government deficit funding policy. It is too late to do anything about them to address the recession, but he is absolutely right to suggest that we can do plenty of things to alleviate the immediate impact of the recession, and I shall run through some of them in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.4/2">I was talking about how we tackle the challenges. International co-operation is one way. We need to tackle areas of domestic regulation&mdash;for example, ensuring that bonuses do not compound the problem by creating perverse incentives that lead banks into the kind of areas that have delivered the problem that we now face. Is there a case for including asset prices in the targeted inflation measure? We have looked at that, and many academic economists around the world have asked themselves that question. Our conclusion is that that is not the right way to proceed, but we need to address asset price inflation.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.4/3">We have proposed specifically a debt responsibility mechanism by which the Bank of England would take on the role of measuring aggregate credit debt in our economy and transmitting its concerns to the Financial Services Authority, which would then use those concerns in managing the capital adequacy ratios of individual British lending institutions&mdash;an effective domestic solution to the regulation of the credit cycle. I should be interested to hear from the Economic Secretary when he replies whether the Government have something to say about that proposal and, of course, fiscal discipline&mdash;not a Liberal Democrat unique selling point. We need in place a framework that has the confidence of the markets and that effectively constrains Government action, not just when the going gets difficult but throughout the cycle&mdash;not a set of rules that crumbles as soon as the Government run into the first hurdle.</p>

	<p pid="b.511.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me about bonuses? I opened an account at Barclays a few weeks ago. On the news that it was seeking funding to avoid Government intervention, possibly involving not paying bonuses, I contacted the bank to say that I did not want to go ahead with my account, and it was very worried by that, having asked me the reason why. I wonder whether there is anything in people power&mdash;perhaps by having to print directors salaries and bonuses on bank statements.

	<p pid="b.511.1/2">The second issue that I want to address is the Bank of England's monetary response in the past few weeks. I agree with the hon. Member for Twickenham that it has been most welcome, but our concern must be that it has not been fully effective. Rhetorical attacks on banks in general, or banks in which the public now have a stake, will not solve the problem. Of course the rescue of the banking sector was undertaken not simply to save the banks, but to save the real economy from meltdown. Presumably, now that we, collectively, are investors to the tune of &pound;37 billion in banks, we want to make sure that we get our money back. With the greatest respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon.

	<p pid="b.511.3/1">No, of course not. The two objectives with regard to the public-sector investment in the banking system must be, first, to save the banking system so that we can protect the real economy, and secondly to get every penny of the &pound;37 billion back, preferably with a substantial gain for the taxpayer over time. Those must be our objectives. Let us not forget that we have a big stake in the banks in question.</p>

	<p pid="b.512.1/1">My right hon. Friend is right, but he is perhaps rather generous to describe the &pound;3 billion as an equity investment in Northern Rock; I think that it was a write-off of debt, about which the Government had little choice. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I know that it is counted as an equity investment, but I do not think that it was made out of choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.1/2">Surely the solution is to mend the mechanism that, until last year, always linked Bank of England base rates with the banks' costs of funding. We can of course urge the banks to pass on changes in the official rate, but we also need Government action to secure the reopening of the money markets, so that banks' borrowing costs follow the base rate down. We will then be in a far stronger moral and practical position to urge the banks to pass on the Bank of England's monetary policy response to consumers and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.1/3">The motion in the name of the hon. Member for Twickenham refers to</p>
	<p pid="b.512.1/4" class="indent">&quot;&pound;500 billion of taxpayers' money&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.512.1/5">having gone into the banking system. I think that that is made up of &pound;200 billion in the special liquidity scheme, &pound;37 billion-odd of capital, and &pound;250 billion in money market guarantees. The latter was the largest component of the package announced by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor a few weeks ago, together with the recapitalisation. As far as I can tell, that bit of the package is not working. I do not know whether the Economic Secretary can, in his winding-up speech, give us any figures on what take-up there has been of that &pound;250 billion. The information is difficult to come by, but my inquiries in the City suggest that there has been minimal take-up. That may have to do with the conditions attached or the pricing. That is a critical matter that the Government must look into, because the whole package depends on our being able to reopen and restore confidence in the money markets, so that in future, the Bank of England's base rate cuts are automatically followed by cuts in the cost of funding to the banks, and thus automatically followed by cuts to mortgage rates, small business overdraft rates, and lending rates to families.</p>

	<p pid="b.512.3/1">Ultimately, once confidence has been completely restored to the markets, I guess the right hon. Lady is right, but sadly that is not the position that we are in. I hope that when the Chancellor and the Prime Minister announced the &pound;250 billion guarantee facility&mdash;a very big, eye-catching, headline-grabbing number&mdash;they did not announce it with the expectation and intention that virtually none of it would be taken up. I hope that they announced it in the expectation that it would have the desired effect. It has not, however, because if it had, LIBOR rates would have fallen by 1.5 percentage points last Friday. That is where we need to get to. We must restore the link, because that is what is broken, and that is what needs urgent attention if we are to fix the credit famine that is affecting families and small businesses throughout the country.

	<p pid="b.513.2/1">My question was not meant as a party political point either; it was meant for all our elucidation. I shall say something later about inter-bank lending, which is right at the heart of the matter, but the hon. Gentleman said quite clearly that the mechanism is not working, so, if he believes that it is not, what does he think would?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.513.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="513"  time="016:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0007.htm#0811107000575">
	<p pid="b.513.3/1">I suspect that the mechanism is not working, and I suspect that the reasons why are partly the pricing, partly the conditionality and partly, perhaps, the toxic assets that remain in the system. We heard a suggestion earlier about the creation of a &quot;bad bank&quot;. I should like to hear from the Exchequer Secretary not that she has a magic wand but that the Government at least recognise that the extent to which that part of the package has not been taken up demonstrates that the package as a whole is not delivering the intended results, which it clearly is not. That is a problem for all of us, and one that we, collectively, have to address.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.3/2">The third point on which we agree with the Liberal Democrats&mdash;at least I think we do&mdash;is that spending and borrowing our way out of a recession, over and above the levels that are implied by the automatic stabilisers and the Government's commitment to continue some support for those who lost out in the 10p tax fiasco, will not work and is not sustainable. Future generations would be burdened with even higher debts and the recovery might be threatened by the prospect of large tax rises. We would simply be sowing the seeds of the next crisis, but, as we heard earlier, carefully targeted and fully funded tax cuts, and other specific support measures, would bring relief to families and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.3/3">We do not agree with the Liberal Democrat approach in seeking to raise taxes on middle-income earners to pay for cuts, and we do not believe it credible to claim to fund cuts on the back of unidentified spending cuts. Fiscal prudence and a concern for the future does not mean, however, being unable to help, although others who have behaved more prudently in the past have greater scope for action now: the Australians recently enjoyed the luxury of making a decision to spend half their public sector surplus on stimulating demand from families and businesses. We have set out a number of suggestions and already announced the following proposals: a council tax freeze, funded by cuts in Government consultancy and the Government's advertising budget; the abolition of stamp duty for 90 per cent. of first-time buyers; the use of the Post Office card account to give access to direct debits&mdash;thus cutting the fuel bills of the most vulnerable householders&mdash;while the Government appear set on privatising it; cuts in the small companies corporation tax rate, funded by scrapping the annual investment allowances; a temporary cut of 1p in the pound in employers' national insurance contributions for the smallest employers for six months to stimulate employment; the deferment of small-to-medium enterprises' VAT bills for six months at commercial rates of interest to help businesses with their cash flow; and, changes in the law to provide breathing space for businesses facing insolvency and households facing repossession for amounts that were incurred as unsecured debts. We continue to identify opportunities for targeted, fully funded interventions that will bring much-needed relief to families and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.3/4">I turn briefly to the Government amendment, which has the now-familiar focus on the global dimension&mdash;the subtext broadly being, &quot;Not our problem, guv. The problems were made somewhere else and we are innocent victims.&quot; The Exchequer Secretary used the words &quot;global&quot; or &quot;globally&quot; 21 times in her speech, and I heard no acknowledgement in it of the policy and regulatory failures in the UK. The Lib Dem motion sets those failures out and we have repeatedly drawn attention to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.3/5">The fact is that the claim to have abolished boom and bust heralded in the UK the age of irresponsibility against which the Prime Minister now rails. There was five-times-income mortgage lending and there were 125 per cent. mortgage loans: the Government not only failed to curb household borrowing, but through the years of economic growth ran the biggest deficit of any developed economy. The Exchequer Secretary claims that Government debt has been reduced since 1997, but she and almost everybody else in the House knows that the Office for National Statistics figures show that, in fact, Government debt is up a little on the 1997 level. After 10 years of continuous economic growth, our national debt position has not improved but slightly worsened.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.3/6">There is no sense in the Government amendment of the scale of the challenge. The Exchequer Secretary likes to draw comparisons with statistics relating to the end of the last economic recession, but the appropriate comparison for where we are now is with its beginning. In the last full year before that recession, there was a budget surplus of 0.2 per cent. of GDP; this time, we are entering recession with a budget deficit of 2.6 per cent. of GDP, as a result of having borrowed through the boom.</p>

	<p pid="b.515.0/1">May I take the hon. Gentleman back a little to the issue of household debt? One of the difficulties has been that for more than 30 years there has been a shortage of housing supply in the UK, and that has led to ridiculously high property prices. On the back of that, equity release, based on optimism that house price rises would continue, has gone on apace. The Government&mdash;and, I hope, the Opposition&mdash;are stretching towards what we need to do, which is to build a lot more housing so that there is no boom and bust in the housing market.</p>
	<p pid="b.515.0/2">Furthermore, one of the drivers of the current situation has been the Conservative policy, in the mid-1980s, of removing the ban on equity release from mortgages. Like me, the hon. Gentleman is old enough to remember when people could not get money from a building society or bank on a house unless it was to buy or improve the property&mdash;the money could not be for buying a car, more furniture or whatever. We need to look at getting back to that position.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.515.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="515"  time="016:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0007.htm#0811107000577">
	<p pid="b.515.1/1">I urge the hon. Gentleman to be a little cautious with that analysis. I suggest to him that although house prices are now falling rapidly&mdash;and, according to the hon. Member for Twickenham, will fall significantly further&mdash;the housing shortage has not gone away. The housing-asset price bubble has been driven by the growth of credit and the invention, for it was an invention, of clever new ways of creating credit, mainly through securitisation. That led to more money being available in the system and manifested itself as an inflation in asset prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.515.1/2">I acknowledge, of course, that the housing shortage is an underlying problem, but a lot of people with no borrowing power&mdash;short of their houses&mdash;do not in themselves drive up house prices. House prices get driven up when the people who want to live in the houses can borrow effectively unlimited amounts of money to bid up the prices. That is what we have seen in the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.515.1/3">The Prime Minister has repeatedly claimed, and did so again as recently as last week, that Britain is well prepared to weather the economic storm. In fact, back in January Alan Greenspan described us as being particularly vulnerable. The EU reports, and the IMF report that we saw last week, have confirmed that Britain is ill prepared for the recession, that we go into it with a bigger deficit than any other country and that because of our economy's narrow base, we are struggling to find the locomotive that will pull us out. That is because we have been so heavily dependent on financial services, rising public spending and the housing market during most of the economic growth of the past decade.</p>
	<p pid="b.515.1/4">The Minister used the term &quot;schizophrenia&quot; towards the end of her speech. However, I have to say to her&mdash;perhaps the Economic Secretary will clear this up later&mdash;that the Government's position is far from clear on the question of an overall significant further fiscal loosening. We have heard lots of rhetoric and been given lots of briefings that are then not matched by the words that come out of the Prime Minister's or the Chancellor's mouth. Having heard the hon. Lady's speech, we are none the wiser as to whether the Government are proposing a massive fiscal loosening or merely considering targeted tax measures&mdash;along the lines that the Liberal Democrats propose and we have discussed&mdash;that are fully funded by changes elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.515.1/5">The immediate imperative must be to help those caught in the fall-out of this rapid economic decline&mdash;families facing repossession, sound businesses caught in a short-term cash crunch, employers who are having to face the agonising decision over letting valued staff go because their orders have dried up&mdash;and to fix the broken transmission mechanism in our monetary system. However, we must not lose sight of the lessons of the past few years as regards how we got to this point. A recession caused by excessive borrowing cannot be solved by borrowing and spending our way out of it. That will not work, and anyone who doubts it should ask the Japanese.</p>
	<p pid="b.515.1/6">A responsible approach combines immediate, fully funded help for families and businesses to weather the recession; action domestically and internationally to restore confidence and thus liquidity to financial markets; a rejection of the superficially easy route of a massive increase in borrowing to pay for an unfunded spending splurge; a careful and considered response to the weaknesses that have been exposed in the regulation of our financial system; a proper, sustainable medium-term fiscal framework to restore market confidence that does not crumble at the first hurdle and will get the public finances back into a position where Governments will be able to help families and businesses in future downturns; and a focus on fixing the underlying weaknesses in our economy&mdash;the productivity gap, the skills gap, the unreformed welfare system, and the negative productivity growth in significant parts of the public services&mdash;all of which must be resolved if Britain is to maintain its prosperity and resume a sustainable growth path long after this immediate crisis has passed. That is the approach that Her Majesty's Opposition will continue to pursue.</p>

	<p pid="b.516.2/1">I should like to start with several welcomes. First, I welcome the fact that we are having this debate, because given the enormity of the challenge we face, the more time that we spend discussing it and seeking solutions and responses, the better. Secondly, I welcome the steps that are already being taken by our Government. I hope that that is widely recognised. Whatever other areas of disagreement might exist in this House, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Government should be congratulated on the courage, decisiveness and leadership that they have shown not only in this country but internationally. It would be churlish for anyone in the Chamber not to recognise what has been recognised in so many other countries. Thirdly, I welcome the fact that the Government, and indeed many Opposition Members, recognise the requirement to address these complex issues in a multi-layered way: at the international, global level; at the level of central banks; at the sovereign, national level; at the level of inter-bank relationships; and at the level of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.2/2">I understand that this evening, according to news reports, the Prime Minister will again urge a restructuring and reformation of the international monetary regulatory system. I do not know why that makes news; he has been doing so for years. Indeed, not only has the current leader of the Labour party been doing so, but the one before that, and the one before that. I have been here long enough to remember the one before that, Lord Kinnock, calling for a revision of Bretton Woods in the early 1980s. It just shows that if we stay around long enough, common sense&mdash;born out of a crisis&mdash;afflicts everyone.</p>

	<p pid="b.517.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman think that one of the priorities should be to put more capital into the International Monetary Fund so that it has enough money to lend to impecunious countries that are borrowing too much?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.517.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" speakername="John Reid" colnum="517"  time="017:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0008.htm#0811107000582">
	<p pid="b.517.1/1">I certainly think so, but there has been a shift in economic predominance from the west to the east, and we cannot merely ask other countries to inject liquidity into the international monetary system or the IMF without having regard to the fact that they may want something in return. That is an element of the international rearrangement of the mechanisms set up in the late 1940s, and since the 1970s it has been obvious that those mechanisms are inadequate in some respects.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.1/2">I welcome many of the measures that have at least been hinted at regarding the protection of individuals, particularly those who need the most protection, through targeted cuts in taxation and so on. I do not know whether the Government are considering such measures. If so, I feel that they are to be welcomed. Of course, such measures need to be responsible and prudent, and there are automatic stabilisers in the system anyway, which entail an increasing dependence on Government finances because of the reduction of incoming income, and the increase in outgoing expenditure to protect the poorest.</p>

	<p pid="b.517.2/1">Will the right hon. Gentleman clarify whether he is advocating to his colleagues on the Front Bench unfunded tax cuts that create a fiscal stimulus, or the sort of funded tax cuts that both Opposition parties have talked about?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.517.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" speakername="John Reid" colnum="517"  time="017:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0008.htm#0811107000584">
	<p pid="b.517.3/1">Ultimately, all tax cuts have to be funded from some quarter. I agree entirely with the Prime Minister and my Front-Bench team that a recession is not the time to cut back on public expenditure. Some of the increase in borrowing is automatic through the stabilisers, some of it comes through capital programmes, and some of it could be the result of targeted taxation cuts that result in borrowing. The overall limit to indulging in such borrowing has to be set at a responsible level. The point has been made that we are in a stronger position to do that than many other countries because of the stewardship of the economy during the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.3/2">In the limited time that I have, I want to address a point that I raised with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>, not for partisan reasons but because I am genuinely interested in the solution to what I regard as the central problem, which is that of inter-bank lending. My hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary said that that was the primary task. It is relatively easy to envisage how we would address the reconstruction of the International Money Fund and associated bodies, and to see how we would address the problems of an individual bank through recapitalisation. It is a controversial matter, but it is relatively easy to see how we would help an individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.3/3">It is not relatively easy, however, to see how we might get long-term, sustainable acceptance and confidence among banks that resurrect inter-bank lending, and I would like to deal with that point today. In doing so, I want to make it plain that what I have to say is a result of my involvement in very unusual parliamentary practices in the recent past&mdash;effectively, staying silent, listening and thinking. I apologise, and I include that because the ideas that I refer to are not my original ideas but those of some of the people I have been speaking to.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.3/4">We all know that the global banking system has been under severe stress for more than a year, largely owing to a lack of trust between banks. Lack of confidence has resulted in banks largely, although not exclusively, being prepared to lend to each other only at accentuated rates on an overnight basis. That makes it impossible for the banks to provide the necessary funds to industry or the public&mdash;both need funds for a much longer time.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.3/5">However, if a bank is not fully confident that it can get money in future, it cannot take the risk of lending the money that it has to customers. That problem is easily described. In dealing with the difficulties in the inter-bank markets and in trying to make funds available for industry and the public, several Governments have guaranteed the inter-bank markets. I contend that that can be only a temporary solution and that none of us can be confident that the crisis would not happen again if the Government withdrew the guarantees. That gets to the nub of a thorny problem. Indeed, in the absence of change, a crisis is likely to recur. Once confidence has been lost in the working of the banking system, it becomes far more fragile because everyone knows that it has broken down once and that, therefore, it can happen again. That clearly points to the need for a new structure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.518.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" speakername="Susan Kramer" colnum="518"  time="017:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0008.htm#0811107000585">
	<p pid="b.518.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is talking about an incredibly important matter, which, as he says, has been neglected. Does he realise that in the United States, several states&mdash;for example, California&mdash;are initiating major efforts to try to identify whether fraud lies at the bottom of many of the problem loans on banks' books? There is concern that fraud and extreme mis-selling, which has not been unravelled in the UK and other markets, is holding up reinvigoration.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.518.1/1">I do not intend to deal with fraud today&mdash;the issue of confidence is difficult enough to tackle.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/2">The essence of the banking system is intermediating between the essentially short-term nature of deposits and the longer-term nature of loans. In addition, the banking system intermediates between areas where there are surplus funds and those where there is excess demand for them. The inter-bank market has evolved to deal with that intermediation. The problem is that the market has evolved largely on a self-regulating, principal-to-principal basis. The market is also extremely opaque, with participants having only limited, historic information about their intended partners, whether borrowers or lenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/3">The problems that have arisen require a new structure for the inter-bank market, one which instils confidence, is transparent to the regulators at the very least, and is fully controlled. Regulation must be enhanced to focus on all exposures rather than operating in a world where exposures can be made to disappear by being taken off balance sheet.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/4">There is no doubt that the problem is huge. I make a modest suggestion, which may catch the Government's attention and that of other hon. Members as a possible solution. In summary, it would entail the world's central banks establishing an international monetary exchange, through which all future inter-bank transactions would go&mdash;let us call it &quot;IMX&quot;. It would operate like any normal exchange, with the central banks fully and unconditionally guaranteeing the exchange counterparty performance, so that no bank would have a reason not to supply funds to the exchange. All central banks would be fully responsible for the liabilities to the exchange of the banks for which they were the primary regulator. The central banks would own and run the IMX.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/5">In the time available, let us consider the mechanism carefully. The IMX would operate like any other exchange, with the critical benefit that exchange participants could deal freely with the exchange without having to inquire about other participating members' credit status. Exchange technology is already well established and is available from many vendors. In my view, and that of those with whom I have discussed the matter, an exchange could be established in a matter of months by adopting the proven technologies from established exchanges.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/6">There should be an exchange for each major currency, with the initial establishment of a global euro exchange, a global dollar exchange, a global yen exchange and a global sterling exchange, which would be owned and run by the respective central banks for each currency. Each central bank would guarantee the performance of its relevant currency exchange and set rules for the institutions that would be eligible to borrow from the exchange.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/7">It is possible to identify some key features of such a system, even in the limited time available. First, anyone could offer liquidity to the exchange at a set price, including the central banks. Secondly, all inter-bank lending of participating institutions must be transacted through the exchange. Thirdly, borrowing from the exchange would be at the same price irrespective of the borrower, that price being set by the providers of liquidity to the exchange at any point in time. Fourthly, each central bank would set limits on local institutions and charge them for use of the guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/8">It is also possible to identify the major benefits that might flow from such a system if established. Such a system would restore the necessary trust and confidence to inter-bank lending, allow for an innovative and free market to operate, and provide regulators and Governments with consolidated real-time information on global liquidity flows and counterparty exposures, thereby helping to prevent excesses before they occur. One of the problems that we have experienced in the past is the lack of forewarning, just as the asset valuation of lenders and borrowers was opaque. Such a system would reduce redundancy through inter-bank netting at the exchange level and significantly reduce counterparty management and friction costs. I therefore put my proposal forward as one worthy of consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/9">Such a system would do one further thing: assist in providing the basis for regulation. The current structure of the inter-bank market, coupled with the off-balance-sheet nature of many products, makes proper regulation of the financial system almost impossible. The unregulated nature of inter-bank and derivative activity, to which spokespersons in all parts of the House have referred, together with the many off-balance-sheet products, has facilitated the largely uncontrolled growth of credit and provided no early warning system to central bankers on either a global or local basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/10">The introduction of an exchange would provide central banks with the complete and instantaneous information required to regulate those banks that they stand over. The inability of any institution to access the exchange without receiving the approval and meeting the requirements of the authorising central bank would provide that central bank with a formidable array of controls, information and potential regulatory levers.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/11">We could ultimately provide an exchange that was self-funding, because institutions that would be members of the international monetary exchange should be charged for the access to funds which the scheme affords them. The unit cost of exchange participation could be set based on the stand-alone rating of the bank and the maturity of its net obligations&mdash;namely, on the degree to which it is a net borrower from the exchange.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/12">I do not pretend that there are not many other considerations that would affect my proposal, such as the central bank limit and over-the-counter transactions, such as credit default swaps and so on, which can be moved into it. However, such a system would at least begin to tackle the central problem that we face when we consider the recession, the acute crisis that we have come through and the chronic problems that we are somewhere near the beginning of addressing. In many ways, the most intractable problem is restoring sustainable confidence in the inter-bank lending system.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/13">I thus conclude by saying that, irrespective of the economic actions that are taken to stimulate national economies or, indeed, the global economy, it is essential that structural change should take place in the global banking market to avoid a future reccurrence of the collapse in confidence and the freezing of the banking market that we have seen. I am entirely with the Prime Minister and condone his leadership in attempting to reformulate the international monetary institutions. However, in the absence of an exchange, it is unlikely that full confidence will ever be restored in the global banking system, as today's problems can easily reccur.</p>
	<p pid="b.518.1/14">The essence of banking is ensuring the efficient use of funds for the benefit of industry and society, with a fully functioning inter-bank market being the cornerstone of that intermediation. However, the current inter-bank market is not working. It is inefficient, opaque and largely unregulated. Introducing a regulated exchange would restore confidence, and it would be more efficient and transparent, as all inter-bank and even derivative-type activity could be instantaneously, centrally recorded. It would also greatly enhance the regulatory power and information of the central banks. It would not solve all the problems, but I believe it would be a major contributory factor to addressing the central problem.</p>

What motivates it is a sense shared on some parts of the Labour Back Benches, and certainly on the Opposition side of the House, that the twin crises that we are living through&mdash;the financial crisis and the recession&mdash;are not yet responding to treatment as quickly as we would like, and that the Government would be well advised to listen to friends on their side of the House, and to people on my side of the House who wish them well in trying to tackle the crisis, when we offer them advice on the other things that they could do to head off some of the worst disasters that might still lie ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/2">Listening to the Exchequer Secretary, I felt that she was being very complacent. She wanted everyone to believe that this was a global, rather than a British, crisis. Let us go back to August and September 2007, however. Northern Rock was a very British bank, lending too much money to British mortgage holders to pay too much for their houses, and getting into difficulties because it and its customers were greatly over-extended. It was regulated by British regulators, and they let it down very badly. They allowed it to expand too fast, and then starved the money markets of money in August and September. The Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England then lectured Northern Rock on how it had to live with its own mistakes. They brought the bank down and, afterwards, decided that the taxpayer should stand treat. That was not good management, or good regulatory practice, and I hope that the Government will learn from that and not do it to another bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/3">If we look at the problems that the Government now have with Northern Rock, we can see what a bad so-called solution that was. Taxpayers were put on risk for more than &pound;100 billion, and they have lost &pound;580 million in the first half year in owning 100 per cent. of the equity. That was the stated interim loss. The second half losses might be bigger; there will certainly be such losses. Extra capital amounting to &pound;3 billion has had to be sunk into the bank, and I do not think that we shall see a return on that any time soon. Half the staff are being sacked, &pound;14 billion-worth of mortgages have now been repaid, and the bank is unable to make new advances. It is crippled, higgled and gravely damaged, and the taxpayer is going to have to pay all the costs involved in winding up a lot of the business, getting rid of the staff and shrinking the thing that was once a flourishing institution.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/4">I invite hon. Members to cast their minds back to what the directors and owners of Northern Rock were debating in the spring and summer of 2007, as recorded in their annual report, which came out just before the crunch. They were discussing their response to the regulatory signals that were being sent out. The British and global regulators, but particularly the British regulators for Northern Rock, were telling them that they had too much capital for the volume of loans that they were making, and the discussion within the Northern Rock boardroom related to how it could get its capital down, or its loans up, in order to get nearer to the ratio that the regulator said was needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/5">More recently, the British regulators have said to all the banks in Britain that the ratios to which they used to manage are no longer sufficient for the current circumstances, and they are making all banks have more capital, relative to the amount of lending that they do. So in the good times, when there was too much credit, the regulator was saying, &quot;Don't worry. Lend some more. You don't need to have a very high ratio.&quot; In the dreadful times, when there is very little credit available for anyone, the Government and the regulators have decided to send the alternative message that banks in the middle of this crisis have to raise a lot more capital, relative to their lending. That does not strike me as wise regulation on either score, but once the regulators have taken such action it becomes the new hurdle or standard, and every other organisation must do the same, not just to meet the regulatory requirements but in an effort to rebuild confidence. The Government need to understand the important point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>, who observed that the &pound;250 billion package of guarantees was not being taken up to a great extent. That is a sign that the package was not properly constructed.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/6">I fully support the action of Government and the Bank of England in standing behind any major bank that is in trouble, and have always done so. Only a lunatic would want to see a major bank go down, and in view of the impact of Lehman's going down, I would think that even someone who was a lunatic before that event might now understand that it is better to manage institutions through crises such as this rather than precipitate a major crash on the back of a very large institution's biting the dust. That is why I supported the Government's &pound;200 billion of extra loans; and it is why I supported all the extra money that they flushed into the money markets, and the &pound;250 billion guarantee scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/7">I think that that guarantee scheme should be revisited. It is not the case that the lending rates in the market between the banks have fallen to the extent that they have returned to their normal relationship with the rates that the Bank of England is signalling, and it is not the case that there is now a fluid and functioning inter-bank market. The best chance that the Government have of getting that market going again is to tweak, or change, the guarantee scheme in the short term, so that more money can flow between the banks. They should be warned, however, that it will never function as well as it did before the crunch, because the regulators&mdash;perhaps for good reasons&mdash;are now requiring much more capital relative to the amount of lending. All the banks are now fighting to reduce, rather than increase, their loan books, because that is what the regulator and the Government are asking them to do. The inter-bank markets cannot be expected to be as fluid and successful as they were in June 2007, because the regulatory mood&mdash;along with the confidence mood&mdash;has changed in the banking market.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/8">An additional problem is that the twin difficulties of the financial crunch and the banking crisis are reinforcing each other. While we have lived through some of the worst parts of the financial crunch&mdash;let us hope that we now have more stability, because there is a clear understanding in the markets that Governments around the world stand behind their banks in one way or another&mdash;we are only on the edge of the serious recession that is now being widely forecast by independent bodies as well as by most Governments. I suspect that this Government will soon be forecasting one, when they get around to revising their figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/9">That factor is particularly damaging to an economy such as that of the United Kingdom. The last 10 years in particular have seen very lopsided growth in Britain. Growth rates in London, with its financial services, professional services and business services, have far outpaced those in the rest of the country. Indeed, the growth rate in London has been more than double that in the north and west of the United Kingdom, reflecting the success of those financial institutions and the impact of the credit bubble on property-related and finance-related activity emanating from the very expensive districts in the centre of London. That concentration of effort makes the British economy doubly vulnerable to the downturn now hitting it. The epicentre of the crisis is the financial services and property sector, which is going to fall further&mdash;and we have more of it to fall than more balanced economies on the continent and in the Americas.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/10">As the recession bites, the loan experience on all the bank books will deteriorate further. To date, we have been discussing the mortgage mess. The Government would like us to believe that the only mess that we really had to face was the sub-prime market in America, and it is true that some of our banks foolishly lost some money on that market, but we know that a far bigger crisis for the British banks was the mortgage crisis in Britain, where too much mortgage advance was made on house prices that were too inflated. There are big losses coming through as a result of that, which is why it was Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley that needed special treatment in the United Kingdom. British banks under British regulators built a British property bubble.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/11">The next phase of the crisis, unfortunately, will be a sharp deterioration in the loan experience that constitutes lending to everyone else, not just those involved in property and finance. The economy is now falling off a cliff, and activity is falling dramatically in sectors beyond finance and property. That means that there will be many more bad loans throughout the range of business activities and the industrial and commercial services sector, from here to John o'Groats. All around the country, the same pressures will be felt as the recession bites.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/12">That is why I repeat my advice&mdash;it is heartfelt, as I love my country and wish it to do well&mdash;that when thinking about buying banks, the Government should be extremely careful about how much equity risk they take on. If they are really going to persist in taking major shareholdings in banks the size of RBS, which has an average balance sheet over the year of &pound;2 trillion, a sum that is bigger than the national income and five times the tax revenue of the country, they should understand that it requires only a small mistake in terms of a bank's assets and liabilities that falls on the wrong side for taxpayers for them to have very major losses on their hands.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/13">That is why, in this period of relative tranquillity before all the deals go through, the Government should be looking again at the terms and the balance sheets that they will be taking over. They should be sending in the forensic accountants now. We all know they will stand behind the banks, so there will not be a confidence problem. There will, however, be a confidence problem in the Government, and in the amount of Government debt they will have to issue, if they do not behave sensibly by doing some basic accounting work and risk assessment on these huge banks that they are now thinking of nationalising or buying major shareholdings in. The Government should be warned by the fact that they lost &pound;580 million in the first half on a very small bank&mdash;Northern Rock. They should remember that RBS is 20 times the size of Northern Rock, so if something goes wrong they will be playing not for a few billions of pounds, but for tens of billions. That is serious money, even for a rich country with a Government who collect as much in tax revenue as the current Government do.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/14">If the Government press on, they must understand that where they are majority owners of a bank, they are responsible for everything. Ultimately, they are responsible for the lending policy, the bonuses and the number of highly paid staff, and for whether a loan is made to Mr. Snooks or Mrs. Smith. They will be made responsible by their electors&mdash;the people out there&mdash;who will not understand if they say, &quot;This nationalised bank is not actually run by the Government. Yes, we the Government put in all the money on behalf of the taxpayers, but we have no control over how the money is spent.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.524.0/1">I am following with great interest what the right hon. Gentleman is saying. He seems to be supporting my earlier contention that the Government ought to put in people to regulate the internal operation of the banks, to make sure that they act in the public interest.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.524.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" speakername="John Redwood" colnum="524"  time="017:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0009.htm#0811107000589">
	<p pid="b.524.1/1">There is at least one difference between us, in that I would not nationalise a bank at all, as I think that would be too dangerous for the taxpayer. The hon. Gentleman is right, however, that if the Government persist in nationalising&mdash;taking a majority stake or complete control&mdash;they cannot avoid ultimately being responsible for the financial consequences of their actions. I think that Ministers are completely responsible for Northern Rock. They own 100 per cent. of it on behalf of the taxpayer, and I quite understand why people will want to make that an issue with Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/2">Why did the Government take this huge stake in Northern Rock? They presumably did so because they felt they could do a better job in the public interest by backing the bank than by enforcing a market solution. They did not seem to want a private sector bank to take over Northern Rock, and they did not want just to lend it some money to see whether it could then find ways of making more profit or raising capital in the normal way. I therefore think the hon. Gentleman has a point. When Ministers say they will not intervene, they do not really mean that, of course, because they have already told us they have views on bonus payments and on how much lending should be done. When Ministers try to enforce elements of those views, they will discover that they are trying to do so in respect of very complicated institutions that could lose the taxpayer a fortune if the wrong guidance is given, and which might lose them quite a lot of money even if they do not give any guidance at all. They will find this situation extremely difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/3">It is also crucial to offer people the hope that, in the process of settling the banking crisis in the way we have been debating, more will be done to try to offset the real damage being done to the rest of the economy. I welcome the new enthusiasm in all parts of the House for tax reductions. It is vital to put more spending power into people's pockets as quickly as possible. Income tax cuts for those on lower and middle incomes would be extremely welcome, as it would be the quickest way of injecting more spending power into the economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.525.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman accept the proposition put from the Conservative Front Bench that those tax cuts should be fully funded, or is he arguing for a fiscal stimulus?</p>

	<p pid="b.525.1/1">I would not start from where the right hon. Lady and her Government start from. I would be running a much more prudent show than they are, because I would not want to spend all this money on bank shares; I would do it by short-term loans and in the other ways that have been identified, so I would have room for a fiscal stimulus in my Budget. My Front-Bench colleagues have backed the banking package in full, which was very generous of them. However, they are absolutely right: given that amount of borrowing&mdash;the banking package as well as the rest of the borrowing&mdash;it is too risky to borrow yet more for the fiscal stimulus. They are drawing attention to the fact that Britain is not well equipped to do what it should be doing, which is to give a fiscal stimulus by cutting taxes and borrowing in the short term to pay for that tax cut. Given where the national accounts are, it would be ruinous to add yet more to the borrowing.</p>
	<p pid="b.525.1/2">The Labour Government seem to believe that there is a free lunch out there. They believe that because a recession is coming, they can say that they can borrow any amount they like, and the markets will miraculously supply it. They need to be very careful. Past history in this country shows that markets can be very forgiving for quite a long time. Of course, markets are just groups of people: they are all the people in the country and overseas counterparties, and they, like Ministers, want the economy to do well and would like all these packages to work. However, if the Government start to present markets with too big a burden of borrowing&mdash;if they say that they need to borrow such colossal sums that the markets say, &quot;But we're not sure we can find that money any more&quot;&mdash;we will be in a far worse crisis than we are currently experiencing.</p>
	<p pid="b.525.1/3">At the moment, the Government seem to think that the answer to too much borrowing and lending in the private sector is to transfer it to the public sector. That is not the answer. If the problem really is, as they described, too much borrowing and lending, we have to go through a process of reducing it. We can do that in a very sharp, quick, deep, damaging way; or we can try to manage it over a longer period, so that there is not such a sharp downturn, but a longer period of slow growth, no growth or modest reductions in activity. The Government seem to have lurched from wanting a very sharp reduction in private sector debt&mdash;that is what their regulators and the Monetary Policy Committee were saying last year, with the Chancellor saying that it would serve the private sector right&mdash;to wanting a much slower run-down. If they simply transfer it all to the Government sector and build up even more Government debt, they might have another problem on their hands: that of finding it very difficult to finance their borrowing at a sensible price.</p>
	<p pid="b.525.1/4">The Government have already taken a big hit on the currency. We are about a quarter worse off against the dollar compared with a few months ago, there has been a very big slide against the yen, and against all the strong currencies of the world sterling is very weak. If the Government are not prudent enough, they could also have a further leg down on sterling, which would make us all a lot poorer and make it more difficult to raise the money that they need to carry out their tasks.</p>

	<p pid="b.526.0/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase> on making a really innovative proposal today; for some time, I have not heard expressed in this House a new proposal on dealing with the issues that confront us today. It could be a way genuinely of dealing with counterparty risk, and of providing incentives for different countries across the world&mdash;surplus or deficit countries&mdash;to co-operate and abide by certain international rules of the game. His proposition certainly deserves to be explored further.</p>
	<p pid="b.526.0/2">I have listened with interest to the contributions, particularly as I am a relative newcomer to this debate. The Liberal Democrats have at least been consistent in their critique of the Government. It was quite interesting to hear the sharp change in tack from the official Opposition Front Benchers. One moment they were espousing bipartisanship; now they seem to have lurched to the opposite extreme of criticising everything that the Government do. Both Opposition parties have come together in blaming the Government, and particularly my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, for presiding over a build-up of personal and public debt during his time as Chancellor of the Exchequer. They seem to think that the credit crunch and the global issues that we face are largely the result of domestic policy errors in the United Kingdom. I argue that those accusations are fundamentally misguided. They misdiagnose the problem, and when one misdiagnoses the problem it is impossible to provide accurate solutions or to learn the lessons necessary for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.526.0/3">The Government should be judged on whether they understand the nature and scale of the current crisis; on whether they are putting in place the right actions to deal with it, both for now and for the future; and, lastly, on the state of the economy as we enter the forthcoming downturn&mdash;did we fix the roof as the sun was shining? On all three counts, the Government will be proved to have had the insight and the character necessary to deal with the global downturn&mdash;on all three counts, the official Opposition, at least, have failed.</p>
	<p pid="b.526.0/4">Nobody disputes the severity of the current crisis. When, at the end of August, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor described the financial circumstances as &quot;arguably the worst&quot; for 60 years, he was widely derided, so I was interested to read the following in the Bank of England's financial stability report, which was published last week:</p>
	<p pid="b.526.0/5" class="indent">&quot;In recent weeks, the global banking system has arguably undergone its biggest episode of instability since the start of the first world war&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.527.0/1">Does the right hon. Lady think that the Chancellor was wise to make his moral hazard speech in September 2007, in which he said there would be no support for any bank, and that it served the banks right if they got it wrong?</p>

	<p pid="b.527.1/1">We have all learned lessons during this credit crunch crisis and its implications. A natural fear of moral hazard at the emergence of the tightening of credit conditions has turned to a preoccupation with trying to fend off a global slump, as the reality of the impact that a severe credit crunch can have on the economy has dawned.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/2">The seeds of the crisis can be traced back to the development of current account and trade imbalances over the past decade, fuelled by financial market liberalisation and abolition of capital controls in the late 1980s, one symptom of which was the unfettered access of businesses and individuals to credit. Of course, many businesses and individuals are perfectly good credit risks, and not for a moment would I suggest&mdash;I hope that few Members of this House would suggest it&mdash;that we should roll the clock back to the days when individuals and businesses were denied credit lines.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/3">The soaring of current account surpluses in Asia led to low global real interest rates, which, combined with cheap exports, created downward pressure on inflation. The consequence was a sharp increase in borrowing in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, partly financed by the inflows of foreign capital lending. As we all know, that was accompanied by the greater integration of capital markets, an increase in risk, a reduction in transparency and an explosion in credit derivatives as a response to the huge market in securitised assets. Credit derivatives were supposed to make securitisation less risky, but they ended up making it far riskier.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/4">As a result of that global interdependence&mdash;between banks and between banks and other financial institutions &mdash;the global system became particularly vulnerable to any shock. The immediate shock in this case were the losses in the US sub-prime mortgage market. Those losses made credit derivative contracts prohibitively expensive, securitisation ground to a halt, and banks became fearful of lending to each other and fundamentally reassessed each other's creditworthiness. Overnight lending dried up and this systemic risk was noticed and perceived not just in one country but across boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/5">That was the beginning of the real credit crunch&mdash;when it started to bite; the market turmoil; the halving of the capitalisation of world stock markets; the losses of $2.8 trillion, which are now being felt with dire consequences for businesses and individuals; and, of course, the risk of a global slump.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/6">In such circumstances, I would argue that the urgent need was for bold action to get the inter-bank market moving. I apologise for not taking up the proposition of my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts as an automatic conclusion, and for not dwelling at length on that issue. As has been acknowledged, he was right to concentrate on that fundamental weakness in the system, but capitalisation and the degree of capital injected into the system were key ingredients in confidence. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor were, I think, right to take bold and urgent action to re-inject capital into the banking system, to inject liquidity and, of course, to institute the guarantee of inter-bank lending. We might need to reassess whether that guarantee is working, but I certainly would not jump to the conclusion that it was not being taken up and that that was a clear sign of failure: far more important is the price of inter-bank lending, which, of course, as my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary said, has fallen recently.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/7">The Bank of England is to be congratulated on its bold move to cut interest rates by 1.5 per cent, although many of us might wonder whether it did so soon enough. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor, too, should be congratulated on persuading the banks that they should pass the cut on to mortgage holders. It remains to be seen whether any further cuts in interest rates will have the same impact on personal lending rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/8">What about fiscal policy? It is absolutely right that the key macro-economic question, rather than the one of inter-bank lending, is whether there should be a fiscal stimulus. It is clearly right that borrowing should be allowed to rise during a recession, because accommodating an increase in benefit bills and a reduction in tax receipts will naturally lead to an increase in borrowing. I am glad that the official Opposition have now made up their mind that it is right to allow borrowing to rise and automatic stabilisers to be used during an economic downturn.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/9">The big debate is whether there should be a discretionary fiscal stimulus or loosening on top of the use of the automatic stabilisers. The judgment on whether there should be an additional fiscal stimulus seems to depend on whether we think that foreign investors will have confidence that we are not going to default on our debt, and, in particular, on what will happen to long-term interest rates. For any fiscal stimulus to be effective, it must be seen to be temporary. Were the Government to embark on such a venture, they would also have to plot a clear path back to a more sustainable or more balanced position.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/10">Such a move would be much more effective if it were co-ordinated internationally, rather than it resulting from unilateral action. When I look at the figures for the deficits and the public sector net debt as a share of GDP, I find it hard to accept that the markets would not think that the UK was a pretty good bet that could tolerate the running of a pretty large fiscal deficit for a while.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/11">I do not know how the Opposition explain the fact that public sector net debt, relative to GDP, is the lowest of any single major industrialised nation other than Canada. Of course, there is Northern Rock. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" name="John Redwood">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)</phrase> shakes his head. I think that the nationalisation of Northern Rock was essential, but the question is not what the level of deficit is but what the level of public sector net debt was when the situation began.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/12">According to the Office for National Statistics, public sector net debt was significantly lower than the level that we inherited in 1997. In fact, I clearly remember sitting in this Chamber when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, explained that he had used the telecom spectrum receipts to repay more debt in one year than had been repaid in the previous 50 years combined. Frankly, it is not surprising that we enter this downturn with a pretty good and sustainable debt position, which should enable us to take any action necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.1/13">The Government must hold their nerve, continue to be bold and take the action required in the short term, but they must also think hard about the longer term international action required to put in place a new set of global rules to try to minimise the recurrence&mdash;or the likelihood of a recurrence&mdash;of a global credit crunch. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, with the Chancellor, is leading on reforming the international financial system and has argued for a long time for the overhaul of credit agencies. He argues, too, that the global system should offer countries incentives to behave well, and that international macro-economic action is required to stave off a global slump. In such circumstances, the premium is on being bold and taking the action required, and I think that the official Opposition will rue the day they decided to be so timid.</p>

	<p pid="b.529.0/1">The Exchequer Secretary referred earlier to the benefit of hindsight, but the benefit occurs only if we are prepared to learn the lessons. There was enough evidence to be able to spot the crisis coming. The International Monetary Fund identified 64 banking crises around the globe between 1970 and 1999. It showed&mdash;as did other studies&mdash;an overall pattern in each of the crises, starting with lax lending, preceded always by a lending boom. The lending was on risky assets, which were often politically directed for social purposes. The result was unusually exposed institutions and unusually exposed risks.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/2">The second element in the structure of those crises was that banks and regulators were overstretched&mdash;to be charitable&mdash;by the volume of business, or regulators simply believed what the banks told them because they were not ready for the risks that were coming along. The third element was that at the time no one was interested in curtailing the level of debt, because they could not see that it was in their interests to do so. Each crisis led to a change of behaviour and of attitude, where reckless lending was described as bold and rewards for risk takers increased beyond the risk involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/3">What burst the bubble was different in each case, but it is absolutely right to ask why the Government did not recognise that sequence, which had already been set out by the IMF and in a very easy to read article published in <i> The</i><i> Economist</i> three years ago. One is tempted to answer the question by saying that the Government were so confident that they had ended boom and bust that they did not believe it would happen in the UK; they had actually started to believe the spin of their fiscal rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/4">Many Members have mentioned the international situation. I have been involved in projects that helped to introduce financial institutions to the global market, and it is right to say that the global nature of the market makes the situation more difficult. It is thus absolutely right to call for the sort of international action on regulation and transparency that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> proposed in his speech. However, despite the international relationships of financial institutions and products, the major issue in surviving such a crisis is the strength of national economies. To see the situation as nothing more than a contagion from abroad is fundamentally to misrepresent it, and fails to distinguish the contagion of the disease from the contagion of knowledge of the disease. For example, the latest US research into the sub-prime market shows that what did for Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac was not that they had caught the sub-prime disease but that everyone thought they had caught it. That is what burst the bubble&mdash;a domestic situation and a domestic issue of confidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/5">A crisis such as this needs domestic material to work with, and there is plenty in the UK. When UK financial institutions rapidly expanded from lending on the basis of short-term wholesale market borrowing, they created a mismatch that was asking for trouble. The debt boom and the Government's role in it extend beyond the simple fact of debt. Other Members have already commented on that, so I shall say no more about it. However, it fed into a state of mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/6">Three of the conclusions in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's study on the sub-prime issue drew out some general points that are relevant now. The problems the study identified were a convoluted loan product system that consumers did not understand, a credit rating system that did not do a good job of highlighting the risks and a lack of incentives for institutions and Government organisations to carry out research into the risks.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/7">On the first of those conclusions, the Government are complicit in convoluted loan programmes that consumers do not understand, such as shared appreciation mortgages, whereby banks recoup the cost of a mortgage&mdash;by huge percentages of capital&mdash;when the house is sold or the mortgagee dies, leaving people with insufficient equity to move on. Such mortgages were unveiled&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;as a millennium product by Lord Mandelson, in his first incarnation as Trade Secretary. The lack of incentives for institutional investors and Government to carry out their own research must lie behind the failure of the regulatory system.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/8">I have spoken before about the lack of credibility in the fiscal rules, but their underlying weaknesses are why they are so flaky. The weakness lies in the assumptions on which the rules were measured&mdash;the variations in determining the amount of debt, what constitutes debt and the length of the cycle&mdash;and in the fact that the Government did not stick to them. The rules were too vague. What they were not was an operational rule, and it is doubtful whether they could be. They were too simplistic to guide policy and too open to be easily manipulated.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/9">What activity do we want? We need to allow Parliament to debate and monitor more closely the Government's fiscal performance, which is why I wholly support the creation of the office of budget responsibility that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench have suggested in several debates.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/10">It is a great shame that much of the speculation in the papers about incentives and stimulus has concentrated on amounts rather than on quality. There has been massive financial disruption, so the priority is rightly to sort it out rather than to argue about general fiscal stimuli.</p>

	<p pid="b.531.0/1">My hon. Friend is making some important points. Has he seen the work of our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase>, who believes that true Government indebtedness, including pension liabilities, is now &pound;1.8 trillion&mdash;120 per cent. of gross national product&mdash;which is why some of us are worried about the country's financial position?</p>

	<p pid="b.531.1/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for making that point. He is absolutely right: a number of factors have not been taken into account&mdash;the pensions element is one, and the whole business of private finance initiatives is another. That is why it is crucial, as I said, to recognise that although the rules are too vague and flaky, it is not the rules themselves that cause the problems but their underlying assumptions. We can all make nice big rules, but if the assumptions and the data behind them are not accurate, there is no point in having them.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/2">We must look at the quality of any proposed stimulus. I was interested to hear that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> has three favourite words to describe the quality of a stimulus. I have my favourites, too. The first is that the stimulus needs to be &quot;effective&quot;, which means that we must know what it will achieve and when. Secondly, it needs to be &quot;temporary&quot;&mdash;as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1433" name="Ruth Kelly">the right hon. Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly)</phrase>, who is no longer in the Chamber, mentioned&mdash;so that it does not worsen the structural deficit. Thirdly, it should be &quot;efficient&quot;, so that the outcomes yield value. However, we must be cautious about any temporary fiscal easing so that we make sure that it is capable of being swiftly and credibly reversed.</p>

	<p pid="b.531.2/1">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in this important debate, but I do not think that we should give the Liberal Democrats quite so much credit as some hon. Members have done. I remember not so long ago when the Liberal Democrats were signed up as hard-liners to the neo-liberal project, the same as the Front Benchers of the two major parties. I never signed up to that. Indeed, the Liberal Democrats not so long ago had an orange book putsch in their party that was a victory over the minor group of social democrats who remain from the days of the past. Just recently, they have rediscovered little bits of social democracy, but just because they are dipping their toe into the water does not mean that they have been fully converted. I, for one, remember what they used to be like and do not give them too much credence for what they are saying now.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.2/2">I was complimented by the now leader of the Liberal Democrats in a debate on Europe some three years ago, when he said that I was the only hon. Member to propose a coherent alterative economic strategy. He said that it was a socialist strategy. He did not agree with it, but he said that I was at least the only one who had a coherent alternative. I like to think that I have stuck with that coherent alternative throughout my time as a Member. Indeed, when I first entered the House, I said in my maiden speech that I had come here among other things to oppose neo-liberalism. At this point, I have been proved right: neo-liberalism has led to an appalling world crisis. If we had had greater regulation, particularly of the financial sector, and retained larger components of public ownership of the utilities, a larger state sector and more general economic controls, we would not be in this situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.532.0/1">I share the hon. Gentleman's concerns in respect of the regulation of the financial services institutions&mdash;I declare my interest as a shareholder in some of them&mdash;but why does he think that the utilities are key in the financial crisis?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.532.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="532"  time="017:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0010.htm#08111015000120">
	<p pid="b.532.1/1">I have always felt that a significant state sector, as we had until some 30 years ago, was useful not just because it provided the public with a good deal, but because it was a component of economic management and brought a considerable amount of income into the Treasury. The mixed economy that we used to have worked very well. The instabilities have taken place since we started to dismantle that and to put everything into the private sector and the market, and I think that we will see a reversal of that. In fact, if I had said in the debate on Europe, when the now leader of the Liberal Democrats was so kind to me, that I believed that the Government should take a substantial stake in the banking sector and start to arm-twist the Bank of England to reduce interest rates, and that a Chancellor would tell the banks and building societies to reduce their lending rates and pray in aid the name of J. M. Keynes, he would have thought that I had gone mad. However, that is precisely what has been happening in the past few weeks, and I am very pleased that it has been.</p>

	<p pid="b.532.2/1">As the hon. Gentleman says, the Government and the Governor of the Bank of England have been trying to persuade the banks to lower their interest rates in line with a cut in the general interest rate in the past few days. Curiously enough, the bank in which the state has one of the biggest says&mdash;the Bradford &amp; Bingley&mdash;has stopped lending altogether. Is it not better in fact to have a properly regulated system, rather than a state-controlled system?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.532.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="532"  time="017:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0010.htm#08111015000122">
	<p pid="b.532.3/1">The two could easily go together. Indeed, the rate that is charged to existing borrowers and whether one is extending borrowing are two issues. I would want to ensure that both of them are positive in helping the economy. Nevertheless, the reduction in interest rates last Thursday will make a significant difference to the disposable income of the existing mortgagors and borrowers, of whom there are millions, who have been paying interests rates that are too high. That will put a significant stimulus into the economy. I welcome that very much indeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.3/2">I return to the theme that I have raised many times in the House: the Government ought to retain control of the levers of economic management, which are several, but I shall mention the three main ones, the first of which is interest rates. I was an opponent of giving the Bank of England so-called independence. Interest rates should be controlled by the Government, who should be accountable to the House for their policy on interest rates. I have always thought that, and I think that it is the case now. Interest rates should not simply be geared to the inflation rate. Indeed, the Government are now saying that the Bank of England should consider the wider economic impact of changes in interest rates, not just inflation. If the Bank had been looking at inflation, which is currently and temporarily quite high, we would not have seen that reduction in interest rates last Thursday. I am glad that the Bank is now looking at the wider economy and acting appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.3/3">The danger indeed is not inflation, but deflation, which is much harder to deal with than inflation. If prices start to fall, which happened in Japan, arresting a fall in prices is very difficult indeed. People anticipate falls in prices and therefore abstain from spending until prices have fallen further, which generates a vortex of deflation and a downward spiral into slump. We must avoid that, and anyone who looks at the situation now and urges caution in Government spending or the fiscal stance is gravely mistaken. We are still in a very difficult situation, and I want to ensure that unemployment does not rise and that living standards do not fall, as is possible if we were to move in that direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.3/4">Another lever that the Government have wisely kept control of&mdash;to an extent at least&mdash;is the exchange rate. I applauded the Prime Minister when he decided as Chancellor not to enter the exchange rate mechanism. He kept control of our own currency, as a lever of economic management, and rightly so. Of course, the problem was that, after 1997, sterling appreciated substantially. That was a big mistake. I was one of those who supported the ideas of Gerald Holtham, who had been the director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and who said that we ought to intervene in the international money markets to bring down the value of the pound, because sterling was overvalued. If hon. Members want evidence of how overvalued it was, they should look at our structural trade deficit over the past many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.3/5">We should have intervened to reduce the value of our currency relative to other currencies and avoided the situation that we are now in, with record trade deficits. Okay, that will have an effect on what we buy from abroad. I like a good bottle of French wine, for example, and I might have to pay more for it. What a terrible shame. It is appropriate that we ensure that our currency value is correct and suits our internal economic needs. If the pound depreciates, it deflects demand to home products and home producers, and it keeps the demand in our domestic economy high. That is what we should be doing now. I welcome the fact that the pound has been depreciated significantly in the past year, and I hope that it stays down and is managed to stay down for some time to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.3/6">Of course the third lever is spending and taxation. Perhaps we have not taxed enough. I would not say that we have not spent enough&mdash;we should have spent more&mdash;but we certainly have not raised enough in taxation while we have been spending over the past few years. I have said in the Chamber on a number of occasions that we should have raised taxes, particularly on the rich. I have also suggested that the Government should make greater efforts to collect all those taxes that are avoided&mdash;&pound;33 billion-worth, according to the TUC's recent booklet. We should do more to avoid tax fraud. Tobacco smuggling and VAT fraud account for another &pound;14 billion. There is money to be had, and the Government could rake in at least some of it if they made greater efforts. Even if they raked in 30 per cent. of it, it would make a significant contribution to the Exchequer and enable us to sustain public spending where it needs to be maintained.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.3/7">We should not be trying to restrict the fiscal balance; we should be worried above all to ensure that there is enough spending power in the economy to sustain employment in this very difficult time and to avoid above all going into a slump. That is a serious danger now. There has been talk about why the banks are still nervous. They are still nervous because there is still a lot of toxic debt around and they do not quite know where it is. The banks are nervous about lending to one another, because they do not quite know how much toxic debt each one has got.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.3/8">We have to make sure that the Government sustain the banking sector, and that we get through this difficult period. There is still the problem of toxic debt, and many hidden problems in the banking and international finance sector; we have to find our way through that, even if it means having a bigger state sector and more regulation. I must say that I applaud what my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase> said about international regulatory machinery. We are going back to something like the Bretton Woods agreement; we are starting to talk seriously about regulating the international finance sector, instead of leaving regulation to the financial markets and people who gamble with our lives&mdash;our money&mdash;for their own benefit. It is interesting that Nick Leeson, who went to prison for gambling with Barings bank's money to the extend that it went bankrupt, complains that people who do the same sort of thing now are just bailed out. We ought to look at that. We should make sure that those people do not get hold of our economies and our lives again. If we have to extend the public-sector part of the banking and financial institutions sector, so be it.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.3/9">I urge my Front-Bench colleagues to use all the levers of macro-economic power to make sure that, above all, we avoid a slump and build our way out of the obviously difficult recession approaching us. I have been unapologetic about my support for traditional Keynesian policies, for a degree of intervention in the economy, and for having a substantial public sector as part of an economy that can be managed by the Government. I am against leaving everything to the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.3/10">Keynes and others said that the market, when left to itself, tends to redistribute income from the poor to the rich. That is inherently deflationary, because rich people save more of their money, and poor people tend to spend it. If one wants to keep an economy buoyant, one has to make sure that poor people have enough money in their pockets to keep it going. If one gives it all to rich people, they put it in banks, save it, or put it in offshore accounts, and they deflate the economy. Redistribution and intervening actually help to keep economies buoyant, maintain employment, ensure a decent life for working people and bring about a high level of social justice, which is what most Labour Members have spent their lives fighting for. Obviously, I will vote with the Government tonight against the Liberal Democrats, but I hope that, in their new-found enthusiasm for social democracy, the Liberal Democrats continue to move further to the left, and eventually become socialists.</p>

	<p pid="b.535.1/1">It is always an honour to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>. We are getting a blend of the 18th and 21st centuries in speeches tonight, and that is always a pleasure. I want to pick up some of the issues that have been raised and perhaps to take them a little further. I was very interested in the speech made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase> about the inter-bank market. He proposed that the central banks create an exchange that takes account of party risk for banks on either side of the inter-bank market. I just want to point out possible fundamental flaws in that approach. That is not to say that we should not explore it; however, it might not be the palliative that it appears to be at first glance.</p>
	<p pid="b.535.1/2">As hon. Members will know, there are already exchanges within financial markets&mdash;an example is the futures market&mdash;that take different kinds of counterparty risk. However, they do it by having margin pools. In other words, they require parties to pay ahead of their due dates, if that is the easiest way to describe it, in order to limit their exposure to the counterparties on either side. If an exchange takes the full credit risk of the counterparty for the banks on both sides of a transaction, the encouragement given to banks to make an irresponsible decision is quite extraordinary, because the transaction is protected by the exchange that stands in the middle. That is almost like saying that the package put together by the British and other Governments to come to the rescue of banks should not only be placed on a permanent footing but should be of a size and proportion that would, in effect, cover the whole banking market. That is a degree of exposure that we cannot possibly underwrite and undertake.</p>
	<p pid="b.535.1/3">For all of us, there is a sense of great failure in the fact that banking institutions have failed to assess the risk of the transactions with which they have been involved. Rather than relieve them of responsibility of ever having to assess that risk, we ought to require them to assess it. That is the direction in which we have to go; we should not basically say that central banks, and essentially Governments, will stand in the middle and take that counterparty risk.</p>

Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>. Does she agree that if we tried to establish a central body to take on the counterparty risk, the danger is that it would take on the counterparty risk for entities regulated in other European economic area countries? As a consequence, we would be taking on risks for places far beyond the UK&mdash;for Iceland, Estonia and so on.</p>

	<p pid="b.536.0/1">My hon. Friend is right, and it strikes me as impossible for an international body to have sufficient grip on and be sufficiently responsive to the sort of transactions and changes made by individual banks all over the globe. Such an arrangement would also remove responsibility from banks&mdash;a responsibility that no Government or central bank should take.</p>
	<p pid="b.536.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" name="John Redwood">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)</phrase> talked about the imbalance in the UK economy. That has been a concern of mine for a long time. There was a general feeling that it was following the direction of the future, and not taking a risk, to allow developments in financial services and the various spin-off industries and businesses to become overwhelmingly dominant within the UK economy. However, there has always been a risk involved. For example, nobody in this Chamber, when considering their pension, would put all their eggs in one basket or all their money in one sector of the economy. However, we in this country have largely allowed ourselves to invest heavily in one sector of the economy, largely on the assumption that it would be immune from the cyclical patterns that we know exist in manufacturing and what we might consider to be the more traditional industries. We have discovered that financial services are no more immune than other sectors to inevitable cycles; they follow the patterns that have developed in other industries and sectors. We have put ourselves into the terribly difficult position of having only one major arrow to our quiver. We must avoid going in that direction in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.536.0/3">This seems an ideal opportunity for the Government to focus on developing the green industries that we need if we are to tackle climate change. Often, when I hear people talk about the economic recession&mdash;we are at the beginning of it&mdash;I find that they tend to feel we should abandon environmental targets and our work to tackle climate change because we have to give priority to getting the economy back into shape. They have always seen the two as being in conflict with each other. I have never believed that they are in conflict. This is surely an opportunity for the Government to use every mechanism possible to encourage those industries, for example by encouraging the development of new technologies that will reduce our use of carbon and new forms of energy. Work needs to be done on infrastructure, too. There is a whole range of activities that the Government could begin to develop and underpin. We have before us a great opportunity to channel investment into the future; we know that that is required if our children are to have a reasonable environment in which to live. I want to encourage the Government and to hear whether they intend to take advantage of those issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.536.0/4">We are all concerned about how the regulators behaved throughout the period leading up to our financial crisis. The notion that regulators behaved perfectly and the crisis developed despite them strikes me as extraordinary and naive, and work must be done to create a much more rigorous regulatory system.</p>

	<p pid="b.536.2/1">I very much agree. There is suddenly demand for a lot of new regulation, but wise regulation might be better than simply stacking up layers of additional regulation. We must work out what needs to be regulated and how it would be most effectively done, so may I suggest one step in that direction? Members will be aware that the Parliamentary Ombudsman recently reached a verdict of maladministration against three of our most significant regulators in the case of Equitable Life, but the Government have not acted on that verdict. What better lesson could the markets, more broadly, and the regulators in particular, be taught than to live up to the terms that the ombudsman laid down, with an apology from every regulator to all those who lost out by taking pensions through Equitable Life, and the payment to them of the full compensation that the regulator called for?</p>

	<p pid="b.537.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point about the ombudsman's report on Equitable Life. It is disappointing that the Government have still not reached the point of saying sorry. Even then, they could develop the details for implementing the practical recompense. The Government have often prayed in aid the fact that it was a big report, but they had draft copies and knew where it was going. It should not have taken them so long to recognise that they needed to say sorry to the people who invested in Equitable Life.</p>

	<p pid="b.537.1/1">I very much agree. The ombudsman was very clear and, so that it was not too complex and difficult for the Government to grasp, made only two recommendations: one was the apology, and the other was a swift process for implementing compensation in full. When it comes to compensation for those who invested in Equitable Life, what once might have seemed like an extraordinarily large amount is lost to the right of a decimal point in the commitment of funds to resolve the broader banking crisis.</p>
	<p pid="b.537.1/2">Small businesses are very important in my constituency, and Member after Member has talked about the problems that small businesses in their constituencies have had obtaining credit, despite the Government's belief that they have from the various participants in their banking recovery plan the commitment to keep lending to small businesses at 2007 levels. One particular group in my constituency has been suffering, and its situation indicates the depth of the problem. This group, traditionally, has not needed credit lines and therefore has no credit history. Today, however, the companies need credit because their customer base is starting to pay late, but because they have no credit history, the banks are closed to them. Tied to that is the issue of suppliers. I know that the Government have said that they will try to pay people in 10 days, but my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> asked for much more detail about exactly what that means, how it will play out, and whether it will apply to quangos and related Government institutions, because the private sector is doing almost the opposite.</p>

	<p pid="b.537.2/1">We all commend the Government's approach, and the 10-day period should be passed on. Indeed, in my constituency we are trying to persuade the local authority to adopt the same approach, but does my hon. Friend agree that when the Government pay within 10 days, it is very often to larger suppliers that are not necessarily in the same financial difficulty as small suppliers at the bottom of the supply chain? Does she agree also that the Government should make their 10-day payment conditional on the same payment going down the supply chain&mdash;the same conditions, right the way through&mdash;to small suppliers, too?</p>

	<p pid="b.538.0/1">I very much agree. There is a fundamental flaw in many Government contracts, because they are designed so that only the large entity can bid on them; they are not examined to try to find ways they might be bid on by relatively small businesses to stimulate new enterprise. In that context, several private companies&mdash;Tesco is the name that comes to mind&mdash;are going not from 30 days to 10 days but in the other direction, and, I understand, adding another 30 days to the payment period. Very powerful entities, such as the major supermarkets, need to feel some heat from the Government to join them in their approach.</p>

	<p pid="b.538.6/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way as we move towards 6.30pm. Does she think that the Government should review the insolvency laws and examine the chapter 11 experience in America because of the difficulty that companies could face in a tight credit situation, whereby, owing to payment delays, they face legal action to be wound up? Perhaps chapter 11 is something that we in the UK might consider.</p>

	<p pid="b.538.7/1">My hon. Friend makes a pertinent comment and an important recommendation. Having worked in the United States for 18 years, I am conscious that chapter 11 often allows companies to continue and to be restored to health. We have not followed that mechanism in the UK, and I find that surprising, so the situation under discussion is, as my hon. Friend says, a good opportunity to make that change.</p>
	<p pid="b.538.7/2">Finally, I am particularly disturbed by the banks' dismissal of the Government's recommendations on the current bonus culture and of the public's outrage at its continuation. Members often feel that the reason why there is a problem with the bonus culture is that the sums of money are so utterly outrageous. At a time when the Government are coming to the rescue, the numbers seem almost immoral, but there is a deeper problem with the bonus culture in our institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.538.7/3">The Government know that many bankers at a variety of grades are paid exactly the same salary and that most of their income is from bonuses, which have always been tied to short-term performance. The problem is that when somebody makes a sensible decision, recognises risk and refuses to take it, they lose out on bonuses and rewards, whereas the person at the desk next to them who takes that extraordinary risk gets the great bonus. When that persists year on year, we end up with a culture in which not only do we reward risk-taking but we penalise people who make the appropriate decision and identify and begin to recognise both risk and systemic risk. We must turn the whole picture upside down if we are to have a healthy banking economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.539.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me to conclude the debate. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> kicked off the debate in a typically thoughtful and insightful way, and no doubt his speech was of interest to all who heard it. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> later made a similarly insightful and interesting contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.0/2">As my hon. Friends have dwelt in such depth and detail on a lot of the salient points at issue, I will concentrate slightly more on the political response to what in recent months has indeed been an unfolding economic crisis, as the title of the debate suggests. This debate is extremely timely because the economy is shrinking, unemployment is rising and tax revenue is falling. The backdrop to the debate is the issue of how that happened. Two arguments have been advanced by the two main parties. The Prime Minister's essential take on the current situation is that it is all the fault of sub-prime mortgages in America which have contaminated our domestic economy&mdash;an economy that in other circumstances would have been just fine. As has been reiterated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2033" name="John Howell">the hon. Member for Henley (John Howell)</phrase> and others in this debate, the Conservatives' take is different: they say that the problems are the Prime Minister's fault as he grew a bubble of personal and public debt in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.0/3">In a spirit of generosity, let me say that both sides are half right; they have identified the twin causes of a grave situation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham said, there have been international factors beyond our immediate control, but in many ways they have been made worse by how the Government have prepared the country for this situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.539.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman can be assured that they would pay less. Let me get to the party political dimension, because I know how much he enjoys that aspect of things.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/2">The Labour Government have not prepared us well for the current situation. As the right hon. Gentleman said earlier, the Government allowed private debt and house prices to soar to unsustainable levels, failed to make prudent assumptions when setting budgets for the public finances and were painfully slow to respond to rapidly changing economic circumstances earlier this year. As the Minister said, it is easy to make such observations in hindsight; it is much harder to make them in advance. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham deserves such credit and admiration, because he did precisely that. The Minister spoke for half an hour, but at no point did she address the salient point made about her response in the House to the economic crisis earlier this year. She was completely dismissive and high-handed about the warnings that my party was offering, free of charge, to the Government. If they had listened at that point, they might have been better equipped to deal with the current situation than they have been so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/3">I am afraid that the Conservative party has gone through a terribly difficult period; the past few months have been a painful humiliation and a case study in hubris for what was once a great party. It is hard not to wince when recalling the cluelessness, opportunism and inconsistency that has come from those on the Conservative Front Bench. Earlier, the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who is no longer in his place, made a partisan speech, but he was the one who got his party's uncertain start under way when he made his now infamous observations on borrowing. In one interview, the hon. Gentleman said both this:</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Increasing borrowing is not a strategy for dealing with the recession&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/5">and this:</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/6" class="indent">&quot;To increase borrowing to deal with an economic downturn&mdash;that's a perfectly sensible thing to do.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/7">That was not an auspicious start, but to be fair the hon. Gentleman is only doing the bidding of his political master, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1868" name="George Osborne">the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/8">Unlike many of his own Back Benchers, I do not wish the shadow Chancellor any misfortune. I have followed the career of the Conservative child prodigy with a benevolent interest, and it gives me great sadness to say that at every single juncture of this economic crisis he has been found wanting. Let me illustrate the point. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham has led the debate on interest rate policy. We have already heard what the shadow Chancellor said in the House about interest rates in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park less than a month ago:</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/9" class="indent">&quot;I do not think that it is particularly sensible...for politicians speaking from the Front Bench to call on the Bank to cut or increase interest rates. Indeed, I make it a practice not to comment on them.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-10-14.708"><i> Official Report</i>, 14 October 2008; Vol. 480, c. 708</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/10">I am going to chronicle the terrible unravelling of the shadow Chancellor's credibility on the issue by referring throughout to that reliable journal, <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>. Initially, there was a false start, because just two weeks after the shadow Chancellor made his comment in the House, the headline that confronted me as I opened the newspaper was &quot;Osborne admits his mistake&quot;. I thought that progress had been made, but soon found out that the headline referred to a completely separate catastrophic error of judgment by the hon. Gentleman. However, I had to wait only a further 24 hours for the <i> Telegraph </i>headline: &quot;George Osborne: Slash interest rates to drag Britain out of economic nosedive&quot;. <i> [Interruption.]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> says that the shadow Chancellor did not say that. However, I took the trouble of reading the article, which contained quotations attributed to the shadow Chancellor&mdash;they may have been written by him or by one of the teenagers in his office. One of the quotations stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/11" class="indent">&quot;there is plenty of scope to stimulate demand with lower rates&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/12">That is what the shadow Chancellor said, having told the House that it was his practice not to comment on interest rate policy. He is struggling to keep up; he is a follower, not a leader.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/13">Hon. Members do not need to take my word for that, as it is the judgment of the shadow Chancellor's own admirers. Only a week after the article that I mentioned appeared, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-07">7 November</phrase>, there was a <i> Daily Telegraph </i>headline that will cause sadness on both sides of the House. It read, &quot;Support for George Osborne collapses&quot;. I did not say that, and neither did Labour party Members&mdash;Conservative party supporters did. Anybody who thinks that last week's cut in interest rates was a dramatic percentage fall needs to see the shadow Chancellor's credibility rating. In one month, his approval rating has fallen from 70 per cent. to 2 per cent., which is a mark of how well the Conservative party has responded to the economic crisis. The article went on to describe the sheer horror of the hon. Gentleman's position. It said, &quot;Only Caroline Spelman&quot;&mdash;an extremely inauspicious start to any paragraph about a politician in trouble&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.541.1/8">We have to remember that the Conservatives' flagship economic policy, which enabled them to look both ways and tell completely different audiences that they were on their side, was to share the proceeds of growth.

	<p pid="b.542.1/1">The hon. Gentleman sets me a very difficult challenge, which is to chronicle in 15 minutes absolutely every inappropriate remark made by the hon. Member for Tatton. I am concentrating on some of the particular lowlights. It is a depressing experience for all of us who want to see a young man do well in politics. He is very enthusiastic, and his reputation was extremely good, but we are now witnessing a very difficult period for him. However, that is how the Conservatives have positioned themselves. They wanted to share the proceeds of growth, seeming never to have considered that there may not be any growth to share the proceeds of. One can only infer that the logical conclusion is that they now want to cut spending and increase taxes, which would be the flipside of that&mdash;in other words, sharing the pain of negative growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.542.1/2">The other policy that the Conservatives have been giving us a cast-iron promise to put in place is to match Labour's tax and spending commitments. We are now in an unhappy position whereby Labour's tax and spending commitments are not quite as impressive as the heir to Blair&mdash;the leader of the Conservative party&mdash;clearly originally thought that they were. Only yesterday, there was an unseemly clamour in the Sunday newspapers for Labour and the Conservatives to position themselves much closer to the commitments made by my hon.

	<p pid="b.542.2/1">The suspense is too great for me to wait to see whether my hon. Friend is going to come to another example: when fuel prices were rocketing, the shadow Chancellor promised to cut fuel duty to keep things fair. Does he agree that the logic of the Tory position is that we should now be jacking up fuel duty to keep things fair?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.542.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="542"  time="018:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0012.htm#08111015000149">
	<p pid="b.542.3/1">That is another extremely well-informed intervention. What the Conservatives did&mdash;I suppose that it is only fair given the lack of experience on their Front Bench&mdash;was rush into panic mode when they thought that there would be an opportunity for a quick hit when prices for unleaded petrol were going up to 110p or 112p a litre. My party had a reasonably detailed conversation about the Conservative proposal, concluded that it was completely potty, and therefore decided not to support it. We were well advised in that, because now the Conservatives, keen to tell everybody their policies, will be putting out leaflets, inappropriately called &quot;In Touch&quot;, in every constituency saying, &quot;Vote Conservative&mdash;we'll put your petrol up by 5p a litre.&quot; <i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ] </i>It is 5p this week, and it could get a lot worse. The Conservative proposition is, &quot;Vote for the same taxes as under Labour apart from more on petrol.&quot; That is not a particularly impressive piece of positioning.</p>
	<p pid="b.542.3/2">My message to Conservative Members who long instead for decisive and coherent leadership is this: &quot;You do not have to remain trapped in the high-tax, wasteful spending box into which your shadow Chancellor has locked you. You can support this Liberal Democrat motion and show your constituents that you too believe in the values put forward by my party&mdash;effective public spending that offers real value for money, low interest rates to help struggling families and small businesses, and real tax cuts now for low and middle-income households, who need our help.&quot; Those are the right policies for Britain; they are Liberal Democrat policies, and they need to happen now.</p>

	<p pid="b.543.0/1">Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund reported:</p>
	<p pid="b.543.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The world economy is now entering a major downturn in the face of the most dangerous shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.543.0/3">The Bank of England's recent financial stability report concluded that in recent weeks the global banking system had undoubtedly undergone its biggest episode of instability since the start of world war one. Even the dogs in the street know that the origins of the current financial and economic turmoil lie in the problems of the US sub-prime market and a record surge in oil and food prices. It does not wash with the British people to suggest that the problems we are facing are wholly or mainly the result of domestic policies, and the official Opposition have no credibility in attempting to suggest that.</p>
	<p pid="b.543.0/4">I am not pretending that there are no lessons to be learned&mdash;we have done so. That is why the Financial Services Authority is introducing its enhanced supervisory regime and why we have asked Lord Adair Turner, its relatively new chairman, to advise us on further reforms that might be necessary. However, the general public will find it difficult to take seriously the judgment of the official Opposition, who were against our actions on Northern Rock, who opposed the Banking (Special Provisions) Bill, and who would not have safeguarded Bradford &amp; Bingley but who, in effect, would have let it go to the wall.</p>
	<p pid="b.543.0/5">I think that British people have welcomed our decisive action in leading and co-ordinating the efforts of Governments across the world to support the global economy through these very difficult times. At home, we have taken unprecedented steps to shore up the UK's domestic financial system, providing &pound;37 billion of public money to some of our high street banks so that they can improve their capital positions. Through the Bank of England, we have made available more than &pound;200 billion of Treasury bills to provide liquidity to the banking sector, and we have introduced a &pound;250 billion credit guarantee facility to restore confidence and breathe new life into inter-bank lending. This support is crucial, because banks lie at the heart of our economy. We will do whatever it takes, despite the fact that the official Opposition do not support us, to ensure financial stability&mdash;to ensure that small businesses have access to credit and that home owners are able to re-mortgage when they have to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.543.1/1">When the regulator decided to increase the capital requirement for each bank in the system, did it calculate how much lending that would take out of the system and, if so, was it happy with that?</p>

	<p pid="b.544.0/1">I will answer the right hon. Gentleman's question in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.544.0/2">We recognise that it is tough out there, and getting tougher, for hard-working families and small businesses, so we are targeting support at those who need it most. We are supporting households that are facing higher food and fuel bills by raising the income tax personal allowance for 2008-09 by &pound;600, which is worth &pound;120 to the basic rate taxpayer. All basic rate taxpayers will have seen that in their take-home pay from September. We have delayed the fuel duty increase from April this year to April 2009, saving businesses and families nearly &pound;100 million every month, as opposed to the Tories' bungled policy, which would mean that people would now be facing a fuel duty escalator. We are making additional payments to the over-60s and over-80s of &pound;50 and &pound;100 respectively alongside the winter fuel payment, to the benefit of some 9 million households. We have announced a &pound;1 billion package of energy efficiency measures, which means that all households will be able to save at least 50 per cent. on a range of practical energy-saving devices, for which 11 million of the most vulnerable households will qualify free of charge. We are offering financial support through the winter fuel payment, the Warm Front scheme and the expanded carbon emissions reduction target.</p>
	<p pid="b.544.0/3">Despite the global credit crunch, we need to ensure that the small firms that are vital to our economy have access to the loans and capital they need to let their businesses grow and develop. An announcement from the Chancellor at the end of last month means that Britain's small and medium-sized enterprises stand to benefit from up to &pound;4 billion in loans from the European Investment Bank over the next four years. Based on the UK's shareholding in the EIB, British small businesses should be able to benefit substantially between 2008 and 2011. As a first step, UK banks have already signalled their interest in securing around &pound;1 billion a year from the EIB.</p>

	<p pid="b.544.2/1">It is always the task of the official Opposition to raise points that deflect us from the key issue. We are acting to help small businesses and to promote inter-bank lending. There were issues, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, relating to the way in which individuals set themselves up in business because of relative tax positions. That was one of the reasons we took the action we did, and we have debated the matter on many occasions. Moreover, the availability and active marketing of competitively priced lending to small businesses and to home owners is part of the conditionality agreements under the recapitalisation scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.544.2/2">I shall deal with some of the key issues raised. I say to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1433" name="Ruth Kelly">the Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly)</phrase> that we will continue to hold our nerve, and stay on the side of the British people during this difficult time. We in this country will work with others to help to reform the international financial system.</p>
	<p pid="b.544.2/3">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase> raised an important issue. He is right that guarantees on inter-bank lending are only a temporary solution&mdash;they are specifically designed as such in response to the current crisis. He suggested that we ought to have an inter-bank market exchange, which would be a long-term solution to enable inter-bank lending in future. I would be happy to meet him and those advising him on these matters, along with my officials, because inter-bank lending is of fundamental importance&mdash;a point raised by a number of hon. Members.</p>

	<p pid="b.545.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that generous offer, which I will take up. I would like to make it absolutely plain that what I suggested was meant to supplement the measures taken by the Government. I congratulate the Government and I fully support everything they have done. Given the magnitude of the crisis, all of us in this House should be acting&mdash;as far as we can&mdash;to bring together our efforts to address it. I thank my hon.

	<p pid="b.545.1/1">I appreciate the constructive way in which my right hon. Friend set out his proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.1/2">The Government's policy on credit guarantees is an important part of the overall financial package announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-08">8 September</phrase>, and progress has been made. Overnight LIBOR was 6.8 per cent. on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-16">16 September</phrase>; today, it is 3.2 per cent. The three-month LIBOR rate has declined over the past 10 days from 6.3 per cent. to 4.4 per cent. Contingent liabilities taken on through the scheme will be reported to Parliament through the usual winter and summer estimates process.</p>

	<p pid="b.545.2/1">On the reintroduction of 150 basis points in the minimum lending rate, LIBOR went down by only 120 points. Does that not demonstrate the failure of some aspects of the Government's policies?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.545.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" colnum="545"  time="018:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0012.htm#08111025000925">
	<p pid="b.545.3/1">I would like to think that the hon. Gentleman supported our action on credit guarantees and welcomed the Bank of England's cut in interest rates. Some of these things will take time to work through the system, but the credit guarantees, the measures taken through the special liquidity scheme and the bank recapitalisation comprise a sophisticated package that has been copied by other countries around the world. We believe that it will have a hugely positive impact. We will, of course, keep all the policies under review, as we always do with such matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/2">A number of other points were raised, and I would like to address in particular the Liberal Democrats' tax proposal, which, as expressed by their leader on television this morning, was a sustainable cut of 4p, to make the rate 16p in the pound. I have not seen any real explanation of how the Liberal Democrats would pay for that. It would cost &pound;19.2 billion per annum. If the Liberal Democrats propose to pay for the cuts by raising the higher rate of tax, it would have to go up to 52p in the pound. If they were to say, as they often like to, that the top earners on more than &pound;100,000 should pay, a 26 per cent. increase in the top rate of tax would be required, taking it to 66 per cent. I am told by officials that that estimate does not take behavioural impacts into account. I am not sure how many high earners would remain in the country if they had to pay a 66 per cent. marginal rate of tax on income over &pound;100,000. I am afraid that Liberal Democrat tax policies simply do not add up.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/3">The Government cannot and should not try to prop up house prices, but we recognise that volatility in the housing market can be a cause of great concern. That is why we announced a significant package of measures on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-02">2 September</phrase>, and it is why we will continue to consider what more we can do.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/4">On the contention that we did not fix the roof when the sun was shining, I remember the dog days of the Labour Government of 1974 to 1979. We were investing in fixing roofs even during those very difficult economic times. When we came to power in 1997, capital spending was less than half what we spent during that hugely difficult economic period. Since 1997, we have been able to more than triple in real terms capital spending in this country. We have not only fixed many roofs, but we have built new schools and hospitals, and improved the UK's transport infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/5">We must not let the official Opposition con the British public into thinking that we have not fixed the roof&mdash;we have, and we have taken decisive action. What is more, we were prudent and sensible in running the UK economy. Since 1997, inflation has averaged 3 per cent., compared with more than 8 per cent. in the previous three decades. Long-term interest rates have averaged about 5 per cent., compared with roughly double that previously. That is how the Government have managed to triple public investment while cutting debt. It was not always easy, and we have had to make tough choices&mdash;for example, the decision to spend the &pound;23 billion that we secured from the spectrum auctions not on public services but on reducing Government debt. That has put us in a strong position as we face difficult economic times. The Government want to show in our pre-Budget report the further steps that we will take on the side of hard-working people and small businesses in this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.549.1/1">Question accordingly agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/2">Mr. Deputy Speaker <i> forthwith declared the main Question, as amended, to be agreed to.</i></p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/3" class="italic"> Resolved,</p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/4" class="indent">That this House notes that the Government's actions mean that the economy is entering a period of global downturn with unemployment, inflation and interest rates all much lower than in previous slowdowns, and with debt reduced from 43 per cent. of gross domestic product in 1997 to below 36 per cent. last year; welcomes the extra investment in public services and public servants that this has enabled to compensate for historical underinvestment both in infrastructure and services in every region; supports the Government's global leadership and action to tackle both the causes and effects of the financial and economic turmoil on an international level; welcomes the Government's timely support to protect financial stability and consequently depositors, business and the wider economy; further notes that as a condition of this support the Government has demanded support in turn for homeowners and small and medium size businesses; further notes the action that has been taken in the court system and through mortgage interest support to enable people to stay in their homes, and the provision of &pound;360 million to help small and medium size businesses under the Train to Gain initiative; and further notes that Government action to support families, individuals and businesses across the UK through the tougher times ahead includes extra tax credits, cutting income tax, freezing fuel duty, further winter fuel payments and increases in Child Benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.554.1/1">Mr. Speaker has selected the amendment in the name of the Prime Minister. In view of the compressed time available for the debate and the number of hon.

	<p pid="b.554.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.554.2/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes with concern the fact that the Department for Work and Pensions has written to Post Office card account holders informing them that the Post Office card account contract ends in 2010; further notes that Post Office card account holders, many of whom have made a conscious decision to support the Post Office by retaining their card account, are being instructed to take out bank accounts in order to receive benefits beyond 2010; expresses its dismay at the fact that the letter does not mention the fact that a replacement for the current card account is currently out to tender, or make any mention of other Post Office products or services; believes that this is a deliberate attempt to encourage people to switch payment to direct debit and remove the role of the Post Office; further notes the additional damage inflicted on the Post Office by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which is currently sending out licence renewal reminders as part of a communications campaign which makes no mention of the Post Office; calls on Ministers in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to encourage Ministers in the Department for Work and Pensions to consider the impact on communities across the country if the Post Office card account is not renewed; and encourages all Government departments to make their services available through post offices in order to ensure that they have a viable future.</p>
	<p pid="b.554.2/3">The motion highlights the inconsistency between what the Government have said and what they are doing. One example of that is the fact that the Government amendment describes the title of the motion as &quot;Removal of the Post Office Card Account&quot;. In fact, it is entitled &quot;Renewal of the Post Office Card Account&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.554.5/1">It may amuse the hon. Lady to know that a recent response on the future of the post office network from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to the BERR Committee&mdash;of which I am a member&mdash;was headed &quot;The Failure of the Post Office Network&quot;.

	<p pid="b.554.6/1">There are clearly a number of ways in which the debate could be classified. However, there are also a number of inconsistencies between the Government's actions and their words. They said that they would sign new contracts for the replacement of the Post Office card account at the beginning of 2008, but it is now November, and we still do not even know who has won the tender. They said that the managed closure programme would ensure a viable future for the post office network, but Ministers have campaigned against post office closures in their constituencies while voting in favour of closures elsewhere. They said that they believed in the future of Royal Mail Group, while doing all that they could to run down the business. That business made a profit of &pound;577 million in 1997, but, after a decade of what the Government describe as unprecedented economic growth, Royal Mail Group's profit was just &pound;86 million in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.555.0/1">Many Labour Members are very concerned about the future of the Post Office card account, but I shall not be voting for the Liberal Democrat motion. At the time of the local elections in Newcastle-under-Lyme, the Liberal Democrats implied that they could save every post office, irrespective of whether it was uneconomic, whether the postmistress wanted to retire and whether anyone wanted to run it.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/2">May I ask the hon. Lady a question about consistency? Will she confirm that at a Liberal Democrat party conference not too long ago, her party voted in favour of separating Royal Mail delivery from the network, privatising it, and then subsidising the network whatever the cost of doing so?</p>

	<p pid="b.555.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman reads the motion he will see that it raises specific complaints, and echoes the wording of an early-day motion signed by a number of members of all parties. There is clearly support for the motion across the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.555.3/1">That is a very good question, to which I shall return later.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.3/2">The reason why post offices and Royal Mail Group have suffered such hits on their profits is that the Government are removing a wide range of services from the Post Office, while also trying to scare away the loyal custom that the Post Office already enjoys. In 2006, they announced that people could no longer pay for their television licences at post offices. In the same year, they told people who received their benefits and pensions through the Post Office card account that it was being withdrawn, and that they would have to open bank accounts to continue to receive their benefits. In 2008, the DVLA sent out reminder notices asking people to pay by direct debit, making no mention of the possibility of paying via the Post Office. Step by step, the Government are taking business away from the Post Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.555.4/1">This is a track record that dates from the start of the Post Office card account. People had to fight to open a Post Office card account: the Department for Work and Pensions put every possible barrier in their way, including a call centre that they had to telephone where attempts would be made to talk them out of it. People had made a conscious decision to use the Post Office because they wanted a nice simple way of getting their money. The Government tried to put all possible hurdles in their way, but millions of them chose the Post Office despite that, and they should be allowed to do so again.</p>

By January 2006, not even halfway through the contract period, the Government had already decided to take the business away from the Post Office.

Friend highlighted, because the closures would be the result of sub-postmasters facing bankruptcy. They would not be planned. I do not believe that we should be prepared to consider the prospect of sub-postmasters facing bankruptcy as a result of Government decisions. At a time of economic uncertainty, with increasing unemployment and increasing numbers of people needing to access benefits over the next few years, it is extraordinary that the Government would seek to pursue a policy that would actively destroy the livelihoods of at least 3,000 people. Those closures could be far worse for the long-term future of the post office network as a whole, because a chaotic series of closures across the network could leave serious gaps in provision, which would mean post offices would lose critical mass, and that would undermine the Post Office's ability successfully to bid for future contracts, so this could be the first stage in a very dramatic decline in numbers.</p>

	<p pid="b.558.4/1">No, I will not give way any more at present. However, POCA is worth significantly more than that in some deprived urban areas. On average, POCA payments bring in about &pound;400 a month, which is 12 per cent. of net pay. That contrasts sharply with the proportion of income post offices receive from bill payment&mdash;only 5 per cent.&mdash;and from banking transactions, which is currently 1 per cent. It is therefore clear that removing POCA would leave a huge gap in the budgets of sub-postmasters.</p>
	<p pid="b.558.4/2">This is not just about the income from the transactions themselves, because POCA brings people into the post office, and at that point they also spend money on other goods and services there. Each of the 3.8 million POCA customers pays on average seven visits per month to the post office, and in each visit they spend on average &pound;6 on the retail side. Therefore, the loss of business that would follow from the removal of POCA could lose the Post Office much of its annual &pound;2 billion retail income.</p>

It has shown that it will use any means necessary to ensure that vulnerable people are left with the impression that after 2010 they will have no option other than a bank account. My concern is that the DWP is not considering how best to service the needs of its customers. It has to decide whether benefits should be administered in a way that helps the vulnerable customers it is supposed to be supporting or just administered in the easiest way possible for the DWP.</p>
	<p pid="b.559.8/2">The loss of POCA could have a huge impact on some of the most vulnerable in society. More than a third of all pension credit payments and more than one in four income support payments are paid into POCAs. In total, 23 per cent. of all benefit claims are paid through POCA.</p>
	<p pid="b.559.8/3">Although the pain will be felt across the whole of the UK, several Members have already highlighted the fact that rural areas will be particularly badly hit. Although 60 per cent. of rural areas have a post office, fewer than 4 per cent. have banks, so this will clearly have a disproportionate effect on those areas. In many villages, the post office is crucial to the survival of other businesses in the village. Pensioners and benefit recipients collect their cash in the post office and spend it in both the post office and other village shops.</p>

	<p pid="b.560.1/1">Not for the moment. If such people have to travel for miles into a nearby town to access their cash, they are more likely to spend their cash in that town rather than supporting businesses in the area where they live, so this could have much wider implications.</p>

	<p pid="b.561.0/1">I am not going to give way immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.0/2">A further issue concerns those who cannot open bank accounts and involves another group of people we should be considering today. Basic bank accounts do not make any money for banks, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for some people&mdash;those with poor credit histories, large debts, previous debt problems or no address, and people with certain mental health problems&mdash;to open one. In the current climate, banks do not want to take on additional risk, and the number of people in that group is actually increasing. Therefore, when the Government moved giros to direct payment and made people open basic bank accounts or Post Office card accounts, 40 per cent. of the people converting opened the latter&mdash;a figure far higher than expected. They could have chosen to open a bank account, but they did not want to or were not able to.</p>

	<p pid="b.561.1/1">The hon. Lady is explaining the case very clearly. Does she agree that at a time of banking crisis, when many of our constituents are very wary of trusting banks, the one thing that they can trust is the Post Office card account and National Savings? Surely it is perverse that the one very safe area is now under threat.</p>

	<p pid="b.561.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct, and the issue of trust is an important one. There are lots of reasons why people would choose to have a Post Office card account rather than a bank account, and one is that the post office is often an important community resource. It is a source of advice and information and a place where people meet and socialise, particularly in rural areas. Sub-postmasters play a very important role in many communities. They usually know their customers and they are trusted, as the hon. Gentleman said. I recently spoke to a pensioner in my constituency who relies completely on the postmaster in the post office where she collects her pension. She cannot remember her PIN. He knows it, and he tells her what it is every week&mdash;it is the only way that she can access her pension. Clearly, that gives rise to security issues, but it shows just how much postmasters are trusted by members of the community.</p>

	<p pid="b.561.3/1">I very much agree with what the hon. Lady has been saying.

	<p pid="b.561.6/1">I am not going to give way any more at the moment, because I need to make progress. A number of Members want to speak tonight.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.6/2">The physical accessibility of post offices is another reason why people choose to go to a post office, rather than a bank. Even after the latest round of closures, the Post Office, uniquely, has branches in most rural and in most urban areas, so it has a much wider spread than most other providers. Those using the Post Office card account as their main source of cash are particularly likely to have mobility or health problems and no access to a car, and they are more likely to rely on public transport. It is particularly difficult for that group of people to access a bank or another outlet, particularly in rural areas, where usually there are no banks or ATMs. Help the Aged has produced research highlighting particular concerns among those in this position. They are worried that if they have to travel a long way by public transport to get hold of their money, they will have to take out larger amounts each time they travel, which will lead to security concerns while they bring the money back home on public transport. They are also concerned about having more cash at home.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.6/3">Access is a question not just of distance but of access to the outlet itself. Most post offices have been physically adapted to allow disabled access. For people in the customer group we are talking about today&mdash;it includes incapacity benefit, disability living allowance and pension credit claimants&mdash;the compliance of such properties with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is absolutely essential so that they can access their money. The Post Office has taken this issue seriously, but what guarantees do we have that any new outlets that people are forced to use would do the same? Have the Government done a DDA impact assessment on the closing of the Post Office card account and taking it away from post offices? Have they looked at people's access to outlets and within outlets? If, as the rumours suggest, PayPoint takes over, what consideration has been given to the accessibility of PayPoint outlets? What control would the Government have over that, given that PayPoint operates on a franchise basis? How much control would the Government have, in order to ensure that people could access their money in disability-friendly properties?</p>
	<p pid="b.561.6/4">Several Members have this evening mentioned that the Government's indecision has already proved extremely damaging to the Post Office, but the decision to give the card account replacement contract to a different operator could be deadly. The Post Office is working toward an unsubsidised post office network by 2016, but that relies on people going through their branches and using banking and benefit services, and on the Post Office card account as a transition. If the Government continue on the destructive path that they are pursuing, the Post Office will not have enough time to recover from the damage caused by the withdrawal of Government business from the Post Office over the past five years and to rebuild itself. We have the perfect opportunity to use an existing network of well-trained, well-informed, trusted staff who are in offices in almost every corner of the country to deliver meaningful improvements in terms of financial inclusion. Post offices actually want and need the custom of the people the banks are turning down, so we should be building on that, rather than destroying it.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.6/5">The Post Office needs the replacement card account contract as a bridge to enable it to move to a financially viable position. In countries such as Italy and Ireland, there are examples of successful and thriving post office networks that operate as a &quot;postbank&quot;. There is no reason why we cannot have a thriving and successful post office network in the UK, but by pulling the rug out from underneath the Post Office's feet at this point, the Government are almost guaranteeing that there will be no future for it.</p>

	<p pid="b.563.0/1">I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way, and she is making a very good case. I was hoping that she would spend a little more time talking about the impact on rural areas.

	<p pid="b.563.2/1">The hon. Lady is making a very strong case about how deadly it would be for the Post Office if it lost the card account.

	<p pid="b.563.3/1">The tendering process certainly gives rise to issues that I want to raise myself, and the hon. Lady makes an interesting point. So far as I can see, the tendering process is probably one of the least open such processes that we have had. I, among others, have been trying to get hold of the terms of the tender. I recently asked for a copy of the documentation setting out the criteria used for the basis of making a decision on the contract to be placed in the Library. The Minister replied as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.563.3/2" class="indent">&quot;The tender process for the contract for the Post Office card account successor is still under way and a decision on the outcome is yet to be made.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-11-03.9"><i> Official Report</i>, 3 November 2008; Vol. 482, c. 9W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.563.3/3">That may well be true&mdash;although some people believe that the decision has been made already. However, true or not, it does not answer my question. I asked for the documentation to be placed in the Library. All Members are aware that the decision is being looked at, but the documentation could still be made public. The Government's evasiveness on this point raises questions about the criteria that they have laid out in the contract tender, such as how much emphasis they placed on the need for geographical spread, which links to the issue of rural communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.563.4/1">My hon. Friend is right to talk about geographic spread. She mentioned earlier that PayPoint is one of the bidders. The island of Colonsay has a post office, and if people put the postcode into the PayPoint website, they are told that the nearest outlet is at Bowmore, on the island of Islay, which is 22 miles away. Rural areas will be badly hit; however, islands that have post offices but no banks or PayPoint outlets will be much harder hit if the Government do not take into account the fact that, for all these small islands, they must keep the account with the Post Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.563.5/1">My hon. Friend gives another example of why we need to ensure that we know what the terms of the tender agreement are. The evasiveness that the Government are displaying in this regard is also increasing concern and suspicion among the Post Office's customers and sub-postmasters, who are fearful of the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.5/2">A number of questions have been asked about the legality of providing continuing state aid if the Post Office is not delivering social benefits. The processing of social benefits is one of the criteria on which applications for state aid approval are measured. If POCA 2 is delivered by somebody other than the Post Office, will the Government's &pound;150 million a year social network payment become illegal? If so, it would be even more devastating for the Post Office across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.5/3">The Government have said one thing about the Post Office and the POCA replacement, but their actions contradict it. While DBERR says that it is trying to reorganise the network so that it is financially viable, the DWP is doing all it can to undermine a valuable piece of business that the Post Office has. The Government need to start being joined up and to stop undermining themselves. I suggest that POCA should stay in the Post Office, that the Government should make wider services available through Post Office branches and that they should put an end to the uncertainty as soon as possible to stop the rot and ensure that post offices have a viable future.</p>

That figure is higher than the total of all the high street banks put together. We do not believe in a purely commercial network, because the Post Office is not a purely commercial service; it reaches parts of our community that others do not, it is used and understood by people in ways that others are not, and most of all it is a cornerstone of our local communities.

	<p pid="b.565.4/1">The Secretary of State has puzzled me. I am happy to stand corrected on this, but my understanding is that, historically, the post office network has run on a commercial basis and that the aspiration of its current management is that it should once again do so. An interim period has to be got through, but the noble aspiration is for post offices to stand on their own two feet, and I heartily support it.</p>

	<p pid="b.565.5/1">I said on a purely commercial basis. Indeed, under the hon.

We cannot guarantee that any particular service will go to the Post Office if it required procurement, but we can say that identity cards and identity services could be a good business opportunity for the Post Office.

	<p pid="b.566.3/2">As much as the Opposition would like to pretend that we can ignore the way in which the world is changing, we cannot do so. The way in which the Post Office operates and the market in which it does so are different from what happened 10 or 15 years ago; they are even different from the situation two years ago. Some 4 million fewer visits a week are made to a post office and 1 million car tax disc renewals are done online each month. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Opposition can protest if they want, but these changes are happening in our society. People want to renew their tax disc outside working hours and to do so online. Are the Opposition seriously saying that we should refuse to offer online services? If that is their position, they are even more antediluvian than <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2031" name="Bob Spink">the hon.

For example, he might be aware that Tesco sells some of its products over the internet these days. The Post Office cannot be immune to these services. The question is: how do we maintain the fundamental objectives that we have for this important service, while realising that the world in which post offices operate is changing? How can we help them to modernise, as opposed to putting our head in the sand and pretending that those changes are not happening?</p>

I want to make it clear that I completely understand the strength of feeling that has been expressed in the House and by the thousands of people who have written to all Members to explain how strongly they feel. I feel that I have already made it clear&mdash;at boring length&mdash;that I cannot say anything further on that point.</p>

As far as POCA is concerned, we have not been writing to our customers instructing them to open bank accounts. There was one mistaken letter, for which we have apologised, and the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire has brought another two incidents to my attention; we have corrected the problem and will be providing further training. I can reassure him that that is not the official policy of the Department; we have not written to people to ask them to transfer their POCA accounts to bank accounts. We have with cheques and we have been doing that since 2005. There is nothing new about that at all. Indeed, I have amended the leaflet in the light of the hon. Gentleman's letter to me.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.6/3">It would not be true to say that we are not opening new POCAs. We are opening 12,500 POCAs every month, precisely because we inform people about the availability of that service.</p>

	<p pid="b.570.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The answer will be familiar to my hon. Friends: it is the magical Liberal Democrat money tree, which produces both cuts and increases in public spending without their ever having to be squared in any way at all. He is right to say that the Liberal Democrats want to make cuts of &pound;20 billion. If I were running a post office I would be more worried about their being in power, because they will need to find those cuts. That stands in clear contrast to our policy of increasing spending on the Post Office.</p>

Sixty per cent. of bank accounts are available from post offices, which in itself increases footfall, as well as increasing people's ability to find a job because their salary can be paid into a bank account. It increases their ability to make reductions in their energy costs through the use of direct debits. As he says, there is no single solution.</p>

	<p pid="b.571.0/1">I listened carefully to the Secretary of State, but my clear view is that the Government should be ashamed of their handling of local post offices. Over the past few years, I have heard time and again how little Ministers have done to find a new role for post offices at a time of change. The big fear today is that Ministers' lack of judgment on the future of the Post Office card account will ring the death knell for yet another large swathe of the post office network.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/2">No one on either side of the House has ever argued that the post office network should go through no change at all. It has changed under Governments of all persuasions, but for years it has felt as though Ministers have no interest in finding ways of ensuring that the local post office has a future role. The Secretary of State says, &quot;Trust us and what we are doing&quot;, but we have only to remember how the Government and their Ministers handled the launch of the Post Office card account in the first place. They published booklet after booklet. There may have been corrections in one&mdash;as we heard today&mdash;but over the years booklet after booklet has explained to people how payments can be made directly into their bank account, and has set out other new ways of dealing with the Department for Work and Pensions and its agencies. However, to the fury of local postmasters and postmistresses in my constituency and around the country, the Post Office card account was mentioned only as an afterthought, buried in the small print in leaflets that most reasonable people judged as completely biased against it.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/3">There was real frustration in post offices that customers had to turn page after page to find out whether the card account was even an alternative. At the time, I read the leaflets and promotional material and it certainly looked as though the Government hoped that the Post Office card account would not take off.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/4">The product had an unhappy childhood, but despite all the Government's efforts large numbers of pensioners now depend on it&mdash;far more than expected. More than 4 million people use the accounts, half of them pensioners. Much more could be done with the card accounts to make them of even greater benefit to those who use them.</p>

	<p pid="b.572.1/3">I am glad to hear the Secretary of State's assurances that he is trying to do his best with marketing, but only today I received a letter from a postmaster in Liverpool who asks why the Government are still making things difficult for people who want to take out a Post Office card account. He said,</p>
	<p pid="b.572.1/4" class="indent">&quot;listen to the conversation with the DWP as they try to obtain a POCA account and you will witness what I have witnessed, that the choice is simply not offered, in fact it is positively discouraged to the point of coercion.&quot;</p>

Yes, the Government have not been enthusiastic about getting people to use POCA, but if a sub-postmaster is worth their salt, especially in my area&mdash;I cannot understand why this is not reflected in other areas&mdash;they encourage people to sign up to POCA. POCA has been successful because of sub-postmasters. I am a little shocked that that sub-postmaster does not understand the rules that they are using.</p>

	<p pid="b.574.3/1">The Secretary of State is absolutely right that the issue that we are debating today is not simply access to the Post Office card account to enable pensioners to get pension payments. The issue is also about social deprivation and the challenges that exist in many of our communities. It is a crucial issue for families in the battle against poverty. It is all very well for us; we have easy access to financial services, banking, credit, cash to pay our bills, and funding for major purchases such as a car to get to work. However, the truth is that one in 25 families still has no bank account of any kind, and 800,000 children are being brought up in households with no bank account. Some 7.8 million people in the UK are unable to access mainstream credit. That puts huge extra financial pressure on families. That is why the debate has deeper significance; it is not simply about the future of the post office network, however important that is. We are dealing with a vehicle that can address some of the biggest social issues in our society.</p>

Gentleman agree that one of the sad things about all that has happened to the Post Office is that it is not just central Government who have withdrawn their services from it; local government started the process. Members from across the political parties could encourage local authorities to look again at the services that they could still provide through the Post Office.

	<p pid="b.575.0/1">I would like Departments and local authorities to look at ways of strengthening our post office network, yes, but the significance of the debate is that it shows that there is no other step in the pipeline that would lead to such an extensive further closure programme in our post office network. That is why the debate is so important.</p>

	<p pid="b.575.1/1">My hon. Friend has not yet mentioned small businesses, but those in my constituency absolutely rely on local post offices. We have lost more than half our network in the past five years. Does he agree that this is the last time at which we should want to reduce small businesses' access to post offices?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.575.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" speakername="Chris Grayling" colnum="575"  time="020:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0017.htm#08111027000318">
	<p pid="b.575.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. We know that small businesses use post offices vastly disproportionately more than any other similar services available to them. The disappearance of the local post office can be a real blow to small local businesses, particularly emerging businesses in areas of society that face significant challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.575.2/2">Of course, there is another dimension to the financial pressure on families, apart from the lack of access to banking services. Someone without access to financial services cannot access the cheapest tariffs, because they do not have the basic ability to pay through direct debit. There have been all kinds of estimates of the cost of the poverty premium to people on low incomes&mdash;the extra that they pay to access basic financial services and utilities: the figure of &pound;1,000 a year is common. The Financial Services Authority has said that the lack of access to those services pushes family costs up by as much as &pound;700 a year&mdash;money that could be better used for other things.</p>
	<p pid="b.575.2/3">What has the Government's response been? Instead of looking at how we can build up the Post Office, so that it can offer people extra services, the Government are taking steps that risk emasculating the one institution that has national reach, and that could help to bridge the banking gap left behind as the branch networks of the big banks have retreated in the past 10 years. When the Secretary of State talks about renewing the Post Office card account, what is in doubt is whether, in the end, it will be a &quot;Post Office&quot; card account. If the post office network disappears or goes into another period of great retrenchment, we will condemn entire communities to a life in the financial wilderness, when a degree of planning and thinking could have turned&mdash;could still turn&mdash;our post office network into a real force for good in many areas, growing, becoming more diverse and offering a route into banking for those who are deprived of it. That is why we have proposed an extension of the functionality of the Post Office card account&mdash;initially to help people to access a better deal on their utility bills&mdash;and it is why we think that there is enormous potential in expanding the account into other areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.575.2/4">The concept of cheaper utility bills is simple. Ministers have talked a lot in the past few weeks about the fact that some of our poorest people cannot access the cheapest tariffs from electricity and gas providers. If people were able to use their Post Office card accounts to make direct debit payments for their utility bills, they would be able to access those much cheaper tariffs. It is a simple idea at a time of high energy bills, and I wish that Ministers would seize on it and turn it into a reality. The Post Office card account and the post office network could do so much more to help breach the barriers to financial services in so many of our deprived communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.575.2/5">The Government have, step by step, brought us to what I think Members from all parts believe to be a sorry position. We know the constraints on the Secretary of State, and he cannot tell us exactly what is happening. It has been a theme of the process: we were not allowed to know what was in the tender documents, and we are not allowed to know who is bidding. There is no reason, however, why we cannot know, from a Government who 18 months ago said that they would bring a new sense of openness to governing, at least some basics about what is going on.</p>
	<p pid="b.575.2/6">I hope that the Secretary of State will take away a strong message from the House in this debate. Local post offices remain of enormous importance and enormous concern, and the future of the post office network depends significantly on the decisions that he and his colleagues will take in the next few weeks. We have heard from the Secretary of State about all the things that the Government claim to have done for our post office network, but that is not the message that I and others in the House get from people who work in the network. They all say that, step by step, the Government have removed the services that have kept their businesses going, and that, as a result, many post offices have disappeared.</p>
	<p pid="b.575.2/7">The future of the Post Office card account will determine the future size of the post office network&mdash;whether or not there is another wave of closures. I do not think that we can afford to see more post offices disappear, so my message to the Secretary of State is that it is time that the Government did what was actually right.</p>

	<p pid="b.576.2/1">It is always a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" name="Chris Grayling">the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase> in debate. He is always charming, and he is always implausible. He tried to wring Members' hearts by saying how many people would be forced to obtain their benefits through bank accounts if Post Office card accounts failed, which I hope they will not. I should like to remind him that in his own constituency, 89 per cent. of benefit recipients obtain them through bank accounts, and that only 9 per cent. do so through Post Office card accounts, so he is being very altruistic when he calls for the saving of Post Office card accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.576.2/2">Let us be very clear about the issue: Post Office card accounts were created by this Labour Government. The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats try to portray the accounts as a grand old British tradition, like fox hunting or the Poor Law, but the account was created by the Labour Government in 2003 as the electronic equivalent of the benefits order book, which people used to collect their pensions. The Post Office card account is a hugely valued public service, and it was created by this Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.576.2/3">Nationally, 4.5 million people have Post Office card accounts, and in my constituency, 8,110 people collect their benefits through them. The accounts offer a valuable service, and I want them to continue; throughout this controversy, my whole objective has been to persuade whomever is necessary that they should continue. Of course, the account costs money. It is quite expensive compared with other services, but so are other initiatives created by the Labour Government: Jobcentre Plus offices, Sure Start and the new deal are all expensive, but who today would disband any of them on the ground that they cost a lot of money? The answer, I suppose, is the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, as they opposed their creation in the first place. However, the Labour party believes in creating public services for those who most need them, and the Post Office card account is a public service for those who most need it.</p>
	<p pid="b.576.2/4">Hon. Members for rural constituencies often talk about post offices as community centres, and I respect that. I am sure that those hon. Members are right, but their point applies in the inner city as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.577.0/1">Is my right hon. Friend aware that some rural post offices carry out as few as 14 transactions a week? That means that each transaction is subsidised to the tune of &pound;18.</p>

	<p pid="b.577.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that information, but nevertheless I respect what is said by hon. Members from both sides with rural constituencies when they point out that rural post offices are community centres. But post offices are also community centres in inner-city areas, such as my constituency of Manchester, Gorton. The Post Office card account keeps small post offices going; it represents &pound;27 billion worth of transactions every year. That is important. The account provides custom for other post office facilities; people go in to collect their benefit and decide to make another transaction. The account also provides custom for local convenience shops. Pensioners and others on benefit in my constituency go to the post office for their benefit and spend some of it in the local shops for their household or personal needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.577.1/2">As I have made clear to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, my constituents believe that it is essential that the Post Office card account should continue. Of course, we recognise that the Government have to conform to the European Union procurement rules; whatever else <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1480" name="Jennifer Willott">the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott)</phrase> said, she, a representative of the Eurofanatic party, did not tell the Government to ignore EU procurement rules. The Government are not a totally free agent, so I understand why my right hon. Friend has not been able to announce a decision. However, the Liberal Democrats did not mention the European Union rules because they are totally opportunistic. They probably did not know that there were Post Office card accounts until the National Federation of SubPostmasters started organising postcards that alerted them to the fact that here was a little opportunistic horse on which they could ride. That is what the Liberal Democrats look for, the whole time&mdash;&quot;What is the opportunity? What is the grievance? Let's get on board. It doesn't matter what we thought before or what we say next time. At the moment, this could be a vote winner.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.577.1/3">No doubt <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> will be circulating &quot;Focus&quot; leaflets in his part of Manchester, so I am interested that he has not even bothered to turn up for this debate. We shall make that clear in Manchester when crocodile tears are wept about the Post Office card account. The Liberal Democrat MP who got his seat on a bogus scare about the closure of the cancer hospital cannot even be bothered to turn up and speak up for his constituents on the Post Office card accounts, as I&mdash;a loyal Labour Back Bencher&mdash;am doing.<i> </i><i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ]</i> There are all kinds of brands of loyalty. At the end of this debate I will vote with my Government, as I always do, because the last thing in the world that I will ever do is vote with the Liberal Democrats on an opportunistic motion that they do not even believe in themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.578.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. Twenty-nine per cent. of my constituents who collect benefits collect them through the Post Office card account.

	<p pid="b.578.2/1">It is unconscionable that the Post Office card account should go from the Post Office; in a sense, it is like a backstop. Does the right hon.

	<p pid="b.578.3/1">I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. What we have is a public resource going right back to Rowland Hill in 1840. These days, there are very few institutions that are greatly respected by ordinary people&mdash;obviously the national health service is one of them, but the Post Office is certainly another. The words &quot;Post Office&quot; and &quot;Royal Mail&quot; really mean something to people. That is one of the reasons why it is so essential that it remains a publicly owned service. I hope that the Government will look for other ways of using these centres to provide public services for our constituents&mdash;those of the right hon. Gentleman in the area that he represents and mine in the area that I represent.</p>
	<p pid="b.578.3/2">As I say, no force on earth will get me to walk through a Division Lobby with the Liberal Democrats on a motion tabled by those cynical opportunists. However, the fact that I will not vote with them does not mean that I do not expect something from my Government. What I expect from my Government, recognising that they cannot make the announcement this evening and have to abide by the European rules, is a firm decision, as soon as it is possible for them to make it, to continue with the Post Office card account. I have been in correspondence with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, who sent me an encouraging, but of course not conclusive letter. I say to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State: come up with what we want, James, and you will be an even bigger hero than you are now.</p>

	<p pid="b.579.0/1">I intend to speak primarily as Chairman of the Business and Enterprise Committee, which this morning produced a report on this very subject. We published it because we were so concerned about the extraordinary delay in reaching a decision that was originally trumpeted as coming in early 2008, then hinted at before the summer recess, and now here we are in the middle of November still with no decision. I commend the report to the House. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> for waving a copy.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/2">However, I also want to speak as a constituency Member of Parliament, because it is from our constituents that we understand the importance of this issue. An 84-year-old man from Droitwich rang my office this morning to say how worried he was about the future of the Post Office card account. He explained that he and his elderly friends find it increasingly difficult to sort out their affairs because they can no longer speak to anyone to in order do it. He said that they find all these &quot;touch machines&quot;&mdash;his words&mdash;for statements of accounts and so on very confusing, and that even parking the car and using ticket machines is worrying. He said how important the post office was to him and his friends because, as the National Federation of SubPostmasters pointed out in its submission, they get advice there on how to do these things. That personal touch is what the card account brings to elderly, disabled, worried, confused or deprived people.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/3">I shall speak as a Select Committee Chairman, but I want to make one brief partisan comment first. I thought that the Liberal Democrats' motion was extremely good, and I discovered that that was because the hon. Member for Chorley drafted it. They have copied his early-day motion word for word and comma for comma, as he said. That explains the excellence of the drafting, which I commend to the House, and I invite <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> to vote for it in view of its origins, which are honourable indeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/4">I was a little surprised and disappointed by the Government's amendment in two respects. First, touching on an issue we have already debated, it trumpets the fact that there was no subsidy before 1997. A word in the Secretary of State's ear: that is the wrong attack. Royal Mail Group is in trouble because the Conservative Government probably took too much money out of it, denying it the investment it needed, because it was making so much money. It did not need subsidy. I strongly advise the Secretary of State not to repeat the line about no subsidy before 1997. If he wants to attack my party, there is a better way of doing it. Subsidy is not a particularly good thing to trumpet anyhow because the Post Office does not want to be subsidised; it wants to be commercially viable again and it has a plan to work towards that. That is really important.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/5">On an even more partisan note, I would like to deal with this idea that the card account can be replaced with the</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/6" class="indent">&quot;potential for future ID management business for the Post Office&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/7">So we replace a much-loved card account used every week by pensioners, through which they receive money, with an ID card that they do not want, which they replace perhaps once every 10 years, and for which they have to pay for the privilege. I find bewildering and surprising the idea that ID management in some sense replaces the Post Office card account. I shall vote with pleasure for the Liberal Democrat motion, knowing its origins, and with pleasure against the Government's amendment because it is so outrageously wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/8">We are talking a lot about the future of the post office network and the potential for up to 3,000 closures. That potential certainly exists, but this debate is all about the 4 million vulnerable people who choose to use the Post Office card account. As we say in paragraph 12 of our report:</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/9" class="indent">&quot;the POCA caters for precisely the people who do not want to, or cannot, use conventional bank accounts: in the very nature of things, they are disproportionately likely to be poor or elderly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/10">They actually want the Post Office card account as a separate pot of money. Some of them have bank accounts, but they want that separate pot, too, because it helps them to manage their affairs. I sometimes think that the Department for Work and Pensions has a slightly patronising attitude of, &quot;We know better than you how you should run your financial affairs.&quot; Actually, 4 million people still choose to run them this way, in the face of massive incentives not to have a Post Office card account, and those wishes deserve to be respected. As we say in our report:</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Their needs should be paramount&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/12">as the Government reach their decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/13">I would like to highlight the question of state aid, which is a thorny question for the Government. The state aid permission for subsidising the network was given on five specific grounds, and as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1480" name="Jennifer Willott">the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott)</phrase> said, at least two of these depend directly or indirectly on the continuation of the card account:</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/14" class="indent">&quot;the processing of social benefit and tax payments&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/15">and</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/16" class="indent">&quot;universal access to basic cash and banking facilities and Government savings instruments, especially for rural customers and those on social benefits&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/17">As we say in our report:</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/18" class="indent">&quot;The Government must consider the implication of the state aid decision&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/19">If the Post Office does not get the card account, the Government could also lose the ability to subsidise it. That will be necessary until the post office network makes money once again, as I believe it can under its new and very good leadership.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/20">As I said in my intervention on the Secretary of State, the Committee had some reservations about the access criteria, but broadly speaking we endorse them in the current circumstances. What a shame they were not spelt out in the tender documentation in the original advertisement in the <i> Official Journal </i><i> of the European </i><i> Union</i>. The journal entry contained an important phrase. It said that the ATMs and personal teller outlets should be &quot;located throughout the UK&quot;. It is an important phrase that the Secretary of State needs to note carefully. I believe that it gives him the opportunity to make the right decision on the future of the card account.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/21">There are two criteria that the Government need to bear in mind relating to that remark about the distribution throughout the UK. In paragraph 13 of our report, we say:</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/22" class="indent">&quot;A tender which offered far more teller outlets than the 10,000 specified,&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/23">the advert specified 10,000&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/24" class="indent">&quot;but could do so only in urban or relatively densely populated areas would not, in our view, meet the needs of POCA users.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/25">It is important to understand that. Paragraph 15 states:</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/26" class="indent">&quot;Moreover, the new service will have to provide <i> reliable</i> access to cash for those using the card account. No tender should be accepted if it cannot demonstrate that it can meet this need, at the branch most convenient for users.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.579.0/27">That is important.</p>

	<p pid="b.581.0/1">Paragraph 14 makes the point that, under the LINK network, the nearest free ATM, apart from that in a post office, can often be many miles away. If that post office goes, it will be difficult in rural areas to get free access to cash.</p>

	<p pid="b.581.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman&mdash;my hon. Friend for these purposes&mdash;who is a valuable member of the Committee, even though he was not with us last week; I believe that he had other business in Glenrothes. However, he makes an important point, which I would like to have made, if I had time. Our report is short, but I cannot read it out in 10 minutes, even at the speed at which I normally speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/2">Only the Post Office offers guaranteed access to cash. The ATM network cannot be guaranteed, because many of those machines are located in post offices that might close if they do not get the Post Office card account business. Only the Post Office has the cash and transit operation to take the cash to the post offices so that it is there when pensioners, whose most basic financial inclusion right is having access to cash, want it on a Monday morning. There is no guarantee that any other provider could deliver the cash at the moment that it is needed. In our view, that is a crucial criterion.</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/3">The problem appears difficult for the Secretary of State to resolve, but I do not believe that it is. I am pleased that he remains in his place&mdash;it is typically courteous of him to be here, listening to the debate, rather than leaving after making his contribution, and I greatly appreciate that. There is a solution. The contract has been advertised on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender. That is important, because it is not a simple question of cost. Even if one bidder offers a cheaper option than another, the Secretary of State has the right to choose the one that will give the best overall result. As the report states:</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/4" class="indent">&quot;This allows the Government to take a wide range of criteria into consideration. It must do so, to ensure that easy and reliable access to cash and access to benefits remains possible for those who currently use the Post Office Card Account.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/5">We had an exchange about access criteria during the Secretary of State's remarks. Those criteria should underpin his judgment. Anything that falls short of them is, according to the Government's judgment, inadequate and wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/6">We conclude our report by saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/7" class="indent">&quot;There is very little time for the Secretary of State to come to a decision, but when he does so he must take the needs of POCA users, and of the community as a whole, fully into account.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/8">It would be strange, when this country is in a recession and many thousands of small businesses face a difficult and challenging time, for the Government, who claim that they support small businesses&mdash;they did so in the amendment to the previous motion&mdash;to make a decision that directly threatened the future of at least 3,000 businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/9">I do not understand the reason, but the Department for Work and Pensions and its predecessor have never liked the post office network. Those of us who were Members of Parliament between 1992 and 1997 remember that the Conservative Government played with the same idea and speculated about ending payments through post offices. There was a huge outcry from those of us who then sat on the Government Benches and the Government quickly retreated, realising the error of their ways. Clearly, civil servants in the then Department of Social Security kept the idea in the back of a drawer, brought it out and offered it to a new set of Ministers, who willingly and unthinkingly embraced it. They were wrong to do so. The civil servants in the Department have something against the network. It is the job of Ministers to say &quot;No. There is something immensely important and valuable here that we mustn't allow the country to lose.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/10">I therefore say to the Secretary of State: fight the prejudice and enable the Post Office, which has fine new leadership, strong commercial ambitions and a genuine prospect of making a go of it again in the harsh new environment in which we live, to succeed. Please help the Post Office do that&mdash;do not get the decision wrong.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.582.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="582"  time="020:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0018.htm#08111032000149">
	<p pid="b.582.0/1">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. The motion that the Liberal Democrats tabled is a carbon copy of the early-day motion that I tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-09">9 July</phrase>. I am only sorry that naked opportunists did not have the decency to tell me that they intended to copy my early-day motion. That is the least that should have happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.0/2">Two overriding concerns motivated me to table the early-day motion on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-09">9 July</phrase>: first, the future viability of the post office network and, secondly, the future of the Post Office card account. Those two issues were at the forefront of my mind. I must tell my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that there is no way that the majority of hon. Members support any body other than the Post Office delivering POCA 2. I cannot speak strongly enough in favour of POCA 2 coming through the post offices. Indeed, the decision is such a no-brainer that we should not even consider anybody else distributing POCA 2. There is no way we will accept anything other than the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.0/3">I say that to make it clear where we stand now and where we will still stand when the issue comes back to us. I know that my right hon. Friend will get that message and that he has taken it on board. We have all sent letters to the Prime Minister to ensure that our voices are heard as Back Benchers and, more importantly, that our constituents, whom we represent and who are the users of the Post Office, have their voices heard loud and clear. That is the point that I want to make this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.0/4">This debate is about our concern and using our best efforts. We have to ensure that pensioners and people on benefits have that choice. We have had that reassurance this evening, and I was pleased to hear that from the Secretary of State who is listening. He is willing to ensure that people know that POCA is available and can use it. I am pleased to hear that, because it is very important that we do not strangle the system or turn off the oxygen to POCA.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.0/5">POCA is important because the Post Office is so dependent on that business. Whether the figure is 2,000, 4,000 or whatever, as many as 80 per cent. of post office counters throughout the UK could close without POCA 2. That is what we are talking about. It is why 2010 is so important, and why I am pleased that my right hon. Friend has said that he will advertise POCA.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.0/6">It was key to get something from the Secretary of State this evening&mdash;he said that he would look to set up a taskforce, and that is important. A taskforce is needed to find the extra work for the Post Office&mdash;real work and real alternatives, because however strongly I or the rest of us in the House might feel about POCA, it is short term. POCA is not the future of the Post Office. That is where we are failing.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.0/7">We are talking about a short stay of execution&mdash;death by a thousand cuts eventually in the post office network. The problem is that as more people retire, the older generation that uses POCA is dying off and the new people coming into the system use their bank accounts. They do not go near a post office. We have to find an alternative, so that people will go back into the post offices. We have to find the work and bring it back into the post offices.</p>

	<p pid="b.583.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, as he gives me the opportunity to pay tribute to his excellent work on the Committee on which we both serve and which I chair. Does he accept that Post Office Ltd has a plan to do precisely what he describes, but that POCA needs another five years to enable it to work? If Post Office Ltd gets those five years, it can do exactly what he says and move on. That is what we need to work towards.</p>

	<p pid="b.583.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is the Chair of our Committee, so how could I disagree with him? That is what I am saying: it is important that we introduce POCA 2 now, so that we have another two, three, four or however many years after 2010. However, we cannot rely on that to save the Post Office. That is why we have to come up with alternatives and go through other Departments to see what other work we can bring into the Post Office. That work must be sustainable and long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.583.1/2">I believe in the network. I believe in Royal Mail and the Post Office. I also believe in it being publicly owned, unlike the Opposition, who on the one hand say, &quot;We want to privatise the Post Office,&quot; and on the other say, &quot;We want to save the post offices.&quot; Surely they cannot indefinitely put so much taxpayers' money into a private company. There is something wrong with their argument this evening. What we need to do is look for that real alternative.</p>
	<p pid="b.583.1/3">I believe that there is such an alternative. We have invested and saved Northern Rock. We know that a true community bank operating throughout the country is lacking. That is a system that we could use, by introducing a community bank that would offer all the services to the people who cannot access them unless they go through the internet or are willing to travel to the nearest town. We will replace the banks that have been lost throughout the towns and villages in this country. We now have a great opportunity to do just that. We can sit down, look to the future and find the right formula for introducing a community bank, because that is what is lacking. It is also lacking for businesses. Why should the few remaining milkmen, for example, have to bank their money in the town, when they should be able to bank at the post office? There are many small businesses that could use a Post Office bank, and this proposal is about putting such a bank in place and giving people a real assurance of the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.583.1/4">I also want to tell the BBC, which is quick to tell us that it wants more money for the TV licence, that I want to get my TV licence from the post office. What right does the BBC have to take that ability away from us? That was an absolute disgrace, and a complete shambles. It is willing to take taxpayers' money, yet it is not willing to support taxpayers' business through the Post Office. Those are wrongs that we can put right. They are the things that can really begin to save the post offices. Yes, we can do so much.</p>
	<p pid="b.583.1/5">Will I be supporting the Liberal Democrats tonight? Will I heck as like! This is the cheek with which they operate. They really have not given us an alternative, and they will never do so, because they are not going to be in government. What they have not told us tonight is that their motion is a copy of my early-day motion, which aimed to ensure that the Government were getting the message. That message was: rethink, look again and deliver. Supporting the Liberal Democrats tonight will not save anything; far from it. I have achieved more by saying this tonight from these Benches than they have done. We have already reached agreement on a taskforce and on the advertisement of POCA. We have made great strides tonight, and that is because we are willing to fight for the future of the Post Office. If people are serious about voting to save the Post Office, they should not follow the Liberals into the Lobby tonight. If they are serious, they should back the Government, who are willing to listen.</p>
	<p pid="b.583.1/6">I give the House the assurance that I will continue to fight for the Post Office and for the future of Royal Mail, because I believe in them. I believe in the work that we have done on the Business and Enterprise Committee, and I believe that what we did under the Department of Trade and Industry was right. We have got it right, and what we need now is for the Government to listen. I believe that they can do that, and I am with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> when he says that there is only one alternative: it is the Post Office and it is Royal Mail. I say to the Government: please listen, and please deliver. Let us back the Government tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.585.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow the impassioned plea made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase>. I enjoyed his speech, as I often do, although I cannot understand his logic, which reflects the Government's lack of joined-up thinking and their contradictions over this whole issue. It illustrates their inconsistency, accompanied by a real lack of leadership and will. We have seen service after service withdrawn from the post office network over the past few years, and the services that remain&mdash;on which the post offices rely absolutely&mdash;are not advertised. The hon. Gentleman made that point in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.585.0/2">The Government underestimate the public's anger and sheer exasperation at the way in which they have handled the post office network in recent years. They also underestimate the exasperation of the people who are running our post offices&mdash;the sub-postmasters. My constituency has suffered over the past few years, as has every other area in the country. In 2004, we lost four post offices, and in 2008 we lost another three. None was reprieved, although we have a rather surreal situation at Bramhope in that the Post Office now says it will sit down with the local parish councillors to talk about whether a local consortium might be able to open a post office, even though it has let the closures go ahead. That is another case of an extraordinary lack of consistency and joined-up thinking.</p>

	<p pid="b.585.1/1">The hon. Gentleman and I support the great game of rugby league, and we also support and believe in the Post Office. Does he not agree that he should not be proposing to privatise the Post Office, because that is not the future? This illustrates his inconsistency. He wants to support Post Office Counters but, at the same time, he wants to privatise Royal Mail. Does he not agree that that will not work?</p>

	<p pid="b.585.2/1">The hon. Gentleman and I agree on many things, and I am sure that we both felt real hurt over England's woeful performances in the rugby league world cup. I am sure that we both agree that England will improve hugely in the semi-final at the weekend. However, he does not actually know what Liberal Democrat policy is on this issue&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>Let me make it very clear, so that he and others can understand it: our policy is simply to inject a large amount of private capital into Royal Mail and properly support it, and to leave the post offices and let the network continue. <i> [Interruption.] </i>It is what is called the proposal for enabling the network to continue. Nothing has been proposed by the Conservatives, and the Government have eroded the network over recent years. I will take no lectures from Labour Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/2">Never mind the voices of politicians chuntering from sedentary positions; let me allow the voice of those who run our post offices to be heard properly in the debate. I was approached by Sandra Jarvis, sub-postmaster of Ireland Wood post office in my constituency. She said that the Post Office card account was very important to her business, adding:</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Withdrawal of the Card Account from the Post Office network, will mean that thousands of people nationwide will have to draw their monies from where? High Street Banks (that's if they qualify to open bank accounts)? Paypoint outlets, supermarkets?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/4">She went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/5" class="indent">&quot;The Government have chiselled away at products serviced at the Post Office over the years, with the loss of many transactions: TV Licences, DVLA Motor Vehicle Licensing... and savings stamps, to name a few.</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/6" class="indent">Cessation of the Card Account at the Post Office will have the knock on effect of us losing utility payments also... Gas, Electric, Water, Rent and Poll Tax payments. Many Pensioners /Unemployed pay their weekly bills upon receipt of their monies from us, which equates to several thousand pounds per week.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/7">That will hit them, she says, and</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/8" class="indent">&quot;will hit my business badly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/9">She asked:</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Where do the customers go if the Card Account is taken from us? How do they get there?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.585.2/11">Those are questions that the Government simply have not addressed.</p>

	<p pid="b.586.0/1">Is not the question &quot;Where will people go?&quot; particularly relevant to the most rural and isolated communities in the country? As for access to supermarkets and other shops, for many of those communities the last shop has gone as a result of the recent closure programme. People cannot gain access to benefits through shops because they have all gone, and there is no public transport. What is my hon. Friend's solution?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.586.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" speakername="Greg Mulholland" colnum="586"  time="021:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0018.htm#08111032000156">
	<p pid="b.586.1/1">I entirely agree, and I pay tribute to what my hon. Friend has done in regard to rural issues in his community. Let me give another example of the lack of joined-up thinking. I think we would all agree that the Sustainable Communities Bill was an excellent idea, but the Government's action is eroding precisely what it aims to do. Sandra Jarvis also asked:</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Is this the objective of the Government, in order to save on the subsidy it pays out to the Post Office?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/3">I shall restrict my comments in order to allow others to speak, but let me say a little about the most vulnerable members of society. I refer to older people, disabled people, and people who find it hard to access services: people with learning difficulties and people with mental health issues. Those people were marginalised in the so-called network change programme. The Post Office spin doctors came up with that extraordinary phrase to describe what was, in fact, a closure programme. How very new Labour! Now the same people have been marginalised by the confused process involving the Post Office card account. The issues relating to access have been glossed over again.</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/4">Has there been any assessment by the Department of the impact that its action will have on the lives of people who need to obtain the many benefits and services that they may need? There has not, and that is, quite simply, a scandal. Figures from Age Concern reveal that 76 per cent. of older people fear that they will lose essential services if there are more closures, 73 per cent. fear that they will not be able to access similar services in the local area, and 88 per cent. would have to make special travel arrangements to reach alternative services.</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/5">A pensioner in my constituency to whom I spoke on Friday, Mr. Wilf McCombe of Bramhope, simply does not understand why the Government will not allow the Post Office to continue its card account. He said that one of the wonderful things about the account&mdash;let us concentrate on the positives&mdash;was that pensioners could go anywhere in the country to pick up their pensions from the post office. That is very useful when he is away on holiday or visiting relatives. He also not only made the point that people feel that through POCA they can access services in post offices they know and trust, but asked where the machines will be sited if the contract goes elsewhere. They will be sited in places that older and vulnerable people do not necessarily know or feel comfortable accessing, and they will probably simply not want to do so. Awarding POCA outside the Post Office will therefore be a blow from a business point of view&mdash;apart from the clear absurdity of doing that when it is supposed to be called the Post Office card account, as several Members have pointed out.</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/6">We know there is a particular problem for older people and the most vulnerable. We have heard about the issues for rural areas and deprived urban areas, but there are pockets of people everywhere who will find that the problems of access mean that they might not leave their homes. As Sandra Jarvis said:</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The Card Account holders at my office are Pensioners and the Unemployed, and for many of them it is the Social centre to come to the Post Office (and in the case of Pensioners perhaps the only time in the week that they get to leave their homes and speak to someone)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/8">That is not being taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="b.587.0/1">My hon. Friend has talked about rural areas and about deprived areas. I represent a convergence zone area that receives funding from Europe, because Ceredigion is both rural and deprived. Does my hon.

	<p pid="b.587.1/1">That is true but, equally, what about areas such as Otley, north of the river? It is not necessarily a deprived area, yet the wonderful work done by Otley Action for Older People will be undermined by the recent closure of Newall post office. People in that area will simply not be able to access the services they need. The simple fact is that if the Post Office loses this tender, that will leave huge numbers of older people both financially and socially excluded.</p>
	<p pid="b.587.1/2">The Government have not faced up to the reality that if they do not follow through and ensure that the post office network is the recipient of POCA, that will sound the last post for a genuinely national post office network, as 3,000 more post offices have been predicted to go, which would leave about 8,500. That is simply not a sustainable amount, so the post office network will not be able to continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.587.1/3">I shall conclude by specifically addressing my friend, the hon. Member for Chorley, by saying that although he does not feel he should vote with our party this evening, the reality is that this is the last opportunity this House has to send a clear message about POCA. Labour Members are all too happy to march in local protests against post office closures, but they have the chance this evening to put their money where their mouth is and to march into the Lobby with Members from across the Opposition Benches to send the clearest possible message we can from this Chamber that POCA must be retained with the Post Office, as the consequences of not doing so are grave.</p>

	<p pid="b.588.0/1">As chair of the all-party group on post offices, I want to say that there has been considerable all-party support on this issue over a period of time, and it is sad that, although there is a huge amount of agreement on it in all parts of House, we all have to start playing a bit of party politics when it comes to the vote&mdash;although I suppose that that is what this place is like.</p>
	<p pid="b.588.0/2">I say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so he should not be too upset that the wording is precisely what we all signed up to. I also want to say that the report by the Business and Enterprise Committee that came out this morning and the previous reports produced under the chairmanship of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> have been very good indeed, not just on this issue, but on all the issues. Of course, my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley is also a member of that Committee, so I am praising him, too, there. The National Federation of SubPostmasters is very concerned about this issue, and tomorrow afternoon it will be contributing at an emergency meeting of the all-party group, so Members might want to come along to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.588.0/3">No one listening to this debate will understand how we as a Government and a country can have spent the period from March, when the tender process closed, until now with all this uncertainty and lack of transparency regarding the contract tender. That seems amazing in this day and age. I know that there are rules governing the various aspects of tendering, but there must have been a lot more that we collectively could have been told. I still do not understand why we needed to tender the contract, and I will not accept that we needed to.</p>

	<p pid="b.588.1/1">Does my hon. Friend share my puzzlement at the fact that in 2003, when we introduced POCA, as far as I am aware&mdash;I may be wrong and I stand to be corrected&mdash;we did not tender it then?</p>

	<p pid="b.588.2/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, but I expect that somebody somewhere will say that some new European regulation&mdash;I am sure that we in this Chamber did not vote for it&mdash;came through at some stage saying that we must do this. The Secretary of State mentioned the Republic of Ireland. Yes, its Government were taken to court, but the decision was unproven, so they got away with it, if we want to put it like that; I would say that they stuck up for their citizens, which is what our Government should be doing. It is time that we stood up to some of the ludicrous rulings and directives that come from the European Union. Instead of making people feel that the Union is helping them, such measures make them feel that all the Union cares about is a bureaucracy at Brussels that is telling people in this country how to run their lives. However, I do not want to get diverted into that.</p>

	<p pid="b.589.0/1">My hon. Friend is of course aware that the Government recently set aside the competition regulations in relation to HBOS and Lloyds TSB. Given the importance of the post office network to the whole country, does she agree that this is a matter of overwhelming social significance and an overriding public policy reason why the competition regulations should be set aside, and that we should not have entered into this tendering process?</p>

	<p pid="b.589.1/1">I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend, and I still have not had a proper answer to that question; perhaps the Minister will return to it in summing up.</p>
	<p pid="b.589.1/2">I may be wrong, but I suspect that discussions are going on between Departments about this issue. Clearly, there has not been a unified view. We will obviously get a unified view at the end of the process, but it should come very quickly indeed, and I hope that it will be in line with what the vast majority of Members have said tonight that they want to see happen. As everyone has said, winning the POCA contract will not be a solution to the many future challenges that the post office network will face. However, it is absolutely crucial because it will provide the extra breathing space that will allow all the extra work that needs to be done to bring in extra services, including the various new services. Some are ready, but a lot more work needs to be done on others.</p>
	<p pid="b.589.1/3">We will therefore need time, and if the POCA 2 contract does not go to the Post Office, we all know that that will be the end of at least 3,000 post offices, not just in rural areas but in areas such as mine. I and my local community worked very hard to save a sub-post office in Lambeth walk from closure under the recent changes. It was such a vital thing to save that everybody put in a huge amount of work to make sure that that happened. There is absolutely no doubt: if that post office does not have the card account, it will close. I cannot understand how any common-sense Government or politician could not want to do everything that they could to keep the contract with the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.589.1/4">I remind those who go on about bank accounts that although some of our older people perhaps now have bank accounts, they still want their Post Office card account. Many pensioners in my constituency would not dream of having a bank account. The POCA and the cash that they get out is very much part of their budgeting process&mdash;they know that they are getting the money at a particular time on a particular day, they know how they are going to spend it and they know that they will get it again the following week. No bank account will give them that feeling that they have their albeit limited cash; they want to have access to that cash on their terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.589.1/5">I know that many hon. Members from all parts of the House want to speak, so I shall merely add that the Government should not go around saying that the only way in which we will save the post offices&mdash;this is almost being used as a blackmail&mdash;is through identity cards. I am determined to do everything I can to prevent ID cards from being introduced in this country. Even if they were the only way to save the Post Office, I would not support them. It is a pity that reference is made to them in the Government amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.589.1/6">The Government should not have tendered in the first place, but when they did so, they should have ensured that all the parts associated with the tendering showed that this was a public service, that it had a social benefit and that it did all the things that my hon. Friends have mentioned tonight. Let us hope that tonight's debate will be the last time that we have to debate this and that the Government see the sense of what we are saying&mdash;I do not care how they do it. The country&mdash;not just politicians&mdash;will not forgive any Government who allow this service of value to the Post Office to be taken away from it. We have to keep the POCA with the Post Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.590.0/1">Perhaps I should declare an interest, because my sister runs a sub-post office in the village of Eglwysbach, where she also has a small shop.</p>
	<p pid="b.590.0/2">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase>, who has done a lot of hard work on the Select Committee on Business and Enterprise. I fully endorse everything that the Committee said in the report that it published today and also what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> had to say. It just goes to show that there is all-party support on this matter. I speak for Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party, and for members of the Labour, Conservative and Liberal parties&mdash;we are all agreed on this matter. There is a huge amount of feeling on it, and for good reason: the Post Office is a brand that we have all trusted and that we all know to be honest and forthright, and we need to maintain it at all costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.590.0/3">As has been said, hon. Members have bank accounts and can make choices, but others cannot do so. For example, there are 4,480 Post Office card accounts in my constituency, 8,000 in Clwyd, South&mdash;in north Wales&mdash;7,500 in Caernarfon and 8,140 in Ynys M&ocirc;n. Those are big figures for small rural constituencies. It has been pointed out that losing the POCA would be a disaster for rural areas. My home village of Llanuwchllyn near Bala&mdash;the name will be a challenge for some&mdash;has one shop, which is a sub-post office. It will be lost and we will lose the only outlet in our village. There is a social side to this. Some of us have cars, but others do not and they will have to rely on relatively expensive public transport to travel five miles to the nearest town just to get the basics of life. That is unfair and we can reverse that situation. The Post Office needs some breathing space to enable it to do this work&mdash;we need this card account to remain where it is. I, for one, cannot understand what possible benefit will ensue if it is sent to a private concern.</p>

	<p pid="b.590.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, in a sense, we are trying to save the Government from themselves? The access criteria will guarantee only 7,500 post offices, but on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-24">24 January 2007</phrase>, when the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, now the Chancellor of the Exchequer, came before our Committee, he said that</p>

	<p pid="b.590.2/1">That is absolutely right. The Chairman of the Select Committee knows everything about this subject&mdash;perhaps not everything, but he knows a lot about it, and more than I do.</p>
	<p pid="b.590.2/2">The other point that was made earlier related to the effect on other local businesses, and we need to consider that telling fact. We have bandied a lot of figures around this evening, but it is crucial that we maintain and develop this network for the future. We have seen double standards on this issue&mdash;Cabinet Ministers are voting for the closure programme but are then protesting vocally in their own constituencies. I will not call that anything stronger than double standards&mdash;there are other words, but I would probably be ruled out of order if I used them. If POCA 2 is not awarded to the Post Office, I believe that the situation will get quite near to being hypocritical. I hope that we will not see that act of betrayal towards those hard-working men and women who run the sub-post offices&mdash;often for long hours and little return. Yes, they are economic enterprises, but they also offer an important social service.</p>
	<p pid="b.590.2/3">I asked the Secretary of State earlier about the access criteria and the tendering process. The point that I made about the Welsh Language Act 1993 was simply that the Act would cover the public delivery of a public service. If a private concern were to deliver the service, it would not be covered. The tens of thousands of people in Wales who would wish to access services in the medium of Welsh, as they do currently, will undoubtedly be denied. There will be no legitimate expectation that the organisation running POCA 2 should deliver that service. That is extremely important. If the Welsh language is undermined, there will be huge repercussions, not just in this place but in the National Assembly and elsewhere. Acts of Parliament in this place have been made to secure the future of the Welsh Language Act. This move will undermine it, and it is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.590.2/4">There has been a huge amount of agreement on both sides of the Chamber this evening. I hope that Ministers will listen, as we have all put aside our political badges. We are all concerned about the future of our network. In those circumstances, I hope that we can have a positive announcement shortly to put many people out of what appears to be their misery as they worry about the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.591.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" speakername="Andrew Stunell" colnum="591"  time="021:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0019.htm#08111032000167">
	<p pid="b.591.0/1">There is a glint of light in this debate, through the smoke and mirrors, from those on the Government Front Bench. They seem to have moved from hostility to uncertainty, and surely that is good as far as the card account is concerned. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>, with his customary disingenuousness, suggested that the card account had been introduced by Labour along the lines of the national health service&mdash;as a miracle cure. May I remind the House that Labour brought the account forward with the greatest reluctance, because it was compelled to do so by the pressure in this House and in the country?</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/2">As soon as the account was introduced, a series of bullying and inaccurate letters were sent to anyone who dared to apply for one, telling them to do something else. Of course, if that did not work, that letter would be followed up with a telephone call. I know that, because I have the letters and because my wife received the telephone calls. However, there was still massive take-up. Some 4 million took out the card accounts. Even this year&mdash;it might have been a clerical error, but it was an extraordinarily consistent clerical error&mdash;another letter went out, once again telling people that the card account was going to stop and that they should make alternative arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/3">Despite all that, in the borough of Stockport, 18,000 people are on the card account&mdash;5,000 in my constituency. I want to tell the Minister and the Secretary of State that the nine post offices that they have left me with get, between them, about &pound;30,000 a year of income from their handling of those accounts. That is equivalent to 50 per cent. of their business rate. If the Secretary of State takes that away from them, he will be putting a 50 per cent. hike on their business rate. They will go down. Whatever might be said about a move from hostility to uncertainty, that uncertainty is itself no help.</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/4">The Secretary of State quoted from a letter that he had received from Mr. Thomson of the National Federation of SubPostmasters. However, he did not quote some of the other parts of that letter, including the phrase</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/5" class="indent">&quot;uncertainty over the POCA is destroying subpostmasters' confidence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/6">The Government face a doubled-edged problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/7">Since the card was introduced in 2003, my constituents who have card accounts have resisted every threat and blandishment to switch to private sector retail banking. During most of that time, banks were the UK's totemic success story, yet still my constituents did not want to switch. Some could not switch because they did not have the necessary credit rating. Many are unable to switch, because of mobility or disability problems, and for some of the other reasons that have been given already. Now that banks have never been more distrusted or reviled or more in disgrace, along come the Government, telling my constituents, &quot;Leave the safe haven of a simple public sector system based on your local post office and put your trust in a nice big bright shiny bank where you can make a small contribution to a fat cat's big bonus&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/8">The other edge of the problem is the banks themselves. I shall briefly mention two cases. The first concerns a constituent who has recently had a stroke and can no longer write his signature with his right hand. He wants to cancel his account but the bank will not accept the cancellation because his signature is wrong. What sort of bank will not cancel a card because a signature is wrong? My constituent was told that he could get power of attorney. Brilliant. It is not his mind that has gone, but his handwriting.</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/9">The second story is about an elderly lady who moved to live with her family and tried to switch money from her savings account to her current account in the bank she has used for 45 years. She was refused because she has a new address, is not on the electoral roll and has no utility bills, so the bank thought she might be a money launderer.</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/10">I have to tell Ministers and the Secretary of State that it is not just that my constituents do not want the retail banking sector&mdash;the retail banking sector does not want them. It is ironic that while UK banks went broke lending billions, perhaps trillions, of pounds to sub-prime citizens of the United States of America, a United States bank&mdash;Citibank&mdash;will be moving in to pick up the sub-prime accounts of my constituents via POCA 2.</p>
	<p pid="b.591.0/11">In 1999, a revolt in the House forced the Government to set up POCA. In 2006, when the Government said the account would be cancelled, a second revolt forced them to continue it. We need a third revolt to make POCA permanent. The quality of life and convenience of POCA users must be maintained. The quality of our communities must be maintained. Retaining POCA is the way to do it.</p>

	<p pid="b.593.0/1">I am grateful for this short opportunity to speak in an important debate on an issue that is so long-running that a positive outcome for the postal service and postal workers seems more distant by the day. The sooner we have a conclusion to this fiasco, the better.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.0/2">The context and backdrop for the debate is the Government's long overdue decision on the Post Office card account. In 1999, there were 25 post offices in Crewe and Nantwich; we now have 11. A large swathe of the south of Crewe has no post office at all. The town of Nantwich, with a population of 12,000, now has only one post office. We need to remember that backdrop when we look at the future of the Post Office card account.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.0/3">Why have the Government decided that the postal system is so unfit for purpose that they are considering trying to clip its wings even more? They claim support for the Post Office card account in their amendment, yet all the while they are encouraging customers to bank elsewhere. They seem either unwilling or unable to tell us who will run the second phase of the Post Office card account. I suspect that when they had the opportunity to make that decision in May they decided to put it off for other reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.0/4">The card account is only the tip of the iceberg; other services are being stealthily withdrawn from the sub-postmaster's realm. We have heard about tax discs, and that renewal reminders do not even point out that the service is available at the post office.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.0/5">In my discussions with members of the Communication Workers Union in Crewe, I have been told that confusion still remains about the Government's policy on the Royal Mail, so this evening provides an opportunity for the Minister to clarify exactly what the Government see as the future role of the Post Office and whether the Post Office card account will be there to safeguard the future of those people. On behalf of my constituents, I therefore urge the Government to take a step back, to halt the post office closure scheme and the sorting office closure schemes, of which Crewe is a victim, and to sit down with the CWU to discuss a manageable and national strategy for the Royal Mail, rather than trying to dismantle it piecemeal. We need to review what services community hubs could offer people, rather than just taking them away, and to renew the Post Office card account to ensure that the Post Office has a safeguarded future. At the moment in Crewe and Nantwich, it really does seem that the Government are only there to take things away.</p>

	<p pid="b.593.1/1">This has been a good and timely debate, and I hope it has served to make clear to the Government the strength of feeling on both sides of the House and how much all hon. Members value their post offices and the part that the Post Office card account plays in maintaining their post offices and their footfall. Indeed, even the Secretary of State made that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1480" name="Jennifer Willott">the Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott)</phrase> made an eloquent case in opening the debate. She was generous in taking interventions, which allowed many hon. Members who were not able to take part in the debate to make a point. She went straight to the heart of the matter: whether the Government should be allowed to kill the Post Office by slow stages or whether the Post Office should be helped to transform into a 21st century service&mdash;a point that the Secretary of State failed to address. Indeed, the highlight of his contribution appeared to be to tell us that a purely commercial post office network would consist of only 4,000 post offices. I wonder whether that is actually the DWP's target. However, I welcome the fact that he has promised us a statement, and I hope that it will be the statement that we would all like to hear. I also hope that he will take away from the debate the strength of feeling in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">The hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> made the point in a customarily passionate and excellent intervention that we all want the card account. There is no hon. Member on either side of the House who does not want the card account and who does not want it to go to the Post Office. He made the valid, absolutely telling point that that is not because we particularly like the card account, but because our constituents tell us it is what they want and need. He and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> have produced an excellent report&mdash;succinct and to the point, with very good, albeit not bold, points&mdash;that goes to the heart of the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.1/4">I was glad that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire referred in his report to the work done by the Treasury Committee. Indeed, he quoted extensively from it. When I was serving on the Treasury Committee, we went into this in considerable depth. One of the interesting points was a question that I asked of an official on the comparison of cost between the Post Office card account and other services, and the answer was that it is an apples and pears comparison: the two costs are quite different. We should take that point on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>, whom I like to think of as a friend if not a right hon. Friend, was his usual self. He made two charges of me. First, he accused me of sending him reams of Focuses, to which I plead not guilty. I think that he knows me well enough to know that that is not my style. Secondly, he accused me of being an opportunist, and I plead guilty. I take every opportunity I can to support my constituents. I took the opportunity before POCA was announced to ask the Government to change their mind about the evisceration of post offices. I took the opportunity to support POCA when the Government did not want to introduce it, and I take the opportunity now to ask the Government to give us POCA 2.</p>

	<p pid="b.595.0/1">I shall remain as free with my remarks as the right hon. Gentleman is with his.</p>
	<p pid="b.595.0/2">We heard two excellent Liberal Democrat Back-Bench contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) and for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell). They made it clear why hon. Members on both sides of the House feel so passionately that Post Office card accounts should be allowed to continue for a second generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.595.0/3">We want post offices not simply because we want post offices, but because they are economically valuable and provide a social good. As many Members have said, in rural parts of the world, post offices are the only place where many services are available. I will not bore the House with a recitation of the small villages in north-west Sutherland or the middle of Caithness that would have no opportunities if POCA 2 were not given to the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.595.0/4">There is an opportunity here for the Post Office. In all my discussions with representatives of the post offices&mdash;the sub-postmasters&mdash;they say that they want post offices to transform. They want to provide a 21st century post office that can be profitable. However, they need the breathing space to get from here to there. That is what is absolutely critical about the award of POCA 2. Indeed, sub-postmasters have very good plans to make the post office a post bank&mdash;plans that I think many Members present would support.</p>
	<p pid="b.595.0/5">There is another point that we should take on board. The Department for Work and Pensions has been closing offices left, right and centre, including in my constituency. People now have to travel for three hours, in places where there is no public transport, to attend a face-to-face interview. They have grave difficulties, and I could tell many stories about that. Post offices and sub-post offices are operated by literate, numerate, intelligent people. Why not use them as the front line for the delivery of services to the citizen? Why not give allow them to help fill in forms and explain matters? For a very modest cost to the Department, there would be a massive increase in the quality of service. People would not be forced to spend many hours on the telephone to Clydebank, and would not end up with the wrong answer at the end of it all.</p>
	<p pid="b.595.0/6">At the heart of this debate are the needs and desires of some of the most vulnerable in our society, including pensioners, the unbanked&mdash;financial inclusion is an important point that has been brought up&mdash;the disabled and all those on benefit. They trust their local post office to help them. &quot;Trust&quot; is a word that has come out in many contributions this evening. The Post Office, postmasters and postmistresses are trusted. It is that human contact that is missing, but that is so important to many people. Our constituents do not want to spend hours on a telephone, only to be given the wrong answer, or put on to another department when they finally get through.</p>
	<p pid="b.595.0/7">Our constituents value and want to maintain their post offices. They do not trust banks, and they have proved to be absolutely right in that. However, they do trust the Post Office. The replacement card account contract is wanted by the customers, our constituents. It is vital to the future of the network and supported by the vast majority of Members on both sides of the House. The Government have been overseeing the systematic removal of business from the post offices, and it is time to stop. It is time to support the Post Office and allow it to adapt to the 21st century. For that, Post Office card account 2 is needed, and needed by the Post Office.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.596.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" speakername="Rosie Winterton" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions"  colnum="596"  time="021:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0020.htm#08111034000568">
	<p pid="b.596.0/1">This has been a passionate debate about an extremely important issue that affects all right hon. and hon. Members, wherever we are from and whatever party or constituency we represent.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/2">As many right hon. and hon. Members said in the debate, the post office is a treasured and essential cornerstone of local communities throughout the United Kingdom, it is trusted and understood in ways that other services are not and it is not to be treated as a purely commercial service. I assure the House that decisions about the Post Office will be taken respecting that unique situation and focusing on the importance of our post offices to the lives of the many millions of our constituents who use them every day.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/3">Many Members have spoken this evening, and I shall endeavour to respond to their contributions as time allows, but I begin by explaining why the Government disagree with the Liberal Democrats and why I urge the House to support the Government's amendment. First, the Liberal Democrats state that the Department for Work and Pensions has written to all Post Office card account holders informing them that the contract will end. That is not the case. We have not written to POCA holders saying that.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/4">Secondly, the Liberals contend that we have instructed people to switch out of their Post Office card accounts. That is not the case. On the contrary, we are opening 12,500 accounts every month. We have written to customers who are paid by cheque and encouraged them to move to payment into an account, including those that can be used at a post office, for the simple reasons that it is more secure for the customer, it reduces fraud and it is more efficient. We will provide a successor to cheques&mdash;a better and safer product that will be easier for people to operate; but, there will be no compulsion on people using cheques, and there are certainly no instructions as the Liberal Democrats have suggested. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made clear earlier, however, we have changed the leaflet referred to, listing the Post Office card account alongside other bank accounts that are available at Post Office branches.</p>

	<p pid="b.596.1/1">The Minister says that that aspect of the Liberal Democrat motion is not true, but what is it about some staff who, whatever is said on paper, seem in telephone calls and in other ways to make it clear that they do not want people to have a Post Office card account?</p>

	<p pid="b.596.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point&mdash;that it is right that our communications are clear, particularly from staff. Obviously, we need to take that into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.2/2">The hon. Members for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott) and for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) made several points setting out their case, many of which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State addressed. However, I want to take this opportunity to clarify that it was the BBC, not the Government, that decided that the contract for the licence fee should not go the Post Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.597.0/1">I welcome that comment about the BBC. We all know that the BBC was wrong and that it has got to put the situation right, but is my right hon. Friend aware that we need training to ensure that people who answer the phone get across the message that the Post Office card account is open for business and that the Post Office wants to do business? We may need some extra training to ensure that people understand the message that they give out on the phone.</p>

	<p pid="b.597.1/1">My hon. Friend is right to say that training is an important aspect of getting communication right.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" name="Chris Grayling">The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase> asked what more could be done in terms of services provided. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State assured my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> that he will set up a task group of MPs to work with the Government to identify new business opportunities for the Post Office, and continue to work with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/3">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>, in his usual thoughtful and witty way, set out his support for the Post Office card account and sent out a search party for one of Manchester's other Members. My right hon. Friend emphasised the account's public service element, reminded us that a Labour Government established the account in the first place and pointed to the cynical opportunism of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/4">In a speech that reflected the depth of his understanding of the issue, particularly following his Committee's report, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> made intriguing comments about better ways of attacking the Conservative party. Frankly, we have enough to go on at the moment, but we certainly look forward to more advice from the hon. Gentleman in that regard. At least he said that it was necessary to subsidise the Post Office; his party's Front Benchers refuse to commit to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> spoke of the work of the all-party group on sub-post offices and the role of sub-postmasters. The hon. Members for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) and for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson) spoke of their constituents' concerns about access, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> talked about the Welsh language.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley spoke powerfully about the opportunism of the Liberal Democrats. He referred to the task group that the Secretary of State has agreed to set up and thanked the Secretary of State for the assurance that we will do all we can to ensure that we advertise the Post Office card account effectively. I reiterate that assurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> said that Labour Members did not understand Liberal Democrat policy on the matter being discussed&mdash;but who on earth does? The only thing that the Liberal Democrats have managed tonight is to make off with the early-day motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley, without even asking his permission.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/8">The Post Office has been transformed since 1997 and offers far more than it ever did when the Conservatives were in power. As the Government amendment states, the Post Office is the largest provider of foreign exchange and one of the largest providers of travel insurance in the UK. It also provides car insurance, telephone services, driving licence processing and passport application services. The current Post Office card account has played a key role in helping people make the move from having their payments made by order book to using a simple electronic account. About a fifth of Department for Work and Pensions customers use the account. Every week, nearly 4 million people use the Post Office card to collect their pensions, benefits or tax credit in cash at post offices.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/9">As the Secretary of State made clear at the start of the debate, we will make an announcement about the Post Office card account at the earliest opportunity. Our objective is clear: to maintain the Post Office's role while facing up to change. That is the responsible thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/10">I come back to the fundamental point made clear by the Secretary of State. The Post Office is essential as far more than a purely commercial service; it touches the lives of millions across the UK. That is why we have subsidised the Post Office by more than &pound;2 billion since 1997 and why we have announced that we will spend another &pound;1.7 billion until 2011. We have made the investment because the Post Office plays a valuable role in our society. This Labour Government will ensure that the Post Office continues to pay its unique role in British&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.610.2/1">It is a real honour to speak in this Chamber on behalf of my constituents and my local football team, Gloucester City football club. The team has 125 years of history and tradition&mdash;roughly the same as Tottenham Hotspur. Earlier this season, much was made of Tottenham being in crisis, before Harry &quot;Houdini&quot; Redknapp turned up and sorted out their problems. I must say that if Tottenham Hotspur think they have problems, they should see what it is like non-league, at the grass roots, where clubs really do have major difficulties to overcome. Gloucester City have had major difficulties to overcome, not least those brought about by the floods of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/2">As I said, the club has 125 years of history. It came into being in March 1883, and one of Gloucestershire's most famous sons refereed the opening game&mdash;a certain W.G. Grace. He was famous for playing cricket, but he refereed that game all those years ago. We have had many ups and downs over the years. In the mid-1980s&mdash;1986, to be precise&mdash;we moved to Meadow Park, in the Gloucester docks area. In the 1980s we also hosted Wealdstone, who had quite an effective young left back by the name of Stuart Pearce. We do not know what happened to him since, but we went on to have some great seasons in the 1990s. West Ham United fans will recall a player by the name of Leroy Rosenior, who was our player-manager. In 1996-97, we had a particularly good season, with a great cup run. Come the very last game of the season, we were on the edge of promotion. We got the wrong result and unfortunately, Cheltenham Town got the right result for them. They went up.</p>

	<p pid="b.610.5/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. As he said, I have to own up to being a season ticket holder and lifelong supporter of the arch-rivals of Gloucester City, Cheltenham Town. I offer my hon. Friend my support, as a Cheltenham supporter. I remember going, long before he was even thought of, to the old Longlevens ground to watch Cheltenham play Gloucester, and then of course to Horton road and, more recently, Meadow Park. The loss of the football ground has deprived Gloucestershire of one of the key highlights of the football season: the annual Cheltenham versus Gloucester game. A new ground would give them a tremendous boost, so that they might rise up the leagues and play us on equal terms again.</p>

	<p pid="b.610.6/1">I appreciate the comments of my hon. Friend, who is probably the most famous Cheltenham Town fan in Parliament. He is right: the local rivalry is important, although in recent years the clubs have worked very well together. We have also learned something very important from the fact that Cheltenham have been successful and have got into the Football League. Ours is the largest area in the country that does not have a professional team in the Football League, which just goes to show that we have a real opportunity and real possibilities. At the minute, we have a very young and effective team that is doing well, pushing for promotion and full of local lads. We have real cause to be ambitious in terms of what we are doing on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/2">Along came that day in July 2007&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July</phrase>. Local people will be well aware of the famous picture of Meadow Park 8 ft under water. All that could be seen was the top of the crossbars. It was impossible for us to return to Meadow Park, and we have not played in Gloucester since&mdash;for the last 15 months. That was the third time that the ground had flooded in 21 years, which makes Meadow Park uninsurable, so we cannot go back there. There could be serious rainfall and flooding, and if we wanted to play there again it would cost nearly &pound;100,000 to get back in and repair the damage caused by the last set of floods.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/3">We have been beavering away in the southern premier league. Even though we are playing a long way outside Gloucester, we have the largest away support of any team in our division. That shows the devotion of our fans. Last season, we played in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, at Forest Green. We are very grateful to Forest Green for letting us play there last season, although at a price. This season, we are playing our games in Cirencester, at the home of Cirencester Town. For myself and all other Gloucester City fans, that means a 40-mile round trip to see our local team play a home game, and that is not an acceptable situation for us to be in 15 months after the floods.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/4">I pay tribute to those involved in running the club. They have kept it afloat&mdash;pardon the pun&mdash;and alive despite all the difficulties that they have had to face. In particular, I am thinking of someone whom I am proud to say has become a good friend&mdash;we spend a lot of time together of late&mdash;the chairman, Dave Phillips; Phil Warren, the club's historian and the chair of the supporters trust; Mike Dunstan, the club's press officer; and Tim Harris, the general manager. All of them have made the journey up to London to witness tonight's debate, and that shows their level of devotion. I also pay tribute to Eamonn McGurk, the club's biggest shareholder, who has had to bail it out on many occasions. Most importantly, I should mention the volunteers who muck in week in, week out to help to keep our local team ticking over.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/5">This debate is a very important occasion for us, and I know that a lot of people in Gloucester will be watching it at home, so it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to put a few requests to the Minister. The Football Foundation has been a good friend to my constituency. I play whenever I can; on Thursday nights, I have a kick-about with the reserve team at Abbeymead Rovers. The club has a wonderful new third-generation Astroturf pitch, laid in no small part thanks to the Football Foundation, which has put hundreds of thousands of pounds into that project in Abbeydale. It has also invested a similar sum in a project supporting Quedgeley Wanderers, in the south of my constituency, providing new changing facilities. The Football Foundation is a wonderful organisation that does good work, but I must make it clear that if Gloucester City is to survive as a club, given that it has little resource and has fallen on hard times through no fault of its own&mdash;the fault lies with the flooding&mdash;we will need the Football Foundation to step in, support us, probably to the tune of millions of pounds, and help us to find a stadium back in the city.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/6">Throughout the flooding, Gloucester City football club was frank in putting its concerns to one side and saying, &quot;This is about people's lives and about properties.&quot; But 15 months have passed and people's lives are moving on. We are heading into an economic downturn, but at times like this people rely on their local sporting institutions more than ever. A thriving football club with our catchment area and our young players, back in the heart of the city of Gloucester, could make an economic difference to our city. What can the Minister do to support us? The Football Foundation has been very helpful in the past, so if she can help to engage it with me, with the club and with our local authorities, that will make a difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/7">I had not planned to talk about specific options tonight, but having spoken to the club, and as the Minister is in her place, I shall briefly mention the two most likely ones for a return, because she could help us on this matter. The first option is to return to Meadow Park. The ground would require a lot of work in order for it to be insurable again. The level of the ground would probably have to be raised, the pitch might even need to be rotated through 180&deg; and new channels might have to be found to release the water. We might even need to take mitigating measures so that other floodplain is available, because we do not want properties to be flooded as a result of raising the pitch level. Thus, an involved, thorough and quick piece of work needs to be done by the Environment Agency. The club has to play this season and the following one at Cirencester Town's ground, so we need a quick solution to give the fans hope for the future that they deserve. Any help that the Minister can give me in engaging the Environment Agency in a possible return to Meadow Park is one avenue that could be taken. That approach may not be possible, because returning may be far too complicated.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/8">There is another good, strong possibility. Last week, I met the leaders of Gloucester city council. A couple of weeks ago, I met the leaders of Gloucestershire county council. This is not about politics. Across political lines, I have heard only good things from the leaders of both councils, who tell me that they are keen to work with the club and to bring it home as quickly as possible. I viewed another site last Friday, which was Blackbridge playing fields&mdash;a 20 to 30 acre site in the heart of my constituency, which is owned by Gloucestershire county council.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/9">I look forward to engaging with the council on the possibility of bringing Gloucester City home to the Blackbridge site. We would not need the whole site; a small corner of the site could offer the strong possibility of a modest stadium, a clubhouse and some car parking. It would take only a 50 yd road&mdash;at most a 100 yd road&mdash;from Stroud road, which is one of the busy roads in my constituency, to the ground in a parcel of that land. It stands alongside a strip owned by Network Rail, so I encourage my hon. Friend the Minister to work with me and with local agencies to involve Network Rail in any possible dialogue to speed along any solution for the club at the Blackbridge playing fields.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/10">I am encouraged, as I say, by the contact that I have had with Gloucestershire county council and Gloucester city council. I believe that the time could well be right now to work together to bring one of the two solutions to the fore, to find a strong business case to present and to work with the Football Foundation to bring the club home.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.6/11">Our sporting institutions play a big role in our lives. They certainly play a big role in the life of my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.613.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his recognition that we hosted Gloucester City last year. Does he agree that one problem in a county such as Gloucestershire is that we have historically had very good football, rugby and cricket, but our facilities have not moved on? The rugby club, as he knows better than I do, has had a difficult job in developing a new stadium. We need outside help, because every area is looking to renew and regenerate. It is about time we did that in Gloucestershire.</p>

	<p pid="b.613.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that, not least because he reminds me that there are far greater implications for the community, too. Gloucester City have 120 people involved in their youth teams. A further 100 are involved in coaching and working with young women, too. To have a modern site, albeit a modest one, in the heart of my constituency would make a real difference to all the local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.1/2">Just a couple of weeks ago, I was with local fans at a fundraiser for the club. One activist there&mdash;a diehard fan by the name of Nigel Hughes&mdash;came up to me. He has recently been widowed; he lost his wife just a few weeks ago. He said, &quot;Parmjit, right now at this time in my life, this football club means more to me than you could ever imagine.&quot; I know that many other people in the city of Gloucester feel the same way. They are equally passionate about our local club. For Nigel Hughes' sake, for Beverley Hughes, for all Gloucester City supporters and for the city of Gloucester, I hope that my hon. Friend can help me to work with the local authorities, the Football Foundation and the local club to bring Gloucester City back home where they belong.</p>

	<p pid="b.613.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase> on securing the debate and I commend him for the passion with which he talks about his football club. A football club is much more than just somewhere to play sport; it is about identity and family, and I am glad that members of a family have been so supportive of my hon. Friend and that he in turn has been so supportive of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.2/2">I know from my Stevenage constituency what a difference a regenerated football club has made both to the town's whole ethos and to its economy. Clubs perform a function in the economy. Gloucester City should be proud of my hon. Friend and of the work he is doing for his constituents and the communities who support the club.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.2/3">A key element in helping to deliver the Government's commitments to sport, about which I shall say more in a moment, is to ensure that communities across the country have a wide range of good provision, which in turn encourages them to participate more and to lead healthier lives. Not only does sport reduce the chances of ill health; it can also improve skills and confidence&mdash;something we badly need at present&mdash;enhance social networks and strengthen social cohesion. As my hon. Friend has demonstrated, the power of sport goes way beyond the pitch, court or track, and Gloucester City football club is a wonderful example of that power.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.2/4">Only last week in the House, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport spoke about the Government's key legacy goals for sport, which include creating a world-leading community sports system and getting 1 million more people playing sport. Our goal builds on significant investment in sport over recent years, particularly in facilities. Since 2001, more than &pound;1 billion has been committed to develop new or refurbished facilities through a mix of Exchequer and lottery funding. In total, 4,000 new or refurbished sports facilities are being supported by Government funding programmes. It is clear that the investment is paying off; in the last decade, 65 per cent. of the nation's facilities stock has been either rebuilt or refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.2/5">We have also taken steps to protect places where sport is played, specifically playing fields. After years of having our playing fields sold off, we now have tough measures to protect them. Sport England is a statutory consultee on all planning applications affecting playing fields, and planning guidance to local authorities is clear: no playing field needed by the community should be removed. All that work has brought us to a position where currently 90 per cent. of the population of England is within 20 minutes' travel time of at least two different facilities for sports that are most in demand by the public. I realise that for Gloucester City there is a 40-mile round trip, so the distance is further in that case.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.2/6">The Government have provided an unprecedented level of support for sport. However, I stress the fact that local authorities are the main providers of sports and recreation facilities and, as such, are best placed to make decisions about what facilities best meet the needs of the local community. I am glad that my hon. Friend has engaged both the county and the city councils, as I know from my constituency that in the end the solution comes from the council&mdash;working with Stevenage borough council we broke through.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-11-10b.614.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1837" speakername="Barbara Follett" colnum="614"  time="022:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081110/debtext/81110-0022.htm#0811112001182">
	<p pid="b.614.1/1">That is, of course, a matter for the Football Foundation, but I am sure that, as my hon. Friend has raised the matter tonight in the House, it will take it into account and work with Gloucester city council and the county council, as it has with many other authorities, to ensure that we have the provision in England that we need.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/2">The support that the Government give to local authorities comes mainly through Sport England, which has developed a range of strategic planning tools to assist authorities to modernise their leisure facilities and to ensure that the right facilities are provided in the right locations. That is helping local authorities to identify the gaps and to target resources where they are most needed. Sport England's facilities improvement service is also working closely with local authorities to improve their strategic planning for community sport locally. Additionally, the unprecedented Government investment through Building Schools for the Future offers a number of unique opportunities to local authorities. The Government therefore expect local authorities to consider how new developments can build on the current and anticipated sporting needs of local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/3">Investment in football is very important. Football is our national game and incredibly popular. However, the peak of the game accounts only for a very small amount of those that are involved in football. As my hon. Friend mentioned, children and young boys and girls are really getting involved at a much lower level. Football authorities recognise the wider impact of the game, especially in the lower leagues and at the grass-roots level. Sport England's active people survey shows that football is as popular an activity in Gloucester as anywhere else in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/4">Football is one of the sports that have submitted a whole sport plan to Sport England for funding from 2009. That includes how it proposes to invest money in facilities to help to develop the sport. It is right that football receives Government funding, as the sport helps to deliver our sporting aims. That is why the Football Foundation, the premier league, the FA and the Government together have invested more than &pound;300 million in football since 2000. That includes &pound;2 million in community projects in my hon. Friend's constituency of Gloucester. Those projects have ranged from a &pound;400 grant awarded to Gloucester City girls football club for new kit right up to a &pound;426,000 grant to Abbeydale Community Association towards the development of its facilities. In addition, the Government have, through Sport England, invested more than &pound;59 million in community football since 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/5">Turning specifically to Gloucester City football club, I should first like to acknowledge and congratulate the club on its 125-year history and on its incredible resilience. Having been flooded out of its ground three times during its history, it is remarkable that it has reached that milestone. I note that my hon. Friend is sporting the club's yellow and black tie; it looks like a bee or a wasp, and they are very tenacious insects.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/6">I was disappointed to learn of the devastating impact that the 2007 floods had on the club's Meadow Park ground. Although all those concerned will have been extremely disappointed about that, I was pleased to note that the football family in Gloucester has come together to help Gloucester City football club find temporary homes, first at Forest Green Rovers football club, and now at Cirencester Town football club.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/7">I know that the club has been working with a range of interested parties, including the city and county council and the Football Association, at national and county level, to identify appropriate sites for a new stadium. My hon. Friend mentioned the names of some of those sites. I encourage the club to continue discussions with those parties, and to consider the options available through the football stadia improvement fund. I am informed that up to &pound;150,000 could be available from that fund for the development of a new ground. I am also advised that up to &pound;100 million&mdash;sorry; I wish it was that much. I am advised that up to &pound;1 million of funding could be available through the Football Foundation to support additional facilities. As I understand it, the club has aspirations to develop a community facility. That funding route may be open to it, if its aim is achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/8">I urge the local authorities in Gloucester to undertake a full review of their sports provision, to plan strategically for the future and to consider whether the club's desire for a new stadium could be met through the provision made to meet the sporting facility needs of the local community. I ask my hon. Friend to keep my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)</phrase>, who has responsibility for sport, informed of progress on the issue. In turn, I will inform my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of the various options that my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester is considering.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/9">I wish Gloucester City football club the very best of luck. It is lucky to have my hon. Friend as its constituency Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/10" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.1/11" class="italic"> Adjourned accordingly at Eleven o'clock.</p>
