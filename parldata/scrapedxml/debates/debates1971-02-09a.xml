<p>I am confident that my right hon.

<p>It is wise that we should look at the experience of other countries which have tried this.

<p>While the claim that competition will stabilise prices may be an important part of the Government's new philosophy, to which the Minister frequently refers, is it not the case that it has little relationship to the realities of the food marketing situation at present?

&#x2014;he will get exactly the same answer&#x2014;which is, as I explained to them, first, that these are legal obligations on the British Government, which have been set out by the Attorney-General in his advice to Parliament and which the Government have long been aware of; and, secondly, that there are reasons of general British policy, common sense and straightforward dealing why we should fulfil those obligations.

Secondly, can he tell the House whether the Government of Laos have officially made any approach to Her Majesty's Government in their capacity as a co-Chairman?

<p>In relation to the original remark of the hon. Gentleman, I would refer him to a reply to a somewhat similar question given by the right hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Michael Stewart) in the last Parliament. He said:

alone, could not be justified either in common sense or as a useful contribution to peacemaking in this area".&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th May, 1970; Vol. 801, c. 218.]</q>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not departing from that point of view. I made a specific approach to the Soviet Ambassador five days ago and I do not propose to repeat this every five days. It is open to Mr. Gromyko to answer at any time and to reinstate the machinery of the Geneva Conference. The answer to the second question is that the Laotian Government have not made an approach to Her Majesty's Government. On the third question, Her Majesty's Government were not consulted by the United States Government. We were informed that no United States troops were taking part in this operation. I have constantly stated that the only status the United Kingdom has in this matter is as co-Chairman of the Conference which we hoped would bring peace if it was recalled.</p>

<p>Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman had not carefully considered what he said; he said that there had been no condemnation from any quarter about North Vietnam infiltration into Laos and other Communist attacks in Laos. I will not press him for an answer now, but would he look up the private record of our relations with the


Governments concerned and also statements made in this House? He will find that he is totally wrong. In this respect he is being less than fair to my right hon. Friend the Member for Fulham and other members of the late Government.</p>

<p>I would certainly not wish to be unfair to the right hon. Member for Fulham. He took a most courageous line in this matter all the way through&#x2014;in sharp contra-distinction to some hon. Gentlemen opposite.</p>

<p>Further to the last two or three questions, is it not a fact that the Laotian Government in their representations about what has been going on have openly placed the primary responsibility on North Vietnamese penetration of their country? Further, is it not a fact that so far as hearing about Private Notice Questions from hon. Members opposite goes, we did not hear any mention at all of North Vietnamese penetration?</p>

<p>It is true that the Laotian Government have placed the primary responsibility on North Vietnam, although they, like everyone else, deplore the extension of this war. I would have thought that the whole House would agree that the constructive thing to do now is to try to reinstate the Geneva machinery so that we can get the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cambodia, South Vietnam and Laos.</p>

<p>Would the right hon. Gentleman agree that the flooding over of this war into that part of South-East Asia has always been a real possibility, irrespective of whether American troops were there? Is it not equally important for us to try to realise that if there is further extension of the war into Thailand our own forces might be involved? Would the right hon. Gentleman say at what stage, if it did go into Thailand, our troops would be required?</p>

<p>This is a separate matter and matters concerning Thailand are for the S.E.A.T.O. Treaty. We have no obligation in respect of South Vietnam and we have made it clear that we are not involved in this war. The practical thing is for the Soviet Foreign Minister now to respond to my appeal to set up the Geneva Peace Conference.</p>

<p>Has not the change in the nature of the struggle in the area since 1954 made the co-Chairmanship machinery somewhat outdated, and might we not make more progress if we approached the Soviet Union with a view to associating some of the non-aligned Asian Powers with the discussions?</p>

<p>This may well be so. I am ready at any time to consult the Soviet Foreign Minister as to whether any variation of the Geneva machinery is desirable, and I am also ready to consult with the Chinese. The great advantage of the Geneva machinery is that it is there, it was kept in being for this purpose and could be resurrected quite quickly.</p>

<p>Will not the Foreign Secretary accept that when the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia hon. Members on this side of the House were the first to protest, and the Government then in office immediately arranged for the recall of Parliament and a debate. Has the Foreign Secretary seen the statement of the Prime Minister of Laos, Souvanna Phouma, protesting against the invasion, and will he not join the Secretary-General of the United Nations in condemning this extension of the war and make representations in Washington requesting the United States to withdraw all their forces and not to expand this war?</p>

<p>The Question is about Laos and not about Czechoslovakia. The hon. Gentleman might perhaps recognise that the action of the North Vietnamese in mobilising an attack through neutral Laotian territory is likely to prevent and not accelerate American withdrawal.</p>

<p>What we really want to hear from the Foreign Secretary, instead of a general statement on the situation, is some filling out of what he said just now about possible changes in the Geneva machinery. Does he recall that in 1963, I think, when he was previously Foreign Secretary and there was further trouble in Laos after the 1962 Conference, he put forward the proposal that instead of calling the full Geneva Conference there should be a conference between the parties, the co-Chairmen


and the members of the Control Commission. This idea was unfortunately not then accepted. Since the right hon. Gentleman will be aware that the last thing he can ever expect is that the Soviet Government will want a full-dress Geneva Conference with the Chinese present&#x2014;he must realise that&#x2014;will he give consideration to the proposal put forward by him at that time, and by others later, that there should be a more restricted conference of just the parties, the co-Chairmen and members of the Control Commission?</p>

<p>This might be possible, although the Russians have shown no sign of reactivating or wishing to reactivate the Control Commission. It would be fair to point out to the right hon. Gentleman that unless the Chinese are present at a conference there would be very little chance of peace.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I ask your help and guidance? I do not know when my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General last answered Oral Questions in this House, but, through no fault of his own, he has not done so on at least the last two occasions when he was due to answer Questions and when it was reasonable, having regard to the point on the Order Paper at which the Questions appeared, that he might be expected to answer. The essential point about the order of Questions is that every Minister should answer Oral Questions at regular intervals, but this has not happened with the Attorney-General. You will appreciate, Mr. Speaker, that back benchers on both sides of the House are not parties to the arrangements entered into through the usual channels, and I therefore ask you what protection you may be able to offer and what advice you can give in a situation which is becoming increasingly unhappy for many hon. Members.</p>

<p>The Chair is very much in the hands of the House in this matter. I tried to bustle things along yesterday, and we got through 41 Questions. Today we were getting along fairly well, and then things did not go quite so quickly and we only got through about 27 Questions.<br/>
The old tradition was that Questions should be put in order to gain information. The modern tendency is that Questions are put in order to make political points, which was not the original idea of Questions.<br/>
This is not a matter for the Chair but for the House, and the Chair is very much in the hands of the House. All I can do is to try to hurry things along, which I promise to do. If the House wishes to change its rules of order, it must do so.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order. Of course the Government are prepared to look at the order of Questions and the rota, which starts again after the Easter Recess, to see that all Ministers answer Questions, which is certainly our desire. All Governments have great difficulty in satisfying all requirements in working out the Question roster, but in conjunction with the Opposition and all hon. Members of the House we will try our best to do so.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order. In view of your stricture, Mr. Speaker, that Questions should be put down to elicit information, may I draw the attention of the Leader of the House to the fact that the reply from the Minister is often that the information cannot be given because it would be embarrassing to the Government?</p>

<p>Further to that point of order. Is it not obvious that this complaint and similar complaints which have been made in the recent past stem from the practice of giving subsidiary Ministers a lower place on the Order Paper? Would it not be better to revert to the practice of simply taking the Minister as he comes to the top of the list and starting, say, once every five weeks with the Attorney-General or another Minister?</p>

<p>It is possible, but the House would find grave disadvantages in that course in relation to those Ministers whom the House wishes to question most. I am in the hands of the House, and I will consider that, but I hope the House will realise the difficulty of following that course.</p>

<p>Several points have been made on this matter. The hon. Member said that the Minister of Agriculture had only answered 21 Questions but I saw a number of disappointed faces when hon. Members were not called to ask supplementary questions. We have to get along as quickly as we can. This is not a proper matter for discussion now. It is a serious matter but not a new one. For 25 years there have been constant complaints about not getting through enough Questions. I hope the proper channels and those in authority will have regard to the points which have been made.</p>

<p>This Amendment, too, is destined to fall a victim to the guillotine. Like Danton, it deserved a better fate, but I suspect that it shares its tumbrel with many even worthier arguments.

<p>We have discussed at some length the principles and the proposals which are consummated in the Clause and which we on this side of the Committee have described throughout as the fictitious agreement Clause; because what

is proposed by means of this very tortuous procedure through Clauses 35&#x2013;38 is that in the last analysis two parties are compelled to enter into a binding agreement against the clear intention of one of them. It must be the clear intention, otherwise there would be no need to go through this procedure and obtain an order of the court. In the event of the default of one of the parties, a substantial amount of compensation may fall to be paid.<br/>
Because this is so plainly an outrageous intrusion into the principle of freedom of contract and an entirely novel post-election proposal, it is now at the eleventh hour being sold by the Secretary of State as an emergency procedure. This is what we have been told. That may well be the Secretary of State's intention; but if it was, why was this not included in that part of the Bill which is headed "Emergency Procedures" instead of it finding its way into this Part of the Bill?<br/>
There is no guarantee, even if we are assured by the Secretary of State that it is intended to be used only in emergency, that once it is on the Statute Book that is how it will be used. In any event, it does not alter the principle to which this side of the Committee is entirely opposed and it does not detract from the


points which have been made in the debates on the other Clauses&#x2014;that there will be a duty upon trade unionists and others who do not wish to enter into one of these fictitious agreements to police it and take quite drastic action against their own colleagues and members to enforce it.<br/>
The interaction of C.I.R. and N.I.R.C. here is such that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) in a very telling speech pointed out, the whole intention of the C.I.R. will be undermined. This has been shown, not merely by the action of Alf Allen and Will Paynter, but by the action only a day or two ago of a very eminent professor displaying his contempt for the C.I.R. in the new context of the N.I.R.C. One wonders just how long it will be before this is followed by other resignations on the part of those serving on the C.I.R.<br/>
Also, as an appeal lies only on a question of law, it will not be possible to appeal from a decision of N.I.R.C.; because these are purely factual matters in these agreements.<br/>
Above all, we on this side have emphasised throughout the continuous and the changing nature of procedure agreements and the fact that they rely ultimately on voluntary co-operation.<br/>
The problem about procedures is not obtaining an agreement. The problem is seeing that an agreement is kept. This point is entirely missed by this Clause and by the preceding Clauses. We are concerned that we should obtain procedures which, when they are obtained, will be kept.<br/>
Even when parties voluntarily agree to a procedure, it is virtually impossible to enforce this satisfactorily by law. Heaven knows what will occur when, as in this case, we have to enforce a fictitious agreement upon an unwilling, non-consenting party.<br/>
It is not good enough for the Solicitor-General, as he did in last week's debate, to throw the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act at us as a precedent. That Act is not enforced in this way by a union policing its own members. It operates so as to bring the terms and conditions in an industry up to those which are voluntarily agreed by the

majority in that industry. It does not single out, as the Bill does, a particular employer for special treatment with regard to a case and problem particular to him. It is socially acceptable to industry, whereas the Clause, as we on this side continually point out, is not socially acceptable; and that which is not socially acceptable will ultimately be unenforceable.<br/>
This is an alien concept&#x2014;an idea perhaps more at home in the realm of the 1930s than in Britain in the 1970s. What the Government should be doing now is encouraging parties voluntarily to move forward to mutually acceptable procedure agreements. The Government should stop taking Donovan out of context in the way the Solicitor-General did. I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to read again paragraphs 475 and 507 of the Donovan Report and put Donovan in its context instead of putting odd sentences that appear to support his views.<br/>
The secret of harmony in industry is not enforceability but agreement in co-operation, and certainly not the enforcement of things that are not agreed between the two sides of industry.<br/>
Finally, we arrive at these conclusions. First, even if procedure agreements are to be enforceable, as they are under the Bill, the Clause still remains utterly repugnant and unacceptable to this side of the Committee. Second, if procedure agreements are not to be enforceable, as they are under the Bill, the Clause still remains utterly repugnant and unacceptable to this side of the Committee. Second, if procedure agreements are not to be enforceable, the Clause would be an irrelevancy, anyway.<br/>
Therefore, as this is a most provocative Clause which has caused dismay and bitterness throughout the trade union movement and among a great many academics who are concerned with the law of contract and a great many lawyers, and as it is already contributing in great measure to the upsurge of bitterness on the part of industry provoked by the Government, we on this side will oppose the Clause and will throughout the stages of the Bill oppose any attempt to enforce upon unwilling parties agreements into which they have not entered and which they cannot be expected to enforce against their own members.</p>

<p>The Committee has heard the arguments on this part of the Bill rehearsed in many debates and I do not want to take up time on them now, but I must reply to the general assertion again repeated by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Rose) denouncing the provisions when they are a fair and reasonable attempt to solve what is by common acknowledgment one of the greatest difficulties on the industrial relations scene.<br/>
It may be said that these are provocative provisions. The fact is that other people&#x2014;academics and practical people of all kinds&#x2014;have urged us to extend the concept of enforceability to pre-existing agreements. They have said that we should disregard the difficulties or practical facts of particular cases and that we should make the provision for enforceability universally applicable. We have not done that. We have proceeded from the premise, as the Donovan Commission pointed out&#x2014;and there is no room for argument about this&#x2014;that most of our troubles spring from the inadequacy of procedure agreements and that the urgent need is to improve those agreements. [HON. MEMBERS: "On a voluntary basis."] Hon. Members say, "On a voluntary basis." But society has been waiting for management to get off its backside and for union leaders to improve procedures on a voluntary basis. Society asks, "How long must we wait before these improvements come about on a voluntary basis?"<br/>
For that reason, successive Governments have become increasingly impressed with the urgency of trying to do something to accelerate progress towards the making of the kind of agreement which everyone regards as desirable. We are not making a general intrusion into freedom. We are designing selected, precise, case-by-case procedures which will exert pressure upon management and union leaders to improve procedures in given situations.<br/>
The r&#x00F4;le of the C.I.R. will be to act as honest broker and conciliator in those cases which the court has identified as causing persistent trouble, as set out in Clause 35. It must be plain beyond argument that some kind of outside guidance, help and treatment is desirable. It is only

in that narrow situation that we arrived at the remedies proposed. It is beside the point and unimpressive for statements to be made about comparisons between these proposals and anything which may be found in Rome, ancient or modern. Society acknowledges that we have a problem. Everyone has acknowledged the necessity to try to raise standards, and this is a method carefully designed to achieve that end. It involves no contempt of the C.I.R., whose r&#x00F4;le will be to do what it can to bring about the necessary improvements.<br/>
We believe that the general tide of progress must be voluntary but that the law can and should exert pressure in the direction of selected cases to try to achieve the result that society wants.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.302.0" hansard_membership_id="2706" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11510" speakername="Mr. James Sillars" colnum="302" time="">
<p>The Solicitor-General keeps telling us about society's opinion. Can he say when society gave an opinion on this matter, seeing that the point at issue was never discussed as a matter of controversy between the main parties at the election?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.302.1" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="302" time="">
<p>The general conclusion that unofficial, unconstitutional strikes, either in breach of good procedures or, more frequently, because of the non-existence of good procedures, are at the heart of our troubles was endorsed by the Donovan Commission and by the last Government. This is the diagnosis and society has accepted the efforts of Labour and Conservative Governments to find a solution for it.<br/>
The Donovan Report argued that when procedures had been improved we must look again at the case for selective enforceability on a case-by-case basis. We have waited for three years. There is not sufficient evidence that improvement is taking place voluntarily as fast as we should like and I am sure that society supports our attempts to create more quickly machinery for the improvement of agreements and, in these special selected cases, for such agreements to be enforced. I am sure that we all share that objective, and I commend the view that this is a legitimate and reasonably balanced way to try to achieve it.<br/>
The parallel with the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act remains. If society wishes to see an improvement in the standard of procedures, it is not unreasonable to select a method of the kind


we suggest, just as in the context of the 1959 Act it was decided that it was sensible to bring the standards of collective bargains up to those generally agreed and, in those circumstances, to impose the conclusion upon selected firms. It is in that way, and not in any extravagant way, that I commend the Clause, already debated in principle, as one which the Committee should accept.</p>

<p>It is important to point out that Clause 39 does two things. It imposes something upon people who, according to the Donovan Report, would be preferably left to their own devices. There is an element of imposition there, and I think wrongly there, from the beginning. The second element about which we complain is the method of imposition. This is where the paradox is highlighted at its most extreme. The cutting edge of the enforceability of collective agreements is in Clause 39.<br/>
The paradox which highlights it is the fact that in Clause 35 there are examples of three kinds of procedure agreement which can lead to imposition by the Industrial Court. The first is when there is no procedure agreement. Whether one agrees with the Government's remedy or not, one can well understand that the diagnosis is probably relevant&#x2014;that there will be trouble in industry if there is no procedure agreement. Similarly, one can understand the second example&#x2014;the unsuitability of procedure agreements such as exist. One may acknowledge the diagnosis but not the cure.<br/>
But one then comes to the third example which is illustrated in Clause 35(1)(<i>b),</i> namely, a procedure which is in existence, with both parties being satisfied with the agreement. The paradox is that, despite the fact that the parties have reached agreement and have a genuine contract, the Industrial Court can, under Clause 39, impose other terms of agreement upon them. It can not merely impose something on them; it can impose it on the fiction that it is an agreement. One is taking, not one, but two strange new steps and providing for a system of enforceability based on the fiction that the parties are agreed about the thing to be enforceable.<br/>
For that reason, among others, I think that the Clause is in error and goes in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>We all want to make progress on the Bill, but this is one of the points in it at which a vital principle is involved. We cannot stress too strongly how iniquitous we find the principle in the Clause. We are totally at a loss to understand the complacency of hon. Members opposite, and particularly of hon. and learned Gentlemen opposite, because they must know that everyone connected with and experienced in the administration and operation of the law is deeply perturbed by the proposed new principle.<br/>
Although, as the Solicitor-General said, we on this side of the Committee have ventilated our anxieties, we have had a completely contemptible answer from the Government. The Solicitor-General even justified the Government breaking their mandate on their industrial relations legislation by the fact that the Government had not done certain things which they had been urged to do. In particular, he said, "Look how liberal we are, because we have been urged to make pre-existing contracts legally enforceable. So all that we are doing is to make not only post-legislation contracts legally enforceable but to impose agreements that were never agreed." It reminds me of the girl who justified her illegitimate baby on the ground that it was not twins. It will not do for the right hon. Gentleman to quote in aid Donovan and the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act. It is vital for us to place on record once and for all that in this, as in other matters, the Government are distorting Donovan and going in exactly the opposite direction to that which Donovan advocated.<br/>
The Solicitor-General made great play on that section of Donovan which discusses what might be the r&#x00F4;le that law could play when the voluntary reforms had been carried through. He said that Donovan had quoted the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act as an analogy. Donovan did nothing of the kind. It was not quoting that Act as a justification for imposing procedure agreements here. In paragraph 511, Donovan was merely quoting this as an example of <i>ad hoc</i> application of the


law. But the Donovan attitude is made completely clear in paragraph 514 when, having discussed the sort of legal sanctions which might, if all else failed, be considered, and having discussed the possibility of the Secretary of State giving legal backing to particular procedure agreements, in exceptional situations, Donovan went on to say:
<q>To proceed further, the Secretary of State would, on the basis of this consultation, have to be satisfied: (<i>a</i>) that the disputes procedure has been agreed between the employer and the union or unions concerned;</q>
Even in this ultimate resort, where Donovan considered that it might be necessary at some distant future point, if voluntary reform had failed, to consider bringing in the law, they were only prepared to give legal backing to procedure agreements which had been negotiated by both sides.<br/>
Therefore, once again the Government are wrong about Donovan. Once again, the Government are manufacturing a new and illiberal principle entirely of their own.<br/>
It is not only lawyers who are outraged by this Clause. It is not only the trade unions who protest and will continue to protest that they are expected, under this group of Clauses, to police agreements which they did not voluntarily enter into&#x2014;a new form of tyranny in our law&#x2014;but the ordinary person in this country.</p>

<p>I cannot answer for Yarmouth, particularly as it returns the hon. Gentleman, which I should have thought was a measure of the need for enlightenment in that area.<br/>
Hon. Gentlemen opposite are labouring under a very dangerous illusion if they think that there is not intense bitterness against the Bill, which will grow as the full implications of its provisions come home. The Government are coasting along at present by a widespread ignorance of the public as to what the Bill involves.<br/>
I quote a letter which I received the other day, a second letter from someone who had written to me violently supporting the Bill and violently criticising what I had written about it. The tenor of the letter was to say how unreasonable I was being about this reasonable Government. Part of it reads as follows:
<q>You of all people must know that the chances of an employer forcing any agreement on a reluctant Trade Union are negligible. The Unions are far too strong for this to be possible. In any event if a Union did not sign an agreement it would not be an agreement so how could a Union be mulcted for damages for breaking something which did not exist.</q>
In this Clause we are deciding that something shall exist which did not exist, and that it will have the full rigour of the law behind it. When that principle comes home to people, their reaction against the Bill and the Government will be still more bitter.</p>

<p>It would be wrong to take up much time on this Clause because, obviously, it is consequential upon those that we have just considered. However, there is one important point that I want to raise, since it is the basis on which we on this side of the Committee oppose the Clause.<br/>
It provides that, for a period of two years after a report has been made under the earlier provisions, the Industrial Court shall not entertain another application relating to the same circumstances. That is understandable. One would not want repeated applications to the court. It would not be helpful to industry to have that state of affairs.<br/>
The Clause goes on to say in subsection (1) that the court shall not entertain a report in such circumstances
<q>&#x2026; unless the Court is satisfied that there are special reasons for entertaining the application within that period.</q>
That provision causes a great deal of disquiet on this side of the Committee, for two main reasons. The first is that the Bill gives no conception of what the "special reasons" are intended to com-

prise. We do not know what is contemplated for the Industrial Court and whether the reasons are to be legal or industrial reasons. If they are industrial reasons, the provision is yet another illustration of the point made repeatedly from this side of the Committee that the court being set up is an inappropriate body to adjudicate on matters coming before it.<br/>
If the "Special reasons" are industrial, we question whether a court of law&#x2014;even an unusual one like this&#x2014;is appropriate to adjudicate upon such matters. If the "special reasons" are legal, one has to bear in mind that a hybrid procedure has been used to take the reference to the Industrial Court.<br/>
The court is not a purely legal body. Before it gets a reference under Clauses 38 and 39 leading finally to a problem under Clause 40, matters are dealt with by those other hands mentioned in Clause 35 and by the Commission. Clause 35 makes it clear that, even at the level of the Commission, there will be a mixture of industrial knowledge and legal know-how which will make it important to know whether the "special reasons" are meant to be industrial or legal.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
Clause 37(3) deals with the Commission promoting and assisting discussions between the parties to the procedure agreement. It then stresses,
<q>with a view to obtaining their agreement on new or revised provisions".</q>
Then follow the important words,
<q>&#x2026;so formulated as to be capable of having effect as a legally enforceable contract.</q>
Even at the Commission level one will clearly need. legal advice, so that whatever is forged from the negotiations or discussions can be legally enforced. It seems, therefore, most important that we should know what special reasons are contemplated.<br/>
I stress again the opposition of this side of the Committee to a body of this kind adjudicating on industrial matters.


For these and other reasons we shall oppose the Clause.</p>

<p>I should like to give one word of explanation to the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Murray). Of course, the main objective of the Clause is to prevent a series of repeated applications when a matter has already been considered, adjudicated upon, and reported by the Commission.<br/>
The reference to special reasons is in the context of an application under Clause 35. The body which will have to consider whether special reasons exist is the industrial court. It will have to consider whether there are special reasons amongst those set out in Clause 35 which justify it, because of the persistence or recurrence of strife or disorder, making an additional reference to the Commission earlier than it would otherwise do so. The court will answer the questions, looking at the matter as a court and with the assistance of its industrial members. It will do that in the light of the legislation as a whole having regard to the factors which must be considered under Clause 35.</p>

<p>I must press the hon. and learned Gentleman on this point. What the Solicitor-General said seems to indicate that, although we are not to have an inquiry into the circumstances which give rise to a reference under Clause 35 for two years, in considering special reasons we shall go back to those circumstances.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.313.2" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="313" time="">
<p>This is right, but in changed circumstances. The original application will have been made and referred to the Commission which will probably have spent some time considering it and will have reported; but, for some reason or another, neither side will have applied to get the report made part of an enforceable procedure. It may be that 12 months thereafter the conditions in the unit of employment</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.314.0" colnum="314" time="">
<p>have become so bad that, applying the tests set out in Clause 35, it is apparent that the maintenance of orderly industrial relations has been seriously impeded, and specially so, and that there have been substantial losses of work time. In those narrow circumstances I suggest that it is right that there should be this power in the court to conclude that there are special reasons. That is the way we approach the matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.314.1" hansard_membership_id="6922" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29825" speakername="Mr. Hugh Jenkins (Putney)" colnum="314" time="">
<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has given one example of what might constitute special circumstances. To justify the inclusion of this provision one would think that there must be more than a single set of circumstances. Before leaving the subject, might I ask the Solicitor-General to give two or three examples of conditions which would be regarded as special circumstances justifying this special consideration by the court?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.314.2" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="314" time="">
<p>I have in fact, although in a compressed form, given more than one example. The phrase "special reasons" is not expressly defined. The question will have to be answered by the court in the light of the tests laid down in Clause 35.<br/>
There are several alternative matters. There are alternatives in Clause 35(3)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). If those conditions, which normally allow a Clause 35 application to be considered favourably by the court, arise in a special way so that the court concludes that there are special reasons for allowing this early reapplication, then it is able to do so.<br/>
I point to two alternative matters, but there are more than two in Clause 35(3)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). In that sense I commend the Clause as it stands to the Committee.</p>

<p>I should remind the Committee that it would be appropriate to discuss with Clause 41 new Clause No. 15, headed "Reference to Commission of request by trade union for recognition",
<q>.&#x2014;(1) Where it appears to the Secretary of State that an employer or group of associated employers has not complied with a request for recognition made by or on behalf of one or more trade unions, or has failed to honour recognition previously given and has been requested to restore that recognition, the Secretary of State may, after complying with subsection (3) of this section, refer that request to the Commission if he is of the opinion that it is expedient to do so.</q>
<q>(2) Any such request for recognition as is mentioned in the preceding subsection&#x2014;</q>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) may be a request for recognition either in respect of all the employees of the employer or group of employers or in respect only of one or more descriptions of those employees, and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) whether it relates to all those employees or only to one or more descriptions of them, may a request either for recognition generally or for recognition in respect of one or more particular matters and (in either case) may be a request for recognition at all levels (whether national, regional or local) or for recognition at one or more such levels.</li>
</ol>

<q>(3) Before referring any request to the Commission under this section, the Secretary of State shall give notice of the proposal&#x2014;</q>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) to the employer (or, if more than one, to each of the employers) to whom the request was made and to the trade union or trade unions by or on behalf of which it was made, and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) to the General Council and the Confederation; and, if any of them offer any advice with respect to the proposal, shall take that advice into consideration.</li>
</ol>
<q>(4) Where a request for recognition is referred to the Commission in accordance with subsection (1) of this section the Commission shall enquire into the request and shall report to the Secretary of State along with any recommendation which they may wish to make, and on such a report being made to him, the Secretary of State may, if he thinks fit, order the employer or employers to whom the request was made to recognise the trade union or trade unions to the extent specified in the order; and where such an order has been made by the Secretary of State the recognition prescribed in the order shall be an implied term of every contract of employment between the employer or employers and any employee for whose benefit that recognition is intended.</q>
<q>(5) For the purpose of assisting the Commission in their examination of any question referred to them under this section the Commission may, if they think fit, take one or more ballots of employees appearing to the Commission to be employees to whom the question directly relates and the Commission shall take account of the results of any such ballot in arriving at their conclusions on that question.</q>
<q>(6) In this section any reference to the recognition of a trade union by an employer shall be so construed as to include the taking by the employer of all such action in connection with the carrying on of relevant negotiations with the trade union as might reasonably be expected to be taken by an employer ready and willing to carry on such negotiations; and any reference to recognising a trade union to any particular extent shall be construed accordingly.</q></p>

<p>In opposing Clause 41 and the subsequent Clauses dependent upon it, we are seeking to replace it with new Clause 15. Clause 41 introduces, for the first time in British industrial relations, the


concept of the bargaining agency. Without pre-empting the debate on following Clauses, it is essential to say something about what is involved here.<br/>
An application can be made to the Industrial Court by one or more trade unions, an employer or the Secretary of State. It is interesting and significant that, whereas a trade union can apply only for a trade union or a joint panel of unions to be the sole bargaining agent, an employer or the Secretary of State may apply for any organisation of workers. In practice, "any organisation of workers" could mean an unregistered trade union, but it could equally mean that an employer or the Secretary of State could apply for a house union, a company union or a similar organisation, which could seriously affect the <i>bona fide</i> union. I suspect that right hon. Gentlemen opposite intend that it should do just that.<br/>
The Industrial Court can refer the question to the C.I.R. which in turn must transmit its proposals to the Industrial Court, and so on. From the moment that the application is made&#x2014;this can be used by employers&#x2014;it is unlawful for a genuine union to take industrial action about recognition. The situation can be made worse, if what we hear is true, because the Government replied to a question in another place that there will be a special register of professional associations which can have access to the Industrial Court to seek exclusive recognition. Lord Windlesham said in the other place, in reply to a Question from Lord Janner:
<q>&#x2026; a number of professional associations have made representations to the Government, and after consideration of those representations it has been decided to introduce an Amendment to the Industrial Relations Bill in another place which will enable professional associations which have a negotiating function to be placed on a special register and thereby benefit from all the privileges accorded to trade unions by the Bill. The Charity Commissioners may feel that it would be desirable to wait and see in what form the legislation goes on the Statute Book before deciding about the position of those professional associations which are registered as charities."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lord,</i> 28th January, 1971; Vol. 314, c. 1061.]</q>
My hon. Friends and I have not yet seen the Amendment, but it is very interesting that this point was made in the other place. We are entitled to know precisely what is the position. If there is to be a

special register which allows the professional associations to have the rights or privileges accorded to trade unions, that is tantamount to making trade unionism unlawful for many workers. It will cause a great deal of bitterness amongst trade unions, especially those which are trying to organise amongst the professional groups.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that this makes a nonsense of the closed shop argument advanced by the Government?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.322.1" hansard_membership_id="5612" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11612" speakername="Mr. Heffer" colnum="322" time="">
<p>I certainly agree. The Government must tell us precisely what the position is.<br/>
If under this procedure only one union is granted recognition as a bargaining unit, members of other unions will have to resign and join the union recommended by the C.I.R. It is all very well for Ministers to say, as they did the other day, that workers can belong to two unions, but that is not a recognised principle within the trade union movement. A man belongs to one union or the other. The Government are creating a new situation. If men did not join the union that is accepted as the sole bargaining agency, they would become non-unionists. Under those circumstances, the Commission on Industrial Relations, under the Bill, could overturn a T.U.C. disputes committee decision based on the Bridlington principle No. 5.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite should understand precisely what is involved. They are saying that they want to strengthen trade union authority and the responsible trade unionists. Apart from anything else, the lengthy procedures outlined in the Clause are in no way conducive to speedy solutions to problems of recognition and so on. They will not help the trade unions involved. It is suggested that we could have a ballot on top of the reference from the Industrial Relations Court to the C.I.R., and then a ballot, back again to the Industrial Relations Court, and so on. The whole structure is incredibly complicated and totally unnecessary. It is quite clear that the complicated procedure proposed by the Government would not give any real aid to the unions which are trying to gain recognition from reactionary employers.


It would create break-away unions. Workers who are temporarily in dispute with their union could seek a reference to the C.I.R. In the United States there are multitudinous groups of unions as bargaining agencies all over the country, not only in the same industry but often in the same towns and within the same companies. This creates utter confusion in the trade union movement.<br/>
The Clause is a recipe for industrial chaos and will lead to Dutch auctions of unions competing with one another for membership. That is not industrial common sense. Union rivalry will develop where it does not exist; unions which have lived together for years, which have refused to poach from each other and have abided by the Bridlington Agreement, could begin to score off each other. If that is the Government's intention, I do not understand how they can say at the same time that they believe in responsible trade unionism. This is the very opposite of responsible trade unionism. It could lead to the sort of bitterness and rivalry that exists among certain American trade unions, with the Teamsters trying to score off the U.A.W., the U.A.W. trying to score off the electrical workers, and so on. Perhaps that is what the Government want. Perhaps they want the trade unions to be divided in that way, but it is not acceptable to the trade union movement.<br/>
The Bridlington Agreement has helped not only the unions but the employers. In the past 30 years the T.U.C. has dealt successfully with more than 1,000 interunion disputes through the application of the Agreement. Under the Government's proposals we could become involved in Dutch auctions, the very opposite of solving the problems as they are now solved under the Bridlington Agreement.<br/>
The C.I.R. established by my right hon. Friend, which has done a first-class job, would lose its r&#x00F4;le of persuasion and promoting good practice. It would become very much the instrument of the Industrial Relations Court, rather than itself sorting out the problems. In Clause 43(3) we find that the specifications will be laid down by the Court and not the C.I.R. This again indicates a subordination of the C.I.R.<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
A further point that requires making is that, after an application under Clause 51(1), after an order of the National Industrial Relations Court under Clause 51(2), (3), (4) or (6), and after any recommendation of the C.I.R. under Clause 51(5), an unfair industrial practice can apply, and can apply for two years. I stress again that, if a house union were to be recommended by the C.I.R., a genuine <i>bona fide</i> trade union could not obtain recognition for at least two years. For this and many other reasons which I have not been able to bring out for lack of time, we reject Clause 41 and wish to put new Clause 15 in its place.<br/>
New Clause 15 would, firstly, give the Secretary of State a right, after consultations with the employers and the trade unions&#x2014;that is, with the T.U.C. and the C.B.I.&#x2014;to refer a case of recognition to the C.I.R. I stress that it is recognition that is involved. This is a very important point indeed. Secondly, the recognition issued could be for one or more unions. Thirdly, after the C.I.R. had studied the situation and reported to the Secretary of State, then, and only then, he could issue an order to the employer to recognise the union or unions. This is in line with the proposals made in my right hon. Friend's Bill, which unfortunately we did not pass because of the election. It is in line with the fact that the T.U.C. would, of course, be involved at all stages, as would the employers' organisations. We also suggest in new Clause 15 that there could be a ballot of workers and that this would have to be taken into account by the C.I.R. when arriving at its conclusion.<br/>
But these proposals do not follow those of the Government, which are all within the legal framework laid down on the basis of the Industrial Relations Court. We believe that our proposals are a constructive alternative to those being put forward by the Government. We recognise that there are problems of recognition. That is clear. We know that certain employers refuse to accept the elementary principle in this modern age that the trade union movement should be recognised, that unions should be recognised as a basis for proper voluntarily negotiated collective agreements. We can give example after


example of employers who refuse recognition to the trade union movement. There was a bitter example in Stockport, where a gigantic battle was waged for two years in order to gain trade union recognition. So we accept the fact that there are problems of recognition and that some employers are intransigent and seek to avoid recognition of trade unions.<br/>
In our proposals, we equally seek to avoid the need for workers in this modern age to take strike action in order to receive trade union recognition. We believe that, in these modern days, it is totally unnecessary that they should have to do so, and that is why we put forward our proposals. What we are seeking to do is to maintain the important voluntary principle, which is in contrast with the complicated legal framework which the Government propose. Our proposals seek to strengthen and improve the work of the C.I.R., and that again is entirely different from the Government's proposals, hemmed in as they are by the Bill's legal framework. Therefore I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against Clause 41, and equally&#x2014;I am not sure whether we can do so under the rules of the House&#x2014;to vote for new Clause 15 if we have the opportunity, because it is a sensible, sound and constructive alternative to the Government's proposals.</p>

<p>I find myself in a good deal of agreement with a number of things said by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heifer). I want to raise a number of points which have emerged from what has been said. This takes us back to Clause 11 (3), which says that certain things follows in relation to an agency shop if a trade union is recognised by the employer as having negotiating rights. In Clause 41, we find that "negotiating rights"
<q>&#x2026; means rights, recognised by an employer or by two or more associated employers, to participate, on behalf of all or some of the employees &#x2026;</q>
in regard to collective agreements. What we do not have in the Bill is any means by which one can ensure that an employer will recognise. Therefore it seems to me, both in relation to the agency shop, where this is one of the gateways which have to be crossed, and in relation to the recognition of a sole bargaining agent,

there is a necessity to secure the right for recognition.<br/>
I concur in the view expressed by the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he will not be embarrassed by that. I have had in my constituency a case in an engineering works where the union claimed that a majority of the employees wished it to represent them. The employers took the view that this was not a correct assessment of the situation and refused to recognise the union. The only course open to the union was to call a strike in order to secure recognition. I agree that in this day and age we should be more civilised about this.<br/>
In our original "Fair Deal at Work" proposals, we talked about providing a basis for a vote to decide whether a union should have negotiating rights. I recognise that the Bill, in relation to the sole bargaining agent, is designed to deal with the conflict situation between two unions, and I support its proposals in that connection. But where in the Bill is there power for a union to call for a ballot to show an employer that it has a majority of workers in the plant? I am thinking of the situation in which there is no conflict as to which union should be recognised and where there is no need to go to the C.I.R. for the boundaries to be drawn and no need to go to the Industrial Court. I am considering a situation in which there is clear indication that the majority of the employees support a certain union and want it to represent them and which should, therefore, be given recognition by the employer.</p>

<p>On a point of order. I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend, but surely all the arguments, from both sides of the Committee, are directed to the proposals on the recognition of sole bargaining agent, which is Clause 42. I understood that we were taking Clause 41 which relates to bargaining structure.</p>

<p>Further to the point of order. I was about to sit down but I must say that my hon. Friend will have noticed that among the things listed as definitions here is the definition of negotiating rights. The point that I am


making is that there is insufficient basis for securing those outlined in this Clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.327.0" hansard_membership_id="3565" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14217" speakername="Mr. Douglas-Mann" colnum="327" time="">
<p>I hope that you will guide me as to what is and what is not in order, Mr. Deputy Chairman.<br/>
I want to support the new Clause and to comment on those parts of the Bill of which Clause 41 forms an essential ingredient. These are not only the most revolutionary, perhaps I should say counter-revolutionary, parts in the Bill, but they are also revolutionary in English law. We knew before the Bill was presented that it would contain provisions to make collective agreements legally binding. However, until the Bill appeared, I think all of us had assumed that those agreements were to be agreements to which the parties, through trade unions, had assented. Nothing in either the Conservative Party manifesto or, "Fair Deal at Work" in any way indicated that we should be getting collective bargaining agreements made by sole bargaining agents who had been appointed under the provisions of the Clauses we are now considering and which would be binding on members of trade unions who had had no part in the negotiation of those agreements.<br/>
Clauses 41 to 50 provide for an application to be made by either a trade union or an employer for the appointment of a sole bargaining agent. The court must refer that to the Commission and the matter can then be settled at any stage by agreement. When the Commission reports back to the court it has to give notice to those who would be affected by it. That is under Clause 44(2).<br/>
There is no provision in the Bill for any notice to be given to the unions whose members are likely to be affected, even in a situation in which an employer is pressing either for a staff association, a tame company union, to be appointed as the sole bargaining agent or in which an application is made by an employer or by a trade union which has made a satisfactory bargain for its own members with the employer, for that union to be appointed as sole bargaining agent. There is no provision in the Bill which would prevent a union representing 51 per cent. of the employees in a firm or industry

being appointed as the sole bargaining agent.<br/>
There is not even any duty on the Commission to make sure that the unions whose members are likely to be affected would be given notice of the proposal. The Commission is required to satisfy itself that any proposal put forward would promote a satisfactory and lasting settlement, but there is no provision for the unions to be given any notice, let alone for them to make representations to the Commission or the court.<br/>
It may be extravagant to suppose that the Commission would make a recommendation to the court when it knows that 60 per cent. of the employees affected belong to one union and 40 per cent. to another, but there are many more marginal situations in which, without greater protection than we have in the Bill as it stands, there is a great danger of the Commission making a recommendation to the court which could produce an absolutely disastrous situation. There could be a situation in which one union has a minority of members with interests quite different from those of the majority and that minority union interest could be wholly overridden by the provisions of the Bill.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
What is of even greater importance is not so much the majority opinion putting itself forward or being put forward but the employer putting forward a staff association, a tame company union. We have had situations, for example, in the banks, in which a staff association was for a long time the major "union". Almost any retail organisation in which the branches are split up throughout the country carries the danger of having a staff association being promoted within it as a sole bargaining agent. It will be almost impossible, once a sole bargaining agent has been established&#x2014;without the Commission even having heard the representations which the unions would have sought to make&#x2014;to upset that arrangement and the staff association will remain the bargaining agent until the signatures of 20 per cent. of the, often very widely scattered, employees affected can be collected.</p>

<p>On a point of order. May I reinforce what has been said by my hon. Friend the


Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger). It seems to me, listening to the debate and reading Clause 15, that it should be taken in conjunction with Clause 42. Clause 41 is simply a definition Clause with an interpretation of various parts. What hon. Gentlemen opposite are debating are the terms laid down in Clause 42 and in new Clause 15.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order. This is a difficult matter. The Chair has referred to the new Clause. It is not compatible with the interpretation Clause in the Bill. If that new Clause were inserted in place of the interpretation Clause it would make a nonsense of this part of the Bill. What my hon. Friends have said is prefectly right. I appreciate that the Chair has to make the selection, but in this case the selection as it is, without some reference to the next Clause, would make a nonsense of the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.329.4" speakerid="unknown" speakername="The Deputy Chairman" colnum="329" time="">

<p>The provisions introduced by new Clause 15 are infinitely superior to those already in the Bill. Those existing provisions, particularly to do with the sole bargaining agent mean that there are loopholes which provide opportunities for enormous abuses. Many of my hon. Friends have extensive experience in situations in which unionism is strong. Although I have some experience of such situations, I have even more experience of situations in which the trade unions are weak and seeking to establish themselves.<br/>
My fear is that, as these provisions stand the trade unions will find it almost impossible to function properly in situations where unions are not yet established. A sole bargaining agent will have been appointed, either by the employer having made a bargain favourable to himself with a trade union, which is favourable only to the members of that union, to the exclusion of other workers, or to the exclusion of the members of unions representing workers likely to be affected at a later stage or to the exclusion of members belonging to a more aggressive union which might seek to recruit members in that industry. This is a real problem in the areas in which unionism is very weak and wage levels low.<br/>
An employer on a construction site might make a bargain at an early stage of the job and appoint one particular union or his own staff association as sole bargaining agent. At that time he has a relatively small number of employees and he can get their approval or, if necessary, buy their approval, to the appointment of that union or association as sole bargaining agent. Once that union is so established, the tradesmen and craftsmen who come on to the site later, and whose unions will not even have been given the opportunity of making representations when the Commission is considering whether to appoint a bargaining agent, will have no opportunity to make their case. An even graver situation arises with banks and retail trade distribution.<br/>
Whatever may happen in the votes which we shall be taking later, I hope that the Government will reconsider those parts of the Bill which leave so many loopholes for abuse and make it possible for agreements to be made for sole bargaining agents to be appointed when the unions and men most likely to be affected are not even informed of them. The entire procedure envisaged in these Clauses is so unsatisfactory that I hope that the Committee will support new Clause 15.</p>

<p>The Committee at least approaches the debate on these two matters&#x2014;the provisions set out in Clause 41 and the alternative proposals in new Clause 15&#x2014;with an important declaration of principle from the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer). He told the Committee that he

<p>I have just given way, and I am rising to deal with the point put by my hon. Friend&#x2014;if I may be allowed to deal with one at a time. My hon. Friend expressed an anxiety which I think is on a point of order. With great respect, Mr. Deputy Chairman, the concepts embodied in Clause 41 are fundamental to the Clauses which follow it. There are definitions of "bargaining unit", "negotiating rights", "sole bargaining agent", and so on. They are to be contrasted with the provisions contained in new Clause 15. I have no doubt that, as a matter of order, the provisions contained in new Clause 15 could have been set alongside one of several debates on the Clauses in this Part of the Bill, but the Committee may feel&#x2014;and I am probably entirely out of order in saying this&#x2014;that it is not an inconvenient context in which to discuss the alternative approaches, so as to avoid the frequent repetition of the same point on successive Clauses. That is the spirit in which I am approaching it, and I hope that I am not going out of order in doing so.</p>

<p>I will just repeat the point and provoke the hon. Gentleman once again, if I have to. I was saying that the hon. Member for Walton had made an important statement when he said that in recognition disputes strike action is&#x2014;and I utter what he said in parenthesis&#x2014;or ought to be&#x2014;totally unnecessary.</p>

<p>What I said was that strikes ought not to be necessary in this modern day and age. I did not say that trade unions should not take strike action in present circumstances to force recognition. I was saying that we should devise a system, as was envisaged in my right hon. Friend's Bill, for forcing recog-

nition upon recalcitrant, reactionary employers without it being necessary for workers to take strike action.</p>

<p>I do not wish to misunderstand or misrepresent the hon. Gentleman, but we are here, almost for the first time, plainly on important common ground. There are certain types of strike in certain situations which ought not in a modern society to be necessary if society formulates an alternative machinery for the resolution of the underlying disputes. That is precisely what this legislation is about&#x2014;the creation of the alternative machinery which the hon. Gentleman said was to be found in the right hon. Lady's Bill for the resolution of these matters.<br/>
This is the point of principle which we make. We seek only to identify certain types of industrial action as unfair where we are striving to produce alternative machinery for the resolution of those disputes. I am delighted to have the support of the hon. Member for Walton in at least identifying the good sense of the principle. We may disagree on how we apply it, but we have had from him an important acknowledgment of principle.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that it is necessary to provide machinery of this kind&#x2014;and I gladly accept his words. we can all think of examples&#x2014;to compel recalcitrant employers who unreasonably fail to recognise trade unions. I mince no words and make no important concession in acknowledging, as hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have said, that such situations exist. Fine &#x2014;that is what our machinery is about.</p>

<p>I will just make the second part of my point and then give way. It is unrealistic to suppose that disputes and recognition strikes arise solely because of confrontations and disputes between unions seeking recognition and recalcitrant employers. The hon. Member spoke about the way in which disputations arise between the Teamsters and the Union of Automobile Workers in the United States. Fair enough. It may well be easy, but it is quite unrealistic, to shut our eyes to the


fact that inter-union recognition disputes are an alternative and important cause of trouble in this country as well.</p>

<p>I am following the argument which the Solicitor-General is making, but he should acknowledge that, whilst the trade unions do not want to take industrial action on recognition, they have never asked for the law to be brought in to enable them to achieve recognition. They have asked for better agreements and for employers to have a better understanding. We have eleven million trade unionists in this country, without the law, and we do not need it now.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman says that trade unions have never asked for the law to be brought in in this way. I do not want to weary the House with examples, but in a number of cases which have been heard before the existing Industrial Court unions have sought, understandably and rightly, to require employers&#x2014;who are not conforming to an industry-wide agreement because the industry-wide agreement provides for recognition&#x2014;to recognise them. The existing machinery of the Industrial Court does not provide for it. Unions have struggled&#x2014;I know, I have seen them&#x2014;to use the 1959 Act procedure as a means of securing recognition. They have not adequate means of securing recognition, hence they refer the matter to the Industrial Court. It is for that reason we are introducing&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the situation in the United States of America and I pointed to the rivalry which exists between certain unions there. Nobody would deny that even here there are arguments between unions which at the moment are overwhelmingly dealt with by the Trades Union Congress disputes machinery, which solves those problems within the context of the trade union movement. But what the Government proposes to do is to take this outside the trade union machinery, and the establishment of sole bargaining agents would

lead to and develop rivalry between unions where in the past such rivalry has not existed. In fact, in the United States rivalry between unions has developed on a much greater scale because of the type of legislation which the hon. and learned Gentleman is proposing.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has made those points in his own contribution and I will deal with them. The important point is that this machinery does not drive people away, any more than does the machinery in new Clause 15, from making use of the existing important voluntary T.U.C. interunion disputes machinery. To take an example from the other side of the Atlantic, one of the provisions in the original 1947 Taft-Hartley legislation was designed to prevent demarcation disputes. One of the first things that happened when that legislation first came on to the Statute Book was a substantial number of applications before the National Labour Relations Board for the resolution of those demarcation disputes.<br/>
One of the consequences that followed the existence of the statutory machinery was the establishment of a new body covering specifically the construction industry. This body was representative on a voluntary basis of both sides. It was spurred on by the existence of the statutory machinery and voluntarily resolved dispute after dispute. This is the way in which we visualise the law providing a safety valve machinery in situations such as the hon. Gentleman acknowledges are without remedy at the moment, but in no sense obstructing the actions of existing voluntary bodies.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman interrupts from a sitting position and I do not want to raise the temperature of the debate. To answer his point, it is no use saying on the one hand, "We have already done it" and on the other hand asserting that there is here a situation in which people resort to strike action and society ought to provide an alternative machinery.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman should get this matter clear. It arises from the fact that he does not know what has already happened. In the construction industry the trade unions


have already established machinery for dealing with demarcation disputes. This has already been done on a voluntary basis without the law being introduced. Furthermore, this has been done, apart from the T.U.C. Bridlington agreement, in regard to inter-union rivalry, poaching and so on.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.335.0" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="335" time="">
<p>I acknowledged that much is being done, but the fact remains that disputes of this kind are far from unique or unknown in our society. If one looks at the original provisions of "In Place of Strife", it rightly said that the right of a union to secure recognition from a recalcitrant employer was recognised; but the Report stated in paragraph 60:
<q>Questions of conflict for recognition between rival unions present greater difficulties &#x2026; disputes over recognition between powerful unions can cause widespread disruption and, unless peaceful methods of finding a solution can be evolved, such disputes will be settled on the basis of which union or group of unions can do, or threaten to do, the greatest damage to the economy. The Government believes that this is intolerable in a modern society. &#x2026;</q>
We believe it to be equally intolerable for a recalcitrant employer to decline recognition to a union which is strongly supported and for unions to fight it out in this way. We believe it understandable that that kind of strike arises and persists so long as society fails to provide an alternative remedy. That is what we are suggesting.<br/>
To come back to the closing part of this paragraph in the document "In Place of Strife", it reads, at the end:
<q>The employer would then be liable to a financial penalty if he refused to recognise the union or unions which the C.I.R. recommended should be recognised, or recognised one against which it had recommended.</q>
That is the second part of the package.<br/>
<q>A union which used coercive action to obstruct the implementation of the C.I.R.'s recommendations would also be liable to a financial penalty.</q>
The right hon. Lady and her right hon. Friends are entitled to say that they have changed their minds. Indeed, some hon. Members opposite are entitled to say, "We have never agreed with our right hon. Friend anyway." But we are entitled to say that in this paragraph a sensible diagnosis was being made and that it is consistent with the duty of the present Government to follow that diag-

nosis and to produce the solutions we have here. It is unrealistic for hon. Members to say&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

<p>Leaving aside the argument whether my hon. Friends ever agreed with the policy or whether we have changed our minds, will the hon. and learned Gentleman not admit that an integral part of "In Place of Strife" was that the T.U.C. was to have a statutory right for a reasonable period in which to solve the problem first? In other words, there was to be built into the statutory provisions the recognition that the T.U.C. was the ideal body to settle these matters and that the law ought to provide for that.</p>

<p>The machinery proposed in the Bill does no such thing. There is nothing in any of the provisions to stop the T.U.C. and every responsible trade unionist, as they see this Bill marching its way to the Statute Book, or indeed, arriving on the Statute Book, saying, "We do not regard the intervention of the law as necessary on this matter; we will ensure that our own machinery will resolve these matters."</p>

<p>This is a vital point and I should like to come back upon it. It is one thing to say, "Let the T.U.C. strengthen its machinery and then nobody will want to use the law." It is a different thing to say that nobody shall be allowed to use the law until the T.U.C. has first by law been given the right to deal with it. The hon. and learned Gentleman is quite wrong to say that is compatible with his provisions which, after these Clauses are passed, will give the right to one or more trade union or an employer, or the Secretary of State, to make application and set the machinery in motion regardless of what the T.U.C. is doing.</p>

<p>I fully accept the right hon. Lady's point. It is an entirely different thing to say that nobody may invoke the machinery unless and until the T.U.C. has intervened. But that is to exclude from access to this important new procedure society as a whole, represented by the Secretary of


State, and employers and individuals who are being grievously damaged. I do not believe, if we wish to encourage voluntary action by the T.U.C., that it is right to give that body or any other a right of veto over the sensible procedures set out in these provisions.</p>

<p>The right hon. Lady seeks to gain too much from my answer on that point. I have gone on wearily but accurately drawing attention to the similarities between proposals and those put forward by the right hon. Lady. The fact that the right hon. Lady has moved away from her original prescription is something inescapably and indelibly imprinted on the minds of the Committee, as on the mind of the country; and there will be no getting away from that.<br/>
Coming now to the general argument advanced by the hon. Member he says that all things are to be solved entirely by the voluntary procedure. Some days have been devoted to a discussion of the monstrosity of imposing upon anyone an agreement to which he may not be a party. I invite the Committee to look for a moment in that context on the assertion of hon. and right hon. Members on the other side who rely on voluntarism, at paragraph (4) of New Clause 15, where we come to the heart of the voluntary alternative put forward by those who assert the freedom of contract as a principle to stand above everything else.<br/>
It provides that after a recommendation has been made:
<q>&#x2026; the Secretary of State may, if he thinks fit, order the employer or employers to whom the request was made to recognise the trade union or trade unions to the extent specified in the Order &#x2026;".</q>
That is in the heartland of voluntarism. The Secretary of State, if he thinks fit, can order an employer to recognise. We recognise the need for comparable remedies and provide them through the machinery here. But right hon. Members

opposite cannot stand with the white sheet of voluntarism around their shoulders and invite the country to ignore what is underneath. The next sentence reads:
<q>and where such an Order has been made by the Secretary of State the recognition prescribed in the Order shall be an implied term of every contract of employment between the employer or employers and &#x2026; any employee for whose benefit that recognition is intended.</q>
Here we have the employees on whose behalf recognition has been sought. They may be reluctant or unwilling members of a union unable, on the case put forward by the Labour Party, to escape membership of that union. But those employees, with the employers, are to have imposed upon them by order of the Secretary of State an agreement by which both are bound, and which becomes part of the terms and conditions of employment. It is an alternative remedy for pursing the legislative objective; but I say to hon. Members opposite that to put forward that remedy, to say that there is no place for our prescription to resolve a difficult situation and to say that they are still holding the banner of voluntarism: that, with respect, is nonsense.<br/>
I will deal shortly with a number of specific points put forward by the hon. Members for Walton and Kensington, North (Mr. Douglas-Mann). Clause 148 makes it perfectly plain that a union that is not independent cannot make use of the statutory procedure for securing enforced recognition, because a union has to be free from employer domination to make use of such procedure.</p>

<p>It certainly can be referred. This is crucial. An employer can still refer a union which is not independent to this body which could be used as a delaying tactic. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, it was used in the United States over a considerable period of years.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.338.3" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="338" time="">
<p>It is true that an employer could refer an issue of recognition for an organisation that is not a registered union. Candidly, the proposal was not designed in any sense to achieve that, but to recognise that in many industrial situations there could be organisations at work on the ground, at the grass roots, whose case deserved to be looked


at even though they might not have achieved registration. But if hon. Members opposite are saying that the C.I.R. is likely to recommend recognition through this machinery of a house union, it is important to remember that the Commission in paragraph 33 of its First General Report stressed the importance of granting recognition to a union
<q>that truly represents the interests of the employees".</q>
It goes on to say,
<q>the union should be effectively independent of management and able to give the strength of organisational backing to the representatives who deal with management".</q>
It is clear that the legislation is intended to militate against the recognition of house unions. It is also clear that if what is known as a "sweetheart deal" were to be arrived at, a cosy get together between an employer and a house union, Clause 48 provides for the possibility of withdrawal of recognition from that house union. It provides a minority of employees with the opportunity to achieve this. It strikes me as a little inconsistent &#x2014;although I understand each of the arguments separately&#x2014;for the hon. Member for Kensington, North to say that we are in danger of excluding the aggressive unions which should be representing people rather than the house union, when in days past it was said that we were providing a Toughs' Charter whereby militant aggressive characters would disturb responsible unions which had been recognised. Not both arguments can be valid.</p>

<p>One can have both situations in different circumstances. Surely the hon. and learned Gentleman can accept that. A provision which could inhibit a house union being appointed certainly would not prevent from being appointed a union which has been "sweetened" by a provision for its own members.</p>
</speech>

<p>But certainly it can then be challenged. I suggest that Clause 48 provides a way of doing so. Certainly this part of the Bill is not intended to be, nor is it likely to be, a foundation for the over-easy recognition of house unions in that kind of way.<br/>
I return to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. David Mitchell). He argued that there

are employers from whom a union will want to claim recognition and that they ought to have simple machinery to that end. That is certainly something, as several hon. Members have said, for which we proposed machinery in "Fair Deal at Work", so that a union seeking recognition should be able to achieve it.<br/>
I do not want to trespass further than my hon. Friends would allow beyond the Rules of Order, but, when we come to it, perhaps I can explain how Clause 42 will provide a way in which a union could achieve that. But my hon. Friend makes a point of some force when he says that it should be possible to devise a way whereby a union simply seeking recognition as a single union against a single employer could perhaps get the right to a ballot more easily. But one still has here the residual questions, in respect of which employees is the union to claim that right, among which employees is a ballot to be held? There is always likely to be a question whether a ballot is to include the maintenance as well as the service staff, for example. But certainly we sympathise with his approach and are always willing to make sure that we have done all that we can to see whether we have achieved it.<br/>
On that point, may I close by pointing out that we have here new machinery that is put forward to solve, we believe in the best way, a variety of problems which those on both sides of the Committee will recognise exist in this country. It is on that basis that I commend it to the Committee. It is designed to remove the causes of strife between unions, and between a union and an employer in the recognition situation, and I suggest that it deserves the support of the Committee.</p>

<p>I return to the point with which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has just been dealing, when he quoted from paragraph 60 of "In Place of Strife", dealing with demarcation disputes. May I put it to him that he was talking about disputes which arise between unions having demarcation problems arising out of the nature of the work they carry out. I ask him, what has this to do with the appointment of a sole negotiating agent in this context of Clause 42?<br/>
Does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that it is not demarcation disputes


between unions with which we shall be dealing, but something quite different? I think it is fair to say that as a result of the work of the T.U.C. and its disputes committee demarcation disputes no longer arise. I should like any hon. Gentleman to give me recent examples of disputes similar to those which used to occur in the shipbuilding industry, the construction industry and the engineering industry. Where are the demarcation disputes about which the right hon. Gentleman was talking taking place?<br/>
What about the disputes that will arise because of the sole bargaining agent? What the right hon. Gentleman is aiming to achieve by this and subsequent Clauses is one bargaining agent within one plant. My hon. Friend raised the issue of there being a 60-to-40 proportion between two unions. Hon. Gentlemen opposite have strong feelings about professional organisations being trapped by these Clauses. Let us consider the situation which would arise if the A.S.T.M.S. and the A.U.E.F.W. were in one plant, and the question at issue was which union should be the sole bargaining unit. The Solicitor-General owes it to the Committee to explain what paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>c</i>) mean.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman talked about a sole bargaining agent, but the Clause talks about joint negotiating rights within a plant while there is still a sole bargaining agent. Will the Solicitor-General explain this now, or does he propose to wait until we get to some of the later Clauses to tell us how this will work? Will a works committee be an appropriate body to be the sole negotiating agent within a plant where there are a number of unions representing different trades? Who will negotiate for the foundry shop, or the machine shop? Different unions could be involved. Will the works committee be a valid negotiating unit, and the sole negotiating unit, or will attempts be made to try to create a one-union situation in the plant?<br/>
If there is industrial trouble now, goodness knows what will happen if we try to remove established trade unions of many years' standing, unions which go back to the beginning of the industrial history of this country. It just cannot be done. If the right hon. Gentleman thinks that he can wipe out these unions, I remind him of the difficulties created in the United States when the sole bar-

gaining agent and the agency shop were created. American unions are based on more industrial lines than those in Britain, and no not have the historical background of the British trade union movement. There was tremendous difficulty when the change to which I have referred was brought in, and the Solicitor-General was less than honest when he talked about the 1947 Taft Hartley Act assisting in that situation.<br/>
The Solictor-General did not tell the Committee that after the system had been operating for some time, and it looked as though it was coming down in favour of the militant unions, amendments were moved and approved in Congress to remove the advantages which the militant unions were gaining. Nor did the Solicitor-General give us the case histories of the number of employers in the United States who took steps to clog the machinery and stop the recognition of established unions.<br/>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. David Mitchell) talked about unions being quickly and easily able to establish recognition, without having to go through all this machinery. On top of the agency shop, this provision will make workshop organisation and negotiation a legal nightmare. I do not think the Secretary of State appreciates what the duplication of these different provisions will mean, with a 20 per cent. vote applicable in one instance, 51 per cent. in another, a two-thirds vote in another, and a majority being necessary in yet another, without stating what the majority ought to be. All this is stipulated in the Bill time and again and I suggest to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that this will create an absolute morass of problems, which will not easily be resolved.<br/>
I come now to discuss the Bridlington Agreement. When the right hon. Gentleman was in opposition we used to hear him talking about wanting stronger unions, fewer unions and proper agreements. The Bill and these proposals are running counter to those ideas, because the T.U.C.'s standing will be destroyed if this Measure goes through. The Bridlington Agreement will not be worth the paper that it is written on. How can the T.U.C. come in to mediate and use its good offices in an industry about which it knows something when it will have


High Court judges handing down judgments, with the power of legal enforceability to the unions concerned? With the best will in the world the T.U.C. will not be able to operate the Bridlington Agreement, and I think that this provision will make nonsense of the whole situation.</p>

<p>Is it not correct that under the Bill it will be possible for unions to make a binding agreement between themselves about how they will resolve demarcation disputes?</p>

<p>They are now making binding agreements which do not need legal underwriting. I ask hon. Gentlemen opposite to give me instances of current demarcation disputes which are wrecking British industry. All that I am asking for are examples of such disputes. The answer is that they cannot give them, for the simple reason that the number of these disputes has been reduced, because the T.U.C. has operated efficiently, and because amalgamations have taken place in certain shipbuilding and attendant industries. Such disputes no longer arise, because trade unionists in Barrow, Glasgow and elsewhere have become convinced of the wastefulness of such strikes. The difficulties have been removed by the unions under their own constitutions, and under the guidance of the T.U.C., which has handed down decisions to the unions. These decisions have not always been popular, and the unions have not always accepted them in the form in which they have been handed down, but, because of their loyalty they have, in the final analysis, carried them out. Trade unionists understand the problem, and it goes to show that trade unions can deal with demarcation problems.<br/>
The Clause has nothing to do with demarcation problems. It has to do with conflicts arising out of implementation of the Clause and its attendant Clauses. We shall come to some of the details later, but it is a bit odd that here again we have stuck in at the beginning of an important part of the Bill what is meant to be a definition Clause. It has nothing to do with the legal aspects of Clauses 42 to 49, and we have had no definition from the Government of what is meant. They have not defined paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and

(<i>c).</i> They have not explained the principles, or tried to see how the principles set out in the Clause will work. What we get in subsequent Clauses is how the law will be applied, and how it will be imposed. We have not had the overall picture. The Solicitor-General tried to make some point about new Clause 15. The policies and alternatives which we on this side have advocated in opposing the Bill are based on a voluntary system. I hope that on subsequent Clauses we shall be able to show the Secretary of State just how impossible these Clauses are and how heavily weighted they are against trade unions.</p>

<p>The Government Front Bench rarely gives us practical examples. In view of Britain's long history of industrial relations I should have thought that the Government could use practical examples to illustrate how the Bill will work.<br/>
I wish to refer to a practical example in my endeavour to find out how the Bill will operate. In the dustmen's strike last October the national negotiating procedure began to crumble after a while. When the joint body negotiating on behalf of all municipal employers was holding out for granting an increase of only 35s., the Labour-controlled Sheffield City Council, off its own bat, met the demand of 55s. in full.<br/>
This action was bitterly criticised by the Conservatives on the council, who said that as employers the Sheffield City Council was breaking the agreement that the other employers were sticking to, that the negotiations should be national, and that the Sheffield City Council had no right to become the sole bargaining unit at a local level. The Conservative councillors said that the matter should be reported and that Sheffield councillors were liable to be surcharged. Legal advice was taken.<br/>
Many Labour councils refrained from making separate settlements with their employees and getting the men back to work because they were advised by their town clerks or other officers that the councillors would be liable to surcharge. Many councils wished to settle on a local basis rather than wait for the mass of local authorities to move to get the dustbins emptied.


In a case such as that a local opposition could have a field day by making use of the Clause. It could be said, "We as Conservative councillors in a minority are also part of the bargaining unit. We as Conservative councillors have some rights, because we are members of the council. We as a minority opposition are part of the bargaining unit". They could apply to the Court, because in effect there would be a split in the employers' front. One part of the council could say, "We do not agree; and we, as a minority group on the council, have negotiating rights". They could try to stop the majority party on the council from paying the increase. They could take the matter to the Industrial Court, because the law is not clear.<br/>
We shall get into an impossible position if local politics are allowed to bedevil a pay claim. Local councils form together the biggest employers in the country. They make I.C.I. look like chicken feed as regards the number of people they employ, the number of rises negotiated, the number of joint negotiating panels, and so on.<br/>
Once it is possible for the law to step in to settle any disputes, it immediately becomes tempting for local minority groups to throw a spanner in the works; on the one side it could be politicians and on the other it could be local unions trying to take part in negotiations.<br/>
As an example, the ambulance men are trying to establish their own union. In some areas local ambulance men have said, "We demand sole negotiating rights. We are no longer interested in belonging to the Confederation of Health Service Employees". So a dispute could be created by means of this tactic.<br/>
I hope that when he replies the Secretary of State will give us examples of how the Bill would have applied in the local authority dispute, which was conducted under existing procedures. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that once the law is invoked in these matters any small point of dispute could cause havoc.</p>

<p>The Bill has been left behind by the course of events. On an earlier Clause I argued that, although hon. Members opposite never tire of talking about how the Labour Government ran away from their own legislation at Downing Street one

morning, the Labour Government made an enormous advance in the sense that the trade unions&#x2014;the constituent members of the T.U.C.&#x2014;for the first time gave the General Council remarkable sovereign powers over the constituent bodies.<br/>
I, too, remember the demarcation dispute which caused my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) to include a provision about demarcation in her projected legislation. At that time there were fears of a dispute in the steel industry because of the differences between A.S.S.E.T. and B.I.S.A.K.T.A. While Clive Jenkins and Mr. Dai Davies were making all kinds of pugilistic noises, the Labour Government were concerned about what could have become a very crippling strike. We therefore decided that it would be advisable for us to do what we could to influence the trade unions to accept a decision from the General Council of the T.U.C.<br/>
The T.U.C. intervened and made a decision which was not popular with everybody. In such a situation its decision could not be popular with everybody. However, the T.U.C. made a decision which was acceptable to both unions and a dispute in the steel industry was avoided. Since then there has been no demarcation dispute in the steel industry or anywhere else to my knowledge. The unions have given the T.U.C. powers to intervene in such disputes, powers which are far and away more effective than anything that can appear in the Bill.<br/>
As the Committee knows, I differ in some ways from many of my hon. Friends on the question of legislation. However, I do not believe that in the matter covered by the Clause legislation can ever do anything. To use a word well known in the North, nous is the dominating factor in this matter. It is tempting for the biggest single union to demand sole bargaining rights. If the criterion is to be that there should be a sole bargaining unit, one can visualise a whole area of disputes resulting from the acceptance of that one union. At one time I was the convener of the biggest single union in a great plant. If I had tried to run that plant purely on the basis of the A.E.U. I would have had disputes every day. It is in this connection that the works committee procedure must obtain


and we must ensure that there is proper and adequate representation of the shop stewards of every union. They may not be able to justify a place on the works committee, but when matters of vital importance to their union are discussed they should be brought into the deliberations of the works committee subcommittee.<br/>
Huge plants can be brought to a standstill by 20 or 30 men. How can we possibly determine sole bargaining agencies purely on the basis of numbers? The Secretary of State knows as well as I do that if 30 fitters among many thousands of people on the assembly line of a car factory or aircraft factory decided that they had a grievance and stopped work the assembly line would come to a halt within hours. I do not say whether I am happy about that situation or not. All that I am pointing out is that it is a fact. Suppose that those 30 people are members of one trade union which has not been given recognition in the sense of being a bargaining agent. How can we expect them to forget their problems merely because their union is not the bargaining agency, although if they insist upon that which they feel is necessary in their conditions of employment they know that the whole factory will be brought to a stop?<br/>
I have had some experience in these matters and I do not pretend to be unusual in that respect, but I could run a coach and horses through Clause 41 at any time if I were the shop steward of a union which had not been given bargaining rights.<br/>
In many great factories there are two works committees&#x2014;one for the manual workers and one for the staffs. Which will be accepted as the sole bargaining agent? The right hon. Gentleman will agree that the agreements of the staff unions can be completely different from the agreements of the manual unions. Is it to be said, "We are very sorry, but until a new arrangement has been made to bring the two committees together, and until they unify their procedures and the staff unions make the same agreements as the manual unions, or <i>vice versa,</i> one of them will not be able to function as a bargaining agent"?<br/>
I can think of no way of making Clause 41 effective. I can see many ways

in which attempts to apply it are bound to cause disruption in factories where there is no disruption at present. The Clause is another illustration that the Bill is bound to create much more disagreement, although I give the Government credit for their attempts to eliminate areas of disagreement. No hon. Member can argue that there is now need for legislation to deal with demarcation disputes. The Bill is silly and stupid and is more likely to cause demarcation disputes than cure them.<br/>
My hon. Friends have won the arguments to which I have listened. The Secretary of State has not made any concessions. We have had no indication from him that, because of the arguments which have been deployed, to which neither he nor the Solicitor-General has given an adequate answer, he will be willing to consider the matter again. On the question of demarcation, the Secretary of State is barking up the wrong tree. The provisions of Clause 41 cannot be made operative in any industry of which I know and they are far more likely to cause trouble than prevent it.<br/>
I therefore suggest that the Secretary of State tells us that he is willing to look at the Clause again and to try to incorporate some of the suggestions made by the Opposition and bring forward suitable Amendments on Report.</p>

<p>I intervene briefly to make four points.<br/>
First, I agree with the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) that this is a complicated Bill. The most misleading of the many misleading statements in the T.U.C. national advertising campaign was the assertion that it is easy to stop strikes. I do not believe that there is anything easy about it, and therefore this is a complicated Bill. I hope that when the Bill becomes law the Government will ensure that simple booklets and pamphlets are available on factory shop floors for those involved in the day-to-day running of industrial relations. I realise that that cannot be done while the Bill is still a Bill, but I believe that it will be absolutely essential once it is on the Statute Book.<br/>
Secondly, the new Clause and the Government's general provisions demonstrate a clear division between the two


sides of the Committee. On the one side there is the Government's proposal that the law should set the framework for industrial relations, and, on the other side, there is the view that the Secretary of State should be involved in making orders. This is indicative of two completely different attitudes.<br/>
Thirdly, I do not think democracy has very much to do with the matter. During the debate on "In Place of Strife" the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) declaimed about parliamentary democracy. She said:
<q>Parliamentary democracy would be empty and meaningless unless it were underpinned by democratic institutions in the industrial field &#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 3rd March, 1969; Vol. 779, c. 43.]</q>
Under the Government's proposals there could be no order of the court in a recognition dispute unless there had been a ballot of the work people. Under new Clause 15 there could be, and the Secretary of State could make an order even if there had not been a ballot of the work people. I leave it to the Committee to judge which is the more democratic approach.<br/>
Fourthly, the right hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Frederick Lee) said that we do not need legislation for demarcation disputes. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) referred to the ambulance drivers dispute. Who is to say that industrial action might not flow from that dispute? Who, looking at the aggressive development&#x2014;I do not complain about it&#x2014;of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs and its possible future growth can say that it will not lead to recognition disputes and probably industrial action?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is confusing a demarcation dispute with a recognition dispute. The ambulance men do not dispute who is to drive the ambulance. They are simply disputing which union shall represent them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.349.1" hansard_membership_id="11862" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30579" speakername="Mr. Scott" colnum="349" time="">
<p>There may well be recognition disputes about A.S.T.M.S. As that union widens its scope it will come into dispute with other unions, which may lead to industrial action. It is right that there should be provision in the law for resolving such disputes.<br/>
In "In Place of Strife" the two problems of the recalcitrant employer and com-

petition between two unions were recognised as equal problems which had to be solved by legislation. New Clause No. 15 says that only one problem&#x2014;that of the recalcitrant employer&#x2014;needs to be dealt with. It is for the Committee to decide whether that switch in emphasis from "In Place of Strife" to new Clause 15 is in the interests of good, orderly industrial relations or whether it is in the interests of unity within the Parliamentary Labour Party.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General and the hon. Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott) have confused the whole issue of the Bridlington Agreement. They have confused three separate matters&#x2014;the demarcation dispute, the recognition dispute and the inter-union rivalry dispute for the recruitment of members.<br/>
As my hon. Friends have indicated&#x2014;and no one has yet challenged us&#x2014;there has been no major demarcation dispute in this country for a long time. On recognition by recalcitrant employers, there has rarely been any need generally for a union to seek the aid of the State for recognition in this sphere. On the question of poaching between unions, the Bridlington Agreement, the T.U.C.'s example of what happened with N.A.S.D.U. has been a strong and effective weapon agreed voluntarily between the unions to prevent that sort of dispute arising.<br/>
The hon. Member for Paddington, South said that we could not explain the Bill to people on the shop floor because it is not yet passed. But we are to have some little booklets, and then they will understand what a Bill of 139 pages, with 150 Clauses and eight Schedules is all about. The booklets will explain to the lads on the shop floor what irregular industrial action is. We are to say, "Do not stop the job for a minute. Let is go through, and when you have finished you can have the dispute, and you have not broken the law on this occasion." That is the sort of situation which will be created.<br/>
We shall hedge around the people who administer the aspirin on the shop floor to prevent major surgery later, if the type of proposal which the hon. Member for Paddington, South has been discussing comes into operation. It will make


shop stewards or union officials so hedged around by legislation that they will take no action for the benefit of their members because they are afraid of the consequences, until we have a whole lot of precedents to enable them to know what they can or cannot do. They may say, "To hell with all that. This is what I want to see happen, and this is what I am going to do." That will bring the whole fabric of law into disrepute, which will be bad for society as a whole. That is why we are against the Bill and the definition which exists here.<br/>
In his opening speech my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) suggested that we reject the Clause. He mentioned the important statement made by the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, in the other place on the situation with regard to professional organisations or unions, call them what one will.<br/>
What will a bargaining unit mean? If a certain group of people, because of the concession made, are to be omitted, are we saying that we now have two standards of law, one for people with a professional qualification, with letters after their name and perhaps a university degree, and one for people who belong to a manual union or a skilled union, who do not have the same sort of professional qualifications although their organisations in essence, are no different from the A.E.F. or T.G.W.U.? These people have as much pride as professionals&#x2014;those who regard themselves as professional workers.<br/>
Those who listened to the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) and Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell), who spoke about loyalty, devotion and professionalism within their own trade union, and what holding their union card meant to them, could not fail to see that the unions have just as much right to recognition and acceptance as has any other professional organisation. Therefore, we are entitled to ask the Secretary of State to give far more information about what he means by a register for professional organisations.<br/>
Paragraph (<i>c</i>) of this Clause states:
<q>'sole bargaining agent' in relation to a bargaining unit, means the organisation of workers&#x2026;</q>

This is another anomaly created in the Bill. We are told that it means "an organisation of workers." But if one turns to the definition Clause, one is referred back from that to Clause 57, where one has the whole string of definitions of organisations of workers which may or may not be a trade union for the purposes of the Bill. If it is not a trade union, as defined by the Bill, then none of the safeguards for a registered trade union which are contained in the Bill applies to an organisation of workers which has failed to register, or which, once having had its name put upon the provisional register, does not allow any sort of claim to go forward on its behalf, and therefore lapses.<br/>
We shall be in a situation in which we could have recognised as the sole bargaining agent an organisation of workers negotiating on behalf of its membership who will, if they take the limited right to strike action, which they have under the Bill, lose all the protection given to a registered trade union&#x2014;which is not much. They will lose all that, but they will be recognised as sole bargaining agents under the provision of the Clause.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. We should have more explanation from the Secretary of State on exactly what he means in terms of professional associations and the concessions he has made, and in terms of organisations of workers and the effects of this definition. Perhaps we may also have a recognition and realisation from the Conservative Party of the work which has been done by the T.U.C. under the Bridlington Agreement.<br/>
Under the provisions of the Bill, if we had a new organisation of workers which was not a member of the T.U.C. but recognised under the Act as a trade union, and it wanted to behave like a rogue elephant throughout industry, it could create chaos unimagined in the House. We cannot have it.</p>

<p>Listening to the Debate for the number of days which I have, it has become rather frightening to realise that this legislation has been prepared by well meaning people who unfortunately base their experience, I imagine, entirely upon matters such as letters to the Press about trade unionists and their activities and on an out-dated notion of what trade unions'


difficulties are at present. For example, we have been discussing two quite different aspects of trade unionism today: demarcation disputes and organisation disputes.<br/>
For a long time I worked in a shipyard. As hon. Members know, for many years our shipyards were a hot-bed of demarcation disputes. That was only to be expected when one remembers that there were at least 39 unions in the Confederation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Unions at one time.<br/>
One must appreciate the reason behind demarcation disputes. In a minor capacity, I have been called upon from time to time to judge which side in a demarcation dispute was right, and nothing educates one more than to listen to the two sides of such a case.<br/>
In our shipyards, the chief reason behind many demarcation disputes was the simple fact of progress. After the last war, the techniques of building ships changed very rapidly. When I first started in the industry in 1944, a large part of the work was carried out by riveters. By the time that I had finished my apprenticeship, welders had come into the industry in greater numbers and taken over the work previously done by riveters, caulkers and others in the "black squad". Many men had served five-year apprenticeships, and they felt that their trades were slipping away from them. Anyone can appreciate the feelings of a man who realises that his training will be of no use to him in the future, and it is not surprising that he fights hard to retain as much work for his own trade as he can. Any tradesman or professional man would do the same.<br/>
We in the trade union movement made it clear to men in this position that retraining programmes were available and that there would be no attempt to put them out of work and on the scrap heap at an early age. I do not believe that any law could have done what was achieved over the years by argument and persuasion. Laws do not remove from the minds and hearts of men the fear that what they produce and sell to keep themselves in a living is no longer required.<br/>
That was the reason behind many past demarcation disputes. In the shipyard of which I am most intimately knowledgeable, there has not been a demarcation dispute for seven years,

since 1964, and there is no indication that there will be any in the future. That situation has been brought about by the trade union movement. Therefore, there is no necessity now to introduce legislation which is designed to help prevent demarcation disputes.<br/>
When we come to look at disputes about which unions will organise certain groups of workers, we are concerned with a problem which is present today, particularly among those known as "white collar" workers, of whom my own union, the Draughtsmen and Allied Technicians' Association, organises quite a number.<br/>
I will not attempt to deny that my union has been in dispute with certain other unions. Trade unions are in a fairly competitive world, and the possible areas for the expansion of their activities lie among the ever-increasing numbers of technical workers in industry. Behind that simple fact is the reason for a number of moves towards amalgamation between my union and the A.U.E.F.W. since the A.U.E.F.W. recognises the recruitment possibilities in the future among these workers.<br/>
Inevitably, there will be disputes among unions about which of them is entitled to organise various groups of workers. But, just as the trade union movement solved the problem of demarcation disputes, so it has the capability of eradicating this second type of dispute in the long run.<br/>
If anything, the chances of the T.U.C. doing this have been greatly strengthened by the fact that it has been able to assume more power than it had before as a result of the proposition of the Labour Party some time ago concerning legislation for the trade union movement. The T.U.C. and the trade union movement took a gigantic step forward as a result of the pressure put upon them by the Labour Party, and they have now got the powers which will enable them to solve any dispute about organisation without the necessity of the law intervening, which in my opinion would have been as ineffective there as it would be in settling demarcation disputes.</p>

<p>My hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General dealt adequately and well with the general principles of the Clause, and I will not repeat


what he said. I shall deal mainly with the points which have been raised since he made his intervention.<br/>
However, before doing that I should remind the Committee that here we are dealing with machinery of last and not first resort. We are not putting forward machinery to supplant all the voluntary machinery which operates, should operate and will be encouraged to operate in the future. We are providing a net to catch those cases which prove so stubborn and difficult that the voluntary machinery fails. They are not many but, when failures occur, usually they are very serious and very complicated. Perhaps it is not altogether surprising that complicated machinery is required to deal with them.<br/>
We want to make sure that the machinery of last resort is constitutional rather than strike machinery. Both sides of the Committee agree that in the 1970s and onwards we ought to make available to the parties machinery for resolving disputes about recognition and bargaining rights, rather than, when all normal negotiating and voluntary procedures fail, leaving matters to be fought out by the crude weapon of strike action. That is in the interests of the community at large and of the unions and workers concerned.<br/>
However, it is only a last resort and an alternative to strike action. It is undeniable that some of these cases exist. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) said that there were none of these cases nowadays and that no one can remember a great recognition dispute which had caused trouble in recent years. However, the dispute of the white collar workers in the steel industry was very troublesome for a long time. There was the Johnson Matthey case, where the A.U.E.F.W. and A.S.T.M.S. were in dispute. There was the ambulance drivers' dispute&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, I agree. Associated Octel was another case recently. In all of the four cases that I have quoted, A.S.T.M.S. has been involved. That is

no criticism of A.S.T.M.S., but it reinforces the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott) that in this new expansionary drive of trade unionism among white collar workers, where there is room for expansion and where it will undoubtedly take place, there is the likelihood of more union clashes and conflicts in the future than there have been in the recent past. Therefore, it is all the more necessary to have some machinery available, not to take the place of the T.U.C. and all the voluntary machinery that we have, but to provide a means of catching up with the minority cases which the normal voluntary processes have failed to solve.</p>

<p>I think that the right hon. Gentleman made a slip of the tongue, because he said "demarcation" when he really meant "recognition".<br/>
I do not deny that there is competition. The machinery within the T.U.C., by virtue of the Bridlington Agreement, is being used effectively. It was this machinery which settled the steel dispute, not the Pearson Inquiry or anything else.</p>

<p>I agree. This machinery should operate. We must also remember that not all unions, including well-established unions which hon. Members opposite regard as highly respectable, are affiliated to the T.U.C. There are some areas where, for various reasons, some unions are not affiliated to the T.U.C.</p>

<p>Not many, but some. So there must be some machinery for those cases.<br/>
There are also cases of employers who are not, either directly or indirectly through some subsidiary association, members of the C.B.I. Therefore, we cannot depend entirely on machinery which can only be operated when the T.U.C. and the C.B.I. are involved, because on both sides of industry there are employers and unions&#x2014;they may be a minority, but they are there&#x2014;who are not affiliated to the T.U.C. or the C.B.I.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman mentioned, in connection with recognition as opposed to demarcation disputes, Johnson Matthey in which the A.U.E.F.W. and the A.S.T.M.S. were


involved. That is quite right. But there are so few of these cases that the exception is proving the rule. There is bound to be conflict. However, we say that such conflicts will not be resolved by this complicated legal structure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.357.0" hansard_membership_id="2146" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11649" speakername="Mr. Carr" colnum="357" time="">
<p>We believe that there must be machinery to pick up the minority of cases which fail to be resolved. It is quite wrong to suggest that the machinery which we propose will in any way prevent the T.U.C. continuing to operate the Bridlington Agreement. Unions will continue to be free to operate agreements limiting their freedom to recruit each other's members. I hope that they will continue doing so. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent them.<br/>
Clause 43, to which I may refer only briefly in passing, provides that a recognition dispute is not to be referred or dealt with by the C.I.R. until the parties have endeavoured to settle it themselves. Therefore, the C.I.R. cannot come barging in. This machinery cannot interfere. The Bill specifically provides that the machinery cannot be brought in until the parties have endeavoured to settle the dispute themselves.<br/>
I underline again that we are not in any way replacing what is already there. Our proposal is the net to catch the few cases which fall through the normal procedure, which, almost by definition, are likely to be of a particularly difficult and stubborn nature. Therefore, we need this machinery. I do not believe that that is a matter of dispute between the two sides. The Opposition's case is not that there should be no machinery, but that there should be different machinery &#x2014;hence new Clause 15. The Committee must decide whether the Government's proposed machinery is better than that proposed in new Clause 15.<br/>
I wish to comment briefly on new Clause 15, but only on one or two matters of principle.<br/>
First, new Clause 15 deals only with the recalcitrant employer. It is necessary that there should be machinery for that. But, as the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) recognised in "In Place of Strife", however different her proposal for dealing with it may be, there is also the possibility of the recalcitrant union not being prepared to accept recommendations or to abide by voluntary

agreements. The right hon. Lady will remember that this was one of the difficulties in dealing with the dispute about the white collar workers in the steel industry where a committee of inquiry made certain recommendations which were acceptable to certain people but not to all. So the right hon. Lady had to go back on that and start again.</p>

<p>There is a potential problem in the rare case of the recalcitrant union as well as the rare case of the recalcitrant employer. Therefore, any machinery which we have must deal with both. My first argument for rejecting the machinery of new Clause 15 is that it deals only with the recalcitrant employer; it does not deal also with the recalcitrant union.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.358.3" colnum="358" time="">
<p>Another criticism of the new Clause 15 machinery compared with the machinery which we propose is that it all hinges on the initiative of the Secretary of State. New Clause 15 begins,
<q>Where it appears to the Secretary at State".</q>
For anything to happen at all it has to appear necessary to the Secretary of State to set everything going. We say that it can appear to the Secretary of State and he can start it, but it can also appear to the employer and to the union and they should be able to start it. It is important that the Secretary of State, the union and the employer are each able to start the machinery working in a stubborn case. Therefore, the second reason for inviting the Committee to reject the new Clause 15 alternative is that it leaves the right to start the machinery only in the hands of the Secretary of State.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.358.4" hansard_membership_id="5612" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11612" speakername="Mr. Heffer" colnum="358" time="">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman is leaving out a very important part of new Clause 15, which, quite rightly, says:
<q>Where it appears to the Secretary of State that an employer or group of associated employers has not complied with a request for recognition made by or on behalf of one or more trade unions &#x2026; the Secretary of State may, after complying with subsection (3), refer that request to the Commission".</q>
Subsection (3) says:
<q>Before referring any request to the Commission under this section, the Secretary of State shall give notice of the proposal&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) to the employer &#x2026;</li>


<li>(<i>b</i>) to the General Council and the Confederation".</li>
</ol></q>
In other words, before the Secretary of State gets to the stage of making orders, a long process has to be gone through.</p>

<p>I accept all that. But it is up to the Secretary of State to act or not to act in the end.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Blackburn will no doubt be aware that she had in front of her as I have in front of me, requests, for example, to make references to the C.I.R. in some cases where employers are anxious that we should do it and in other cases where unions are anxious that we should do it. In those cases we have to consult, and all the rest. I do not complain about that. But we believe that if a Minister appears to be rather blind in letting something appear to him, the parties, if they feel strongly, should themselves have the right to activate the machinery. We believe that not only in this area, but in various other areas of the Bill, it is right that the parties, as well as the Secretary of State, should have the right to activate the machinery.<br/>
The third point on which I take issue with new Clause 15 is the false claim which it puts forward that somehow our procedure violates the voluntary principle and that the new Clause supports it. That is nonsense. New Clause 15 in the end depends on an order by the Secretary of State. How is an order by the Secretary of State voluntary? It is not. The Secretary of State in making such an order if this machinery were adopted, would be recognising the unfortunate necessity of dealing with certain cases where, despite all efforts, the voluntary machinery had failed. Such cases are rare and regrettable, but the machinery suggested by the Opposition recognises that they exist and that if in the last resort they cannot be resolved on a voluntary basis they must be resolved by some form of order.</p>

<p>I thought that it was common ground between both sides that, in industrial relations, there are certain rights which are in the I.L.O. conventions and which we think should be in the law of the land. One is the right to belong to a union, another is the right of a union, where it is clearly representa-

tive or is judged to be so, to be recognised and negotiated with by an employer. We accept those as being part of a voluntary system of collective bargaining. But that is very different from having, by law, the choice imposed between different parties where there is a voluntary machinery like the T.U.C. doing that adjudicating between one union and another.</p>

<p>I am saying that, when we reach the end of our process, whether it be the process which I advocate or the process which the right hon. Lady advocates, in the last resort, force&#x2014;I use that word in the limited sense which we understand&#x2014;is involved. The argument between us is whether that compulsion is by the order of the Secretary of State or by order of the Court. In our system, it is by order of the court; under the right hon. Lady's system, it is by order of the Secretary of State.<br/>
I ask the Committee to judge which is more accountable. So far as I know, the sort of orders which the Opposition are putting forward and which the right hon. Lady put forward in her Bill, which was published last April but not debated, are not debatable in this House. Therefore, which gives more satisfaction to the parties? Under our procedure, the order is made by the court, and before the court makes the order, all parties involved can go before the court and state their case, to be taken into account before the court decides whether or not to make the order.<br/>
Which is more democratic? Which gives more right to the parties to have their points of view taken into account&#x2014;the chance to go before the National industrial Relations Court, including not only a judge but two people sophisticated and knowledgeable and experienced in the ways of industry, and to have their case stated, or an order by the Secretary of State which is not even debatable?</p>

<p>We are dealing with the right hon. Gentleman's Bill. How accountable to this House is the court which he is setting up? It is not accountable at all. A High Court judge will hand down judgments to trade unionists when he has no knowledge of the working conditions or anything else.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.360.2" hansard_membership_id="2146" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11649" speakername="Mr. Carr" colnum="360" time="">
<p>It will not be handed down by a High Court judge with no knowledge of working conditions, because the


whole basis of our system involves the establishment of specialised courts which, in addition to a lawyer, shall include two people of industrial sophistication, knowledge or experience. So the judgment will be given only by these people&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Member and others like him refuse to take their opportunity to involve themselves in this sort of decision, it is their fault and no one else's; they had better realise it, as their members will realise it too.<br/>
The idea that nothing is democratic or satisfactory unless it is accountable or arguable in this House is a fiction. This country depends&#x2014;the whole constitution and the whole way of life is based&#x2014;on the concept of freedom under the law. Parliament also criticises the executive, but&#x2014;I repeat&#x2014;the sort of order which the right hon. Lady envisages is not even debatable in the House. If she had her way, all we could do is ask the right hon. Lady a question at Question Time.<br/>
I do not believe that that is in any way equivalent, in the satisfaction of the parties involved, to being able to go before a sophisticated and knowledgeable court to state their respective cases before the Order is made. So for that reason, we reject this machinery.<br/>
In answer to fears expressed by the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) and one or two others who asked, "What will these units be and what will the bargaining agents be?", I would say that both the units and the agents will be on the recommendation of the C.I.R., which is also a highly sophisticated industrial body. It will not come in at all if the parties have agreed among themselves. This is only a reserve power to deal with the cases which fail to be resolved by normal voluntary methods. When they have to be, the unit will be defined by the C.I.R., as will the bargaining agent&#x2014;not by the court or the Secretary of State, but on the recommendation of the C.I.R., supported, or thrown out, by a ballot of all those involved.<br/>
The hon. Member for Salford, West was concerned about what would happen in a multi-union situation, with a number of unions entrenched by long history and practice in a particular works or industry. We realise that, and that is precisely why we have not copied the United States law. We are always being accused of copying the United States, but

we have not done so here, precisely because we realise that the situation here is quite different. This is why we are not insistent that the sole bargaining agent must be a single unit.<br/>
This is why we are saying that the sole bargaining agent can be a joint panel, such joint panel as the C.I.R., with all its knowledge and sophistication, after full inquiry, shall decide as appropriate and shall recommend. So there will be no question of someone forcing through one union on a narrow majority and telling others to clear off to the courts.</p>

<p>Would the Secretary of State clarify one point? He said earlier that the C.I.R., not the courts, would determine, as it were, "constituencies" and boundaries and descriptions of workers. Can he explain Clause 43(3) which says that where the Industrial Court refers a question to the Commission,
<q>&#x2026; the reference shall specify both the question to be determined by the Commission and the employer or employers, and the employees or descriptions of employees, in relation to whom it is to be determined.</q>
The way I read that&#x2014;I may be wrong: I am not a lawyer, although I understand that legal opinion agrees with me&#x2014;is that the court will very much determine constituencies and boundaries and descriptions of workers. Let us have it spelled out.</p>

<p>We can discuss this when we reach that point, but I can assure the Committee that that is not so. But we must, when referring something to the C.I.R., define what we are referring. That happens in Secretary of State references at the moment. In this case, as the reference would have come through the court, the court must define the reference, but some other Clause&#x2014;the precise number escapes me at the moment&#x2014;specifically allows the C.I.R. to find on inquiry that it is dissatisfied, and, if it thinks that it is being confined, to be able to apply for the reference to be extended.<br/>
I am sorry that I cannot, on my feet, direct the hon. Member to the particular Clause and subsection where that happens, but I assure him that Clause 43(3) is no more than an official definition of a reference. If the C.I.R. finds this too restricting or wrong, it can change it. If the Committee is not satisfied about that, let me be clear about the intention and


say straight away that, if the Committee feels that the words do not make that intention clear, one one will be more happy than I to make it clear.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman says that collective unions within a plant will be able to negotiate jointly, but of course, as my hon. Friend has just said about Clause 43(3), this means that some outside body will, at some ultimate date, decide whether a certain union is included &#x2014;so the freedom is not there, as it is at the moment, for a collective works committee to be appointed.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State worked up an extraordinary lather about something that only he could read into our new Clause&#x2014;the unwarranted assumption that the order referred to would not be debatable by the House.

<p>Where do the Opposition stand on this? The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) said that new Clause 15 was a

reproduction of the proposals in the right hon. Lady's Bill. I accept that we cannot expect all the consequentials, but Clause 6 of that Bill, of which the new Clause is a compressed edition, made it clear that the order to be made by the Secretary of State for recognition was not to be debatable. It was expressly excluded by a later Clause in that Bill from those which were debatable in the House. In other words, it was not voluntary. It was not even debatable. It was an executive order made by the Secretary of State under Clause 6 of her Bill.</p>

<p>I shall refer again to the extraordinary proneness of the Secretary of State and the Solicitor-General, in advancing their arguments, to continue to rest on what we did at another time and in different circumstances. It is extraordinary that a Bill which has not been debated in the House, the justification for which circumstances prevented us from presenting from the Government Dispatch Box, should so continually be invoked by the Secretary of State. Perhaps as much as anyone in the House he knows that any decision or action by any Minister is accountable to the House; the Minister must be responsible to the House for it. To that extent the Minister would be answerable to the House for his actions, whatever might be in the Bill and whatever the intentions in our proposed new Clause.<br/>
The Secretary of State touched my heart strings when he referred to the British Steel Corporation situation. I was in the Department involved in that at the time. It caused me and my right hon. Friend a great deal of anxiety. In the last resort, that situation was resolved by the unions, when everyone had had a nibble at it and failed. That proves the point that my hon. Friends have been making so persuasively from the back benches. All the unions involved&#x2014;14 or 16 of them&#x2014;are opposed to what the right hon. Gentleman is now pressing on the House.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman seemed to share the curious idea of his hon. Friend the Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott) that recognition of a union can be secured on a democratic basis only through the ballot box. We have pressed the Government to give us concrete examples of the situations in which their


proposals would apply. With the single exception of the reference to the British Steel Corporation we have not had any. I will give another example&#x2014;the situation at B.S.R. at East Kilbride, where a bitter conflict between workers and management was resolved not through the ballot box but by the Commission on Industrial Relations. It did not impose a solution on anyone, but persuaded both employer and workers alike to accept what proved to be the solution.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman said of the proposals in this part of the Bill, echoing what he had said on so many earlier proposals, that he is dealing here with machinery of last resort. That was his phrase. We heard that so many other proposals were for dealing with extreme cases, hard cases. But the right hon. Gentleman has convinced the country that his Bill deals with the generality of cases, that he is legislating for the widespread disorder that he says exists in industrial relations. Now he tells the Committee that proposal after proposal is intended to deal only with the extreme case and last resort issues. Cannot he see that if he provides what my hon. Friend the Member for Walton accurately described as very complex and lengthy procedure to deal with these matters he is providing a very tempting gateway for the recalcitrant employers? My hon. Friend said that there are recognition problems that give rise to disputes and conflicts, and we must recognise this. It is out of such recognition that we have tabled the new Clause.<br/>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) is not here. He worked himself up into a hysterical lather the other evening about the alleged destructive r&#x00F4;le of the Opposition Front Bench. We have sought to put before the Committee a very carefully-thoughtout constructive alternative, based on the very lengthy experience that my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) had with these matters at the Department of Employment and Productivity and after the fullest consultations with all the parties to whom the proposals would apply.<br/>
I return to the right hon. Gentleman's proposals. One thing has puzzled me throughout. Why do we have the Clauses in this part of the Bill dealing with bar-

gaining rights which seem largely to duplicate the agency shop provisions? Unless the right hon. Gentleman is telling the Committee that union recognition is one thing and bargaining rights and recognition of those rights are quite different, we are duplicating what has already been provided. I wish that the right hon. Gentleman had explained why he found it necessary to provide these two different parts of the Bill.<br/>
We have not yet had a reply to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Walton, and pursued by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) about the rumoured proposal that there will be a special, separate register for professional workers. I had not heard of it until this afternoon, but I noticed that hon. Members on the Government back benches were nodding their heads when my hon. Friend referred to it, so it seems that they are somehow privy to information that has not yet been put before the Committee. If so, it is important that the information be provided to us, because it is crucial to the context of the Clause.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North asked some pertinent questions on this point, which have not yet been answered, revolving around the question of who will be the professional workers eligible for this privileged status. How does one define a professional in this context? Is it someone who has qualifications accorded to him by passing examinations of a learned body? For example, are teachers professionals? They readily assume themselves to be so. These are the sort of things we have had no reply to.<br/>
I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on the way in which he has sought to turn the debate into one about interunion disputes. I could not help feeling again that if "In Place of Strife" had never been written, he would have been obliged to invent it in order to provide himself with his stock bolt hole. He must recognise that the Industrial Relations Bill presented to the House by my right hon. Friend before the election differed substantially from "In Place of Strife" in the light of our pursuit of democratic procedures, which contrast very sharply with his own haste with this Bill.


The changes we made arose not only from the very lengthy and detailed consultations we had with the T.U.C. but also, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Frederick Lee) said, from the fundamental changes that took place, as a result of those consultations, within the trade union movement and in the relationship between the T.U.C. and its constituent unions. It is time that the Government woke up to what happened during the summer of 1969. Then, for the first time, the affiliated unions to the T.U.C. surrendered part of their sovereignty and gave additional powers to the T.U.C. over a wide range of matters over which hitherto they had proclaimed their autonomy.<br/>
It lies ill in the mouth of the Solicitor-General to lecture the Committee about demarcation disputes, particularly in the light of the dispute which recently occurred in another place when his own learned profession insisted on its exclusive right to man the judiciary. It is hardly appropriate for him of all people, as the defender of one of the remaining restrictive practices, to be lecturing us about demarcation disputes.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman also said that the definition of independent unions in Clause 148 safeguards the position about which we expressed so much anxiety&#x2014;that is, the possible recognition of house unions consequent upon the provisions of Clause 42. I have searched Clauses 41 and 42 in vain so far for the word "independent", and in the absence of that word it is difficult to reconcile what he said with the position in the Bill and to justify his defence of the position against the charges made by my hon. Friends.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) complained bitterly about the inadequate definitions in several subsections of Clause 41. But even more fundamental is the fact that the Bill does not define what is meant by "recognition". This is extremely important. Recognition <i>per se</i> is insufficient. It is not enough for an employer who has refused&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I did not know that the Foreign Secretary was an expert on industrial relations. Perhaps I might return without his assistance to the point. It may not strike him as of

fundamental significance but it is fundamental to ten million workers in industry.<br/>
It is not sufficient for an employer, having gone through the drill laid down by the Secretary of State for Employment, to say, "I will concede your right to be a member of a trade union. Now, so what?". It is not sufficient, when a member of a union invokes, as he sees it, his right to have his union negotiate on his behalf, to see that negotiating right rendered nugatory by derisory and ridiculous offers by the employer.<br/>
One of the points of principle in new Clause 15 is a recognition that the right to negotiate does not take place in a vacuum. Union recognition does not take place in a vacuum. It arises from concrete issues in negotiations about terms and conditions of employment. If, having secured recognition, the workers in a factory want a substantial wage increase negotiated through their union, it is obvious that, unless "recognition", is carefuly defined, the employer can make it ridiculous by a derisory offer&#x2014;for example, "Very well. I will fulfil my obligation by offering you one penny an hour".<br/>
We therefore deliberately included in new Clause 15 the provision that the order would become an implied term of every contract of employment between employer and employee. This is rather different from what was in my right hon. Friend's Bill because she provided there that the order that would be made by the Secretary of State would be one that would enable the union to proceed unilaterally to arbitration about a particular issue that was to be the subject of negotiations. The decision of the arbitral body would then have become an implied term of contract of employment. It would then, of course, have been pursuable in the courts in the same way as any other part of the contract of employment.<br/>
We have exposed not only the weaknesses but also the impracticabilities of the procedure proposed by the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;a procedure which we acknowledge tilts at the problem which undeniably exists&#x2014;and in doing so we have put forward our own positive alternative, albeit modified. Because it was based on the profound understanding and experience of industry of those with whom we had consultations; because it was


based fully on the diagnosis prepared by the Donovan Commission; because it had the backing of the T.U.C., we put our proposal before the Committee as a practical and constructive road ahead in tackling this very difficult problem. That</p>

<p>Having discussed the principle of the Government's new machinery, we come in this Clause and subsequent Clauses to examine its details. The first question we must ask is who will be entitled to take advantage of this elaborate provision for the establishment of bargaining units and bargaining agents. In this group of Amendments we are dealing with a principle which runs through the Bill, namely, that unless a trade union registers under the


iniquitous provisions of the Bill it shall be denied the right to operate as a trade union at all. We shall have a lot to say about this as we go through different parts of the Bill and come up against different manifestations of this principle, but in this group of Amendments we are dealing with two particularly mean and damaging facets to good industrial relations.<br/>
The first is the denial expressed throughout the Clause of the right of an unregistered union to make an application for recognition for bargaining purposes. Just as an unregistered trade union was denied any rights under the agency shop provision, so an unregistered trade union is denied any rights under the concept of the bargaining unit and the bargaining agent.<br/>
The second facet is the denial of the right under Clause 52(5) of an unregistered trade union to have access to the information from the employer which in future the law will provide because the Bill admits that such information is necessary for negotiation. Therefore, what happens in Clause 52 is that if a union is unregistered it will not be entitled to the information without which&#x2014;and I quote Clause 52(1)&#x2014;
<q>the trade union representative would be to a material extent impeded in carrying on collective bargaining &#x2026;</q>
The Government's intention is that any union which on grounds of principle refuses to register on the present Government's terms will not only in future forfeit the traditional protection of Section 3 of the 1906 Act, but will be totally outside the pale of collective bargaining.<br/>
That this is the Government's intention is made quite clear in the Consultative Document, and the Bill has faithfully reflected the intention of that document in these Clauses. In paragraph 131 of the Consultative Document the explanation of this bargaining machinery is expressed as follows:
<q>The Government proposes to provide that any registered trade union, any employer or registered employers' association &#x2026; could make a claim to the National Industrial Relations Court to have any dispute over a trade union's claim for recognition, or over bargaining structure, examined by the C.I.R."&#x2014;</q>
I emphasise "any registered trade union", and no other.<br/>
The Consultative Document says in paragraph 134:
<q>The 'bargaining agent' would be the registered union, or the joint negotiating panel of registered unions, which should have sole negotiating right for all employees within a bargaining unit.</q>
When we study these words we realise the totality of the exclusion of any union which under the Bill is ostensibly given the right to decide not to register. The Government say that if a union wants legal protection it can register, but here they are going much further. As a result of these Clauses unregistered unions for bargaining purposes in innumerable situations would cease to exist. They would vanish into thin air so far as the Government are concerned.<br/>
This is a devastating new principle which goes far beyond anything contemplated in Donovan. The Donovan Report has been quoted by the Government <i>ad nauseam</i> and always selectively. The Government have even prayed in aid the Donovan Report in respect of the registration proposals which we shall be discussing in the next part of the Bill. In fact, we shall be discussing them tomorrow and will examine in detail the sort of insults and indecencies the trade unions have to swallow in order to be registered.<br/>
I am concerned with the nature of the penal clauses for a union which says that it does not want to register. What are the sanctions against such a union? They will not be legal sanctions in the sense&#x2014;</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows that a trader who is required to register under the business names legislation is subjected to certain disabilities in the event of certain kinds of proceedings. Has the right hon. Lady ever considered that kind of requirement to be unreasonable?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.376.1" hansard_membership_id="4880" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2085" speakername="Mrs. Castle" colnum="376" time="">
<p>It depends first on the nature of the disabilities, and secondly on the purposes which are to be achieved. We have been told that the Government are trying to achieve the better regulation of industrial relations. The only disability Donovan ever suggested was withdrawal of immunity under Section 3 of the 1906 Act. Donovan said that in a particular context. That was in the context of conditions of registration which


in Donovan's words, were to be no more onerous and certainly no more restrictive than the present ones under the 1871 Act. Donovan made clear that he foresaw no difficulties under his conditions for any existing union which is registered to remain on the register, but in withdrawing the immunity of Section 3 of the 1906 Act&#x2014;with which we on this side never agreed, as is made clear in "In Place of Strife"&#x2014;Donovan was thinking of temporary unofficial combinations. Donovan makes this quite clear in paragraph 794 in which it visualises how easy it is for anybody to register and the report later examines whether it is right for unofficial groups to have the protection of Section 3 of that Act.<br/>
I do not agree with the conclusions of Donovan in regard to withdrawal of that immunity. I am quoting it to show that there is no suggestion in Donovan that if a union refused to register&#x2014;and the conditions of registration in this Bill are far more far-reaching than anything visualised in the Donovan Report&#x2014;it would from thenceforth cease to exist in bargaining terms. Therefore we have a principle adopted here whereby the Government say to great trade unions, many of which are now facing great decisions of principle&#x2014;and I would stress to the Government how important it is for them to take seriously the debate now going on in these unions as to whether as a matter of principle they can consider registering&#x2014; "Not only will you lose the immunity of Section 3, but you will have no bargaining rights whatsoever, for they will just not be there". It will be purely for the good boys who have signed on their dotted line to be considered to have first and foremost right to make application to go through this machinery and all these gateways, to get "vetted" and ballotted for and therefore finally approved as a bargain agent. If any group of unions one of which, on principle, has said it does not want to register puts forward an application under this it will be ruled out, because only a joint panel of registered unions will be eligible.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend's argument on this principle would apply to my own A.E.W.U. which has already taken a conference decision in regard to registration. But also, is not it rather strange that the words which my right

hon. Friend is seeking to insert are found in every other part of the Bill where they want to catch the unions for unfair industrial practice, but where it is going to operate in this respect those words are deliberately left out, showing the bias there is in this matter?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.378.0" hansard_membership_id="4880" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2085" speakername="Mrs. Castle" colnum="378" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend is right, but the time for us to elaborate on that in greater detail is tomorrow when we are discussing registration. Then we shall be able to draw together the total picture. I am trying to keep myself within the confines of the Clauses covered by these Amendments, Nos. 42, 46 and 56 broadly, where we seek to have these words inserted. There may be others where we should have done so, but this principle runs through my group of Amendments. With regard to the union's right to receive information from an employer in order to be able to bargain effectively, I believe the Donovan Commission would be absolutely horrified at this attempt to dragoon proud unions into swallowing their principles in this way.<br/>
I want to repeat the warning I was giving to right hon. Gentlemen. Many unions are now faced with this decision; and this kind of treatment of the unregistered union is going to make it more likely they will decide not to register, not less likely. There comes a point when the provocation is so great that a man, an institution or a group of people, can only keep their innate pride and dignity by saying, "To hell with you". The Government, in Clauses like this, are provoking otherwise deeply responsible unions into that attitude of mind. This is made all the worse by the discrepancy to which my hon. Friend has just referred, the different treatment in regard to the penalties falling on the organisation. Organisations of workers do not get any plums. It is made worse by the discrepancy to which my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) referred earlier in the debate between the use of the terms "trade union" and "organisation" in this very Clause.<br/>
Why is it, for example, that under subsection (1) of this Clause only a trade union or trade unions are entitled to make application for recognition as sole bargaining agent or as a member of a joint negotiating panel whereas in subsection (3) an employer can make an


application for an organisation of workers to be so recognised? We have had no explanation of this discrepancy. The view was expressed by my hon. Friends behind me that this is a clear gateway for an employer to push forward a house union or a company union for recognition as the sole bargaining agent. I say to the Solicitor-General advisedly that no other interpretation can be placed on this discrepancy. How did it slip in? He has said that that is not the intention. This is a very detailed Bill. It has been drafted with considerable consciousness of intention on the part of hon. Gentlemen opposite. We have not liked their intentions but we have to admit that they have expressed them very clearly.<br/>
I do not believe the Solicitor-General was having a nap when the draftsmen slipped the term "organisation of workers" into subsection (3) instead of the term "trade union" which we have in subsection (1). There was a reason for having that, and it has an effect; because the term "organisation of workers" in Clause 57 of this Bill is not defined in a way that would exclude a house or company union. The Solicitor-General has said that by "organisation of workers" is meant an independent unregistered trade union. He said an organisation of workers is an independent body, it is not a house union.<br/>
Certainly, when we insert the words "organisation of workers" we mean an independent trade union which has decided not to register. That is why we have tabled an Amendment which we will be discussing when we come to Clause 57 to amend the definition of "organisation of workers" in that Clause; because at the moment it does not subsume the word "independent". The Solicitor-General says if only we will turn to the interpretation Clause, Clause 148, we will see that our fears here are misplaced. I believe I quote him aright when he referred us to the definition of independence given in that interpretation Clause. It reads:
<q>'independent', in relation to a trade union or other organisation of workers, means not under the domination or control of an employer", etc.</q>
But that is not the same as saying that throughout the Bill wherever the phrase

"organisation of workers" is used, by definition it means that that body is independent.</p>

<p>There are real questions to be debated here, and I do not want to mislead the right hon. Lady or the Committee on any aspect. "Organisation of workers" is defined in Clause 57, and does not have to be independent. A trade union, as defined in Clause 57, is one that is registered, and a registered trade union&#x2014;in other words, a registered organisation of workers&#x2014;has to be independent, in the words in which the right hon. Lady has described it.<br/>
The right hon. Lady is right in her premise that "organisation of workers" means an unregistered organisation which need not, by definition, be independent. Trade union means registered, which must be independent. I am not to be taken as conceding the rest of the right hon. Lady's case. The point is that it is only a registered union which can secure recognition enforceable against an employer.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for his honesty, because when the point was raised earlier by my hon. Friends that subsection (3) meant that an employer could put forward a non-independent organisation of workers for acceptance as the bargaining agent for a bargaining unit, right hon. and learned Gentlemen gave us the impression that that was not so. He is now saying that it is so, that my intepretation of the subsection is correct. The Solicitor-General may go on to say that that is not the Government's intention. If that is his answer, the remedy is clear. It is to put the word "independent" before "organisation of workers", as has been done in another Clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.380.3" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="380" time="">
<p>I apologise to the right hon. Lady for interrupting again. That is not our intention, and we believe that we have fulfilled our intention, because this is really designed to enable an employer to go through the machinery of the C.I.R. if an unregistered organisation is seeking recognition. It is not designed to enable him to go there to get a tame house union certified by the C.I.R., and what I said on that point is that the C.I.R., consistent with the standards which it has enunciated in its First General Report,


will not put forward for establishment through statutory machinery a non-independent union. But if that were to happen and an independent union were claiming to be recognised instead, it could make its own claim under Clause 42, so that the effect is in line with the intention. I do not want to mislead the Committee, and if the Committee is anxious about it we can consider the way in which it is put forward, but I want to be on common ground about what the words mean.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.381.0" hansard_membership_id="4880" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2085" speakername="Mrs. Castle" colnum="381" time="">
<p>I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for making clear that my analysis of the Clause as it stands is correct. My analysis is under subsection (3) it would be feasible and possible for an employer to put forward a house union to the C.I.R. and the Government's only defence to what is an outrageous proposition, as I think the Committee will agree, is that the C.I.R. in its annual report has made it clear that it will always choose an independent union.<br/>
Which C.I.R.? Not the C.I.R. that we have now. Not the C.I.R. with Will Paynter and Alf Allen on it. Not the C.I.R. set up to be an independent voluntary body, operating a voluntary policy. It is a C.I.R. which has become emasculated because the trade union members refuse to be the creatures of the Government's Bill, and the right hon. Gentleman is finding great difficulty in getting to serve on that Committee anybody who would have the confidence of the trade union movement. The right hon. Gentleman knows that, and therefore it is no assurance to anybody to say that the C.I.R. will be the long-stop.<br/>
What is the Government's intention? Do they want employers to be free to put forward house unions, tame unions, captive unions? Coupled with that there is the fact that under the Clause as it stands, if strong, established unions refuse to register they will not be allowed to apply or to be considered. The only conclusion that one can draw about the Government's attitude to industrial relations is that they are out to debase and humble proud established trade unions, while giving opportunities for the promotion of tame house and company unions, unless the right hon. Gentleman amends either the definition of "organisation of workers" in Clause 57, or puts the word "independent" in subsection (3) of the

Clause, as he has in Clause 63 where he wants to make it clear that he is talking about an independent organisation. I think I am right in saying that it is Clause 63 which says:
<q>any organisation which&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) is an independent organisation of workers".</q>
So where the Government want to make clear that they are talking about independent organisations of workers they put the word in. Will they put the word in to establish their intention; will they insert "organisation of workers" or "independent organisation of workers" at the points of the Clause to which our Amendments refer and in the subsequent Clauses to which our Amendments refer.<br/>
We shall have a later Amendment to define "organisation of workers" as always being independent. The right hon. Gentleman can either accept the later Amendment or he can put "independent" in front of "organisation" throughout the Clause.<br/>
I ask the Committee to take these two points very seriously. I do not believe that the Government can claim that they are trying to reform industrial relations or introduce greater stability unless they make these two vital Amendments for which we are pressing.</p>

<p>It might assist the Committee if I give at least a quick interim reply now. I must reply "No" to both the questions which the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) asked.<br/>
As the right hon. Lady said, these Amendments raise the whole question of registration and the principle behind it. We shall be discussing the details of that tomorrow and it would not be proper for me to go into them now. However, I think that it is proper to mention the principle.<br/>
It is a basic principle of the Bill that privileges and rights should attach to registered unions&#x2014;registered organisations of workers&#x2014;over and above those which attach to non-registered ones. That is for better or worse a clear principle of the Bill and it is at the heart of what we are putting forward.<br/>
The right hon. Lady talked about the principle in rather emotive language. She talked about dragooning proud unions


into registraton. At the end of her speech the right hon. Lady talked about our being out to debase and humble proud unions by asking them to register if they wanted certain rights and privileges.<br/>
What about the public? Are we to debase and humble the public? The right hon. Lady said that the unions would say, "To hell with you". She was not referring to you, Mr. Godman Irvine, but to me. Are we to say to the public, "To hell with you"?</p>

<p>The public are the 50 million people of this country. They include about ten million trade unionists and their families, but they are the whole of the people. What we say, and what we believe that it is right to say, is that if unions claim, as they do, and rightly do, to exercise very great influence and very great power in our community, both economically and socially&#x2014;they claim it; they should claim it; we make no complaint about it&#x2014;it is not unreasonable that they should comply with certain minimum standards and register so as to achieve that power, that status and those special rights and special privileges. We admit that they should have those special rights and privileges, but we believe that the public as a whole&#x2014;the 60 million of us&#x2014;have a right to say to any trade union or to any other organisation&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;of people in this country, whether they be trade unions, doctors, architects, traders or any section one likes to mention, "If you claim to exercise power in our community, you should comply with certain minimum standards". That is the basic principle of registration. It is the basic principle of the Bill. I should be very surprised if that principle did not have the overwhelming support of the vast majority of people, including trade unionists.<br/>
There is nothing oppressive in the conditions for registration which we lay down and which have to be fulfilled. This is not dragooning proud trade unions. It is not debasing or humbling them. It is asking proud unions which were once

very weak but which are now strong to accept the responsibilities and duties in relation to the rest of the community which the community has the right to expect and which every other sector of the community has laid upon it. That is the basis of registration, and we had better get it clear before we start. We can discuss the details of it tomorrow.<br/>
The principle of registration was accepted by the Donovan Commission and by the right hon Lady the Member for Blackburn. The details, which I agree are very important, are different. We are not talking about the details now. We are talking about the principle of registration. If our conditions for registration are wrong, that is an argument which we can have tomorrow. What we are now saying&#x2014;and surely it should be possible for the two sides of the Committee to agree about it since it was recommended by the Donovan Commission and by the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn when she was in my position&#x2014;is that registration should be a pre-condition of achieving trade union status. The form and conditions of registration are matters for important argument. We are now discussing the principle of registration as a pre-condition to achieving trade union status and all that goes with it. A principle of our Bill is that registration should be the means of obtaining certain important rights and privileges.<br/>
The right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn talked about the provisions in Clause 42 clearing a gateway for employers to push forward a house union. That is nonsense. The whole burden of the right hon. Lady's argument&#x2014;and I am sure that she is more rational than her argument made her out to be&#x2014;concerned the great disability attaching to non-registration. She says that by confining these rights&#x2014;in the last debate they were "evil powers", but now they are "rights"&#x2014;to registered bodies we are unfairly placing a disability on non-registered bodies. That is a point of view. But, by definition, the house union, which she is afraid of and which she says we are clearing a gateway for, must remain non-registered because it can acquire registration and the rights which go with it only if it can satisfy the registrar that it is not employer-dominated.<br/>
If an employer puts forward an unregistered union under this procedure, as


I agree an employer could do, what is the good of the C.I.R. recommending it? The complaint in this Amendment is that an unregistered body will get no benefit from that process. But the house union must, by definition, remain unregistered. It is therefore nonsense to suggest that the Clause advances the employer-dominated house union. It benefits registered unions. That is what the Amendment complains about, because the Clause gives benefit to registered unions which is denied to unregistered unions. If one says that it gives benefits to registered unions which are denied to unregistered unions, one cannot say that it is promoting house unions which, by definition, must remain unregistered.</p>

Second, will he tell the Committee why employers have a right to refer any trade union in this regard? This is a matter for trade unions.

<p>It is no good the hon. Member sitting there muttering, "Smash the unions". We are talking about an employer faced with an unregistered body, probably in competition with a registered union, and the employer wanting to resolve the conflict caused by this intrusion by an unregistered body. We properly give that employer the right to go through this procedure and to say to the C.I.R., "We believe that we have a recognition problem here which needs your help to resolve, because we have been unable to resolve it through all the normal

channels." The employer would go to the C.I.R. in this case not to obtain a blessing on an unregistered union but to try to persuade the C.I.R. to give their support to the registered body with which he wants to negotiate and to deal with the unregistered intruder which is causing the trouble. That is the purpose.<br/>
True, the employer could also ask for a house union to be considered, as the right hon. Lady said. But, as I have said before, what would be the purpose of this? Whatever the C.I.R. might advise, it is most unlikely that it would recommend a dominated house union for recognition, but even if it were mad enough to do so, what would be the purpose? All the legal privileges which come in this Clause attach only to registered unions and, therefore, could not attach to the employer-dominated house union, which has been raised as a bogey.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me. I was talking about the specific case in which an employer would take a house union to the C.I.R.

<p>I maintain that it is unnecessary to add anything, because since the privileges attaching to this Clause can apply only to the registered unions, they cannot, by definition, apply to the employer-dominated house unions. My only objection is that this Amendment, clearly, is not necessary. By definition, it is ruled out, because the employer-dominated union which hon. Gentlemen


opposite rightly do not wish to see encouraged could not achieve registration and therefore would not benefit under the Clause. That is the basic answer.</p>

<p>The language throughout this group of Clauses is totally arbitrary and confusing. One Clause refers to "trade union". Another refers to "organisation of workers". Let me refer the right hon. Gentleman to Clause 45(3), where a question has been referred to the Commission about bargaining rights and the Commission has examined the case and transmitted a report. The Clause says in subsection (3):
<q>A report of the Commission under this section shall not recommend the recognition of an organisation of workers &#x2026; as sole bargaining agent &#x2026; unless it appears to the Commission &#x2026; that this would be in accordance with the general wishes of the employees &#x2026;".</q>
There is an clear indication that the Commission can and might recommend an organisation of workers. All that it has to do is satisfy itself that, for example, the employees of a bank want the bank's house union and not the Union of Bank Employees.<br/>
It is true that only a trade union can make application to the Industrial Court for an order enforcing it where a trade union has been nominated. But an employer can apply to the court. Therefore, I suggest that for some inexplicable reason the right hon. Gentleman is dodging from one phrase to another. In one Clause it is "trade union" and in another, "organisation of workers". For clarity of drafting, we should have consistency.</p>

<p>The right hon. Lady must be patient and allow me to finish my sentence. We believe that the C.I.R. should be able to recommend an unregistered organisation, provided that it is put to the test and discovered to be the wish of the majority of the workers.<br/>
Let us suppose that that has happened. To achieve the legal sanctification, potency and benefit that the Clause confers, that unregistered body would have to become registered. If it remained unregistered, it would not have the benefit, protection and status provided by the Clause. If that unregistered body were an employer-dominated house union, it would not be able to achieve registration and, therefore, would not be able to achieve the sanctification of the Clause.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman turns to Clause 46, he will discover that in order to be given the power, validity and legal status conferred by this Clause, it has to be a registered trade union. That is the whole point. In so far as the Clause is held to confer benefits, they should be benefits only for a registered trade union.<br/>
The right hon. Lady began her speech by saying that an unregistered body is not to have any bargaining rights. That is nonsense. I must remind the Committee of what I said in replying to the debate on Clause 41. Here, we are dealing only with the safety net procedure. It is a procedure for catching the cases which fall through the net of normal industrial relations procedures. Of course, unregistered organisations of workers can always bargain.<br/>
We are saying that unregistered organisations shall not have new statutory rights &#x2014;for example, in respect of this Clause, or, to take another point raised by the right hon. Lady, in respect of information. They do not have those rights at the moment. In future, they will have the rights which they have now, but the new statutory rights will be confined to registered bodies.<br/>
There are no penal sanctions against unregistered bodies, but there is a denial of certain rights. It may be controversial,


but we believe that it should rest on the principal of registration. Whether our principles of registration are right or wrong is no doubt a matter of separate debate and deep controversy. All we are saying is that these rights should depend on the achievement of registration. We believe that to be a sound principle, and we shall stand by it.</p>

<p>Listening to the involved reply which has just been given by the right hon. Gentleman, in which he went from one Clause to another to try to prove his point&#x2014;my right hon. Friend pointed out that "organisation of workers" appears in one Clause and "trade unions" in another&#x2014;makes me wonder whether shop stewards and trade union officials will understand it.<br/>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will see the validity of the argument which we have put forward on the Amendment. My right hon. Friend pointed out that the Amendment talks about voluntary independent trade unions, but the Minister's proposal will take away from them these basic rights. The right hon. Gentleman spoke polemically on this matter. We feel just as strongly in answering his point.<br/>
I want to deal with the right of the employer to refer a matter to the court for decision on which should be the bargaining agent. It was not clear to me why this was written into the Bill in such detail. Now I begin to see, after what the Minister said, why it is put in. It means, for instance, that, in an industry where there is an unregistered militant trade union or a union which the employer finds difficult in negotiations and there is also a registered trade union, the employer will be free to submit the registered trade union, not the voluntary union, and get the Commission's endorsement or recommendation that that body shall be the negotiating agent.<br/>
I understood the Minister to say that every union would have the right, or a ballot would be available, to decide which should be the negotiating agent. But, as I see it, it could be used deliberately by an employer, first to try to buy time against perhaps the main union in the organisation and, secondly, to undermine that non-registered trade union.<br/>
I believe that the Minister will be faced with a situation in which unions will not

register&#x2014;probably some of the key trade unions&#x2014;and this will call into question the whole basis of the Bill.<br/>
I assume that throughout the whole of the Clauses, the industrial notes for guidance will spell out many of these facts. We ought to know what these notes for guidance are. Again, we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.<br/>
Many of these Clauses are unintelligible unless the Code of Industrial Practice runs alongside. I assume that the Code will deal with many of these points, but we do not have it. We have no indication of what it will say. The more we go into the jungle of these Clauses, 42, 43 and 44, the more we see the difficulties which we are up against. They will not untangle industrial difficulties but will make life almost impossible for people of good will in industry when faced with an employer or an employer's organisation which wants to be a devil's advocate against a union, whether a house union or a registered union. This could be disastrous and I do not think that the Minister has seen this point.</p>

<p>I am sorry for any trade union movement which cannot achieve maximum membership through the quality of its service to its members. I hope and believe that our experience will be to the contrary.<br/>
Any Government needs a strong, virile and self-reliant trade union movement. I see nothing in the registration requirements complained of by the right hon. Lady which should be of any difficulty to our excellent trade unions. Indeed, most of them will automatically fulfil the reasonable requirements for registration.<br/>
The right hon. Lady did not reply clearly to the simply question which I asked her about those engaged in trade who have to fulfil the simple requirement of registration under the Business Names Act. If they fail to do so, they are at a serious disability if they then have to sue for non-fulfilment of a contract. But no one has suggested that that requirement of registration is unreasonable. Similarly, practically every commercial organisation, from the joint stock company in all its infinite varieties, private public and otherwise, must fulfil very comprehensive requirements of registration. The requirements here are reasonable, as my right hon. Friend has been at pains to point out.</p>

<p>They do not have to accept an enemy in their camp, do they? Clause 61(7) virtually means that a trade union will have to accept someone who is basically against the interests of the union, whether it likes it or not. If it does not accept that, it cannot be registered.</p>

<p>As that it has to do is to satisfy the formalities of the Act and show the registrar that its rules and procedures are fair, democratic and reasonable. To us, that is unexceptionable, and I should have thought that it would appeal to most hon. Members. Is it reasonable to add the words in the Amendment and so lessen the require-

ment for registration prescribed by the Bill?<br/>
My right hon. Friend's reply is unanswerable. The requirement is merely one that will enable any registered trade union to apply for the very considerable powers as special bargaining agents. There are no express disabilities from non-registration. It merely happens that this is one of the new extensive powers that unions will very properly hold and exercise under the Bill.<br/>
I see no objection to the present wording. The Amendment is impossibly loose. The phrase
<q>or organisations of workers</q>

<p>When the Secretary of State replied to my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) he did what he has done once or twice in the Committee. When stuck with a problem of reality and a problem of the drafting of the Bill he retreats to something he calls principle, as if he will ascend into the clouds at Blackpool in October and draw divine inspiration for something he cannot justify to the Committee. That is what he has done this time. He knows perfectly well that there


is a real drafting problem and a problem in reality raised by the absence of a provision that an organisation of workers may apply for recognition. He reminds me very much of the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Instead of getting a spell book, the right hon. Gentleman got a law book from the Solicitor-General. He will learn one day the same lesson as the Sorcerer's Apprentice learned&#x2014;not to meddle with academic abstractions when dealing with reality.<br/>
What the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) are saying is that it is wrong if the National Union of Mineworkers refuses to register or if the Amalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry Workers refuses to register, and they shall not be accorded recognition rights. He said that they must be forced to register; they must comply with basic provisions in order to achieve recognition rights. That is the argument.<br/>
Let us think about reality, not principle. Is the Secretary of State suggesting that if large unions choose not to register they should be denied recognition of the right to negotiate with the employers? What is also suggested, if that is not his argument, is not that one must register to obtain certain privileges, but that certain privileges will be taken away from one if one remains exactly as one is at the moment.<br/>
When the right hon. Gentleman says that certain privileges will be accorded only to those who go through the hoop of registration, he has the whole equation wrong. He is equating a trade union with something that does not even exist on the employer's side. He is not saying to us, for example, that, on the employer's side, in a corporate body such as a limited company, every member of that corporate organisation should obey certain principles. If he were saying that, he would surely be saying that the Government believe in putting an end to non-voting shares. He says that every member of a trade union must have control over its branches, its officials and its funds. Is he saying that every shareholder should have control over the directors of the company, should participate in the organisation and should have control over its branches? He is getting the equation wrong.</p>

<p>All we are saying at the moment is that the range of law that governs trade unions and their relations with their members is and should be at least as open to public debate and variation in the interests of the public and of trade union members as company law has been over the last 100 years.

No doubt he will say that the C.I.R. would not be mad enough to produce that situation, but he is producing a Bill whereby it is possible for employers, who do not have to go through this hoop, to apply to have a union de-recognised, and in the context of organisations which are recognised as responsible, that is ridiculous.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman says that under Clause 46 the Court can accord recognition only to a registered trade union. Why is it that Clause 43 talks about an "organisation of workers"? Why is it that Clause 45(3) talks about:
<q>A report of the Commission under this section shall not recommend the recognition of an organisation of workers &#x2026;</q>
unless certain conditions are fulfilled? Then it goes on in Clause 45(5) to say:
<q>&#x2026; before recommending any organisation of workers &#x2026;</q>
and in subsection (6) it says:
<q>Any recommendation contained in such a report may be made subject to such conditions as the Commission think fit; and in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of this subsection) any such condition&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) may require an organisation of workers recommended for recognition&#x2026;".</q>
Subsection (<i>b</i>) says:
<q>may require any organisation of workers so recommended &#x2026;".</q>
How on earth can he quote his statement to the Committee that only a registered trade union can have an order for recognition when he uses the phrase "organisation of workers" repeatedly?<br/>
There is only one explanation&#x2014;that it is only where the trade union is to be recognised that there can be a ballot and that is where the words "trade union" appear in Clause 46. It could be that under that provision the Commission for Industrial Relations could recommend a house union for recognition without a ballot but where the registered trade union wants recognition, it has to have a ballot. If the right hon. Gentleman

says that I have completely misconstrued the terms of his Bill, then all I can say is that I am entitled to because of the way it is drafted. May I ask him or his learned friend not to run away from the argument by talking about principles. Will he please answer the debate?</p>

<p>The hon. Member has completely forgotten in his argument that the whole reason for using the words "organisation of workers" in those Clauses is to give every opportunity to a body that is unregistered at the moment to get into position and be recommended for recognition, and to get registration so as to be able to have the enforcement of its rights in Clause 46. If it were an employer-dominated house union&#x2014;I must repeat what I have said&#x2014;it would fail to get the registration and therefore would not get the rights and privileges conferred in Clause 46.</p>

<p>This Amendment throws a good deal of light on one of the paradoxes of the Bill to which I have tried to draw attention. My right hon. Friend has said many times, and I accept his sincerity, that his intention is to be perfectly fair as between employers and organised workers. The way this fairness is translated into legislative form in most Clauses is by assuming that trade unions and employers' organisations are mirror images of each other, that they are equal, symmetrical twin pillars on which the whole structure can be built. In some Clauses, particularly Clauses 61 and 65, virtually identical rules are laid down for those two kinds of organisations. But the fact is that trade unions and employers' associations are totally different kinds of structure. I will not go into detail about all the differences that are relevant, but there are several points in the Bill where this artificial parallel breaks down completely, and this Clause is one of them.<br/>
My right hon. Friend has said, quite rightly, that it is his intention to insist on confining certain privileges, one of which


is embodied in the Clause, to those who have accepted the responsibilities of registration. He does that for trade unions, but he does not do it for employers. If we look one line further beyond the Amendment, we see that an employer has the right conferred by Clause 42 without any proviso or requirement about registration under the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) has pointed out that employers have to be registered under company legislation, which is perfectly true, but there is no obligation in the Clause on an employer to undergo the process of registration and to accept the responsibilities of registration before he enjoys the privileges created by Clause 42(1).<br/>
My right hon. Friend has good reason for insisting that the privilege on the side of organised workers should be confined to the registered trade union. He has made out his case on that point, but if he wishes to be fair, should he not also write into the following line an addition specifying that this privilege is only to be enjoyed by an employer who is a member of an employers' association and therefore limited by the same requirement of registration, as defined in the later Clauses of the Bill, as the trade union is in operating under the previous line of this Clause?</p>

<p>I am sorry to detain the Committee, but it is necessary to question the Secretary of State a little more deeply on the details of the Clause. During the debate I have been going backwards and forwards through the pages and getting mixed up, for example, between the joint negotiating panel, which refers to two or more organisations of workers, and the joint negotiating trade union panel, which deals with registered organisations. As one goes through the relevant Clauses one finds occasionally the "joint negotiating panel", which is obviously taken to be the joint negotiating trade union panel.<br/>
The Secretary of State said that one of the misconceptions on this side of the Committee was to think that we were talking about a general situation. He claimed that this was a safety net, the long stop, to take account of the occasional situation that arises. I refer the Committee to the Explanatory Memorandum, which says nothing of the kind. It simply says:

<q>Clause 42 provides for an interested employer, one or more trade unions or the Secretary of State to present to the Industrial Court an application that the Commission on Industrial Relations should be asked to examine questions relating to the definition of a bargaining unit and recognition of an organisation of workers or joint negotiating panel as sole bargaining agent with exclusive negotiating rights.</q>
There is nothing there to say that the Clause is intended to deal with the exceptional case. I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) that it is possible under Clause 42 to have established house unions or creature unions of the employers.<br/>
The trade union is entitled to make an application but not an organisation of workers. Yet the employer is entitled to make an application on behalf of an organisation of workers. Naturally, in the light of the history of the trade union movement, particularly of the Foremen's Mutual Benefit Society, we are bound to be suspicious of a such situation. Nowhere in Clause 42 and subsequent Clauses do we find any explanation for the situation which might arise when an employer creates a house union and makes an application to the court for that house union to be the sole bargaining agent.<br/>
What happens when the court examines the case and finds that both the employer and the house union are in agreement that the house union should be the sole bargaining agent? Clause 43 and subsequent Clauses deal with the situation where there is a conflict of interest or view between employer and trade union. Clause 43, for example, says that the court must be satisfied that both parties
<q>have made adequate use of any facilities for conciliation available to them.</q>
But what does the Court do when the parties are not in disagreement? We are entitled to ask the Secretary of State for a detailed reply on this point. This again is an excellent example of the reason that a guillotine should never have been applied to this Bill, simply because of the sloppy wording of Clauses 42 to 50.</p>

<p>One thing on which both sides of the Committee is clearly united is the fact that there are benefits, rights and privileges which it is intended trade unions should enjoy. Up until now

<p>That may well be, and perhaps I have the hon. Member with me in saying that it would be a matter of principle.

<p>I will answer that in one sentence: the rights conferred by Section 42&#x2014;otherwise what are hon. Members talking about? Presumably they are arguing that they want trade unions to be able to enjoy certain rights. Perhaps the most obvious right is that contained in the Clause with which we are dealing, namely the right to be recognised as a sole bargaining agent.

<p>The hon. Member is a little unwise, because the rights enjoyed by trade unions are those conferred by

legislation. Section 3 of the Trade Disputes Act is a right conferred by law on trade unions, and I should have thought that if it were sought to repeal those rights any such move would be very much resisted.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
I am afraid the hon. Gentleman really cannot have it both ways. Either the Amendment he has put down is designed to secure a benefit or it is not, and if it is then we might take it as agreed that a benefit is to be secured and that is what we are talking about. The argument before the Committee is whether or not the benefit ought to be dependent upon registration and I had thought that that was common ground between both sides of the Committee. I agree that it is open to argument whether or not the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) is correct, fair and right in saying that the provisions for registration in this Bill are odious and unacceptable. That is her view, and it is something which the Committee will have to consider in due course when we come to it tomorrow.<br/>
That is absolutely fundamental, but the point I wish to establish at this stage on these Amendments is that it really is not appropriate for the right hon. Lady, who I believe is about to rise and I would like to know her comments on this, to deny the second principle which is that the rights conferred by the Clause, or any other part of any enactment, should be dependent upon registration; because she has herself analysed the situation in these words:
<q>The present legal requirements relating to the rules of trade unions are inadequate and should be extended in the interests both of the unions and of their members.</q>
She goes on to say that legislation should propose that trade unions should register with a new registrar of trade unions and that unions will be required to have rules governing certain matters&#x2014;admission, discipline, disputes between a union and its members, elections, strike ballots and the appointment and functions of shop stewards, and should be required to register. The right hon. Lady even went further and said that refusal to register by a trade union should lay that trade union open to a financial penalty by the Industrial Board.


At this stage, therefore, although the Committee may well be persuaded by the right hon. Lady when the time comes that the provisions for registration in the Bill are wrong or unfair or should be changed, it is a matter on which the Committee will have to decide and we are not prejudging it now. But, with great respect, it is quite wrong for hon. Gentlemen opposite at this stage to try to fly in the face of the principle which is fully accepted by both sides that the very considerable rights and privileges which trade unions claim should be enjoyed without registration, and registration subject to rules determined upon by this House.</p>

<p>I intervene only for a moment, but it might be helpful to the Committee if I do so because I believe there is at least one point on which we can reach agreement. I have said quite clearly, as has my hon. and learned Friend, that it is not the intention to encourage the employer-dominated house union. We also believe, and genuinely believe, that that is not the effect of the Clause as it is worded at the moment: and I have explained why. Nevertheless, while I do not like adding unnecessary words to a Bill, I do not mind adding one if it helps to solve the difficulty.<br/>
I must say to the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) that I do not believe it is possible to add it where she would wish to add it in this context. I believe the place to add it might be in Clause 45, and I will tell the Committee that when we come to that point at another stage I will consider very favourably the possibility of including there something which makes clear that the Commission will be empowered only to put forward as a sole bargaining agent an organisation which is independent. That, at least, would clear up that point beyond peradventure.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for trying to help us achieve greater clarity. Clearly we shall want to examine the right hon. Gentleman's proposal before we are satisfied that it offers us greater clarity or that it goes far enough. None the less, we shall be glad to examine the proposal on Report, which is no doubt when the right hon. Gentleman will put it forward.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman realises that he has not conceded the main principle behind our Amendments, and we therefore intend to divide the Committee. He has tried to say that nobody should be opposed to the principle of registration, that I have not opposed it in "In Place of Strife", and so on. He says that we ought to agree on that, even though we argue about the conditions tomorrow. Our case is that it is impossible to differentiate between the principle of registration and the conditions of registration.<br/>
The hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) rattled off at me about the trader who has to register under the Register of Business Names Act and said that there was nothing iniquitous about that and nothing to which anybody can object, but, as I told the hon. Gentleman, no great disabilities follow, and whether it is iniquitous to expect a trader to register depends entirely upon the conditions imposed upon him and what disabilities might flow from that requirement. Would the trader to whom he referred have registered so equably if, as a condition, he was forced to allow someone to work for him who was also working for his competitor?<br/>
That is the kind of condition which will be imposed on the trade unions under the next part of the Bill. We cannot accept that we should concede the principle of registration and argue merely about conditions, and I ask my hon. Friends to divide the Committee.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Amendments is to delete the provision under which an employer can apply for a trade union to be appointed


the sole bargaining agent and the subsequent provisions in subsection (3).<br/>
The great danger to which the Secretary of State and other Ministers have referred which these very unsatisfactory provisions of the Bill are designed to meet would all be satisfactorily met by deleting the provision which the Amendment is designed to eliminate and leaving the trade union to make an application to be appointed the sole bargaining agent and the employer, in the rare cases in which the problem justified the step, to make an application to the Secretary of State to apply for a union to be appointed as sole bargaining agent.<br/>
The reasons which prompted me to move the Amendment stem from my fears of the danger of grave abuses which the Bill as it stands leaves wide open. I shall not repeat the arguments which I advanced on Clause 41, but there is a very substantial danger that an employer could seek to promote a tame company union, or a tame union, to be the sole bargaining agent.<br/>
Although the Solicitor-General will no doubt point out that the C.I.R. is unlikely enthusiastically to recommend such a union, there have been many situations in which employers have successfully promoted amongst their staff a trade union which was very subservient to the employers' interests.<br/>
When speaking earlier this afternoon, the Secretary of State drew attention to the fact that the union that would be appointed must be independent. I was hesitant to contradict him at that time, but I was delighted a few minutes ago to hear him conceding that there is no provision in the Bill as it stands to ensure that the sole bargaining agent is an independent union, and that he is now proposing to ensure at the Report stage that Amendments to guarantee the independence of the unions will be introduced.<br/>
But the definition of "independent" contained in Clause 148 is not by any means sufficiently watertight. The wording is:
<q>'independent', in relation to a trade union or other organisation of workers, means not under the domination or control of an employer or of a group of employers or of one or more organisations of employers;</q>
Presumably there is no case law at present on the subject of what "domina-

tion or control" means precisely with regard to trade unions. But if one has a union even with a wholly independent executive or with a majority of elected representatives, say, seven elected representatives and five representatives appointed by the employer on its executive, it would still come within the definition of "independent" contained in Clause 148. Even if one has a union with a wholly elected executive, if they were, for example, elected for very long periods, it is within the knowledge of most hon. Members that trade union officials are no more immune from gradual weakening of resolution than anyone else. There are great incentives for an employer to get a quiescent trade union appointed as a sole bargaining agent with which he can subsequently make legally enforceable collective agreements which are binding on many people who are not and would not wish to be members of the trade union concerned, but who wished to belong to another union which was prohibited from getting itself put forward as an alternative bargaining agent.<br/>
I urge the Government to accept the Amendment, which would remove from these provisions the dangers of the most serious abuses. Many abuses would remain, but the most serious is that of the employer promoting a tame union. The Amendment is designed to ensure that that cannot occur.</p>

<p>We have had a good deal of discussion, and right hon. and hon. Members opposite seem to be very concerned about tame unions or unions tied to the skirts of employers. I should have thought that Mr. Clive Jenkins was getting rid of a great many of them. His activities in recent years been been quite effective in increasing the size of his own union. Because we believe that trade unions are effective if they are well organised, we have no complaint about that. Indeed, I understand that employers have not complained in some of the establishments where Mr. Jenkins has gained a footing.<br/>
There is a danger that we may have from right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite the suggestion that they are concerned about tame unions when what they are concerned about is the possibility of smaller unions developing at the expense of some of the bigger ones. We


on this side of the Committee have no such inhibition. We believe in competition between unions just as much as anywhere else. If some of the smaller unions grow and become more effective, that is all to the good. I have in mind some of the white-collar technical unions, for instance. If trade unions are efficient and give good service to their members, they cannot be tame unions. No employer will be able to hold a union in his grasp if it is known that another union is knocking on the door and can offer to the work people concerned a service which is better than that being provided by what might be a house union.<br/>
Whatever may be said by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite, and however they may criticise what they feel are the disadvantages of the Bill, it also gives many advantages, some but not all of which were contained in their own proposals. The advantages are greater than the disadvantages and, if trade unions are strengthened, they will be more able to give the kind of service to their members which will make tame or house unions completely obsolete.</p>

<p>I want to support my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington, North (Mr. Douglas-Mann). When the Committee considered the last group of Amendments, the Government's answers to the straight question of the difference that registration makes were totally obscure.<br/>
It will not have escaped the notice of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite that the trade unions are not altogether enamoured with much of this proposed legislation. On balance, it may be that a number of important trade unions will decide not to register. I do not want to exaggerate the position, but it may be that the General Council will recommend that unions should not register. If that happens, I do not see how the legislation can function. However, such a state of affairs will bring very much to the forefront what are the advantages of registration.<br/>
Listening to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite, I am still not clear what the advantages are. One hon. Member on the back benches opposite said that his party did not seek to take away any of the rights of trade unions, even if they

did not register. If that is so, what is the point of registration?<br/>
These are points which the Government have not yet made clear. Taking the engineering industry as an example, let us suppose that the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions decides that it will not register. The position will be reached where an employer makes a recommendation about the type of union which shall constitute the sole bargaining agent. There will be the three parties: the trade unions, the employers and the Secretary of State. There will be no recommendation from any trade union. There will be a recommendation from an employer, and it may be that what has been described as a tame house union will be put forward by the employer as the sole union with which he wants to bargain. Therefore, we shall be inviting industrial strife on a very wide scale if an employer's recommendation of that kind of union as the sole bargaining agent is to be accepted. Even if the unions are not desirous of registering, it would be far better, from the Government's point of view, to put the onus on them of suggesting the bargaining agent rather than the employer.<br/>
10.0 p.m.<br/>
I think that the Amendment, which seeks to delete the grave dangers which nomination by an employer in these conditions would bring, is, certainly from my angle, important and, from the Government's angle, well worth consideration.<br/>
The Government could help if they were more precise in defining whether registration is to be considered as a prime factor in determining who shall be the sole bargaining agent. Given two <i>bona fide</i> unions, affiliated to the T.U.C., as it were, running neck and neck on the numbers employed, and so on, if one were registered and the other were not, would that be the determining factor in the eyes of the Government as to which should get the right of negotiation?<br/>
We have not had answers to points like this. Instead, we hear about the virtues of principles. I remind the Government about a famous Irishman who suggested that there are times when a man must rise above principle. I think that this is such an occasion. Unless and until we get answers to some of


these points I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to go into the Lobby in support of the Amendment.</p>

<p>It seems that if we abstracted from the Bill "(<i>b</i>) an employer" and the qualifying part of subsection (3) we should be restricting the power to make such an application to a trade union and to the Secretary of State. I suggest that there may be occasions on which it might be a great advantage for the employer to have this additional power. I appreciate why the hon. Member for Kensington, North (Mr. Douglas-Mann) has his doubts about the additional power, and he has explained them.<br/>
I am sure that we can all imagine cases in which a reasonably efficient staff association could fulfil admirably most of the functions of a trade union. I accept that it would be undesirable in some cases that there should be a tame staff association or union which was unduly dominated by the employer. But, as my right hon. Friend pointed out on an earlier Clause, if such an organisation were to be brought within the ambit of the Clause and to obtain these rights, it is inconceivable that it would subsequently obtain the registration which it needed to fulfil those powers.<br/>
In the other Clauses dealing with registration, he will see that, to carry out effectively the powers sought under this subsection, the association which he describes as tame would need to apply for registration. As my right hon. Friend said, in those circumstances, it is not conceivable that such an association, dominated by an employer, would fulfil the requirements. This additional power could be effectively used by some employers. They could apply on behalf of valid unions which would fulfil a valid function. It would weaken the Clause to take out these words.</p>

<p>Clause 42 deals with proposals for recognition of a sole bargaining agent, which is defined in Clause 41(<i>c</i>) as one of the work people in the unit referred to there. It seems completely outwith any concept of industrial relations that the sole bargaining agent should be at any time at the behest of an employer. The definition is concerned

solely with the employee's interests, so I see no case for an employer being able to determine the sole bargaining agency, except under the conditions to which my hon. Friend referred.<br/>
In other words, the only case for giving an employer this right is when the employer decides that he wants a tame union of the company type which has bedevilled the trade union movement, particularly in some of the professional spheres to which the hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford (Mr. Kenneth Lewis) referred when talking about Clive Jenkins.<br/>
If the Under-Secretary could tell me some circumstances in which it can legitimately be argued that an employer could advance a case for this nomination, I might be convinced. Unless we are very careful, and unless the Amendment is accented, we shall have the situation in which an employer desires to have a tame union or a company union and a measurable number of employees will resist. If an employer takes advantage of the opportunity afforded to him under the Measure to nominate the sole bargaining agency, whether it is a professional or industrial type of unit that he represents, inevitably the lads will want to have a union of their own, as distinct from the employer's union, and we shall have industrial conflict.<br/>
Can the Under-Secretary tell me the kind of case that can be argued for any employer to nominate the sole bargaining agency of a trade union? I know that there is identity of interest on both sides of industry, to a given point, as I have argued for 15 years as a trade union official. But beyond that point the interests diverge. Any employer who suggests that he could even nominate the sole bargaining agency for his employees is presumptuous in the extreme.<br/>
If the Under-Secretary's explanation is not adequate and he does not resolve here and now the problem of the discrepancy between affording an employer the opportunity to nominate the bargaining agency and the definition of a bargaining agency in Clause 41, I shall keep him a long time on the issue. It is fundamental to the rights of people in industry that they should be able to determine the persons and organisations who shall represent them.</p>

<p>There are perhaps some misunderstandings about the idea that employers should be entitled to apply for a reference to the N.I.R.C. The Government feel that it is right and proper that there should be provision for employers to be able to apply for references alongside trade unions and the Secretary of State. This is a means of getting problems sorted out by an independent body. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for West Ham, North (Mr. Arthur Lewis) laughs, but the C.I.R. is designated as an independent source. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We shall debate the C.I.R. at a different time. I am telling the Committee that it is an independent source. In effect, where there is difficulty the employer can put forward his case via the Industrial Relations Court to the C.I.R. and have matters sorted out for him. I stress to the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Loughlin) that this is not a question of nomination. It is a question of application. It raises the question of who should be the bargaining agent, but it is not the employer who will decide that.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Frederick Lee) asked what would happen where a registered union and a non-registered union competed in these circumstances, and whether the registered union would win. In effect, it is a decision that the C.I.R. will have to make. It might recommend the formation of a joint panel, but in due course the unregistered union could not enjoy the rights under Clause 46 unless it became registered.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman suggests that we might have a joint panel of registered and unregistered workers.

<p>As I said, I think that the C.I.R. could put this particular point forward.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kensington, North (Mr. Douglas-Mann), moved the Amendment fairly and I would have appreciated his point if we had not had the previous debate. I think he now sees that there are adequate provisions to eliminate any idea of tame trade unions. As we have said before, and as I now repeat, the C.I.R. is unlikely to recommend recognition of a tame union. My right hon. Friend has said that there is no intention on our part to encourage or to allow tame unions, but he is going to look at the matter further and establish the fact that independent organisations of workers will be the ones which will qualify.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he thinks there is no provision that stipulates a union nominated by an employer? He says that it is not a matter for nomination but for the C.I.R. In fact the provisions as they stand refer to
<q>organisations of workers specified&#x2026;</q>
in the employers' organisation or negotiating panel. Does he confirm that it will be the employers who will be nominating the unions to be considered and that it is open to the employers to nominate unregistered unions because there is no provision in the Bill to restrict them from doing so?</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. Gentleman is right in saying that. But it is for the C.I.R. to make a decision. My right hon. Friend made it clear in the last debate that the question of organisations of workers will be looked at in relation to their being independent. We maintain that the definition "independent" is the right one, but if the Committee feels that it is not the right definition we can discuss it on Clause 148. But I must point out that, if hon. Members feel that "independent" is wrong, in the Labour Government's Bill the term "independent" defined independent trade unions. I thought that that definition was appropriate.</p>

<p>We must have one point to which the hon. Gentleman referred made quite clear.

<p>It can be put forward in that way but it can only apply for statutory recognition if all the members are registered. That is the situation. We have taken the point put forward by the hon. Member for Kensington, North (Mr. Douglas-Mann) about tame unions and there is no intention to encourage them. My right hon. Friend will deal with this on Report. If the hon. Gentleman is still doubtful we can debate this on further occasions.<br/>
There are reasons why employers should be allowed to apply for references&#x2014;very rare and complex situations in conditions of inter-union rivalry when an employer might legitimately wish to protect himself against either one or other of the unions not being willing to apply to the N.I.R.C. In that situation, with strife and chaos evolving, an employer might want to take action and make the application to the N.I.R.C. What we are trying to achieve is orderly procedures, and an improvement in industrial relations. In difficult circumstances, which may be comparatively rare, it is right that the employer should be able to make application. In view of the assurances given in a previous debate I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not find it necessary to press his Amendment to a Division.</p>

<p>There is one point with which the hon. Gentleman has not dealt.

<p>That would lead to a political decision and we do not think that is necessarily right. The various parties enumerated should be able to go to an independent organisation like the C.I.R. <i>[Interruption.]</i> That is my view and I am entitled to put it forward.

It is better for this to be decided upon by the C.I.R. in the circumstances.</p>

<p>The reply to this short debate has been most unsatisfactory&#x2014;in fact it has been pathetic. The Minister has not answered one point raised from this side of the Committee. I put my question to him again: what would happen if an employer referred to the Commission a case in which he had two trade unions operating in his establishment, one a registered trade union, the other an unregistered trade union, and the Commission decided that there should be a joint negotiating body composed of representatives in equal numbers from the registered and unregistered unions?<br/>
What would be the position of those organisations under this Clause? For example, if there were an industrial dispute, one would have the protection of the Bill and the other would be outside it. The whole of its funds would be at risk if it engaged in an industrial dispute. Is this not an impossible situation for any trade union to contemplate?<br/>
The Minister will not say that most of the unions would be registered, because my information is that the majority will not register, and as a consequence there will be all sorts of difficulties if we proceed along these lines. We are entitled to have an explanation of this Clause. If it were possible to psychoanalyse the mind of an employer then we would know the reason for the Clause&#x2014;it enables an employer to make an application to the Commission for sole bargaining rights.<br/>
It seems that the friends of hon. Members opposite have told them that the motor car industry has to negotiate with 22 unions, whereas in Germany the negotiations are with one union. The motor car industry wants to know why it cannot negotiate with one union in this country. This is an attempt to get sole bargaining rights in the hands of one or two big unions.<br/>
Hon. Gentlemen opposite, who know nothing about industrial relations, cannot understand the evolution of the trade union movement in this country. In Germany the trade unions were restarted with a clean slate in 1945, on the advice of the British T.U.C. It was decided that there should be 12 trade unions and it was all planned. But in this country trade


unions have been evolving for 150 years. There was the growth of craft trade unions. Then with the great conurbations the great national institutions arose, and the industrial unions. With the rise of new industries came new unions with hundreds of different practices, different rules and so on. The trade union movement in Britain cannot be treated in the same way as the trade union movement in Germany. We did not start with a clean slate.<br/>
We are left with eleven million people organised on traditional lines. The trade union movement cannot be unified into one or two bargaining units in each factory because of its evolution. If the psychology behind this Bill is to try to coerce the trade union movement into bigger conurbations and so reduce the number of unions, it will not work.<br/>
The greatest factor against it working is that no one has continuity of employment. It might work with stable employment and if a man could be guaranteed his job throughout his working life. But electricians, clerical workers and draughtsmen may have between a dozen and 20 employers during their working life, there is no stability, and therefore there must be craft unions to cater for craftsmen who move from factory to factory and from institution to institution.<br/>
The Minister has not replied to the question raised by my hon. Friends of what the employer would do if he had the opportunity of nominating his bargaining unit. We have asked what would

happen to the company union, the staff association, the house union or the compliant union which, in the striking language of our American cousins, is called an organisation that signs "sweethearting" contracts with employers. As set out in the Clause, employers have the right to nominate this type of union to the Commission in the hope that it will be accepted as a stooge to negotiate in place of the real trade union.<br/>
In many establishments trade unions only have a foothold, where only 25 or 30 per cent. of the employees are organised, but the employers have to recognise their right to bargain at the moment. If they are given the opportunity of opting for something else, they will disregard the trade unions which are building up their membership.<br/>
It is sensible not to allow the employers to pick the agents they want who would accquiesce in their demands. The trade union movement is a movement of struggle. We do not ask for rights or privileges. We fought for our rights and privileges. We have sacrificed, starved and died for our privileges. We do not come cap in hand asking for privileges from the employers. We have reached our present establishment of eleven million organised workers by fighting for the rights of working people and we have established these rights by building up a strong organisation. This legislation is aimed at weakening the organisation, and I hope that my hon. Friends will divide the Committee on this issue.</p>

The hon. Gentleman argued that an employer should have the right to protect himself. Then he made the revealing statement that we were dealing with the right of trade unions to be the sole bargaining agency, and I quoted to him the definition of "sole bargaining agent" in Clause 41. Of course, the purpose of a trade union is to safeguard its members and, if it is to do so properly, obviously it has to be independent of the employers. Short of that situation, it cannot safeguard those rights.<br/>
What right has any employer to be the arbiter as to who should be the sole bargaining agent. [An HON. MEMBER: "He has not such a right."] But he nominates. I want to be brief, but I will try to explain the situation for hon. Gentlemen opposite. Clause 42 says
<q>An application under this section may be made to the Industrial Court by any of the following parties that is to say&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) one or more trade unions&#x2026;".</q>
That is the issue. If the employer makes an application and the Industrial Court agrees, it means that the employer is the arbiter, as I argued in the first instance. [HON. MEMBERS: "No".] Of course it does. I wish that hon. Gentlemen opposite would be a little sensible about this. I have been very lucky. I have been on the management side, as well as on the trade union side, and I was

on the former before I was a trade union official.</p>

In replying to the debate the Minister said that we could have a joint panel of either registered or unregistered trade unions&#x2014;meaning organisations of workers, a mix, a joint panel. I want the hon. Gentleman to repeat what he said.


Is that what he means? Is that the position? If he does mean that, then he does not understand the Bill, because the Bill does not say anything of the kind, and this is one further example of the complete confusion into which right hon. and hon.

A little earlier, in reply to my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) who raised a point about "independent" and said that an organisation of workers could be recognised as a sole bargaining agent, the right hon.

<p>The distinction, which is plain throughout, and consistent with the point of principle made by my right hon. Friend is that the Commission is encouraged to put forward a union, or an organisation of workers, a joint panel, one or the other, registered or unregistered, of the unions and organisations to be found in the plant or unit. The Commission is encouraged to put forward whatever solution seems most likely to produce a reasonable bargaining situation. That is the position arrived at up till Clause 45. The only point at which those bodies must register is when under Clause 46, whether separately or jointly, they seek to claim their new statutory rights to enforce that solution upon that employer. It is at that point that Clause 46 requires them to be registered, entirely consistently with the proposition that the new rights should be in line with registration.</p>

<p>That is fine. Let us suppose that this procedure is followed whereby an organisation of workers, because the application has been made by the employer or by the Secretary of State, is referred to the C.I.R. and the C.I.R. decides that it should be recognised as the sole bargaining agent. Then the Solicitor-General says that under Clause 46 at that stage it must become a registered trade union. Let us suppose we have gone right through this procedure and the organisation represents a great body of opinion amongst the workers; it has the majority in the ballot. What happens if the organisation decides that

it does not want to become a registered trade union? Hon. Gentlemen reveal stage by stage how impossibly idiotic the Bill is.</p>

<p>Before that organisation can then claim the new statutory right, it is required to register. That is entirely consistent with the principle my right hon. Friend enunciated and with the principle set out in paragraph 109 of "In Place of Strife".

In his Amendment my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington, North (Mr. Douglas-Mann) says that we should eliminate the employer. I agree entirely. [<i>Laughter.</i>] It seems that many employers are eliminating themselves by bad management. Perhaps we will not need to put them out of business, because they are putting themselves out of business. I am talking about the words "an employer", which the Amendment proposes to delete. It should be removed because as long as it is in the Bill there must be the suspicion in the mind of the entire trade union movement that it is possible for an employer to make an


application for a tame union, a house union or a company union, whatever it may be called, which is acceptable to the employer and to no one else. [An HON.

<p>I will not accept the Amendment because we believe that employers as well as trade unions and the Secretary of State should have the right to initiate this procedure. We have explained why we think that three parties&#x2014;the Secretary of State, the trade union and the employer&#x2014;should have the right to initiate this procedure. Although I believe it is sure, I am prepared to make it doubly sure that the C.I.R. cannot recommend other than an independent organisation of workers as the sole bargaining agent. I think that that is the assurance for which the Opposition ask.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether the Secretary of State has given way or not, but what he has said is that he will give an undertaking that the C.I.R. will recognise only an independent organisation of workers as the sole bargaining agent. Unfortunately, he was not in the Chamber when this commotion was started by the Under-Secretary of State. We want to know what the right hon. Gentleman means by an "organisation of workers". Does he mean a registered trade union? Confusion has been worse confounded by three contradictory statements. The first came from the Under-Secretary of State. Then the Solicitor-General made his unhelpful contribution and said that it could be recognised as the sole bargaining agent but when it started to exercise its rights it would have to register. Then the Secretary of State spoke.<br/>
We should have an answer to this point. If the Secretary of State cannot give it, there is only one other Minister who has not spoken, and that is the Minister of State. Perhaps he could throw in his hat and let us know the answer.</p>

<p>It is a pity that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) does not listen or does not want to hear, but this point has been answered several times this evening. However, I will answer it again. We have said that we see no reason why the C.I.R. should not put forward for recognition as a sole bargaining agent an unregistered organisation of workers providing it is an independent one. If that unregistered organisation of workers which has been put forward by the C.I.R. for recognition then wishes to take its legal right under this Clause it must get itself registered. If it does not, it has its rights but not the legal sanctification and strength behind it, because it should be a registered body to take this extra legal right. The only object of allowing the C.I.R. to put forward an unregistered organisation as long as it is independent, is to give the opportunity to such a body to move into that position. Then if it wishes its de facto position to be strengthened by the new statutory right, it must get itself registered.</p>

<p>With great respect to the right hon. Gentleman, he has missed the point. The Under-Secretary, when


replying earlier to my hon. Friend, said that a joint negotiating panel could consist of a mix of both registered and unregistered unions. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) is asking whether we are to understand that this is the case or did the Under-Secretary make, perhaps, a pardonable slip of the tongue or an error.</p>

<p>I have obtained from HANSARD a proof copy of what was said by the Under-Secretary. He said:
<q>The panel&#x2026;</q>
that is, the joint panel&#x2014;
<q>&#x2026;could only obtain recognition if all its members were registered.</q>
I was saying that the hon. Gentleman was saying that it would not be recognised. The Under-Secretary has said that the C.I.R. could put this point forward.</p>

<p>We do not know where we are. The right hon. Gentleman is saying "Absolutely right", and I am saying that the Under-Secretary said:
<q>The panel could only obtain recognition if all its members were registered.</q>
That presumably means that a joint panel coming from a factory could only be recognised if all its members were in registered trade unions. Immediately after my interjection, the Under-Secretary says that that is not a fact. Now he says that if they do that and we have one which is unregistered recognised, when it comes to the question of being recognised and exercising any powers it has by virtue of being recognised, it cannot exercise those powers because it is unregistered. This is nonsense.</p>

<p>It is not nonsense. First, let me deal with the case of a single body recommended for recognition. If that body wishes then to acquire the new statutory right to recognition, it must get itself registered. The C.I.R. can also put forward a joint panel as its proposed bargaining agent. If that joint panel contains any unregistered members, then if that joint panel wants to have its statutory right to recognition&#x2014;as opposed to any de facto right it may enjoy&#x2014;all its members must be registered. If a bargaining agent, either a single organisation or a joint panel, thinks it of value

to have this new statutory right to recognition, then it must be registered.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman make it clear what an organisation of workers recommended by the C.I.R. under Clause 45 would need to do to have the statutory rights to which he refers? Would it still have the right to make collective bargains legally enforceable on behalf of the employees concerned? Whether or not the matter went to the court under Clause 46, what requirements for registration arise under Clause 47?<br/>
Perhaps I have not made myself clear. Can the right hon. Gentleman confirm that the sole bargaining agent recommended by the C.I.R. under Clause 45 would have the power to make legally enforceable bargains, and that it would not be necessary for it to become registered?</p>

<p>I am not sure that I have followed the hon. Gentleman's point? I think that the answer to his question is "Yes". The body could have the right, if it wished, to make a legally binding agreement without having to have its statutory right.</p>

<p>I have listened carefully to the Secretary of State and the Solicitor-General saying that under Clause 46 an unregistered organisation could not make an application. Clause 46(1)(<i>b</i>) says:
<q>&#x2026;the trade union or joint negotiating panel, as the case may be, may make an application to the Industrial Court under this section.</q>
The words used are "joint negotiating panel", and they are extremely important. There is a vast difference between those words and the words "joint negotiating panel of trade unions", which deal with registered organisations.<br/>
Are we to take it that an unregistered organisation cannot make application to the court to have an agreement imposed which gives it sole bargaining rights, but that an unregistered organisation can make application to the court in respect of a registered organisation? That is what the Clause seems to mean. We are entitled to an explanation.</p>

<p>If the Secretary of State says that he is looking into the possibility of meeting the point raised about the independent organisation of workers at the C.I.R. end, what is his objection


to meeting it at the beginning? If that body is not to have any standing before the C.I.R. and will be ruled out, why should it be possible for that organisation to be sent there by an employers' body?<br/>
Then we have all this confusion about joint negotiating bodies, unions which are registered, and unions which are not registered. I can see the intention here. There might be mixed bodies of registered and unregistered unions, but, as Clause 46 says, it will not be possible for the unregistered bodies to operate. I get that message clearly. But why is the Minister still reticent about the employers' attitude? He has heard from my hon. Friends how we feel that employers have no right to refer a trade union in the first place. What is it to do with an employer? We have made that point. We say that the employer has no right, and we remind the Government of the way in which, in the United States, this principle has been used continuously to refer bogus organisations solely in order to clog the machinery and stop the recognition of <i>bona fide</i> trade unions.</p>

We want a reply to the question which has been put. I shall put it again. I hope that I shall not be ruled out of order for repetition. If a registered and an unregistered trade union each had an equal number of employees in membership and the Commission decided to set up a joint negotiating committee, would both the registered and the unregistered trade union have recognition from the employer? If they have <i>de facto</i> recognition, would any agreement which they entered into be valid for the members of both the registered and the unregistered trade union? If an unregistered trade union is a valid union for negotiating and obtaining wage increases,

what is the purpose of registration; what are the disabilities?<br/>
Will the right hon. Gentleman or the Solicitor-General clear up this confusion, because we have had contradictory statements? The Government owe it to the Committee to say where they stand on this issue.</p>

<p>I shall try again. The unregistered body has bargaining rights. It does not have to be registered to have bargaining rights. It has to be registered to have certain additional rights, including the statutory right to compel the employer to recognise and negotiate with it. If a union does not wish to have that extra statutory right, then in this context there is no need for it to be registered. If it does want this extra statutory right, there is the need to be registered.</p>

<q>(5) The Industrial Court shall not entertain an application made under this section otherwise than by the Secretary of State unless, before the application was made notice of the proposal to make it had been given to the Secretary of State; and where such a notice has been given &#x2014;

<li>(<i>a</i>) the Secretary of State shall offer such advice and assistance to the party or parties giving the notice and to such other parties as appear to him to be directly concerned, as he may consider appropriate with a view to promoting agreement between them with respect to the matters to which the application would relate and for that purpose may refer any question relating to those matters to the Commission for examination by them, but</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) nothing in the preceding paragraph shall prevent the party or parties giving the notice from making an application under this section at any time after the notice has been given.</li>

The effect is to provide that the National Industrial Relations Court shall not entertain any application under Clause 42 unless notice of the application has first been made to the Secretary of State, who will thus be given the opportunity to conciliate. It is complementary to the similar Amendment which I moved to Clause 35. The purpose is simply to emphasise that statutory references should be seen as a last resort after voluntary efforts, including conciliation by my Department, have failed, and therefore the objective is to avoid unnecessary references to the Court and onwards to the C.I.R.<br/>
The Amendment was prompted by a suggestion made to me by Mr. George Woodcock and I have heard from him that he much welcomes the fact that I have felt able to put it on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>I think that the Amendment is quite clear. It is in my name, but there is a large measure of support for it from my hon. Friends, and in view of the lateness of the hour all I want to know is whether the Secretary of State will accept it. As I am restraining myself from making a speech, I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept the Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.431.0" hansard_membership_id="2146" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11649" speakername="Mr. R. Carr" colnum="431" time="">
<p>The brevity of my hon. Friend puts me in a testing position. I cannot be quite as brief, nor can I go as far as my hon. Friend would like me to and accept these Amendments, but I hope that I can, nevertheless, say something which will be of considerable help to my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne-mouth (Dame Irene Ward), to many other of my hon. Friends, to, I hope, some hon. Gentlemen opposite, and to many people outside the House who share the views and motives which have led my hon. Friend and other hon. Members to table these Amendments.<br/>
I understand and appreciate the reason why it is felt that the agency shop and bargaining unit provisions as they stand should include some special safeguards for professionally qualified people. I have received representations on this point from a number of quarters, and I have listened carefully to them, but I do not think that it is possible for the Government to accept these Amendments in the form in which they have been put forward, because I am convinced that in this form they could jeopardise one of the fundamental aims of the Bill; namely, the need to avoid fragmentation of the bargaining structure, which is one of the problems in industry, and one which we must not aggravate.<br/>
I also have very much in mind the fact that whereas the professional workers have a problem, with which I have some sympathy, that problem arises not so much from the fact that they are professional workers, as from the fact that in the circumstances which concern them they are quite small minorities embedded in a larger majority in a working group. Therefore, as I said briefly the other night, anything we do to help here must really be something which is designed to help not only professional workers, and not primarily because they are professional workers, but to make sure that in dealing with bargaining structure, appointing bargaining units and agents, we take proper account of minorities of workers, whoever they may be, embedded in a larger group of workers of a different nature, with different interests, different purposes and functions. So we must tackle it from that point of view.<br/>
It is and must be the responsibility of the C.I.R. to determine, in the light of all the circumstances, what is likely to

prove the most acceptable, satisfactory and lasting solution to disputes about the bargaining unit and the bargaining agent. Experience both in this country and certainly in North America amply confirms the conclusion that hard and fast rules or criteria make it more difficult rather than easier to resolve the wide range of problems that arise.<br/>
Therefore, I do not wish to tie the hands of the C.I.R. by writing strict criteria into the Bill; nor shall we do so. I believe that when we bring forward our code of practice we can give sensible guidance within it which can bear on this problem; but, although influential, the code of practice will be much less rigidly binding than criteria written into the Bill.<br/>
What it is essential to ensure is that, dependent as we shall be upon the wisdom, skill and foresight of the C.I.R., the C.I.R. in its composition is fully representative of people with experience of all the problems with which they have to deal. Although it would be wrong to set up the C.I.R. or any similar body on a strictly representative basis, and I do not want to have on the C.I.R. people who are there as members for this interest of that interest&#x2014;that would be wrong&#x2014;nevertheless it is important to ensure that the C.I.R. includes amongst its membership those who are experienced in all these matters.<br/>
It will be my intention to ensure that the C.I.R. contains amongst its membership one or more members who will be fully conversant with the needs, problems, ethics, functions and all the rest, of professional workers of all kinds.<br/>
I am also prepared to consider very carefully the possibility of moving on Report an Amendment&#x2014;not to this Clause, but to Clause 45&#x2014;which could offer some further guidance to the C.I.R. in deciding the scope of appropriate bargaining units. Clause 45(4) specifies two matters which the C.I.R. must in particular consider in determining matters concerning the recognition of an organisation of workers or a joint panel as sole bargaining agent. My Amendment would require the C.I.R., in determining whether to make such a recommendation, also to have regard to the minorities which may be in a bargaining unit which it is considering and to the community of interests of different descriptions of


employees, the nature of the work which these different groups perform, their training, experience and responsibilities, as well as any other matters which the C.I.R. might consider relevant. If when we reach Clause 45 we give that direction to the C.I.R. and we ensure that the C.I.R. is fully representative in its membership, I believe that, without tying its hands, we can give the guidance to the C.I.R. which is necessary to ensure that the interests, not only of professional workers, although of course including professional workers, but also of other minority groups of workers can be properly regarded within the determination of a bargaining unit and the recommendations which the C.I.R. may make about bargaining agents.<br/>
Although I cannot accept these Amendments, I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that, if I were in Clause 45 to do something along the lines I have suggested and take care of the matter in the code of practice and in the membership of the C.I.R., we would in all reasonable ways be meeting the genuine needs both of professional workers and of any other minority groups of workers embedded in their bargaining units.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-09a.433.0" hansard_membership_id="424" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2349" speakername="Mr. Ashton" colnum="433" time="">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman has given a peculiar answer. I welcomed the first part of his speech when he said that he could not accept the Amendment, but it is peculiar of him to talk about Clause 45 on Report when we are going through it under the guillotine in Committee in five minutes' time. The hon. Lady the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward) put down her Amendment because of the Tyneside lock-out of my union, D.A.T.A., and the position of the United Kingdom Association of Professional Engineers.<br/>
We maintain that D.A.T.A. can recruit up to the top level of chief draughtsmen and high technicians and is perfectly able to negotiate on their behalf. For many years we have never advocated that top executives should join our union, although they have had the benefits of its negotiations in that there has never been a pay increase yet to lower management or technical grades in which the same percentage has not gone to other management grades. If we obtained 10 per cent. increase in pay, these chief draughtsmen and others also obtained

10 per cent. to maintain differentials. The maintenance of differentials is built into trade union structure and the vast majority of engineers were satisfied with that until 18 months ago, when the U.K.A.P.E. was set up.<br/>
We believe that it is a bosses' union and is financed by bosses' money. It has had a rapid rate of growth to about 30,000 members in the past 18 months. Top class executives are travelling round the country recruiting for it, and someone obviously is paying their salaries and expenses because a campaign of starting off a union through its initial stages costs money. A great deal of time, money and effort is required.<br/>
We think that this is being done for one purpose&#x2014;to put it bluntly, so that U.K.A.P.E. members can act as strikebreakers, not as blacklegs during a strike because blacklegs have to belong to a union to be classed as that. The members of the U.K.A.P.E. can keep the wheels turning when the rest of the factory is on strike.<br/>
The technicians in industry have a great deal of power because they recruit up to a high level of management. Because of the nature of the job, technical work has to be put into a pipeline, so that drawings done today, for example, will often not reach the shop floor for two months. So if draughtsmen go on strike, it is possible by using the existing supply in the pipeline to keep the shop floor going for as long as two months. We therefore have to pay a high rate of strike pay of &#x00A3;27 10s. a week so that the men can survive, and we have to ensure that no sub-contracting takes place to another firm or ensure that there is insufficient management left in the factory to keep the place going.<br/>
The U.K.A.P.E. virtually says, "No strikes". We had representatives of the organisation visit this House about a month ago, when some of them said that they were proud that they could keep works going and that it was their public duty to maintain them while an official dispute was on. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We now see the difference between the two sides of the Committee. When we pointed out to these people that they were, in effect, prolonging the dispute by enabling the plant to continue with a skeleton staff, they shrugged their shoulders and said


"So what?". That is their attitude&#x2014;and not one that they are entitled to more money because they are professionals, since under D.A.T.A., which negotiates for everyone at a plant, they get their increases.<br/>
The U.K.A.P.E. is a bosses' union designed to break strikes. As I have said, because of the nature of the job it is necessary to keep a long pipeline going, and if there is a skeleton staff during a strike, that strike takes very much longer than necessary. That is why we refuse to work with the U.K.A.P.E. It is why D.A.T.A. was locked out at Parsons, near the constituency of the hon. Lady the Member for Tynemouth, but finall Parsons had to agree that D.A.T.A. would have sole negotiating rights.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but the hon. Lady moved the Amendment. I would give way if we did not have the guillotine. The Government imposed it. We did not. Of necessity, we had to exert pressure on Parsons and suffer a lockout and a cost to our funds of about &#x00A3;200,000 to try to solve the problem and work for the sole negotiating rights we believed necessary. If this Amendment and a series of others were made, it would create chaos. It would not improve industrial relations or stop threatened disputes but would lead to more lock-out than there have been in the past.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity of raising this very important question of the need to expand educational opportunities in the Northern Region. We talk a good deal about attracting new industry and creating new job opportunities, and sometimes we are apt to overlook the fact that education has a vital part to play in regional development.<br/>
The Northern Region, for which I have the honour to speak tonight, has in the past made a tremendous contribution to the prosperity of Britain by the inventive genius of its people, coupled with hard, skilful work done in the pits, in the shipyards, in the iron and steel works, and in heavy industries. We are undergoing great changes, with not a little success. Much has been achieved in recent years. During the past five years our roads programme has transformed communications throughout the whole region.<br/>
I came across some statistics recently which greatly interested me and which are relevant to this subject. Two-thirds of the hourly paid workers in the Northern Region are now employed in new industries, as against 40 per cent. only seven years ago. I say this because I do not want people to think that the Northern Region has only a depressing or black picture to present. Indeed, there are sectors of our educational development which compare favourably with those achieved anywhere in the country. Nevertheless, there is much to be done and I believe that education can be the key to our achieving parity with other areas, and in this the Government have direct responsibility.<br/>
The Northern Region, despite high unemployment rates, is still short of certain grades of personnel. Every year hundreds of our schoolchildren leave school at the statutory age and write themselves off far below their full potential. A tragically high proportion&#x2014;83&#x00B7;9 per cent.&#x2014;of our school leavers go straight to employment and take no part in higher education. In 1964&#x2014;when I saw this figure I could hardly believe it&#x2014;only 24.2 per cent. of


the children in the Northern Region stayed on at school after the statutory leaving age. That figure had increased to 44&#x00B7;9 per cent. by 1969. I know that the latest figure will reveal an even greater proportion staying on.<br/>
We welcome this vast improvement&#x2014;it is almost double&#x2014;in five years under the Labour Administration, but it is still 10 per cent. below the national average, and we will not be satisfied until we match the figure applying for the rest of the nation.<br/>
I could say much about polytechnics, colleges of education, the university at Tees-side, and so on, but in this short debate I will concentrate on education up to the age of 18 and I will deal in the main with the question of provision in schools.<br/>
There is a desperate need for nursery school provision. Far too many children in the whole country&#x2014;this certainly applies to the Northern Region&#x2014;begin their school life deprived and handicapped because they have limited access to the spoken word, to books, to pictures, to the kind of environment that would give them a good start in life. I appreciate the contribution made by voluntary playgroups, private nurseries, child minders, and so on, but the need can be met only by a massive extension of local authority nursery schools, particularly in the priority areas.<br/>
I want to make a controversial proposal, although I am confident that the Minister will consider it. I am a teacher and a member of the teachers' union. I have had experience of teaching in a primary school and then of being head of a large primary school in the north. If the alternatives are waiting for years to come for purpose-built nursery schools staffed by fully qualified teachers or using facilities now available, improved by minor works allocation and staffed by qualified teachers available, assisted by ancillaries and even with the help of parents, the latter must have preference. Unless we can do something big and do it now, generations of our schoolchildren will continue to be deprived.<br/>
The Northern Region received one-ninth of the national allocation for educational priority areas. This in itself is an indication of the leeway that has to be made up in the region. I was

told by the Minister last week that we have 3,877 primary school classes with over 35 pupils, which means that far too many of our children are denied the individual attention so necessary if they are to receive the education they deserve.<br/>
In 1968 a total 45&#x00B7;9 per cent. of our primary schools had been built pre-1902, despite the expenditure by the Labour Government of over &#x00A3;15 million on the primary school building programme. There is no doubt that massive resources are required, including allocation of teachers and the minor works programme. An indication of the willingness of local education authorities to do their share is shown by the expenditure on books, equipment, and so on, for it is higher in the Northern Region than in many others.<br/>
It is at secondary level that we really see the results of the economic history and social character of the region. Despite the fact that the building programme has doubled in the last six years, we urgently need purpose-built comprehensive schools offering a wide variety of course and making possible the supply of well-educated youngsters so vital to the future of the region. Early leaving has been a particular problem in the North, and the whole educational service is the poorer because so many children leave as soon as they reach the statutory age. Fewer children staying on means a smaller building programme because the sixth forms are smaller. The basic need element that has governed the building programmes for so long is less than in the more prosperous parts. Early leaving means fewer children going on to higher education and poorer overall secondary provision because the older the child the more units he represents in assessing rate support grant.<br/>
I have become convinced that one of the reasons is the mania that we have for labelling our children. If one labels a child "B" or "C"&#x2014;it is sometimes done in the infants' school&#x2014;and that label carries on, and both parents and child are aware of it throughout the school career, can one wonder that when the child is 15 both he and his parents are convinced that the best thing he can do is get away from school and begin work? There is far too much selection in our schools, and, of course, far too much selection and segregation outside them.


In the north far too many parents&#x2014;1 say this as a practising school master&#x2014;are far to willing to accept the verdict of the school and the label placed on their child. That is why so many of our children are leaving without realising their full potential. Education was developed in the region to serve the traditional industries where the worker learnt his trade in the job. Apprenticeships have been a strong feature, and they had to be taken up before the 16th birthday. Many children were forced to leave school in order to supplement the family income.<br/>
I say without fear of contradiction that we have penalised and punished the average and below average children for generations, and now we must give them justice by abolishing privileged selective schools. It is no crime to involve parents by reminding them that education is the key very often to better job prospects and a better living standard. If there is a choice, the community must choose in favour of those hitherto under-privileged.<br/>
I want particularly to mention maintenance grants. I know that maintenance grants for children staying on at school are discretionary. It is about time we made them mandatory to ensure parity between the various areas of the country. I asked a widow, who had two children at secondary school both likely to go on to higher education, to apply for a maintenance grant. When she filled in the form I was amazed at the scales laid down. The maximum grant payable to a 16-year-old child is &#x00A3;115 per annum, and for a 17&#x2013; or 18-year-old boy the maximum is &#x00A3;140 per annum. One must have less than &#x00A3;450 a year net income to obtain the maximum grant. That is not being fair to our children. There ought now to be a mandatory system, a national rate, and this ought to be taken over in the same way as higher education grants and so on.<br/>
There is no doubt that much can be done for the schools. I could take the Minister to a school in my region which I know well. It is a neighbourhood comprehensive school. I know what is often said about neighbourhood schools. It serves two council housing estates. The numbers staying on at the school represent a figure well above the national average. That is so because the school offers facilities superior to many grammar schools. It has a dedicated staff who offer

a wide variety of courses. The courses are practical, realistic and vocational. There was a time when I was against vocational courses in schools. As chairman of an education authority I was asked about typewriting, and I said that typewriting had nothing educational about it. But when I have seen girls doing typewriting and so on, I have seen their attitude to school change completely. I have seen boys doing courses relevant to what they want to do when they leave school, and their whole attitude changes. I am fully converted to that kind of education.<br/>
The Northern Economic Planning Council, in a very interesting document called "Education" published early last year, made a strong plea for the Northern Region to be given special status for education. It suggested a 10-year programme under which we would have discriminatory treatment similar to that of the road programme initiated by the previous Government. The Council is right. We need nursery provision, improvements in the primary schools and Government aid to enable local authorities to go comprehensive. It is interesting that the Council advocated comprehensive schools for the Northern Region.<br/>
An injection of resources now&#x2014;not in five or 10 years' time&#x2014;would yield great dividends both socially and economically. It would enable the region to contribute to the prosperity of the nation. Even more important, it would give every boy and girl the opportunity which they ought to have to develop their talents and abilities to the full. I am very conscious of that every day in the North.<br/>
I want to see the Minister taking the initiative, allocating extra resources and pursuing a positive policy which would give individual children real equality of opportunity and enable the Northern Region to achieve parity with other areas of the country.</p>

<p>As one who until June was associated with the next rung on the educational ladder, may I press on the Minister that unless the points raised by my hon. Friend and neighbour the Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong) are taken into account, and unless the nursery, primary and secondary schools in the


North-East are given the resources which they desperately need, much of the expenditure on the Universities of Durham and Newcastle and on the polytechnics in the region is ill-spent. Unless we get our basis right, we do not achieve the objective of this expenditure. Therefore, as one who is associated with that end, I briefly support my hon. Friend's submission.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong) will forgive me and, I hope, acquit me of discourtesy if I am unable to deal with all the points that he has raised. I have noted them carefully, as I have those made in the necessarily brief intervention of the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Mark Hughes).<br/>
I hope that it will not sound unduly pompous, which I hope that I am not, if I say that my first official visit in my job was to the North-East. That was because I have always thought that too much happens from London, and I wanted to start my modest and no doubt short career at my Department by seeing for myself on the ground some of the problems in a region which is rightly famous for a very vigorous people. As a result, I am fully conscious of the requirements of education in that area.<br/>
The hon. Member for Durham, North-West has referred to the Report of the Northern Economic Planning Council, which I have read with great care. My Secretary of State has asked me to say that she hopes, before long, to send the Council some further comments on its report. Naturally, there has already been contact on this matter.<br/>
I want, as the hon. Gentleman did, to start at nursery education. Both hon. Members are more entitled to say so than I am, but it is undoubtedly true that, for historical reasons largely connected with the pattern of employment in the North-East, nursery education has not developed rapidly. Over England and Wales as a whole, about 8 per cent of the combined 3 and 4-year olds are in nursery schools or classes, whereas the proportion in the North is very much smaller. That is why our predecessors devoted a sub-

stantial part of the first two phases of the Urban Programme to the expansion of nursery education in the North.<br/>
Between them, those two phases provide over 1,000 places, or about 10 per cent of the total for England and Wales as a whole. That has to be set against the Northern Region's 7&#x00BD; per cent of the total school population. It is fair to recall that allocation.<br/>
In phase 3 of the Urban Programme, which we announced last month, the Northern Region has done even better. We have approved another 750 places, or about 15 per cent of the total for England and Wales. In terms of money, the north has done better still. About one-fifth of the total educational share of the third phase of the Urban Programme is going to the North, with a special Government grant of 75 per cent. So I am able to say that I am totally seized of the problem and that, as far as resources allow, we shall continue to expand nursery education in socially deprived areas.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman will recall that in its report, the Economic Planning Council recognised that the north had had a substantial share of the resources available for school building during the 1960s. In the three programmes so far approved for the 1970s, this record will be maintained and improved. The value of major projects to be started, including the special allocations for raising the school leaving age, will rise from &#x00A3;11 million in 1970&#x2013;71 to nearly &#x00A3;12&#x00BD; million in 1972&#x2013;73. Within the total for 1972&#x2013;73, the Northern Region will do particularly well in terms of resources for the replacement and improvement of old primary schools, which is the Government's first priority for school building after basic needs have been met. There are 39 projects in the programme for this purpose, at a cost of over &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;5 million, compared with 25 projects at a cost of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;2 million in 1971&#x2013;72. The primary school building programme as a whole in the Northern Region in 1972&#x2013;73 will total about &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;8 million, 20 per cent. more than in each of the two previous years and indeed an all-time record.<br/>
The hon. Member made special reference to primary schools, and, without his expertise behind me, I totally agree with his order or priorities. He will, therefore,


be glad to know that the two programmes together will make possible the replacement of about one-fifth of those nineteenth century primary schools for which, according to returns by local authorities, there is a long-term need. 1 hope we shall be able to maintain this good progress. I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving me the opportunity to make this very clear indeed.<br/>
Perhaps I could mention one other small but important feature of school building programmes. Durham's allocation for minor works costing less than &#x00A3;30,000 each and this is an important human allocation, although it may be small money in national terms&#x2014;has been increased from &#x00A3;380,000 in 1970&#x2013;71 and 71&#x2013;72 to &#x00A3;450,000 in 1972&#x2013;73.<br/>
The House will appreciate that the 1972&#x2013;73 programme is the first which an incoming Government, in this sphere, can lay hands on. Quite properly, reference has been made to class sizes, particularly in primary schools. I do not want anyone to read satisfaction into my words. One of the great interests of education is that one can never be satisfied because each progress produces greater demand.<br/>
In January, 1969, 10&#x00B7;2 per cent. of primary classes in the North had more than 40 pupils, compared with 9&#x00B7;5 per cent. in the country as a whole, so it was worse. As the hon. Member foreshadowed, by January, 1970, the North's figure had fallen to 6&#x00B7;8 per cent. as against 6&#x00B7;7 per cent. for the country as a whole. In other words, the north has been catching up, and the proportion of primary classes over 35 in the North, 34&#x00B7;6 per cent., is smaller than the figure of 37&#x00B7;6 per cent. for England and Wales. The figure for the proportion of classes over 35 is smaller per cent. than the figure for England and Wales. Under the quotas recently announced, staffing at schools in the North should continue to improve.<br/>
I was glad that the hon. Member mentioned the school leaving age and voluntary staying on. I take every opportunity of making it clear that the Government are firmly committed to raising the school leaving age in 1972&#x2013;73 and the North has its substantial share of the necessary allocation of resources.<br/>
Even in advance of the raising of the school leaving age, we can all recognise, as the hon. Member has, that voluntary staying on in the North has shown a welcome increase. In 1964&#x2014;I think this is the same figure as the hon. Member mentioned&#x2014;24 per cent. of pupils were staying on at maintained schools. He was absolutely right to look at the figure with great anxiety, comparing it with the national figure of 37 per cent. By 1969 the gap had been halved to 45 per cent. in the North and 53 per cent. in England and Wales. No region made faster progress in this very important matter than the North.<br/>
I shall not go into higher education and the university sector, which is also important; but I should like to mention capital investment as a whole. The Economic Planning Council's Report, which I have already mentioned, showed that over the four years 1965&#x2013;66 to 1968&#x2013;69 capital investment for education in the North, other than universities, totalled over &#x00A3;47 million and represented over &#x00A3;14 per head of the population&#x2014;the highest figure for any region in the country.<br/>
I do not want anyone to read into what I have said that I am satisfied or that, on behalf of my right hon. Friend, I am complacent. Not only in education but in many other services mentioned by the hon. Gentleman which I am not qualified to answer for at this Box there are still big gaps to fill. I understand that this throws heavy burdens on the local authorities, but I am seeking to show, without complacency, that there has been a very marked improvement over recent years. In particular&#x2014;though I seek to make no narrow party point here, because this is not how the debate has been raised and conducted&#x2014;specific decisions of this Government have continued and built upon that progress. I hope that I have shown that with my personal concern for and interest in a vital part of this United Kingdom I am not likely to overlook the proper and rightful claims of the North.</p>
