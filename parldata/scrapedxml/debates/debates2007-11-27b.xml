I do not sniff at that&mdash;there is a need for new housing&mdash;but the plan added the rider that the creation of new homes should be closely related to the availability of infrastructure and associated services. Now that the Government's panel of planning inspectors has said that it does not accept that new home levels should be contingent on infrastructure, I eagerly anticipate discovering on which side of the argument the Minister falls.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-27b.215.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="215"  time="019:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071127/debtext/71127-0015.htm#07112769000052">
	<p pid="b.215.0/1">In the north-west over the past decade the housing scene in our large cities and towns has changed from one of low demand, and even of abandonment in our older terraced streets, to one of affordability. Affordability is not only a matter for London, the south-east, York and Chester, because it hits all our areas today, including my town of Bolton.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/2">Regeneration has been one of this Government's successes&mdash;if hon. Members visit Manchester today, they will see all the cranes on the skyline&mdash;and it has extended to housing in our older urban areas. Whereas once we had street after street of decaying and deeply unpopular terraced housing stock from the factory eras blighting the lives of the people who lived there, today we have a new hope in most of those areas. I urge the Government not to take their foot off the accelerator of regeneration, especially in the pathfinder areas of the north-west.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/3">Our region still faces the greatest incidence of low-quality private sector housing in the entire country. We need to invest both in providing new homes to meet increasing demand, which is partly driven by substantial demographic changes, and in valuing our existing stock, which needs the refurbishment that this Bill will hopefully provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/4">As economic growth accompanies urban regeneration, people are&mdash;fortunately&mdash;being attracted back to live in our town centres. Town centre living has been positively encouraged in Bolton, where we have built on brownfield sites, such as the recent use of an old picture house, and converted old mills and churches into affordable accommodation for purchase. However, the speculators have moved in, too, and we have our fair share of buy-not-to-let properties in Bolton. Cities such as Leeds and Salford report that between 40 and 50 per cent. of new private sector flats in the city centre are empty, which is a scandal considering what we have heard this afternoon. The Government must try to tackle that. Are we building for sale far too many one and two-bedroomed flats, rather than much-needed family accommodation?</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/5">Rising prices have restored confidence in recent years in the older end of the private sector market. Young people are now buying in areas that they would not have considered 10 years ago, and they are spending money on refurbishing homes at the cheaper end of the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/6">I joined Bolton's housing committee in 1977, and after that we rightly abandoned general improvement areas, which were vehicles for tarting up run-down areas. Instead, housing action areas were introduced under the Tory Government, which were a way of not only substantially improving older properties, but investing in the surrounding environment. Our first HAA was declared in the Castle street area in my constituency in 1977. We promised the residents a further 30 years of life for their properties, and it is ironic that we are having this debate 30 years later. Those properties in Castle street, and many thousands more throughout Bolton that were refurbished after that under the HAA, must last for many more years given the current rate of regeneration. My fear is that if we do not tackle that problem large clearance areas will reappear at some point.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/7">I am in favour of limited clearance, but not on the scale at which we used to do it in Bolton in the '60s and early '70s, when 1,000 properties were cleared every year. We must slowly regenerate our towns by replacing some of the clapped-out houses, otherwise we will face the major clearance problem that I have mentioned. Although Bolton has supported the need for housing market renewal, which is clearly demonstrated by those areas chosen as pathfinders, it has meant a considerable slowing down of the regeneration of older properties in Bolton and throughout the north-west. The danger is that we will return to a point at which private sector housing falls into disrepair faster than we can improve it.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/8">I welcome the formation of the Homes and Communities Agency under the Bill. Its focus will be on regeneration as well as the provision of more rented social housing. The Government have some tough challenges to face, but I hope that they will commit themselves to meeting those challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/9">In the north-west, house price rises far outstrip wage and salary growth, and there is an urgent need to develop a higher-wage economy in our region. In 2002, only four districts in the north-west were experiencing lower quartile house prices to lower quartile earnings affordability ratios of above five, but by 2006 only eight districts had a lower ratio, and a significant number had a ratio in excess of six. Those facts, along with the sub-prime crash in the United States, are having an increasingly serious effect on the British housing market as credit becomes harder to acquire, which is making buying a home much more difficult today.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/10">I have been worried for some time that if the economy slows, stagnates or crashes&mdash;I hope that that does not happen&mdash;there will be nowhere to house those people who lose their owner-occupied houses. In my opinion, we have concentrated too much on home ownership, which is currently far too high at over 70 per cent. I ask Ministers how much further we can go beyond 70 per cent. Of course, it is most people's ambition to own their own home, but the problem is that many of those who have been persuaded or even cajoled into buying their own home can no longer afford to maintain it. Today, for example, I visited a refurbished council estate, where it was easy to pick out the houses that had been bought in previous years, because they desperately need refurbishment.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/11">There is a desperate need for more affordable rented accommodation in the private and the public sectors: both have a role to play. The problem is that one third of our former council homes have been sold off through the right-to-buy policy. There is not much point in building more affordable rented homes if the right to buy will be applicable to them. Shelter shares my concern about that. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to find a way of protecting such homes from sale in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/12">We need to replace those lost affordable rented homes as quickly as possible, as the housing market again changes rapidly. It is noticeable that the turnover of council properties has slowed down significantly and that, as a result, waiting lists have risen&mdash;in Bolton, from about 5,000 in 1997 to more than 18,000 today. That figure is very up to date, because we have just cleared out the dead wood in the waiting list by writing to everybody. It is a joint waiting list held between the council and all the housing associations in the town. Like Shelter and many Members who have spoken, I am completely opposed to the application of a means test for social rented housing. Social housing should not become residual housing only for the very poor. In 1997, the new Labour Government faced a backlog of &pound;19 billion-worth of repairs of the council-owned stock caused by 18 years of gross neglect of that stock by the Tory Government. In the 10 years when I was chairman of housing in Bolton, from 1986 to 1996, I lost 70 per cent. of housing investment in our town. Is it any wonder that we face this crisis today?</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/13">The decent homes standard will be met in Bolton by 2010, and Bolton Homesforyou, the arm's length management organisation that manages the stock, has gone well beyond the standards laid down by the Government. I am pleased to announce to the Minister that the SAP&mdash;standard assessment procedure&mdash;ratings on Bolton's refurbished ALMO-managed properties averages 72 per cent., which is exceptional.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/14">Today, <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November</phrase>, is Lancashire day, when, in 1295, the first elected representatives from Lancashire were summoned to Westminster by King Edward I to attend what became known as the Model Parliament. It has been a particular pleasure for me to take part in this debate, because although I live in Bolton I regard myself as a Lancastrian.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-27b.232.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" speakername="Andrew Slaughter" colnum="232"  time="020:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071127/debtext/71127-0017.htm#07112779000046">
	<p pid="b.232.2/1">My hon. Friend is right that the Opposition have offered only the most trivial spin imaginable. They never follow through on what they say so exuberantly to housing charities and the media.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/2">Part 1 of the Bill deals with the Homes and Communities Agency. I hope that the agency takes a robust line, and that the Government do not underestimate the scale of the task facing it. Various hon. Members have spoken eloquently about the problems in their constituencies, but I want to make a special plea for London&mdash;something that I know always goes down well with my friends in the north.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/3">This country has 93,000 households in temporary accommodation, but two thirds of them are in London. We have heard that the average price for a property in some parts of the country is &pound;140,000, but the average in my constituency is something over &pound;400,000. There are some 24,000 people on the housing waiting lists in the two boroughs that my constituency covers, and about 4,000 people live in temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/4">The figures are worse than they sound. In Hammersmith and Fulham borough, there are more than 8,000 families on the housing waiting list, but the very deceptive banding systems that are used mean that only the 5 or 10 per cent. of people in the top two bands have any hope or prospect of being rehoused. In addition, overcrowding is a huge problem in the private rented sector but also, and especially, in social housing. That was never the case before, and Shelter estimates that black and minority ethnic families are seven times more likely to suffer overcrowding than white families.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/5">Those are some of the bare facts, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister is aware of them. How are Conservative local authorities responding? Hammersmith and Fulham council in my constituency has reduced the target percentage for affordable housing from 65 to 40 per cent. It has tried to reduce the amount of social housing in the borough, and the leader of the Tory council has said that</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/6" class="indent">&quot;we must stop our borough becoming a ghetto for the urban poor&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/7">The council's policy is to cut the target for the construction of social rented housing by more than half, even though its own housing strategy says that it needs to build 4,390 additional social rented homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/8">Most extraordinary of all is Hammersmith and Fulham council's decision to switch existing designated affordable housing units for which permission has been granted and which have been built to something called &quot;discounted sale&quot;. That may be a new concept to this House, but I shall give one example involving the well known Imperial wharf site, which is on the riverside in Fulham. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-30">30 October</phrase> last, the Tory-controlled planning committee agreed to switch 191 social rented units and 50 shared-ownership units to discount sale. That means that, for almost 90 per cent. of the units, buyers will need an annual income of more than &pound;50,000, while buyers of the other 10 per cent. will need an income of more than &pound;35,000. As a final blow, the subsidy will come from the housing revenue account, which means that council tenants will pay the subsidy for people earning more than &pound;35,000. In my constituency, 50 per cent. of households have incomes below &pound;20,000. Only 20 per cent. of households are in the above &pound;50,000 category and by definition they are the least in need. If Tory affordable housing policy is to cater only for people in the &pound;50,000 to &pound;60,000 bracket, we are living in deeply cynical times.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/9">The main defender of affordable housing in London is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Mayor of London. My hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> has already made this point, but it is worth repeating: there is provision in the Greater London Authority Act 2007 that the Housing Corporation should have regard to the Mayor's housing strategy. There should be a similar provision in the Bill and for the London plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/10">I say that because I feel certain that the current Mayor will be re-elected next May; otherwise I should not be making the argument so strongly. Last week, I had the misfortunate to read a speech, headlined &quot;Boris Johnson sets out his housing vision for London&quot;, which contained the following gems: we should not be</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/11" class="indent">&quot;getting too hung up on percentages of affordable accommodation...There isn't a dwelling in London that is intrinsically affordable or unaffordable, from the smallest flat in Lewisham to the biggest wedding-cake schloss in Kensington...I would like to concentrate on helping people on low incomes to live in London in beautiful homes of all kinds; and of all prices...Most people would like to live in either a village house or a bungalow.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/12">Such words are extremely comforting to my Shepherd's Bush constituents, as perhaps is the final gem:</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/13" class="indent">&quot;The instinct for differentiation that is deep in the human soul and which explains why so many council house dwellers used to invest in gnomes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/14">That is the view of the Conservative party's candidate for the mayoralty of London&mdash;as unfunny as it is patronising. The prospects for my constituents fill me with dread, especially those in housing need.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/15">Part 2 deals with regulation. The National Housing Federation and some Members have said that the requirements on RSLs are onerous. I beg to disagree. There are some good RSLs and some adequate ones, some of whom operate in my constituency. They are usually the ones who pay most attention to tenants and whose boards have the most tenant participation. For the past five years, until recently, the management committee of Shepherd's Bush housing association was chaired by Ron Lawrence&mdash;a tenant and a superb advocate of social housing, whom I hope to see next week when he collects his MBE from the palace. However, that association is the exception that proves the rule.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/16">My general experience of RSLs is that they give tenants an indifferent, sometimes poor, service, and are unaccountable to their tenants. Notting Hill housing trust, for example, appears to have completely forgotten its rental tenants in the push for home ownership. The Peabody trust is busy selling off 10 per cent. of its stock at market values, while Genesis, William Sutton and Catalyst are rolling over before the demands of Tory councils intent on minimising the amount of social housing. Such RSLs need to remember why they were set up and what their purpose is, and if they are not prepared to act voluntarily, mainly through their tenants, I hope the regulation provided in the Bill will ensure that they do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/17">I welcome clauses 257 to 259 on tenant empowerment. I am pleased to be a member of the all-party group on housing co-operatives and community controlled housing, ably chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. I am also pleased that several of the large estates in my constituency, including South Acton and, I hope, Acton Vale, will pursue tenant management. That is in part because of Ealing council's appalling management of their housing stock, but it is also a positive move, which should be encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/18">I agree with the Local Government Association on two points. First, it is important that resources are given to support tenants in what is a difficult process, and often against the hostility of local authorities. Secondly, there is no reason why RSLs should not also be subject to tenant management.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/19"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1481" name="Julie Morgan">My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan)</phrase> has ably covered my final point on clause 272, so I will not go into it in detail. The clause extends the same rights to Gypsies and Travellers as are already extended to other occupants of mobile homes. It follows the decision in Connors <i> v.</i> the United Kingdom and my hon. Friend's Bill, the Caravan Sites (Security of Tenure) Bill, which I was pleased to support last year. A bit of prompting has been needed, but nevertheless I compliment the Minister on bringing the measure forward. It is an essential addition.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/20">There is, of course, also a wish list, which Shelter has provided as it always does on these occasions, on overcrowding, on ground 8 of schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1988 and on improving the private rented sector, and I hope that that goes forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/21">Let me conclude by addressing the security of tenure point. I hope that there is no threat to security of tenure from the Government. I do not believe that there is, and I ask the Minister to confirm that. I know, however, that there is such a threat from the Conservative party, which said in its policy review of this summer:</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/22" class="indent">&quot;Living in social housing should be viewed as a transition during which support is temporarily required&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/23">That is completely beyond the pale. As security is being extended in the Bill, it is ironic that the Opposition should be seeking to take it away, and I will ensure that my constituents know that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-27b.239.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="239"  time="021:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071127/debtext/71127-0018.htm#0711281000630">
	<p pid="b.239.1/1">Let me deal with targets up front. Conservatives without targets built more houses than Labour with targets. Labour set targets, in respect of which it continues to disappoint. There is no evidence that targets deliver. They have been the fig leaf which Labour Members have used today to cover their embarrassment at their failure. I know what my constituents who are looking for houses would like. They would like the houses that would be built under a Conservative Government and they would like a stamp duty policy that would help them get some of them. That is it for the discussion of targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/2">Under Labour&mdash;<i> [interruption.]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1698" name="Margaret Moran">The hon. Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran)</phrase> should listen. Her speech of denial was a classic of its kind. Under Labour, as she was reminded, an average of 145,290 homes a year have been built. In the last 10 years of the previous Conservative Government, the average was 164,000 a year. Across the whole period of the Governments of Mrs. Thatcher and John Major, the average was 173,000 a year. As my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield said in his speech, people do not live in targets; they live in houses. If targets are of no consequence to Labour because it cannot meet them, what is the point? I would rather we went back to a more sensible approach. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> defined a target as what those in her local community believed to be the right number for them. They had one, they built to it and it was right. The Government came along and imposed something on top which cannot be delivered. That is why it is nonsensical for Labour to advocate targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/3">The Minister for Housing was generous in taking interventions during her contribution and made a robust defence of her policy. I appreciate what she said, although her defence of policy which is failing was admirable but wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" name="Paul Holmes">The hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes)</phrase> made two key points. He took on the central argument about why houses were not being built, and explained that it was a problem of the centre trying to take more and more powers and of no incentives for local authorities to build houses. He is right. He also noted that the attempt in the Bill to give councils the chance to build more houses was a chimera, because the money will not be made available. The hon. Gentleman spoiled it all at the end. Having described his objection to Government policy, he explained why he would not support our amendment, which was a shame.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/5">Let us get to the heart of the argument. We intend to work through the Committee and hope that we can produce a better Bill by the end of it. At the end of that process we will make a judgment as to how we will vote on Third Reading. At this stage, as our reasoned amendment makes clear, we believe that the evidence of delivery under the Government's fixation with control and top-down, unaccountable regional bodies is not good enough. It does not deliver the housing that all our constituents want, and virtually every Member seems to agree with that. The new merged agency will not deliver on its own, and the new social regulator will not deliver on its own. Those bodies will be assisted by the acquisition of new powers. That will give them greater powers at the expense of local decision making by democratic bodies, which is an answer that so many hon. Members have missed or simply swept aside.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> was angry and testy, but she made some good points. She mentioned the targets in her area and said that she does not think that they can be met. In all fairness, if she does not think that they can be met, what is the point? She also said that she has read the Bill carefully and wants to make sure that it includes a duty for the new agency to consult on planning, because she fears that it might be too aggressive in its controls.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> spoke with the knowledge gained from his previous experience and made a number of suggestions for when the Bill is in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> made an excellent speech with the benefit of his long experience. He discussed amending the Bill to introduce a national mobility scheme, which makes a great deal of sense. He also discussed the danger of the new agency acquiring too many powers, in which he was not alone. In a number of interventions on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">his colleagues, the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> drew attention to what he sees as the agency taking more powers away from councils, and he is right about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/9">The <i> Local Government Chronicle </i>headline for <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November</phrase> stated &quot;Planning grab fears. Housing quango may silence councils on new towns&quot;. That headline could have been written by my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield&mdash;that is his sort of language. The editorial stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/10" class="indent">&quot;Clearly, the government's housing targets are too precious to leave solely to local government. Housing Minister Iain Wright&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/11">who is on the Government Front Bench&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/12" class="indent">&quot;is explicit on our front page this week, when he says that the agency is there to 'challenge' authorities that drag their heels over housing quotas. While this is an attempt to mitigate some of the NIMBYism that blights housing supply, it also takes some of the local out of local government. One of the crucial components of councils' ability to 'place-shape' is planning, and if they can be steamrollered over where housing and eco-towns are located, their role as local community leaders is significantly undermined.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/13" class="indent">We need urgent clarifications on just how these planning powers will be used, or else we could find the Bill takes us two steps forward, one big leap back.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-27b.255.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1725" speakername="Desmond Swayne" colnum="255"  time="022:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071127/debtext/71127-0021.htm#0711283000050">
	<p pid="b.255.4/1">Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I was saying, I share the Lymington river with my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East. It forms the dividing line between our two parliamentary divisions, and we have both received an enormous correspondence&mdash;and amount of lobbying&mdash;about the issues that I wish to raise this evening. My hon. Friend has apologised to me for not being able to be in his place this evening, but he had already entered into a commitment when I learned, at 12.30 pm on Thursday, that I had secured this debate. I believe that, even as we speak, he is at sea with the Royal Navy.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/2">The port of Lymington makes a contribution to my local economy that is not far short of &pound;100 million a year. The harbour exists only because it is protected from the waves of the western Solent by Lymington's salt marsh and mud flats, but the problem is that they have been eroding since 1920. I understand that New Forest district council's coastal protection team estimates that the current rate of erosion is between 2 yd and 6 yd a year at the periphery, and 1 yd a year on average in the harbour itself. At that rate, the salt marshes will cease to exist by some date between 2030 and 2040. That will mean that the vast majority of existing moorings in the harbour will become unviable, which will be an economic disaster for Lymington.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/3">The Lymington harbour commission has been working on the problem since the early 1990s. Over the past two and a half years, in association with the consultants Black &amp; Veatch, it has come up with a scheme that is both viable and affordable. I stress the word &quot;affordable&quot;, as we are not asking for Government money&mdash;indeed, to do so in an Adjournment debate would be out of order.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/4">The plan is to build a series of overlapping breakwaters over the next 25 years, with work starting next year, if permission is obtained. The breakwaters will do exactly what the salt marshes do now. They will protect the harbour from the waves of the western Solent but, crucially, they will also protect the surviving salt marsh that they enclose. Let us be clear: if we do nothing, we will lose not only the harbour but the salt marsh.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/5">The salt marshes fall within the Southampton Water special protection area and are a very important wildlife site, especially for overwintering and breeding birds. The area also falls within the Solent special area of conservation, which is protected by the habitats directive, and it is, indeed, a European Natura 2000 site.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/6">Notwithstanding the permitted development rights of the Lymington harbour commissioners under the Pier and Harbour Order (Lymington) Confirmation Act 1951, the proposed breakwaters will require planning permission from the New Forest national park authority. To that end, an environmental assessment has been made and I understand that the statutory consultees will sit down and scrutinise the draft assessment on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December</phrase>. However, I think I am correct in saying that, whoever the statutory consultees are, they will be led by Natural England, which has a national policy of not interfering to secure coastal protection where deterioration is the result of a natural process.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/7">The breakwater's footprints will be on the existing salt marsh, and I understand it is likely that Natural England will judge that an adverse effect. It will not take into account the fact that, although the salt marsh footprint will be given up to the breakwater, a larger amount of the salt marsh that will otherwise disappear will be saved by the breakwaters. The salt marsh land occupied by the breakwaters will cease to exist anyway as a consequence of the continuing erosion.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/8">If the Lymington harbour commissioners cannot get Natural England to acquiesce to their proposition, and if Natural England persists in saying it will be an adverse development for the salt marsh, the commissioners' only recourse will be to make a case to the Secretary of State on the basis of overwhelming public interest. If the Secretary of State accepts the case, the commissioners will have to enter into an arrangement with Natural England to compensate the organisation for loss of the salt marsh by paying for the creation and stewardship of an equal amount of salt marsh elsewhere in the kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/9">It is into that Alice in Wonderland world that I want the Minister to intrude. It is absurd to ask the Lymington harbour commissioners to pay for the creation of 5 acres of salt marsh elsewhere because they are taking action to save 12 acres of salt marsh in Lymington. I accept that 5 acres occupied by the breakwaters will be given up, but that land would be lost anyway. If we do nothing we shall lose all the salt marsh and the harbour, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/10">I hope that the Minister will be able to provide some reassurance to the large number of organisations and people in Lymington who are rightly concerned about these developments. Those supporting the Lymington harbour commission include the harbour advisory group, the sailing clubs, the marinas, the chamber of commerce, New Forest district council, Wightlink and the hundreds of constituents who have written to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/11">The second issue I ask the Minister to deal with is the plan by Wightlink significantly to increase the size of the ferries that operate between Lymington and Yarmouth, which is in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase>&mdash;I am glad that he is in the Chamber tonight. A few weeks ago, I attended a public meeting about the plans in Lymington. The meeting was highly charged; it was packed&mdash;more than 300 people attended&mdash;and a number of questions were asked, which might have been answered by Natural England had it taken the trouble to send someone to the meeting. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-02">2 November</phrase>, I wrote to Natural England asking why it had not taken that opportunity but I have not yet had a reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/12">Had I been granted a whole parliamentary day to examine the issue, we should still not have covered it all, as I discovered at the meeting. If the Minister will forgive me, I shall briefly summarise the issues as I see them. There are three competing interests. The first is the environmental interest. There are those who insist that the significantly increased ferry size will generate a bow wave&mdash;a wash&mdash;such that it will accelerate the erosion of the salt marshes. Equally, there are those who argue, on the basis of tests carried out in tanks in Zurich, that new modern ferries will generate a reduced wash, although the counter-argument is that those tests were carried out in relatively deep water and the port of Lymington is relatively shallow. What is more, when countering a side wind, the directional thrust of the engine type that is unique to Wightlink's operations will have a deleterious effect on the sides of the channel.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/13">The second interest is the commercial one: the need of enterprise and jobs in Lymington for an efficient ferry service to the Isle of Wight. That has to be set against the commercial interests of the trade generated by the huge number of leisure craft that operate from the port of Lymington. It is the case, however, that the current ferry service is uneconomic; it will lose money unless investment is put into new ferries that are cost-effective, modern and meet contemporary regulations and standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/14">The third interest is the interest of the other river users, principally the yachtsmen, the sailing clubs and the marinas. There is an argument that the new greatly increased size of ferry will inconvenience them or put them in significant danger. When I refer to the size of the new ferries, I do not just mean the relatively modest increase in capacity; I am also referring to the greatly increased displacement of water, the increased deadweight and the increased thrust. The argument is that all sorts of activities that now take place in the Lymington river will not be able to continue, particularly the free sailing training that is afforded by the sailing clubs to youngsters, many of whom are from less advantaged backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/15">All of this has resulted in an enormous row. I have no doubt that assessments, modelling and sea trials might provide some of the answers to the disputed questions, but I do not believe that that will solve the dispute itself, because the reality is that these ferries are already half-built and many people in Lymington feel that, whatever the outcome, they are being presented with a fait accompli.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/16">Into this m&ecirc;l&eacute;e steps the Lymington harbour commission, of which I have spoken. It insists that because Lymington is designated as an open port it has no ability to deny the ferries access. Indeed, it cannot deny anyone access; I am told that even a supertanker can have access to the Lymington river and all the Lymington harbour commissioners can do is impose measures to mitigate the impact. Measures to mitigate the impact might well affect other river users as well. Even if such mitigation is imposed directly on Wightlink&mdash;in the form of a slower speed limit, for instance&mdash;that will affect other river users, because it will mean that ferries will occupy the river channel for longer in any hour, to their disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/17">The following is the essential point I wish to make to the Minister. If an undertaking of this size and sort had taken place on land there would have been a planning application and all the objections and interests would have properly been taken into account in the determination of it, but because this is happening at sea apparently no one needs any permission to apply for anything, notwithstanding all the designations&mdash;I have spoken of Natura 2000. I believe this is an enormous omission in our planning system, on which Ministers should reflect and act. A Planning Bill has been published today, and an appropriate amendment to it might prevent these situations from arising in future&mdash;but that would not, of course, be retrospective.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/18">There will, however, be a planning application. Indeed, there is one because of the effects on land. In order to accommodate the new ferries, there has to be some shore works at Lymington, and a planning application has been put in. According to the Minister for the South East, in response to a written question of mine of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November</phrase>&mdash;column 243&mdash;this planning application will be determined by the Marine and Fisheries Agency, and it will consider the opinion of Natural England that Wightlink's proposals constitute a plan or project for the purposes of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c) Regulations 1994, and therefore an appropriate assessment will be required.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/19">Wightlink will argue that the proposals do not constitute a plan or a project. So the conservationists and the yachtsmen of Lymington are, in effect, looking for the Marine and Fisheries Agency to act as the seventh cavalry and come down on the side of Natural England and its assessment of what is a plan or a project. Equally, it might all end up being settled by a judge in court, at great expense to everyone. I want to know from the Minister whether there is any other statutory body that is in a position to demand an appropriate assessment before the matter is determined and the shore works take place.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.4/20">I accept that this process of dealing with the issue is better than none, but it falls far short of a proper planning inquiry, because the appropriate assessment will take into account only the environmental interests. It will take no account of the commercial interests, or, most important, the leisure craft interests. The sailors of Lymington have the most to lose, but their voice is not going to be heard&mdash;and it ought to be.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-27b.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="258"  time="022:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071127/debtext/71127-0021.htm#0711283000051">
	<p pid="b.258.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1725" name="Desmond Swayne">the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne)</phrase> on obtaining this debate, which is obviously on an important subject. He has made his case enthusiastically. I regret that I may have to confirm a lot of the things that he has already said, but I need to do that for the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/2">The hon. Gentleman asks how the salt marshes and Lymington harbour itself can be protected from the open seas. As he has stated, this is an important site. The salt marshes and mudflats at Lymington estuary are internationally designated as part of the Solent and Southampton water special protection area for birds. They constitute a Ramsar site, and are part of the Solent maritime special area of conservation. They are also part of the national sites of special scientific interest series.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/3">Natural England has confirmed that recent studies have estimated that the Solent will lose around 700 hectares of salt marsh over the next 100 years due to sea level rises and increased erosion, and that there will also be losses of inter-tidal mud and sand. The coast is able to adapt to sea level rises, as it has over the centuries, by rolling back. Much of the Solent is developed and not available for such dynamic change. However, there are sites where such adaptation can occur and this is the only way that salt marshes can be part of the Solent's suite of habitats into the future. It is not&mdash;I repeat, not&mdash; sustainable to maintain salt marshes in situ in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/4">Natural England is working through the shoreline management plan process to enable important habitats to roll back where appropriate. There is limited scope in Lymington for such a roll-back. A water level management plan led by the Environment Agency is exploring the possibility of allowing salt marsh to form up-river from the harbour, where it will naturally migrate under climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/5">However, I can see the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument that, if the salt marsh habitat in the Lymington river will ultimately disappear through the effects of sea level rises, a temporary artificial intervention to protect at least part of this asset in the short term should be welcomed. The merits of that approach, however, need to be very carefully assessed and weighed against the potential loss, in so doing, of some of that habitat. In particular, it is necessary to undertake sophisticated modelling to ensure that, as far as possible, any proposal would not have unforeseen effects that could exacerbate the loss of the salt marsh.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/6">Regarding the proposed breakwater development in Lymington harbour, as the hon. Gentleman knows, this lies within the New Forest national park and consequently the New Forest national park authority is the appropriate local planning authority. However, I understand that Lymington harbour commissioners are relying on permitted development rights&mdash;a general development order under section 25 of the Pier and Harbour Order (Lymington) Confirmation Act 1951&mdash;to pursue the development. As such, the new breakwaters do not require planning permission from the New Forest national park authority. However, as the proposal affects an international site, the national park's approval will still be required under regulation 62 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations 1994.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/7">The regulations say that where a developer relies on a general development order, the developer still has to make an application in writing to the local planning authority for its approval. The regulations state that</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/8" class="indent">&quot;the local planning authority shall, taking account of any representations made by the appropriate nature conservation body, make an appropriate assessment of the implications of the development for the European site in view of that site's conservation objectives.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/9">As the hon. Gentleman said, the New Forest national park authority is awaiting the production by Black &amp; Veatch&mdash;consultants working on behalf of the Lymington harbour commissioners&mdash;of a draft environmental statement to support an environmental impact assessment and an appropriate assessment. I understand that Natural England has provided some informal feedback on the drafting of the statement and impact assessment in meetings with the harbour commissioners, and Natural England intends to respond formally in writing to the commissioners next month. As yet, no application for consent to the breakwater proposal has been submitted to the Marine and Fisheries Agency. Assuming that an application is made in due course, it will need to be supported by an environmental statement incorporating a draft appropriate assessment. In considering any such application, the MFA will consult formally with Natural England. Despite what the hon. Gentleman said, Natural England has no pre-formed view on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/10">As the hon. Gentleman said, a meeting for Black &amp; Veatch, Natural England, the national park authority and the MFA is scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December</phrase>, at which the results of that work will be heard. Until the regulators have seen the report, it would be inappropriate for them to take a formal position on the proposal. Clearly, they could not have gone to the meeting that has been described. As members of a statutory body, the Lymington harbour commissioners have a duty under section 62 of the Environment Act 1995 to take into account the impact of their decisions on the national park. The national park authority considers the coastal landscape outside Lymington harbour to be of very high importance because of its unspoilt natural beauty. The area is highly sensitive and could be irreversibly damaged by inappropriate or unsympathetic development, so there is a responsibility on the harbour commissioners to ensure that the highest possible standards of design, and the best materials, are applied in the construction of the breakwaters to protect the special qualities of the national park.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/11">The national park authority recognises the significance of the national conservation interest and the level of legal protection it is afforded, but it is also aware of the socio-economic importance of Lymington harbour, and it is therefore keen to ensure a balanced, sustainable solution to the problems facing the port. The harbour needs a solution that takes into account nature conservation and landscape and environmental issues, while securing the future of the recreational and commercial activities that sustain the local economy and enrich the life of local communities and visitors. The national park authority is keen to support a sustainable solution that meets the range of legitimate demands made on the part of the New Forest concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/12">The hon. Gentleman pointed out that it is possible for the Secretary of State to consider an application for</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/13" class="indent">&quot;imperative reasons of overriding public interest&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/14">and he seeks an assurance on the issue. I am sorry to disappoint him, but it is obvious that until the results of the appropriate assessment are available I can comment no further on that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/15">The hon. Gentleman is correct that the Wightlink application has been received by the Marine Fisheries Agency. Wightlink applied for a licence under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, and for consent under the Coast Protection Act 1949 for works to improve the ferry berth and access ramps in Lymington. In considering such applications the MFA endeavours to satisfy legitimate development aspirations and to promote economic growth, commensurate with delivering sustainable development. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that all applications for marine works are subject to rigorous scientific evaluation to prevent or minimise any adverse environmental effects and prevent undue interference for other users of the sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/16">In dealing with the application the MFA has consulted a range of marine stakeholders and other regulators, including Natural England, which has a statutory duty to advise on nature conservation issues. In considering whether to grant consent, NE has advised that the MFA should also have regard to the potential impact of Wightlink's intention to replace the current ferries with larger and more powerful vessels. In its view a formal appropriate assessment should be carried out. Natural England also suggested that the scheme may be a relevant project under the Marine Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2007. Wightlink, as the hon. Gentleman said, has challenged NE's stance with its own legal advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/17">The MFA has not yet taken a view on these matters but will have full regard to the responses that it has received, together with the expert advice of the Department's marine scientists. Although the proposed vessels are understood to have a significantly larger superstructure and correspondingly greater displacement, more information about their propulsion, operational speed and service frequency will be needed to assess better any risks. The Lymington harbour commissioners manage the Lymington river and harbour in accordance with the Lymington Harbour Orders of 1951 to 2002. Although they have indicated that the construction works will have no adverse effect, it is not clear to what extent they have assessed the potential effects of operating larger ferries.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/18">I understand, as does the hon. Gentleman, that New Forest district council says that planning permission is required. No doubt the larger ferries may also have implications for road traffic and other planning-related matters. Accordingly, the agency intends shortly to meet Wightlink, the harbour commissioners, Natural England and New Forest district council to consider how each regulator will take forward the process of appropriate assessment. The matter needs to be sorted out between those regulators. They will need to address how the potential risks associated with the operation of larger vessels can be properly assessed and what measures may be available, if necessary, to mitigate their effect on the environment and other river users. The results of the appropriate assessments may, of course, have an impact on the time scale for the introduction of the ferries or the operating arrangements for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/19">I have done my best to obtain all the relevant information in order to assist the hon. Member for New Forest, West and his constituents. We are dealing with very complex matters in trying to conserve our beautiful places and our biodiversity while satisfying human demand for economic opportunity, trade and leisure. It is important to explore the issues and this has been an important debate. I heard what the hon. Gentleman said, and I trust that he will understand why it is not possible for me to give him more definitive answers at this juncture.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/20" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/21" class="italic"> Adjourned accordingly at twelve minutes to Eleven o'clock.</p>
