	<p pid="a.1583.7/1">The Bill includes a number of important measures that will help families with transport. The cost of transport is a barrier, particularly for low-income families, which is why the Bill extends the entitlement to free school transport. There is a general duty on local authorities to assess all pupils' travel needs; local authorities' current focus is on 7 per cent. of pupils. When the new travel plans in the Bill&mdash;another measure for disadvantaged pupils against which, regrettably, Liberal Democrats voted last night&mdash;come into force more families will benefit from the opportunity for their children to attend the school of their choice.</p>

	<p pid="a.1584.5/1">The chief inspector's latest annual report shows that the quality of science teaching and learning is good or better in nearly three quarters of secondary schools. We are improving that teaching and learning further by making the school science curriculum more engaging; improving teacher recruitment; providing more and better professional development; and introducing a new statutory entitlement to study science programmes leading to at least two GCSEs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1584.6/1">I thank the Minister for her reply. Yesterday, the CBI warned of the erosion of core science and engineering skills in this country, describing the decline in the number of science graduates as a car crash in slow motion. Does the Minister agree that the situation will not be turned around without serious improvement in the quality of science teaching in British schools? When 40 per cent. of all chemistry lessons are taught by non-chemists, is it any wonder that the country is not producing enough 18-year-olds with a love of, or an interest in, science?</p>

	<p pid="a.1584.7/1">The hon. Gentleman is quite right, as are the CBI and others, to identify the importance for the economy of high numbers of science understanding and science graduates. That is why, for example, the introduction of specialised diplomas with an emphasis on applied science in areas such as engineering is important and why we need to continue working, as he suggested, on the quality of teachers. It is reassuring that, whereas in 1997&ndash;98 we recruited 2,790 people to teacher training places for science, in 2004&ndash;05 the number increased to 3,460.</p>

	<p pid="a.1585.1/1">Like other higher education institutions, the University of Sussex is, rightly, an autonomous organisation. Students in the south-east will be reassured to know not only that the number of home full-time undergraduates studying chemistry has risen by 6 per cent. since 1999 but that the Higher Education Funding Council, working with the surrounding universities, particularly Reading, Southampton and Surrey, has already ensured that the places lost at Sussex will be provided at those other universities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1585.2/1">I, for one, am very grateful for the extensive work that we have done to renew science facilities in schools. However, the reality is that the number of young women who are entering engineering apprenticeships is pitifully low, because we do not have sufficient resources aimed at promoting and taking women into work. What will my right hon. Friend do to address that very low figure and try to improve the number of women going into engineering apprenticeships?</p>

	<p pid="a.1585.3/1">My hon. Friend has a strong background in this area and has pushed me on numerous occasions on precisely that issue. There is the work that I know that she supported in respect of women in science and engineering, the task of ensuring that there are role models for young people, the introduction of the specialised engineering diploma that I mentioned previously and the task of ensuring that, as we improve information, advice and guidance for young people, we enable, for example, young women to undertake taster courses in areas such as engineering so that they realise that engineering is not only something for them, but needs their talents.</p>

	<p pid="a.1585.6/1">The Department's own research has pointed to a crisis in specialist physics and chemistry teachers in deprived areas in particular.

	<p pid="a.1586.0/1">In the science curriculum in mainstream British secondary schools from September, creationism is to be taught alongside Darwin's theory of evolution. Does the Minister welcome that, as students should understand the context in which scientific ideas arise and reinterpretation of empirical evidence can generate scientific controversy?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1586.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" speakername="Jacqui Smith" colnum="1586"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-01.htm#60316-01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.1586.1/1">In fact, neither creationism, nor intelligent design are taught as subjects in schools and they are not specified in the programme of study for the science curriculum. In fact the national curriculum for science clearly sets out that pupils should be taught that the fossil record is evidence for evolution and that that is a fact. As my hon. Friend identifies, there will be opportunities, perhaps in RE lessons or in science, to consider scientific controversy and the issue of creationism may come up in that context, but it is not, of course, a factual element of the science curriculum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1586.2/1">In the spirit of the consensus that was developed yesterday, I thought that, together, we might tackle science teaching in our schools. One of the unforeseen consequences of the Conservative Government's making science compulsory was the proliferation of the double science award GCSE, which is now almost universal in the state sector and likely to remain so even with the Minister's reforms. For someone going on to study three sciences at A-level, that means a reduction of a third in the amount of science that he or she studies at GCSE. Does she agree that we need much better science teaching in our comprehensives and far more students studying the three separate sciences at GCSE?</p>

	<p pid="a.1586.3/2">It is important that we ensure, in the way in which science is taught, particularly at key stage 4, that we provide our young people with both the knowledge and the enthusiasm to continue to study science at a later stage. That is why one of the things that we voted for yesterday was an entitlement for every pupil to study at least two science GCSEs. Part of the way in which that entitlement will be represented in schools will include the study of three separate science subjects. I am confident that, whether we are talking about the science and advanced science option, or the three single science options, that will provide young people with the knowledge and enthusiasm to carry on studying science at a later stage in greater numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1587.4/1">No. I thought for a moment that I was going to agree with my hon. Friend on something, but sadly not. I can assure the House that I will never compel a school to become a trust school, although it should be an option for a local authority, where a school is failing, to look at whether a trust is one way in which it could raise standards. The Labour party does not agree with the Conservative party, which in the minority report of the Education and Skills Committee insisted that all schools should be compelled to become trust schools.</p>

It is my view that the more schools see that working in practice, the more will be interested in trusts, but it is right to have a voluntary approach because in the end head teachers know best what is in the interests of raising standards.</p>

Where a school considers it to be in its interest to acquire a trust, it should have the opportunity to do that. That will help the school deepen its existing partnerships with its specialist schools relationships, and enable schools to build federations and collaboratives of schools working together to raise standards, which is particularly important in the light of our commitment to enable every young person from the age of 14 to study vocational education&mdash;yet again, a measure delivered by the Education and Inspections Bill.</p>

The Minister is aware of my concerns about education funding in Bournemouth in general. My question is specifically to do with the fact that staff salaries at further education colleges, such as Bournemouth and Poole college, are often significantly lower than those of staff teaching the same subjects in a school. I know that the Government have taken some initiatives, but as long as teachers are receiving &pound;2,000 a year more at a school than at further education colleges, colleges will be unable to compete in recruiting and retaining staff&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1590.2/1">Let me be clear that negotiations are a matter for colleges and the trade unions. No college in the country would thank the Government for intervening directly on the issue. It all comes back to funding. Since 1997 the Government have increased funding to the further education sector by 48 per cent. in real terms, which compares favourably with the 14 per cent. real-terms cut that took place in the five years running up to 1997. We envisage that with those increased resources, greater flexibility as regards their use and a longer-term funding framework, colleges should be able to address the structural barriers&mdash;</p>

I assure him that all maintained schools, including trust schools, are under a duty after being consulted to admit children whose statements name their school, so the policy is clear and categorical. On top of that, the framework includes early intervention and advice through SEN co-ordinators, which has led to a significant improvement in performance&mdash;an increase of some 10 percentage points in the proportion of statements that are dealt with within the statutory time limit of 18 weeks in the five years running up to 2005.

Only last week, I met a group of parents in my constituency who expressed their concerns about statementing and the inclusion in mainstream schooling of children with autism and Asperger's syndrome. Schools cannot cope, and the parents did not feel that the action being taken was appropriate. Will the Minister share with the House his thoughts on why Government figures show that the number of children with special educational needs, but no statement, has increased?

On the key criterion of the percentage of statements without exceptions that are drafted within the 18-week target, performance has risen from 82 per cent. to 92 per cent. in the five years running up to 2005.

The number of adult places on courses contributing directly to those priorities might reduce. However, some 274,000 additional level 2 places will be created through our new train to gain programme&mdash;a &pound;630 million programme over the next two years to deliver training of the kind that employers need through a demand-led system.

The trust school model is aimed precisely at building on the good experience in our system of the past eight years, such as the contribution that external partners make to the specialist school movement and the way in which schools are beginning to collaborate for the benefit of their pupils. However, as my hon. Friend rightly says, those collaborations are too often dependent on the enthusiasm and commitment of dedicated individuals.

The ability to embed such collaboration, make it permanent and bring in external support is one of the key benefits of the trust school model.</p>

	<p pid="a.1596.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. The provision in the Childcare Bill of a duty on local authorities to ensure that there is sufficient child care involves not only a sufficient quantity but a sufficient range and flexibility of child care to meet local parents' needs. That will have to be part of a local authority's obligations. Of course, that does not mean that the local authorities themselves will provide that child care, but they will have sufficient resources to stimulate the market and ensure that it responds with the quantity and range of provision that local parents need.</p>

	<p pid="a.1596.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is being unnecessarily alarmist. There is clear research evidence that high quality early-years experience for three and four-year-old children considerably enhances their development and, in comparison to their peers who do not have that experience, gives them a considerable advantage at the start of their primary school education. Clearly, many parents of younger children will want a range of options. That is why, in addition to stimulating the provision of good quality child care, this Government&mdash;unlike the previous Conservative Government&mdash;have made it possible for mothers and fathers who are balancing their work and home life to make the decisions that they feel are right about where their very young children should be cared for.</p>

However, it is open to the CPS, under section 36 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, to prevent the accused from personally cross-examining a witness. The court must be satisfied that the quality of evidence given by a witness under cross-examination is likely to be diminished if the cross-examination is conducted by the accused, that it may be improved if the accused does not cross-examine the witness, and that it would not be contrary to the interests of justice to restrict cross-examination by the accused.</p>

	<p pid="a.1600.4/1">My hon. and learned Friend will know that the first full performance review of the CPS was published on Tuesday. It showed that performance was less than good in more than half of CPS areas and that in most, there was a failure to communicate with victims of crime&mdash;to tell them that charges had either been dropped or reduced. Those are damning criticisms of the CPS. What steps is my hon. and learned Friend going to take to ensure that the Director of Public Prosecutions is aware of these failings&mdash;and what is the CPS going to do to get its act together?</p>

	<p pid="a.1600.6/1">The overall assessment of the recent analysis was that three CPS areas were &quot;excellent&quot;, 16 were &quot;good&quot;, 19 were &quot;fair&quot; and four were &quot;poor&quot;. So some 45 per cent. of CPS areas are either &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, and 90 per cent. are for the most part complying with relevant standards satisfactorily. The inspectorate also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/2" class="indent">&quot;we are confident that the performance generally across the CPS is improving.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/3">A lot of good work has already been undertaken in the past year through the charging programme, the &quot;No Witness, No Justice&quot; programme and the effective trial management programme. We predict that by December 2007, due to the steps that we are taking, 12,000 more trials will go ahead per year than do so currently.</p>

The murder principle set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will also remain. The Government passed that Act to ensure effective sentencing principles in dealing with murder cases, which, I have to say&mdash;given the way that the hon.

	<p pid="a.1601.3/1">Does the Solicitor-General agree that it is far better to respond to the Law Commission's proposals in the rational and measured way that it made its proposals, than in the histrionic manner that we just heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the hon.

The Law Commission has made it clear that the law is in a mess, that it is not saying and doing what the public think it is, and that it needs reform. The best way to get reform is to have a rational debate and to build consensus. Will the Solicitor-General commend the Law Commission's very sensible proposals?</p>

	<p pid="a.1601.4/1">The proposals are out for consultation and will remain so for only a few more weeks, so I suggest that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase>&mdash;who asked the &quot;histrionic&quot; question, as the hon.

	<p pid="a.1601.5/1">The Solicitor-General will be aware that the Law Commission proposes that, although first-degree murder would continue to carry the mandatory life sentence, second-degree murder&mdash;which could involve killing a person when the intent is to commit grievous bodily harm of the most serious kind&mdash;would not. Does the Minister think that it might be useful for the review also to look at how fixed-term sentences are passed, and at the disparity between what the judge says in court and the sentence that is in fact served? The public need greater reassurance that fixed-term sentences mean what they say and approximate to the period that a person might serve in prison. Would it not be possible to provide that reassurance by making it clear that the mandatory sentence was not always necessary? People latch on to the mandatory sentence because they do not have confidence in the current sentencing system.</p>

The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> is right that it is important that we consider these matters with a degree of calm and ensure that the public have confidence in the sentences that are passed. The Law Commission is looking at how such matters should be dealt with. We must await the outcome of that, but the Government are discussing how to ensure that people understand better precisely what a sentence passed by a judge will mean in practice for each defendant. There are ways to achieve that, but we must approach the matter through a process of consultation and not by making announcements here. However, I take on board the point that the hon. Gentleman makes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1604.0/1">I suspect that not all Members will be aware that this morning it has been announced in a written statement that due to chaos in the Rural Payments Agency, which is responsible for the single farm payment, the chief executive has been replaced&mdash;I assume that means sacked. May we have an oral statement on Monday from the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs so that Members can question Ministers and raise farmers' concerns about the failure of that agency?</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/2">I appreciate that there will be a statement today by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on the Government's response to the parliamentary ombudsman's report, &quot;Trusting in the pensions promise&quot;. However, the Government's initial attempt to dismiss the ombudsman's findings called into question her role and her ability to act on the referrals that she receives from hon. Members. Constituents assume that the ombudsman is the last line of defence against possible maladministration by the Government. The ombudsman serves this House. Will the right hon. Gentleman arrange for a debate on the role and powers of the parliamentary ombudsman?</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/3">The latest annual study by the Association of Directors of Social Services shows that council social services departments have a funding shortfall of &pound;1.76 billion, some of which is due to deficits in the health service. Crucially, that means that councils are cutting the provision of services to elderly and other vulnerable people. May we have a statement on joint funding and working between health and social services and a debate on the provision of social care?</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/4">In business questions recently, I, and other hon. Members, asked for a debate on the withdrawal of the Post Office card account and the possible resultant closure of 10,000 post offices. The right hon. Gentleman dismissed those concerns. Last week, in reply to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/5" class="indent">&quot;No one is suggesting that people should be forced to use the banks. Indeed, I have been at great pains to emphasise that there is a range of accounts available at the post office&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 955.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/6">I have checked the Post Office website. There are indeed accounts that can be used at the post office. They are accounts that are held at Abbey, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bank of Ireland, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Clydesdale Bank, the Co-operative Bank, First Trust Bank&mdash;the list goes on. Unless I am mistaken&mdash;and the names do rather give it away&mdash;those are all banks, although there is one building society, the Nationwide. Will the right hon. Gentleman explain to the House what accounts the Post Office provides as an alternative to the card account? I ask him again for a debate on the future of the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/7">Finally, may we have a debate on standards of financial management? I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman was concerned that the treasurer of the Labour Party did not know that the party had received a loan of &pound;1.5 million. I wonder what account the money went into if the treasurer did not know about it. Should we assume that the money went into a hedge fund? The Labour party treasurer is married to the Minister of State at the Department for Constitutional Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1472" name="Harriet Harman">the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase> who speaks for the Government on the funding of political parties. Indeed, in a debate in Westminster Hall on <phrase class="date" code="">8 November</phrase> last year, the right hon. and learned Lady said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/8" class="indent">&quot;We do not have any millionaires in Peckham, and we probably do not have any people who would donate &pound;5,000&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/9">She went on to say in reference to local party members:</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/10" class="indent">&quot;If they think that donations are entirely the remit of millionaires, they will feel that they themselves do not matter&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">8 November 2005</phrase>; Vol. 439, c. 20WH.]</p>

Where there are problems, it is obviously right that the Government and accountable Ministers should take the action necessary to bring about an improvement in the situation. I can assure the House that that is precisely what my right hon. Friend has done through her decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1605.1/3">On pensions, I can assure the House that no one is dismissing the report of the parliamentary ombudsman. Indeed, after business questions, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will make a statement to the House about the report, as is appropriate. As the House is aware, it has a proper process for dealing with reports from the parliamentary ombudsman and, as I understand it, that proper process will be pursued by the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, which again is as it should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.1605.1/4">The responsible Minister at the Department of Health is looking at any shortfalls that may arise in social services. I have made clear to the House before the importance of health service bodies being able to deal with deficits and having appropriate procedures and accountancy standards to deal with them. I am sure that all Members want the huge amount of extra money that the Government have put into the health service to be spent wisely and effectively on continuing to improve health care both for the elderly, in conjunction with social services across the country, and for all other users of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1605.1/5">I look forward to the right hon. Member for Maidenhead telling the House about the evidence on which she relied when suggesting, in rather emotive terms, that 10,000 rural post offices will be closing. I have seen that in headlines and in newspapers and although there is a tendency for the Opposition to believe all they read in the <i>Daily Mail</i>, it is not necessarily the best source for research or advice. Nevertheless, I take seriously the future of the Post Office&mdash;the Government take it extremely seriously. I have previously set out the position on Post Office accounts and accounts that can be used at the post office. It is important that pensioners and others get the best return on their savings and their money. I have generally assumed that the Conservative party supports financial improvement for pensioners, so I am a little surprised that week in, week out Opposition Members continue to suggest that pensioners should not get the best return on their savings and their accounts. That is the implication of the right hon. Lady's suggestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1605.1/6">The Government have introduced clear standards of transparency on financial management in respect of donations&mdash;<i>[Laughter.]</i> Quite why that should cause the Opposition so much entertainment is difficult to understand. Without those arrangements we would not be aware of the range of contributions that have been made to the Conservative party over the years. The Government have no difficulty about discussing such matters and I am surprised that Opposition Members are not a little more embarrassed about the history of the arrangements in their party.</p>

	<p pid="a.1606.0/1">The evidence on which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> might have been relying was the words of Adam Crozier, the chief executive of the Post Office, who might be expected to know about the Post Office system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606.0/2">The Leader of the House cannot just sweep aside an issue that the treasurer of the Labour party calls impropriety. Is the right hon. Gentleman not at all ashamed that there should be even a suspicion that in this country people can buy a place in Parliament? There is nothing wrong with loans to political parties, if they are transparent and if they do not buy preference, but should not we have a debate on removing patronage altogether from Parliament and stopping millionaires from payrolling parties the money they need to go about their business?</p>
	<p pid="a.1606.0/3">I note that the Leader of the House has arranged for a debate on the costs of the actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, which I welcome. But is there not a need for a wider foreign affairs debate, dealing with not only what is now acknowledged by the Secretary of State for Defence as a prospective civil war in Iraq and the continuing situation in Afghanistan, but also the crisis in Palestine? We need an opportunity to debate the British position on these matters more fully than the time available for the statement would permit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606.0/4">Lastly, I wonder whether we ought to have a debate on the teaching of English in universities, because I am very concerned that the Home Secretary, who went to Cambridge&mdash;which some say is a reputable university&mdash;appears to think that a scheme that is compulsory for everybody who drives a car and for everybody who wants to go on holiday is somehow voluntary. For nine out of 10 people in this country it will be compulsory, so I do think that perhaps we need a debate on English comprehension.</p>

	<p pid="a.1607.0/1">Well, as someone who has suffered at the same institution as my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, I am confident that we both understand English and that we can both explain it with the same ability. I recognise that in the recent past the hon. Gentleman has had some difficulty understanding my replies. I will do my best to make them clearer to him, not least because he has at least accepted the House's advice in relation to his political ambitions&mdash;I see that he is planning to become the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats. We all congratulate him on that, and if I were to get a vote, I would be voting for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1607.0/2">On the question of political patronage, I assure the hon. Gentleman that in any event, rightly, it is against the law for honours to be sold&mdash;a law that I think was passed by the House as a result of the activities of a previous Liberal Democrat Prime Minister. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry; I should correct that&mdash;Liberal Prime Minister.</p>

This week we had Foreign and Commonwealth Office questions, where I know that my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary went out of his way to provide as much detail as he could at the time in relation to recent and very troubling events in Palestine.

Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang)</phrase>, I recognise the changes that have come about in terms of transparency since we were elected, but I wish to restate the need for a statement in view of the controversy. Given all the circumstances, perhaps it would be wise for all the latest nominations for peerages from the three parties to be withdrawn. At long last, after all these years&mdash;this issue goes back a long time indeed&mdash;is it not essential that we separate the connection between donating large sums of money and getting a peerage?

However, it has come to light that, because of an error in the way that the Office of the Deputy Prime calculates the number of students in an area, 6.5 million people are spending &pound;82.5 million too much on their council tax.

Perhaps my only slight scepticism stems from the fact that hon. Members do not listen to the replies. Given our concern about education, I realise that there are still some Opposition Members who perhaps have not benefited from the excellent state education that the Government provide and continue to improve. However, in those circumstances, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government take very seriously the Post Office card account and the future of rural post office services, but we believe that, equally, pensioners who use the Post Office card account have an interest in moving to accounts that, for example, pay them rather better interest than they earn currently.</p>

Many people in my constituency are angry that people sent to prison are let out early to commit crimes such as the one that I have described. People want prisoners to serve their sentences in full.

	<p pid="a.1616.1/1">I apologise for my late attendance in the House&mdash;I was at a meeting with a Tesco representative. Last Saturday, I was delighted to attend an event at the Tesco superstore in my constituency to promote its involvement in Fair Trade fortnight. I was therefore outraged to find out on Monday in the local press that Tesco is shedding more than 400 jobs in my constituency, without any prior consultation with the local council, the local chamber of commerce or myself. Can we have a debate in the House to discuss employment relations to ensure that employers such as Tesco do not behave in such a cavalier fashion?</p>

I would not want him to leave the House with the impression that there is a shortfall in the number of people studying chemistry, as chemistry course applications and acceptances through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service rose by more than 12 per cent. last year, compared with a national average increase of 7 per cent.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1620.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" speakername="John Hutton" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"  colnum="1620"  time="012:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-11.htm#60316-11_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.1620.1/1">With permission, I should like to make a statement on the ombudsman's report on the security of final salary occupational pensions published yesterday. The Parliamentary Commissioner's report is a detailed piece of work and, of course, deserves a proper, full and formal response. It is my intention to publish such a response in the next few weeks. However, I would like today to set out the reasons why, after very careful consideration, we have reached the view that we cannot accept any of the findings of maladministration and why we have therefore decided to reject all but one of her recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/2">The ombudsman's report concludes that over the period between 1996 and 2002, both this Government and the Conservative Government were guilty of maladministration in three principal areas. I would like to take each of those findings in turn. I make no apology for the detailed response that I am about to give. To offer anything less comprehensive would not properly reflect the importance of the report and the seriousness with which we treat the findings that the ombudsman has made against this Government and the Conservative Government. I should stress, in that context, my Department has co-operated fully with the ombudsman and her office during the preparation of the report. It has provided detailed information and documentation on request and it has commented extensively on the specific findings that the ombudsman had indicated that she intended to make. Those responses are set out in the report, included in a lengthy annexe to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/3">Turning to the individual findings: first, the ombudsman found that official information about the security that members of final salary occupational pension schemes could expect from the minimum funding requirement, introduced in the Pensions Act 1995, was sometimes inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent and therefore potentially misleading, and that that constituted maladministration. We do not accept that the Department's leaflets were inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent or misleading. It is true that some were more detailed than others, but that was because they were designed for different audiences. All the leaflets covered by the report carried very specific statements that they were not a full explanation of the law and were for general guidance only. The leaflets themselves make that clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/4">Perhaps I could illustrate those points by taking some of the key documents referred to in the report, in order. In 1996, the then Government published a guide to the 1995 Pensions Act&mdash;leaflet PEC3&mdash;which described the intention of the various measures in the Act, including the minimum funding requirement, or MFR, and how they were expected to operate. The leaflet also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/5" class="indent">&quot;This leaflet is a brief summary of the changes. If you need advice about your occupational pension, speak to the trustees or managers of the scheme . . . This leaflet gives general guidance only and should not be treated as a complete and authoritative statement of the law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/6">That was very much the pattern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/7">In July 1997, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority&mdash;OPRA&mdash;guide for pension scheme trustees summarised what the minimum funding requirement was. The guide also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/8" class="indent">&quot;You&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/9">that is, trustees&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/10" class="indent">&quot;will need to take advice from professional advisers so that you can use your powers and fulfil your duties properly. Please note that this guide should not be taken as a definitive statement of the law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/11">In May 2002, the Department issued leaflet PM3: &quot;Occupational Pensions&mdash;your guide&quot;. Although the guide did not discuss the risk of schemes winding up underfunded, it did say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/12" class="indent">&quot;this guide . . . looks at some of the questions you may need to think about and it tells you where you can find more information . . . Read any pension information your employer gives you . . . This leaflet is for guidance only. It is not a complete statement of the law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/13">The Government do not consider that any of the leaflets or quoted statements relied on by the ombudsman could have formed a proper basis for scheme members, still less trustees who were professionally advised, to assess the security of their individual pension schemes. But, even more importantly, the Government also believe that the report fails to demonstrate that decisions taken by individual scheme members were influenced by the information that the Government did, or did not, make available. In other words, the report simply does not establish that the wording of the leaflets led to the losses suffered by individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/14">I now turn to the second finding of maladministration. The ombudsman says that the failure by the Department for Work and Pensions to review its existing information leaflets, when informed that scheme members and member trustees did not know the risks to their accrued pension rights, constituted maladministration. The Government do not believe that the information given to the Department by the actuarial profession during this time should have instigated a review of its publications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/15">Those recommendations concerned how trustees&mdash;not the Government&mdash;should communicate with their members about the funding of their schemes. The Department invited views on that issue in the consultation document that it issued in September 2000 on the future of the minimum funding requirement. The response to that consultation led ultimately to proposals, which were then implemented, for the replacement of the minimum funding requirement. I want to say more about that replacement later. But so far as we are aware, no respondents suggested that departmental publications were causing confusion. They were not advising that the content of these leaflets concerning the purpose or intent of the minimum funding requirement was misleading or inaccurate. Ministers cannot fairly be criticised for failing to do something that was simply not proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/16">Moreover, trustees had access to advice from their own scheme actuary, who would have been well aware of the operation of the minimum funding requirement. In addition each MFR certificate included a statement that meeting the minimum funding requirement did not equate to full buy-out. All of this information was available to scheme members. We do not believe that it would have been reasonable for trustees to have relied on publications issued by the DWP which were brief and general in nature, rather than the professional advice they had access to and were under an obligation to consult. Trustees were required to give all scheme members basic information about their scheme, and many trustees produced fairly detailed information booklets. We have seen no evidence from the report that the ombudsman has considered what information trustees supplied to their scheme members and what, if any, impact this information might have had.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/17">Thirdly, the ombudsman has said that the decision in 2002 by the Department for Work and Pensions to approve a change to the basis of the MFR was taken with maladministration. The Government believe that we acted wholly responsibly in implementing the recommendation of the actuarial profession which had received the backing of the independent Government Actuary's Department. The ombudsman has not allowed us to see the full actuarial advice on which some of her comments were based. The Government Actuary advised the ombudsman that, if this advice was not disclosed, it made it impossible for anyone to understand the basis on which she reached her conclusion that the Government were guilty of maladministration. As a result, we have not been able to see or challenge how she arrived at some of her conclusions on the 2002 change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/18">The change in 2002 was intended to bring the MFR back to its original strength. Adjustments to the MFR were always on the principle of maintaining its 1997 level. This was the principle on which the actuarial profession kept the basis of the MFR under review and made recommendations to the Department. It was also the basis on which the Government Actuary's Department advised my Department. The report published yesterday contains a letter from the Government Actuary, referring to the decision criticised by the ombudsman, and I want to quote from it. It says that</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/19" class="indent">&quot;the evidence base&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/20">for the DWP's decision</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/21" class="indent">&quot;was not insufficient since it was based on strong advice from the actuarial profession, which had been developed by a committee containing leading technical experts from most of the major firms of actuaries, and supplemented by GAD as a further independent source of advice. The evidence base for this decision was in fact extremely strong and much stronger than for many (perhaps most) of the decisions that have to be taken by Government.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/22">The ombudsman acknowledges in her report that the 2002 change did not affect the degree of knowledge which scheme members had.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/23">Against this background, the Government have considered carefully the ombudsman's first four recommendations, which involve considering whether to restore the lost pension rights of affected scheme members, making consolatory payments and apologising to scheme trustees. As I have already made clear, the Government are unable to accept the findings on which those recommendations are based. We do not believe that the findings of maladministration can be supported by the facts. It simply cannot be right that the losses from the schemes that have collapsed should be met by the taxpayer without establishing any causal connection between the actions criticised in the ombudsman's report and the losses that people have incurred. The report fails to establish that connection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/24">Indeed, in respect of the ombudsman's fourth recommendation, relating to schemes that began to wind up between April 2004 and April 2005, the report itself acknowledges that the individuals concerned could be said to have had the opportunity to take whatever action they could to mitigate their potential loss. I do not consider that it would be in the wider public interest for Government to accept that very substantial liability on behalf of taxpayers. We calculate that liability as being in the range of &pound;13 billion and &pound;17 billion in cash terms over the next 60 years. We estimate that the administration costs would be in the region of a further &pound;20 million each year. We do not therefore intend to take the actions recommended by the ombudsman. The taxpayer cannot be asked to accept the responsibility for effectively underwriting the value of private investments in the way the report suggests.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/25">The Government do, however, accept the ombudsman's fifth recommendation with regard to reviewing the time that it takes to wind up a defined benefit pension scheme. Work is already under way in this area, and we will set out our proposals for how we intend to proceed when that work is completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620.1/26">I would like to finish by making two things absolutely clear. First, this Government have been the first to accept the moral and social obligation to make sure that as many as possible of those who have suffered hardship and distress in these circumstances receive financial support. That is why this Government have set up the financial assistance scheme, with &pound;400 million of public money. The scheme is designed to provide help to those who have lost the most and who are in the greatest need&mdash;those closest to retirement and who are therefore least able to make alternative provision. The scheme will currently help up to 15,000 people who have faced significant occupational pension losses. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.1623.1/1">The financial assistance scheme will top up those people's pensions with financial support, to give a maximum income of up to &pound;12,000 a year. The Government are prepared to look again at all aspects of the scheme as part of the current spending review, and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister yesterday made it clear that</p>
	<p pid="a.1623.1/2" class="indent">&quot;we will expedite that review and do it as quickly as we possibly can&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 1450.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1623.1/3">Secondly, this Government have led the way in providing greater levels of security for the future. We have replaced the MFR, which is of course a large part of the subject of this report, with new scheme funding arrangements that are more flexible and fit for purpose. The Pension Protection Fund and the new pensions regulator will transform security for members of defined benefit schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1623.1/4">We do not underestimate the importance of this issue for those people who have been affected by pension scheme closures, particularly when employers are insolvent and cannot make up any deficiency in scheme funding. We will continue to do what we can to help them. That is the fair and sensible way for us to proceed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1624.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="1624"  time="012:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-12.htm#60316-12_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1624.0/1">May I start with the bit that the Secretary of State missed out? On behalf of Opposition Members, I should like to express my sympathy for the 85,000 people who have lost their pensions through occupational pension scheme failures. Those are decent people who set out to do the right thing to try to ensure a decent retirement for themselves, and they have seen their dreams of a comfortable and secure retirement cruelly shattered. Their plight is not only a series of personal tragedies, but a tragedy for the cause of increased pension saving as confidence in the system is further undermined.</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/2">The ombudsman's report specifically addresses misleading information by Government, but let us not forget the context. In spite of any amount of dodgy information, the problem would never have arisen if the pension funds in question had not failed. The Government must accept their share of responsibility for those failures, as well as for the information that misled people about the consequences. It was this Government who reduced the minimum funding requirement for occupational pension schemes. It was this Government and the present Chancellor who raided pension funds and are still raiding pension funds, to the tune of &pound;5 billion a year with his pension stealth tax, equivalent to &pound;120 billion of capital value wiped off pension funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/3">So the Government stand accused not only of misleading about the consequences of the failure of occupational pension funds, but of helping to precipitate that failure. On the first count the ombudsman, an official of Parliament charged with the task of reporting to Parliament on claims of maladministration, has investigated and found that maladministration has occurred. What is the Government's response? A direct challenge to the authority of Parliament. The accused in the dock has decided that he will be judge and jury in his own case. He has just spent 10 minutes of his 15-minute statement going over the case again and telling us that the ombudsman, an Officer of the House, got her findings wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/4">The ombudsman rightly replies to the right hon. Gentleman that</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Parliament has decided that it is my role&mdash;and not that of any party to a complaint&mdash;to determine what constitutes maladministration.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/6">The House must insist that the Government bow to the decision arrived at by the due process which the House put in place in respect of the factual finding of maladministration by the ombudsman. While they are at it, the Government could also comply with the ombudsman's recommendation that they apologise. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman's mother ever taught him this, but my mother always taught me that an apology costs nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/7">The real problem for the Government is that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1981" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, South-West (Mr. Darling)</phrase>, then Secretary of State for Social Security, and the present Secretary of State for Transport, has already committed the Government to the principle of redress. In March 2000 he told the House that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/8" class="indent">&quot;As a matter of principle, we believe that when someone loses out because they were given the wrong information by a Department, they are entitled to redress.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-15">15 March 2000</phrase>; Vol. 346, c. 308.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/9">The Secretary of State has sold the pass, leaving Ministers in the ridiculous position of trying to deny the ombudsman's findings of maladministration because that would-be Chancellor of the Exchequer has already committed them to providing redress in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/10">Surprisingly, yesterday at Prime Minister's questions, the right hon. Gentleman was rather more honest about the situation. He did not say the ombudsman was wrong. He did not question her findings of maladministration. He simply told the House that the Government could not pay what he claimed would be a &pound;15 billion bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/11">However, the ombudsman's principal recommendation was that the Government should consider whether they should make arrangements for the restoration of the pensions and other benefits of those who had lost out, in her words</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/12" class="indent">&quot;by whichever means is most appropriate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/13">The Prime Minister said yesterday that the Government</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/14" class="indent">&quot;have to look for another way of dealing with the issue&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 1456.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/15">The obvious way, to which the Secretary of State alluded, is the financial assistance scheme, which was put in place to help people who lost their pensions or suffered diminished pensions because their pension funds had failed. I welcome what the right hon. Gentleman said about his willingness to look again at the way the financial assistance scheme works. At present, it does not work. It is limited to people who are already retired or who are within three years of retirement age when the scheme fails. It is slow and cumbersome. Only 27 people have received payments from the scheme, out of 85,000 people who have lost their pensions or suffered diminution of their pensions. The fund is clearly underfunded for its stated purpose, having only &pound;20 million a year at its disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/16">Will the Secretary of State as a matter of urgency look at how the financial assistance scheme can be reconstructed to help a much wider group of people who have suffered loss of pension rights through no fault of their own? He said in his statement that it would be wrong for the whole burden to fall on the taxpayer. With that thought in mind, will he consider the possible use of unclaimed assets, in particular unclaimed pension and insurance assets, to see whether those could be used to support an expanded financial assistance scheme?</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/17">When we proposed that last year, the Chancellor said that those assets did not exist, but since the general election he has discovered them and earmarked some of them for one of his own pet schemes. It would be a more appropriate use of unclaimed assets in the pension and insurance sector to use them to fund failures in that sector. I urge the right hon. Gentleman to ask his colleagues at the Treasury to embark upon a serious piece of work to identify the extent and scope of those assets, to see whether they could contribute towards a remedy of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/18">When the Secretary of State is talking to his right hon. Friend the Chancellor about additional funding for the financial assistance scheme, will he remind him of the &pound;45 billion that he has had so far from pension funds with his pension stealth tax, and the &pound;5 billion a year that he continues to levy on those pension funds, even as the system is collapsing about his ears? Will he remind the Chancellor of the pension fund failures and the misery suffered by tens of thousands of individual stakeholders in consequence?</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/19">Both the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have used the figure of &pound;15 billion. The Secretary of State today spoke of &pound;13 billion to &pound;17 billion. That is a cash figure and it is meaningless. Will he make a commitment today to put in the Library for the benefit of all Members a properly worked out net present value figure for the cost of making good the pension funds, so that Members can understand what the real figure is, not the hyped-up figure that he and the Prime Minister have been using?</p>
	<p pid="a.1624.0/20">The Government must accept without further delay the ombudsman's factual finding of maladministration. If they do not, the authority of Parliament and the credibility of the ombudsman's office will be critically undermined. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, South-West had already committed them to the principle of redress in these circumstances, but the ombudsman's recommendations leave scope for examining various ways to deliver that redress&mdash;through the financial assistance scheme, or perhaps by revisiting the use of unclaimed assets, as I suggested. The commitment to redress, in whichever form, has already been made by the right hon. Gentleman on behalf of the Government, so Ministers cannot duck it by refusing to accept the ombudsman's finding of fact. It is for the Government to deliver on that commitment, and a great deal is at stake. With national pensions day ahead of us this Saturday, and the Government's response to the Turner report eagerly awaited in the spring, if the Government get this wrong and send the wrong signal about the security and safety of pension funds to the British public, there is a real danger that efforts to address Britain's pension crisis by promoting pension saving will be fatally undermined before they even get off the starting blocks.</p>

	<p pid="a.1626.0/1">I agree, in some respects, with what the hon. Gentleman has said. It is important that we establish proper arrangements for confirming the security and confidence that people have in their pension investments and pension savings. We have taken action to try to strengthen those arrangements, and I am confident that we have succeeded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1626.0/2">I also welcome the hon. Gentleman's support for what I have said about the financial assistance scheme, which is the right way to see what further help, if any, we can provide for pensioners who are caught in that particularly difficult situation. I have listened to his expressions of concern and sympathy, which we all feel, but many people in the country will regard that as crocodile tears. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is important to make that point because his party had plenty of opportunities to devise a similar compensation or assistance scheme, which it completely failed to do. It is all well and good for him to express his concern, but no financial assistance scheme was previously available. <i>[Interruption.]</i> He referred to when pension schemes started failing, but he clearly knows nothing about the issue, because it is utterly ridiculous to suggest that pension schemes suddenly started to collapse in 1997. We have implemented the necessary provisions and are examining further help.</p>
	<p pid="a.1626.0/3">The hon. Gentleman has referred to unclaimed assets, which are obviously a matter for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, and the &pound;5 billion figure. Since 1997, there have been two significant impacts on pension funds: first, rising life expectancy has increased the costs of UK pension funds by some &pound;250 billion; and secondly, the fall in world stock markets at the end of the 1990s had a similar impact. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Conservative Members do not like it because they do not like the facts of the matter and are not prepared to listen.</p>

Gentleman argued that Governments must always accept the findings of the parliamentary commissioner, but that was certainly not the way in which the previous Tory Government used to respond.

	<p pid="a.1627.6/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement, but I fear that his response to the ombudsman's report will have created even greater anger and an even greater sense of betrayal among those people who have lost their pensions. As I understand it, the essence of his statement is that he believes that the Government have got more or less everything right and that the ombudsman has got more or less everything wrong. With respect, his Department has had a chance to put those points to the ombudsman over the past few months, and I remind him of her conclusion:</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/2" class="indent">&quot;I have found that maladministration was a significant contributory factor in the creation of financial loss . . . Nothing in the DWP's submissions persuades me otherwise.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> has pointed out, paragraph 7.26 of the ombudsman's report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/4" class="indent">&quot;Parliament has decided that it is my role&mdash;and not that of any party to a complaint&mdash;to determine what constitutes maladministration&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/5">If the Government are going to trample over the ombudsman's report, what is the point in having a parliamentary ombudsman and giving her those responsibilities? I hope that Committees of this House, including the Public Administration Committee, will take up the way in which the DWP has dealt with the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/6">Does the Secretary of State agree that those people who have lost their pensions will now feel doubly betrayed, not only because of what originally happened, but because of the way in which the Government have dealt with the report, which comprehensively condemns the Government and states that they provided information that was</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/7" class="indent">&quot;inaccurate, incomplete, unclear and inconsistent&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/8">Is the defence in the DWP response to the ombudsman's report&mdash;that many people will not have bothered to read those leaflets or that those who have read them will not have paid any attention to them&mdash;good enough? One wonders why the Government bother to distribute such leaflets, if people are not supposed to read them or pay attention to them. The Secretary of State's statement was peppered with the excuse that people should have read the small print in the leaflets, but that is the approach of a dodgy second-hand car dealer, which one would not expect from a Secretary of State charged with regulating such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/9">On cost, I share the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about the &pound;15 billion figure that the Prime Minister has been waving around, and I want a clear commitment that the Secretary of State will put an explanation in the Library. I also want a clear commitment that the Secretary of State is not going to fob off people with a token increase in the FAS, when a more substantive measure, such as extending the protections in the Pension Protection Fund to people who are currently losing out in relation to the ombudsman's report and the existing FAS, is clearly needed. Will he tell us the cost of such action? Is that not precisely the type of expenditure that should fall to the contingency reserve? Given that this Government can find billions of pounds to fund an unjustified war in Iraq, surely they can find the money out of the reserve to fund such compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/10">As a Minister told the House of Commons in 2000:</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/11" class="indent">&quot;We are aware of the importance of protecting members' rights . . . If we cannot do that, they have no one else to look to&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-03">3 April 2000</phrase>; Vol. 366, c. 765.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1627.6/12">What has changed? Why do Ministers now say that they are not responsible for protecting those rights and that members must look only to employers or trustees? Surely that approach not only betrays those people who have lost their pensions, but undermines the Government strategy to encourage millions more people to take up second pensions. The ombudsman, who obviously has a sense of irony, has entitled her report, &quot;Trusting in the Pensions Promise&quot;. Does the Secretary of State understand that if he deals with the ombudsman's report in that way, people will not trust this Government's pensions policy?</p>

	<p pid="a.1629.0/1">I can agree with some of the hon. Gentleman's points, but I am afraid that I am unable to agree with his fundamental analysis of our response to the parliamentary commissioner's report or to the arguments that I have advanced today. It is important&mdash;indeed, it is our responsibility&mdash;to place on the record why we disagree so strongly with the ombudsman's findings. In particular, in relation to the second of her findings of maladministration, there is very strong evidence that the Government acted on the basis of proper professional advice and followed that advice at every stage of the decision-making process. That is not just my view, but that of the Government Actuary's Department. In those circumstances, particularly given that we have not seen her actuarial advice, it is right and proper for me to put that on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.1629.0/2">I can confirm to the hon. Gentleman, as I should have done to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>, that we will set out the details of our costings when we produce our fuller response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1629.0/3">It is simply untrue to say that the Government are not seeking to provide financial assistance and support for people who are caught up in these circumstances, terrible as they are. We are looking to see what more we can do. As I said in response to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, that is the right and proper way for us to proceed.</p>

It is an outrage to come to the House and systematically attack an independent arbiter who was set up by this House independently to investigate accusations of difficulties. His defence that those people had a let-out clause at the bottom of their advice is utter nonsense. Does he not realise that when lawmakers offer advice, it is categorically different from advice offered by second-hand car dealers who then opt out by saying, &quot;You didn't read the small print.&quot;? Surely he should accept that his responsibility now is to shoulder the burden of the difficulties that have happened as a result of his advice and deal with it instead of attacking the messenger.</p>

Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>; they want their pensions back&mdash;the pensions that they have paid for. I am sorry to disagree with the Secretary of State, but they took out an occupational pension on Government advice in the belief that it would provide them with a guaranteed income in retirement. I am therefore disappointed that the ombudsman's recommendations are not being accepted by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1631.2/1">My right hon. Friend talked about extending the financial assistance scheme. When he does that, will he bear in mind that there is a group of schemes, including the APW scheme in Hampshire, in which the employer is still solvent, but the trustees were effectively forced into compromise with no option, with the loss of a significant part of individuals' pensions? So far, the Government have set their face against extending the financial assistance scheme to schemes such as APW. Will he give me an assurance that in the review that is taking place he will look afresh at that group of schemes to see whether assistance can be offered, because those people have suffered just as much as anybody else, and through no fault of their own?</p>

We will need to have another look at it as part of the review, but I am afraid that I am not holding out any promise to him that we will be able to make progress in this particular area.

	<p pid="a.1631.4/1">I believe that the Secretary of State is an honourable and a decent man, but it saddens me that he has had to read out a squalid attempt to justify the unjustifiable. He knows, as we do, that each and every one of those 85,000 cases represents an individual, and a personal tragedy for somebody in retirement. Some of those cases include steelworkers from ASW in Kent, who are my constituents. They were looking to the guardian of the people&mdash;the parliamentary ombudsman&mdash;to come up with a fair answer. What are we supposed to say to them now that the Government have decided to overturn the findings of the judge?</p>

	<p pid="a.1631.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his opening remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1631.5/2">The essence of our argument is that we strongly dispute the findings of maladministration, and I have tried to explain to the House why that is so. That is an entirely proper and sensible thing for any Minister to do, particularly when significant amounts of taxpayers' money are involved. I suspect that a Conservative Minister would have done exactly the same. What we have to do now&mdash;this is where I agree with the hon. Gentleman&mdash;is see whether there is scope for doing more to help more people. I have confirmed today that we are doing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1631.5/3">I want to return to an important issue that goes to the heart of this argument. I hear every Conservative Member saying that we should pay out in full for everyone covered by the ombudsman's report, even when the ombudsman herself indicated, in relation to some of the scheme failures, that individuals had the opportunity to mitigate their loss. I am slightly confused by the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that, even in those cases, the taxpayer should be required to pay out to meet the losses, given that the evidence that links the alleged maladministration with the loss is not substantiated in her report.</p>

	<p pid="a.1632.0/1">We can bandy accusations all afternoon as to who is to blame for the collapse of occupational pension schemes, but that does not help the large number of my constituents who have lost some, if not all, of their pension savings following the collapse of the Richards pension scheme. Will my right hon. Friend take this opportunity to reiterate that the Government will stand behind those individuals who have lost large amounts of money and savings? The Government are the only body who can reimburse them for their loss, whether through the financial assistance scheme or any other mechanism. I am looking to the Secretary of State to reiterate that these people will be reimbursed in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1632.2/1">In the statement, the Secretary of State said that the financial assistance scheme would help up to 15,000 people. However, yesterday, only 27 people had registered for it. Does not that suggest that the scheme is barely scratching the surface of the problem? When the right hon. Gentleman attends one of the national pensions day events on Saturday, what arguments will he deploy to persuade people to take the Government's advice to invest in new occupational pension schemes? The Government are obviously not prepared to take responsibility for the failure of past advice to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1632.3/1">I have made it clear that no Government can take responsibility for underwriting the total value of people's private savings. That is impossible and untenable. The Pension Protection Fund and the new powers of the pensions regulator mean that we have a much stronger regulatory environment to deal with the point that Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front Benchers made about securing confidence in the future.

He lost his pension and now the Government have rejected and attacked the ombudsman's report in a cavalier way.

I can only reiterate the points that I have tried to make repeatedly about the existence of the financial assistance scheme, the reasons for setting it up and the group of people whom we wanted it to help at the beginning of its operations&mdash;those in the greatest need and closest to retirement who cannot make alternative financial arrangements.

For my constituents who are workers or former workers at Kalamazoo, time is of the essence.

Given that the situation requires substantial amounts of money, will he speak to appropriate firms and bodies in the financial sector to ascertain whether, even at this late stage, there may be mileage in considering not purchasing annuities and pooling the schemes' assets to ensure that money can be front-loaded and the cost can be spread over the maximum period?</p>

	<p pid="a.1641.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That this House insists on its disagreement with the Lords in their amendments Nos. 16 and 22, and proposes the Government amendments (a) and (b) in lieu thereof.</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">The amendments are technical amendments to clause 8, making it clear that an application for an identity card must include or accompany one to be entered on the national identity register. We have already had one debate on the Lords amendments this week, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">Monday 13 March</phrase>, when the House rejected them for the second time. However, their Lordships have again insisted on their amendments to remove the requirement for anyone obtaining a designated document such as a passport to register and be issued with an identity card.</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/3">Yesterday, in the other place, the mover of the main Lords amendment, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, rebuked me in his summation in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The other thing worth saying is that last Monday, the Home Secretary . . . in levelling his defence against our proposal to make the scheme voluntary, did not in any sense call upon the constitutional justification of the Commons' position that has been the mainstay of the noble Baroness's closing speech&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/5">&mdash;he was referring to Baroness Scotland of Asthal&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/6" class="indent">&quot;and has been the subject of speeches from various noble Lords. Mr Clarke attempted to justify the Government's case according to the issues that he raised in the other place&mdash;none of them were constitutional issues; they related to the merits and demerits of this Bill.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 679, c. 1248&ndash;49.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/7">I intend to remedy that defect in my presentation today. Let me start with what was said by Lord Strathclyde, the leader of the main Opposition party in the Lords. He spoke very wisely, as befits a graduate of the university of East Anglia. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/8" class="indent">&quot;This House should always proceed with caution when it is trying to defeat the Government, even when it is asking the House of Commons to think again on a Bill it has passed. Generally speaking, we do that. I think we always do that. What is so unusual about this aspect is that the Government have already been defeated on two occasions, and therefore this is the third occasion on which we are dealing with this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/9" class="indent">In this context, perhaps I may make three points. First, I think the House should proceed with caution and should deal with matters as controversial as this only when they are very few in number. This is the first time in this Session that we have come to an issue of this kind. Secondly, we should proceed only on an issue where there is a good deal of public support for what this House is doing. Thirdly, we should not proceed if there are issues to do with the Salisbury convention. My noble Friend and the Government may disagree about the use of the Salisbury convention; I am entirely satisfied that there are no Salisbury convention implications if the House were to return this small point back to another place.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/10">I shall deal with each of those three points. The first was that the House of Lords should proceed with caution. I think that Lord Strathclyde was quite right about that, and he should take his own advice. The fact is that the amendment is not a small point. It constitutes a major and deliberate effort by the Opposition parties to sabotage the whole of a Bill that has been agreed by this House, and that was set out to the public during the general election campaign. I hope that the Lords will indeed proceed with caution, and will not adopt a strategy that is designed to undermine the entire Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/11">Secondly, Lord Strathclyde said that the other place</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/12" class="indent">&quot;should proceed only on an issue where there is a good deal of public support for what this House is doing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/13">I remind the House&mdash;and perhaps, via this House, the other place&mdash;of the facts about public support. There is not such support for what the House of Lords is doing. Even the result of the latest opinion poll sponsored by the NO2ID campaign shows that 52 per cent. of the public are in favour, while Home Office research shows that 70 per cent. are in favour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/14">Lord Strathclyde said that the other place</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/15" class="indent">&quot;should proceed only on an issue where there is a good deal of public support for what this House is doing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/16">According to the NO2ID campaign, 52 per cent. of people are in favour of the identity cards and against what the other place is doing; and, as I have said, Home Office research shows that 70 per cent. are in favour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.2/17">The Conservative election manifesto was entirely silent on the matter, although the then leader of the party was a known supporter of identity cards. However, the findings of an opinion poll published by ICM before the election, in December 2004, show that some 80 per cent. of the public were then in favour of the introduction of identity cards, with 88 per cent. of Conservative supporters, 81 per cent. of Labour supporters and 72 per cent. of Liberal Democrat supporters in favour. So the answer to Lord Strathclyde's second point&mdash;that the Lords should block the will of this elected Chamber only if there is clear public support&mdash;is that there is not.</p>

	<p pid="a.1642.0/1">Surely the point is that it was not put to the people who were polled that the system would be compulsory. I am sure that there would be huge support for voluntary identity cards. The issue that the House of Lords and this House are having to consider is the whole issue of voluntary versus compulsory. I suspect that if those people had been asked, &quot;Should it be a criminal offence not to carry an identity card?&quot; or, &quot;Should it be compulsory to carry an identity card?&quot;, the answer would have been very different.</p>

	<p pid="a.1642.1/1">We have already agreed, in response to proposals from the other place, that before the stage was reached of making identity cards compulsory there would be further primary legislation. The Bill explicitly excludes a requirement for anyone to carry an identity card, so what the hon. Gentleman has said is completely incorrect.</p>

	<p pid="a.1643.1/1">Would the Home Secretary continue to take the line that he is taking in the context of what the Information Commissioner has said on the subject&mdash;that the Bill would cause a sea change in the relationship between the individual and the state?

	<p pid="a.1643.2/1">I have not spoken to the Information Commissioner recently but, as I have said, there has been considerable debate on the substance of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman speaks of the relationship between the individual and the state. A general election is a pretty important part of the relationship between the individual and the state. That is why I think that the hon. Gentleman's noble Friend Lord Strathclyde was right to say yesterday that in his view&mdash;not mine&mdash;the House of Lords should proceed only on an issue on which there was a good deal of public support for what that House was doing. My point is that there is not.</p>

	<p pid="a.1643.3/1">Is my right hon. Friend at all concerned about the apparent drift away from the high levels of support for identity cards in the past?

	<p pid="a.1643.4/1">I accept the first point, but not the second. Because of the debate about these issues and because the precise questions are different in different polling data, there is an issue concerning public support that needs to be addressed.

	<p pid="a.1643.6/1">No, I will not; I want to deal first with Lord Strathclyde's third point. He said that the House of Lords</p>

	<p pid="a.1643.6/3">That is a very important point and it is worth recalling what the position is. First, it is absolutely clear that the introduction of ID cards is a manifesto commitment that has been approved twice by the elected House. I remind Members of the view of the Salisbury convention taken in January 2000 by the royal commission on the reform of the House of Lords. It was chaired by Lord Wakeham, who is not a notable Government toady, except when the Conservatives were in government. Recommendation 7 of commission's report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1643.6/4" class="indent">&quot;The principles underlying the 'Salisbury Convention' remain valid and should be maintained. A version of the 'mandate' doctrine should continue to be observed; where the electorate has chosen a party to form a Government, the elements of that party's general election manifesto should be respected by the second chamber.

As I said earlier, he made it clear that the Lords should not proceed if there are issues to do with the Salisbury convention. He said that if the Government were not prepared to back down or to find a compromise, the only option was for the unelected House to force the Government to use the Parliament Act procedure to ensure that the will of the elected House prevails.</p>
	<p pid="a.1646.2/3">The Parliament Act has been used four times since 1949, and Lord Strathclyde is not right to suggest that we have reached the point where that option should be invoked. For the three reasons that he himself gives in columns 1244 and 1245 of the <i>Official Report</i> of yesterday's Lords debate, the other place should indeed think again, just as this place should decide to insist on its own position.</p>

	<p pid="a.1646.4/1">In a moment. My fourth point is that the Lords amendments would impose an additional burden and cost on the plans for the introduction of ID cards that were approved by this House. It cannot be right for the constituents whom we represent to be denied by those whom they did not elect and cannot remove the most cost-effective option in implementing a scheme. In effect, the Lords voted for the establishment of two parallel biometric databases, with all the cost, inconvenience, confusion and insecurity that that approach involves. That raises the question of whether the unelected House has the right directly to place such burdens on our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1646.4/2">The remaining issue is, essentially, a constitutional one: whether it is right for the other place to keep insisting on amendments that have been rejected here twice already, and that will be rejected again today.</p>

The numbers in respect of the share of those who voted are about the same, so he surely cannot argue that the Government are justified on this issue, and that the House of Lords is not this?</p>

	<p pid="a.1647.3/1">My right hon. Friend is right about the Liberal Democrat arithmetic. The situation is very simple. I repeat that Lord Strathclyde made it clear that the Lords should frustrate the will of the Commons only when there is a &quot;good deal&quot; of public support for what the Lords was doing. The NO2ID campaign is opposed to our policy, but that organisation set the questions in the poll, in which more than half the country said that it did not support the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.1647.3/2">I studied yesterday's Divisions in the Lords carefully, to establish how opinion had moved between the votes on 6 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase>. There was almost no change in the position of those peers who are whipped by the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour parties. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March</phrase>, 190 peers&mdash;principally Tories and Liberal Democrats&mdash;were against the Government position. Yesterday, that number rose to 194&mdash;almost no change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1647.3/3">The peers who are not whipped&mdash;the Cross Benchers and the bishops&mdash;voted on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March</phrase> by 37 to 12 against the Government position, but yesterday a majority was clearly in favour of supporting and not frustrating the Commons' position. <i>[Interruption.]</i> In answer to the hilarity among Opposition Members, I have to add in fairness that there were only four bishops in the total of more than 50 Cross-Bench peers. They were not significant in the arithmetic, although their significance may lie in the guidance that they get from yet another place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1647.3/4">My point is that it was the whipped Conservative and Liberal Democrat peers who voted to frustrate the elected House and overthrow the Government's position. That was what happened, and I urge my colleagues to sustain the Government's position. I also urge the Opposition to stop trying to frustrate the will of the people.</p>

However, does he really believe that foreign travel is voluntary for business men whose customers are all abroad? Does he think that travel is voluntary for people whose parents or children live abroad, as is increasingly the case today? Does he think that foreign travel is voluntary for people whose children get in trouble abroad&mdash;something that we have read about too often in the past few months and years? <i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the Under-Secretary of State want to intervene? If so, I shall give way.</p>

	<p pid="a.1650.6/1">No, I shall not. I must make some progress. I may give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment, but I am not sure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.6/2">We can see that the Government's proposal is clearly in breach of their own manifesto, unless one takes the attitude that the manifesto did not mean to say that or that that is not what they understood it to mean&mdash;but the words mean what they mean. This part of the Bill is not the exercise of a democratic mandate. The best that can be said of it is that it is an exercise in elected dictatorship, full stop. So the Lords are right to amend it and they are entirely within their rights. That point destroys the entire speech that the Home Secretary just made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.6/3">We have continually been treated by the Home Secretary and his Ministers&mdash;sometimes from a sedentary position, but mostly on the &quot;Today&quot; programme&mdash;to new reasons for this legislation, be they terrorism, welfare reform, immigration or fraud. One Minister puts up a reason for the idea, only for another honest Minister to admit that the Government have overstated their case. That has happened several times in the course of argument over the Bill. That is followed by another Minister coming up with another argument, which is also overstated. That has been most obviously the case on terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.6/4">The Government love to portray everybody except themselves as soft on terrorism. It is their favourite tactic with all of their illiberal legislation. Time and again, impositions are placed on the British people, that they have not faced for centuries, on the basis of arguments that are designed to make other people, the Government think, look soft on terrorism. That has applied most obviously to this legislation. I want the House to listen to the words of Baroness Park of Monmouth. The House should remember that Daphne Park has worked in the defence of our country in some of the most dangerous postings in the word. She has taken more risks in the defence of our country than the Home Secretary has had hot dinners, and that is a pretty high hurdle. I would trust her judgment on the defence of the realm way beyond that of the Prime Minister or, indeed, any Minister. Yesterday she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.6/5" class="indent">&quot;The very creation of such an enormous national identity register will be a present to terrorists; it will be a splendid thing for them to disrupt . . . . It will also provide valuable information to organised crime and to the intelligence services of unfriendly countries&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 679, c. 1234.]</p>

	<p pid="a.1652.5/2">If that were not daft enough, the Home Secretary tells us that citizens will find having an ID card useful, and even valuable. The technology director of Microsoft, no less, pointed out that the identity register will be a honeypot for hackers, fraudsters, thieves and terrorists. It will worsen the risk of identity theft. Far from being an infallible security system, we hear this week that the Government intend to rely on chip and pin technology to protect the card, the same technology that we have used for years in the common, everyday Visa card.

	<p pid="a.1653.4/1">I want to come to a close on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1653.4/2">If an ID card were really valuable to the citizen as the Home Secretary claims, presumably ordinary citizens would want them; everybody would want them if they were as valuable as the Home Secretary claims. So why are the Government not willing to leave citizens to make decisions for themselves? If cards are going to be popular, if they are going to make people happy, if they are going to do things for them, then they will take them up of their own accord. What we are talking about today is the compulsion issue&mdash;they will not need to be compelled to have an ID card. Of course, the Government do not believe their own argument. That became clear in the Home Secretary's view of this amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1653.6/1">No.</p>
	<p pid="a.1653.6/2">The Government believe that unless they force a majority of the population to have an ID card by covert compulsion, they will never win the vote to make it compulsory in the final analysis. They know that if the card is not compulsory, it will not just be ineffective against terrorism, fraud, illegal immigration and crime; it will be completely useless.</p>
	<p pid="a.1653.6/3">Listening to the Home Secretary go on about the extra costs arising from the scheme, I was almost dumbstruck. The Opposition are not imposing &pound;20 billion on the public for no virtue&mdash;we are not doing that, but that is what will happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1653.6/4">Covert compulsion has become necessary to the Government's ill-starred strategy, which is incompetent in design, ineffective in execution and deceitful in delivery; but that does not mean that it is not dangerous. The proposal will completely invert the relationship between the citizen and the state. As we saw from the statement that preceded the debate, the Government too often forget that they are the servant of the people, not the other way round. The right to my identity is held by me, not by the state. My right to my citizenship is my birthright, not the gift of the Government, and our right as British citizens to our liberty and privacy should not be carelessly thrown away. That is why I ask everyone in the House to support the Lords in their defence of the rights of individual British citizens against unnecessary intrusion into their lives by an over-meddlesome Government, apparently bent on creating a surveillance state.</p>

	<p pid="a.1654.0/1">The debate and the disagreement between the other place and our House turn on whether the scheme is compulsory or voluntary. The Home Secretary is right to remind us that we should need primary legislation if the scheme were to be completely compulsory, but the Bill establishes, by the back door, a halfway house to compulsion. Why?</p>
	<p pid="a.1654.0/2">I suspect that the real reason is that the Home Secretary is not confident. When we eventually reach the stage of introducing primary legislation to make the scheme compulsory, he wants to be able to tell the House and the public, &quot;Sixty per cent. of people in the UK already have an ID card. What are you worried about?&quot; However, the only reason that 60 per cent. of people will have a card will be as a result of this back-door way of compelling them to have a card if they want a passport or a driving licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1654.0/3">It is perfectly respectable for the Home Secretary to want a universal card, but as the shadow Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> said, the proposed scheme will not be effective; the card certainly will not achieve any of the things that the Government hope for it against terrorism, international fraud and so on, unless it is universal. The idea that it could be semi-universal actually denies the whole purpose of an ID card, certainly in terms of its practical effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1654.0/4">It is not unreasonable for the Home Secretary to want a universal card, but he does not want to legislate for it now because he knows that he would not get the measure through&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> No, he is not legislating for a compulsory card. If he did that now, he knows that the Government would have to pay the full costs for such a card. He could not compel people to have a card and to pay &pound;90 for it. He knows that a compulsory card would have to be financed by the Government and the Chancellor does not want to do that, so we have this rather dishonest and disingenuous halfway scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1654.0/5">If the Government and the Home Secretary were really confident about the proposed card, they would trust the British people. If the Home Secretary feels that he can make an overwhelming case for the importance of an identity card&mdash;as he undoubtedly does; I think that he is entirely sincere&mdash;he should trust his judgment and make that case to the British people. He should say, &quot;Believe me, we will benefit from the card so volunteer for it&quot;, but he cannot introduce the scheme by compulsion. In proceeding by compulsion, he does not trust the British people. He certainly does not trust the people when he proposes this semi, rather false voluntary scheme, which is in effect compulsory.</p>

	<p pid="a.1654.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend's line of thought. Does he agree that many of our constituents, who were deeply opposed to ID cards, gave the Government the benefit of the doubt because they thought that at least the scheme would not be compulsory? Now that a compulsory scheme is being brought in by the back door, does my hon. Friend fear that the next step will be a provision brought in by the back door that people have to carry their identity card?</p>

	<p pid="a.1655.0/2">Will the Home Secretary listen to the other place, and to the public, and trust his own judgment? If, as he believes, he can convince the public of the importance of identity cards, he should trust them and let them volunteer for the scheme. The Bill does not trust the public; in effect, it asks them to be compelled to sign up for the cards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1655.1/1">The simple facts are that the Government say that ID cards will be introduced voluntarily, yet the 80 to 85 per cent. of the British population who possess passports will, if the Bill is passed, have an ID card foisted on them in coming years whether they like it or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1655.1/2">By refusing to acknowledge the blindingly obvious&mdash;that a measure applied by stealth compulsion on the vast majority of the British people could never be described as voluntary by any known use of the English language&mdash;the Government seem to have turned their back on the most elementary terms of rational debate. The Home Secretary seems to inhabit a curious back-to-front world, worthy of C.S. Lewis, where words simply do not mean what they used to&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1655.3/1">I stand corrected. The House must forgive me. As an Alice in Wonderland allusion was used earlier, I deleted mine from my notes and clearly made an error in my replacement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1655.3/2">As it appears fruitless to continue to ask the Government to use the same dictionary definitions as the rest of the English-speaking world, I shall take a slightly different line of inquiry. If, according to the Government, the scheme will be voluntary, will British citizens be able to withdraw their data from the ID database voluntarily? I know of no database in operation to which individuals can voluntarily enter their data, and from which they are not equally free to remove that information at a time of their own choosing. The Data Protection Act 1998, which sets out the core data protection principles, is clear. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1655.3/3" class="indent">&quot;It must be recognised that even when consent has been given it will not necessarily endure forever . . . Data controllers should recognise that . . . the individual may be able to withdraw consent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1655.3/4">Just this once, I shall take at face value the Home Secretary's insistence that the scheme is voluntary. If it is voluntary to enter, based on individual consent, will he confirm that it will also be voluntary to leave it?</p>
	<p pid="a.1655.3/5">I am also struck by the breakneck urgency with which the Government seem to want to roll out ID cards by surreptitious compulsion. This week, we mark the 10th anniversary of the tragic shootings in Dunblane. The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 included a provision for a national firearms database, yet almost 10 years later nothing has happened. This week, Ministers told us that the decade-long delay was due to difficulties with the IT systems required for the firearms register. Apparently, at long last, a pilot register will start in May, with a view to rolling it out in fully fledged form a little later.</p>
	<p pid="a.1655.3/6">The contrast between the woeful delay in establishing a comparatively small database, agreed 10 years ago after the harrowing loss of life in Dunblane, and the headlong rush towards a vast uncosted, untested and unjustified national ID database speaks volumes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1656.0/1">The hon. Gentleman refers to the anniversary of Dunblane. Last Saturday was the second anniversary of the Atocha bombings in Madrid.

	<p pid="a.1656.1/1">The point is, why should the Government be so keen through compulsion to roll out an untested, uncosted and vast ID database and seem incapable for a decade to develop the IT systems for a much smaller one? It hardly confers confidence in the Government's ability to deliver. The Government drag their feet on something that is urgently needed and justified, yet rush ahead on something that is neither needed nor justified.</p>

Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> knows jolly well and full well that if the Labour manifesto had said in terms that the Government were going to introduce compulsory ID cards, they would have got a raspberry. We all know from our constituency postbags and from conversations on the doorstep that the people of this country are resolutely opposed to compulsory ID cards, and that was why the Labour party manifesto was drafted as it was. No amount of sop<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1866" name="Anne Snelgrove">histry by the hon. Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove)</phrase> will change the fact that the manifesto made it very clear that this is intended to be a voluntary measure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1658.4/3" class="indent">&quot;If we believe in a voluntary scheme, as the Home Secretary and the manifesto say that we do, there is no way that we can reject the Lords amendments. By rejecting the amendments, the Government will be opting for compulsion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1658.4/4">What the Government are seeking to do is simply that&mdash;opting for compulsion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1658.4/5">But even today the Home Secretary keeps trying. He abandoned his attempts on Monday. On Monday he tried to persuade the House that it was not compulsion&mdash;that somehow it was voluntary as to whether or not we actually went and applied for a passport. So when we decided to go overseas, we got this ludicrous Alice in Wonderland description by the Home Secretary:</p>
	<p pid="a.1658.4/6" class="indent">&quot;That is the free will that people may exercise in deciding whether or not they wish to have a passport&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is the free will over what they can do and how they can operate.

The numbers in my constituency were overwhelmingly in favour of an identity card, and they continue to be so. My constituents will know, having had an opportunity to see the debate, that there is another motive behind the Opposition supporting the other House in its attempt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.4/2">The reason why I absolutely depart from some of the spurious arguments on why the Bill should not proceed is that I hear the same Opposition Members who argue for clarity in databases and say that we must have a single database&mdash;I cite child protection and many other issues that are before the House&mdash;using an entirely separate argument in this case.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1664.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="1664"  time="014:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-24.htm#60316-24_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.1664.3/1">The effect of my motion is simple. It effectively reinstates the wording which this House has previously decided on and rejects the attempts of the other place to remove all references to glorification from the Bill. I can be brief in my remarks because I set out in detail what was wrong with the amendments made by another place when we last discussed the issue on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February</phrase>, and I do not intend to return to that debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1664.3/2">I am pleased to say that one objection to those amendments has been removed. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> has perhaps realised that his assertion that he was</p>
	<p pid="a.1664.3/3" class="indent">&quot;not wholly persuaded by the argument that listening cannot encompass reading.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 1435.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1664.3/4">is not really sustainable. I accept that today's amendments from the Opposition parties do at least seek to remedy the weakness that we reflected in the debate that we had last time, but the reference solely to &quot;listener&quot; was not the only thing that was wrong with the amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1664.3/5">The amendments from the other place are defective because instead of containing an exemplary description of what &quot;indirect encouragement&quot; could be, they provide an exhaustive description. In other words, the offence is limited so that it is committed by making available to the public a statement directly encouraging terrorism, or a statement indirectly encouraging it but only by actually describing it in such a way that the listener will infer that he should emulate it. To put that simply, the use of the word &quot;describing&quot; in the Lords amendments means that the Bill would not catch, as the original wording would, glorification, praise or celebration of an act of terrorism that does not actually describe the act. Although the amendments that have now been tabled by the Opposition parties do not rely on the word &quot;describing&quot;, the same type of objection still applies to them. The use of the word &quot;comprises&quot; makes them exhaustive.</p>

	<p pid="a.1665.0/1">Instead of using the word &quot;describe&quot; our amendment uses the phrase &quot;referring to terrorism&quot;. Can the Home Secretary give me an example of when glorifying terrorism would not have to make a reference to it as an activity?</p>

	<p pid="a.1665.1/1">The point that I was making is that the amendment seeks to provide an exhaustive description, which, in my opinion, does not meet the original position put forward by the House. That is precisely why we think that the amendments made in the other place and the amendments tabled by the Opposition should not be accepted here.</p>
	<p pid="a.1665.1/2">The removal of the reference to glorification, which appears to be the purpose of the amendments made in the other place, appears to be the position of the official Opposition, although it is difficult to be sure. On Tuesday, the official Opposition tabled amendments jointly with the Liberal Democrats that included the word &quot;glorifying&quot;, but by yesterday those amendments had been replaced by Conservative amendments that do not make reference to glorification. In the other place, those on the Conservative Front Bench urged their colleagues not to vote against the Commons on those points. No doubt we will receive some clarification on that from the Opposition spokesman.</p>

	<p pid="a.1665.4/1">On the whole, I am genuinely trying to see whether I can reach a consensus with the Home Secretary. For that reason, I considered whether it would be possible, within the restricted ambit of the word &quot;comprise&quot;, to give the Prime Minister his &quot;glorifying&quot; word, so that his ego would be satisfied, but after I had put the amendment down on the blues&mdash; I take responsibility for this&mdash;it seemed to me, for the very reason that I gave to the Home Secretary, that I could not think of a single example of when glorification would not involve a reference to terrorism. One cannot glorify something without referring to it. In fact, in lawyers' language, the word was otiose and surplusage and I have no business tabling an amendment that includes something that is completely unnecessary and serves no purpose whatever.</p>

	<p pid="a.1666.0/1">I am grateful for that explanation. Trying to help the Prime Minister's ego is a new task for Opposition spokespeople. I am delighted that they are diverting their energies to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1666.0/2">What of the Liberal Democrats? No one&mdash;including them, probably&mdash;has any idea where they stand. On Tuesday they were with the Conservatives in accepting &quot;glorifying&quot;. On Wednesday they had parted company from the Conservatives, but today they are back with the Conservatives and opposing &quot;glorifying&quot;. It is such typical behaviour from the Liberal Democrats that perhaps it is not worth considering.</p>
	<p pid="a.1666.0/3">The case for including glorification is strong. It is a clear and well understood English word that captures better than any other word some of the conduct that we are trying to deal with in the Bill. As I have said, I imagine that that is why the press have picked up and focused on the word. They know what it means and they know that their readers understand it. It was and, I hope, will be perfectly clear in the Bill for the sake of the courts. It is also a word that the nations of the world were prepared to accept last September when they voted to adopt UN Security Council resolution 1624, which features that word. We should uphold it in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1666.0/4">As I have also pointed out before, in light of the attention given to the issue of glorification, if we were now to remove it from the Bill the courts would be fully justified in reaching one obvious conclusion&mdash;that Parliament did not intend glorification of terrorism to fall within the scope of the encouragement offence. If any hon. Members doubt that, they may like to read a judgment given by the Lords of Appeal only last week. In the course of his remarks, Lord Bingham of Cornhill said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1666.0/5" class="indent">&quot;There is no warrant for treating Parliament as having meant something it did not say&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1666.0/6">That clarification, given in the case Regina on application of Gillan and another <i>v</i> Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and another, which was given <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March</phrase>, should cause all of us to be clear that if we take out the word &quot;glorification&quot;, there will be understanding of that in the court when the legislation comes through.</p>

	<p pid="a.1666.2/1">No, not at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1666.2/2">The reason why the Government believe that we need to deal with glorification in our law is clear. People who glorify terrorism help to create a climate in which terrorism is regarded as acceptable. They help to persuade impressionable members of their audiences that they have a moral duty to kill innocent people in pursuit of whatever ideology they have espoused.</p>
	<p pid="a.1666.2/3">In recent times, we have seen threats from extremists who claim to represent Islam. Leaders of the Muslim community in the UK and elsewhere have quite properly and very strongly made it clear that such views do not represent true Islam. However, there are, nevertheless, people who may be influenced by those who glorify terrorism and conclude that they have a duty to kill and injure innocent bystanders in the misguided belief that they are bound to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1666.2/4">I should also remind the House that glorification features in the Bill as an example of what is encompassed by the concept of indirect encouragement. It is not self-contained. Glorification as an offence is a subset of indirect encouragement as an offence, and can be committed only if the conditions surrounding the main offence are met. Key among those conditions is the requirement that there must be an intention that others should be induced to commit terrorist offences or subjective recklessness on this point. Glorification without intention of emulation or subjective recklessness cannot constitute an offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1667.1/1">No, I will not give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1667.1/2">That is a very important safeguard and gives the lie to some of the fanciful claims that have been made about perfectly innocent statements falling foul of this legislation. In part we can have such confidence because of the requirement in the Bill, as this House passed it, for the glorification to relate to conduct that could be emulated in existing circumstances. The amendments from the Opposition parties remove this requirement. I am quite willing to believe that the proposers did not intend to extend the scope of the offence in this undesirable way, but they must speak for themselves, as I am sure the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will do in a moment, and justify their own drafting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1667.1/3">Another important consideration in this debate is that the creation of an offence of glorification was a specific commitment in the manifesto on which my party fought and won the general election less than a year ago. That goes hand in hand with the question of which House should prevail in any dispute between the two Houses. In Committee and on Report the House voted explicitly on the question of whether this Bill should contain references to glorification. It endorsed the proposition by majorities of 16 and 25 respectively. The Bill then had an unopposed Third Reading and proceeded to another place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1667.1/4">The other place is a revising Chamber and can invite this House to think again. That is precisely what happened in respect of glorification, and other aspects of the Bill as well. Although I disagreed with the views of another place, I made no complaint as to its conduct up to that point. However, the Bill then returned to this House. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February</phrase> we had a lengthy debate on the whole issue and voted by a majority of 38 to include glorification in the Bill. We thought again, as the other place requested, and reaffirmed our original decision. At that point, I would have expected the unelected House to concede, and I am disappointed that it did not do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1667.1/5">The elected House must prevail and I hope that the motion standing in my name will pass by the largest possible majority, so that it is clear to Members of another place what form Members of the elected House want the legislation to take.</p>

	<p pid="a.1667.2/1">I rise to respond to the Home Secretary and to speak to amendments (b) and (a) to his amendment in lieu.</p>
	<p pid="a.1667.2/2">The Home Secretary has failed to explain the scope of his proposal, from which flows a large number of the problems with which the House is grappling. He came close to touching on that matter a moment ago, but whenever he comes close to it, he veers off, because an explanation would make nonsense of the Government's entire argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.1667.2/3">The glorification of terrorism is not being made an offence, thank goodness. If the glorification of terrorism on its own were made an offence, it would mean, as we have said on many occasions, that anybody who celebrates Robin Hood, the peasants revolt or Spartacus would be liable to prosecution. Furthermore, the poor old Taoiseach would be liable to prosecution when he comes over here after celebrating the Easter rising next month in Dublin, which he intends to do. Mercifully, that is not the Government's objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.1667.2/4">The Government's approach must be based on the Prime Minister's ego, because there is no other rational explanation. Having produced a Bill which contains draconian and powerful provisions to criminalise the indirect encouragement of terrorism&mdash;something that we support&mdash;the Home Secretary has insisted on including in clause 1(4) a most extraordinary subsection, which suggests that the courts should have particular regard to an example that he is offering, which is the possibility that glorification falls within the scope of indirect encouragement. At the same time, he has provided the suggestion that members of the public would reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is being glorified as conduct that should be emulated by them in existing circumstances&mdash;I think that the Taoiseach would still be in some difficulty, because quite a few people in Northern Ireland think that any celebration of the Easter rising does exactly that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1667.2/5">The key point is that every single judge and lawyer to whom I have spoken has highlighted that including such a concept is woolly, opaque and unclear, that the word, &quot;glorify&quot;, is not known in our law and that the definition of &quot;glorify&quot; as praise or celebration is very poor. The provision appears to be deliberately aimed at people who might wish to celebrate as part of their culture episodes that would fall within the Government's catch-all definition of terrorism. Above all, it is entirely unnecessary in meeting the Government's objective, and the Home Secretary has said nothing this afternoon to explain why it needs to be included in the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.1668.0/1">Surely the Home Secretary's claim that judges will take it as a signal if this is cut out has no merit. The judges will know perfectly well that it was cut out because it is unnecessary given that any offence that it would catch would be caught under existing legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1668.1/1">There is no doubt that in many respects the Bill is a belt and braces job. As we pointed out to the Government, the truth is that there are perfectly good laws on the statute book that could be used instead of clause 1 or many other clauses. I must admit that I will probably not lose a huge amount of sleep over that, provided that the legislation that we enact is rational, fair, makes sense and, if I may say to the Home Secretary, does not provide a lawyer's field day of casuistic arguments whereby every person who is prosecuted under the glorification clause will take the courts up hill and down dale day after day, and eventually be acquitted, probably on the direction of a judge, because it is all completely unintelligible.</p>

	<p pid="a.1669.1/1">The police certainly do not need additional powers to deal with a demonstration outside the Danish embassy. I was rather depressed to read today that although some prosecutions have been started, there are problems in identifying some of the people who participated because, of course, nobody was arrested at the time or shortly thereafter. That is a policing matter, but it is not exactly encouraging for those of us who wish to see that sort of behaviour stopped, something that I suspect is true of every single hon.

	<p pid="a.1669.3/1">If nobody knows who is holding up the placard because that person is wearing a dish dash in such a way that all that can be seen is his eyes, what possible use would an identity card be? I am afraid that Government Front Benchers are living in fantasy land as regards terrorist offences, and one need only engage in any sort of debate for the fantasies that are besetting them to become increasingly apparent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1669.3/2">I say this to the Home Secretary: we have genuinely been trying to see whether we can reach agreement with the Government on the problem that has been posed by the Prime Minister's ego and his slavish adherence to the word, &quot;glorification&quot;. If one is French, that word does not feature in the debate at all, because the equivalent word is, &quot;apologie&quot;, which means &quot;vindication&quot; and is entirely different. For those in the international community, the failure of this House to enact the glorification clause would not be the most seismic event ever, because what they actually want to see is terrorists and those who encourage terrorism brought to justice. That is the matter on which the House should be concentrating.</p>
	<p pid="a.1669.3/3">Mindful of that, we tried to see whether we could reach some measure of agreement. That is why the amendments that I have tabled, on which, I am glad to say, we will be able to vote before voting on the Home Secretary's proposition, would provide the framework for doing that. The Home Secretary's suggestion that the word &quot;listening&quot; might not encompass viewing or reading struck me as having force. Indeed, if there had been an opportunity for a full debate and vote in the House of Lords, it might have been possible to do something about that there. That classically illustrates how our parliamentary procedure does not work very well. Here we have an opportunity to remedy that minor criticism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1669.3/4">On top of that, as the Home Secretary will have noted, we have removed the word, &quot;describing&quot;, in relation to terrorism because he said that it is possible to glorify terrorism without describing it&mdash;I think that it is quite difficult, but I can see that it is a drafting argument&mdash;and replaced it with the word, &quot;referring&quot;. Can the Home Secretary give me any example of where it would be possible to glorify something without referring to it? I have to say that I do not think that that argument would get very far.</p>

	<p pid="a.1670.1/1">I believe that they will be a great improvement because they focus on what Parliament wants to achieve. My judgment is that Parliament wants to prevent people from indirectly encouraging terrorism by referring to it in such a way that the listener, reader or viewer, who heard, read or saw whatever was said would infer that he should emulate it. I have always accepted that glorification could constitute an offence if a reference to terrorism was made in such a way that a listener, reader or viewer inferred that he should emulate it. Our amendment removes the focus from a concept that should have no part in our law. People should be allowed to celebrate the Easter rising in Dublin without thinking that they are beginning to fall foul of the measure. They celebrate it not only in Dublin, but, for all I know, in west London.</p>

	<p pid="a.1670.3/1">The hon. Gentleman may be right&mdash;there could be more such celebrations. In my part of London, celebrations of the Easter rising will undoubtedly take place. The Irish centre is within a few hundred yards of my home.</p>
	<p pid="a.1670.3/2">Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman. If he accepts that indirect encouragement of terrorism should be criminalised, he should have no fear about supporting our amendment. It gets round the problem of the Government's concept.</p>
	<p pid="a.1670.3/3">The clause that covers proscribing organisations specifically focuses on glorification. Again, the amendment would remove that focus and provide that, if an organisation referred to terrorism in a way that made people infer that they should emulate it, it would fall foul of the proscription provision. However, simply glorifying something would not fall foul of the provision. Some glorification will undoubtedly constitute a reference to behaviour and terrorism in a way that encourages emulation but some will not. The amendment would get rid of the concept of glorification. That is a great improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1670.3/4">I am waiting for the Home Secretary to intervene because no coherent argument has been advanced for the Government's reason for getting so hooked on the inclusion of glorification. I do not know what will happen when the Bill returns to the other place. I note that, for something that has become so intimately bound up with the Prime Minister's ego, when it previously returned to the Lords, only 156 out of 208 Labour peers turned up to support the proposals, even in the Government's great heave to show their mettle. Indeed, some Labour peers supported us.</p>

	<p pid="a.1671.0/1">What was the position of Opposition Front Benchers in the Lords in the debate? What were the reasons for their position?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1671.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="1671"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-26.htm#60316-26_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.1671.1/1">The Home Secretary can read what my noble Friend Lord Kingsland said. He took the view that the Government's slavish adherence to glorification was unproductive. He and many other peers on the Front and Back Benches criticised that. However, he said that the Opposition believed that the argument might have been exhausted and they therefore abstained on the vote. So many peers of all parties, including the Labour party, took objection to &quot;glorification&quot; that they defeated the Government despite the Government's turning out their troops in large numbers. That is a telling indication of the independent mindedness of the other place. For that reason, when the Bill returned here, I went to much trouble to ascertain whether there is a way in which we can square the circle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1671.1/2">At one stage, I drafted an amendment that made use of the words &quot;referring or glorifying&quot;. I try to apply a bit of logic to what I do, and I hope that the Home Secretary will forgive me for saying that I could see no basis on which the word &quot;glorifying&quot; in that context would add anything at all to the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1671.1/3">This is what worries me about the Government's approach. When we read the Bill, we see that the Government have created an offence and then, in a bizarre way, put in a subsection that draws specific attention to an activity that they want to criminalise or condemn. That is very bad law. It would have made sense, had the Government persevered&mdash;I am glad that they did not&mdash;and said that glorifying terrorism was in itself an offence. Mercifully, they did not go down that road, because enough people pointed out to them that that would have been a completely loopy proposal. What we have here, however, is a remnant of that loopiness. The House should not be in the business of encouraging loopy legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1671.2/1">I am following the hon. Gentleman's arguments closely. What comfort does he draw from the clear statement by Baroness Scotland, who speaks for the Government on this issue in the other place? When she was asked by my right hon. Friend the noble Lord Clinton-Davis whether there would be an opportunity to revisit this matter soon, she conceded that there would be &quot;bound to be&quot; such an opportunity. What comfort does the hon. Gentleman draw from that?</p>

	<p pid="a.1671.3/1">A pretty limited amount. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Government have said that at some point&mdash;probably not in the next parliamentary Session, but possibly the one after that&mdash;there could be a huge terrorism Bill to bring together all the many terrorism and anti-terrorism Bills that the Government have enacted in the past five years. We seem to move between terrorism Bills and anti-terrorism Bills. We have heard about the possibility of such a Bill in the context of control orders. I hope that, in the course of producing such a Bill, some of the loopier things that we have done will disappear down the plughole. That would include allowing people to be deemed to be members of a proscribed organisation on the basis of the hearsay evidence of a police officer. That measure has never been used since it was introduced. There are an awful lot of added-on bits that we could get rid of. However, we are in the hands of the Government, and I can easily envisage the circumstances in which the Home Secretary&mdash;despite having been completely honest when making the point in relation to control orders&mdash;could come to the House in 18 months' time and say, &quot;I'm sorry, but there is insufficient parliamentary time. We'll have to put this off for another two years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1671.3/2">In the meantime, the House should not put on the statute book a measure that is plainly idiotic and wrong. This problem could so easily be cured. If we were to cure it by adopting my amendment, the Bill would have every bit as much bite. It would be able to deal with those whom we wish to prosecute, and it would be able to help to uphold the rule of law without making us a laughing stock for having adopted a concept so opaque that it will be unintelligible when presented in court.</p>
	<p pid="a.1671.3/3">Hon. Members should also bear in mind the important point that certain law-abiding sections of society feel that they are being targeted by anti-terrorist activity. That is an almost inevitable consequence, but we must keep it in mind. It is my view&mdash;I wish it were the Home Secretary's view&mdash;that, in using terms such as &quot;glorification&quot; when they are not necessary to achieve our objective, we do ourselves no favours in the battle for hearts and minds that we have to win. That battle will have to go together with everything else that we do, if we are to curb the terrorist threat in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1671.3/4">For those reasons, I invite hon. Members to support our amendments in lieu of the Home Secretary's proposition. If we do not succeed in that regard, my colleagues and I will stand by the Lords amendments and vote against the Home Secretary's proposition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1672.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" speakername="Nicholas Clegg" colnum="1672"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-26.htm#60316-26_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.1672.0/1">In this debate, as in the earlier one on the Identity Cards Bill, the Government have revealed a curious attachment to a single, ill-defined word. The debate on identity cards highlighted their somewhat spectacular redefinition of the word &quot;voluntary&quot;. Now we are dealing with a Government&mdash;or more precisely a Prime Minister&mdash;who appear to be absolutely insistent on another word, &quot;glorification&quot;. A petulant insistence on the use of a particular word does not make good law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1672.0/2">The Government's position is weak on three counts. First, as was said earlier, there is no legally understood definition of the word &quot;glorification&quot;. It confuses the law, creating unnecessary imprecision and fluidity. That should not happen to a law that deals with such an important issue as tackling terrorism. The Joint Committee on Human Rights objected to the term on exactly that ground&mdash;legal imprecision&mdash;and we have still not heard a compelling argument from the Government to refute that view.</p>
	<p pid="a.1672.0/3">Secondly, the provision adds nothing other than confusion to existing laws that are deployed effectively to tackle many of the problems that it is supposed to address. The arrest yesterday of a number of protesters who used sickening and inflammatory language on their placards when demonstrating against the anti-Islamic cartoons published in Denmark shows that current laws against incitement appear to be working fairly well, although there was some delay in that case.</p>

	<p pid="a.1673.0/1">Surely the hon. Gentleman agrees that the enormous delay in the effecting of those arrests and the very small number of people who were arrested, given the large number who were protesting, show that action has not been taken as expeditiously as we would expect&mdash;and, indeed, as we saw in the case of the counter-demonstrators who were arrested there and then, and in that of the people who protested in support of liberties in the countryside a few months ago outside the House.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1673.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" speakername="Nicholas Clegg" colnum="1673"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-27.htm#60316-27_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1673.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point about the curious delay in the action taken by the police in arresting the placard protesters, but that is not really relevant to the fact that a law is already available to allow such prosecutions and arrests. There is no obvious loophole that the offence of glorification, even as a subset of indirect encouragement, is required to fill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1673.1/2">Thirdly and most important, the insistence on the term &quot;glorification&quot; will have a chilling effect on freedom of expression. It will lead, in effect, to self-censorship. Its application to any events&mdash;I think that this phrase in clause 1 is in parentheses, but it is important none the less&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1673.1/3" class="indent">&quot;whether in the past, in the future or generally&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1673.1/4">casts the net extremely wide. Muslim communities in particular, who have an understandable interest in debating and speaking out about conflicts on the west bank or in Gaza, or in Iraq, Chechnya or Kashmir, will find themselves especially vulnerable to the loose application of a poorly worded law. Is that really what we want at a time of heightened sensitivity between Muslim and other faiths?</p>
	<p pid="a.1673.1/5">Of course acts of terrorism, in those places as anywhere else, are abhorrent and must be condemned; but freedom to discuss them should not, surely, be threatened by such loosely worded legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1673.2/1">Is it not bizarre that while the Home Secretary seems to think that the exclusion of the word &quot;glorification&quot; from the Bill will send a signal to judges&mdash;who ought to know better&mdash;that the House of Commons thinks that it is okay for people to glorify, he is not worried about the possibility that the inclusion of the word will send the communities to whom the hon. Gentleman referred a misleading signal that they should not dare to mention such subjects in a legitimate debate?</p>

	<p pid="a.1673.3/1">That is an excellent point. The heavy-handed indifference to the effects on our culture of freedom of speech, and particularly the effects on certain communities, is both cavalier and dangerous. We are simply not going to win the battle against terrorism by driving debate underground. That is the fundamental problem with the Government's approach, and their insistence on the use of the word &quot;glorification&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.1674.0/1">My hon. Friend is right to say that the measure will lead to self-censorship. Those of us who have debated the issue at length know that the Government accept that. It is not that they are indifferent; they want us to be censored and self-censored. We see that in many Government proposals. It would be legitimate for the Government to take that view if they had any evidence that sacrificing a freedom would help rather than being counter-productive. There is no such evidence, and we are in danger of losing our freedoms to a Government who do not care about the importance of freedom of expression.</p>

	<p pid="a.1674.4/1">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman, in the circumstances, for his generosity. He will be aware that a significant number of people from Darfur are in this country seeking asylum or exceptional leave to remain. Would it not be an abomination if such people&mdash;in expressing support for the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, or strong opposition to the Government of Sudan or the Arab militias&mdash;were held up as supporters of terrorism when what they really want is the opportunity to enjoy civil rights and to live in a free Darfur?</p>

	<p pid="a.1674.5/1">Indeed, and the grotesque effect of poorly drafted legislation that the hon. Gentleman describes is also retrospective. Those who celebrate the Easter uprising or write about the American war of independence could be scooped up by the law in a way that no reasonable person would consider desirable. That is why the amendments before us to clauses 1 and 3, on &quot;indirect encouragement&quot;, deserve support from all parts of the House. Their wording is more precise in law, easier to read and more clearly understandable than the convoluted and garbled text on glorification.</p>

	<p pid="a.1674.7/1">If I may, I shall now address my remarks to the Home Secretary, who referred to the Opposition parties' attempt to find a way to satisfy the rather petulant insistence on the use of the word &quot;glorification&quot; by qualifying and defining it in a way that neuters its ill-judged effects. It was a serious, concerted and sincere attempt to secure agreement in all parts of the House, and if his only reaction to it is to make crass debating points, it will discourage further attempts in other situations to achieve cross-party consensus.</p>

	<p pid="a.1674.8/1">First, the hon. Gentleman should think carefully before describing the United Nations Security Council as petulant in its use of the word &quot;glorification&quot;, particularly given that he represents a party that has a strong tradition of internationalism and of support for the UN. Secondly, such efforts to reach agreement involved the two Opposition parties; they did not involve the Government at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.1675.0/1">With the greatest respect to the Home Secretary, his reaction to our sincere and, as it happens, rather open attempts to reach agreement, as revealed by the amendment, will discourage us the next time that we wish to achieve cross-party agreement on such matters. My recollection is that the UN's use of the word &quot;glorification&quot; was heavily qualified by legal understandings of intention and purposeful activity in the act of glorifying&mdash;understandings that have been excluded from this Bill. So the read-across to the UN understanding of &quot;glorification&quot; is not entirely valid.</p>

If so, the amendments before us deliver precisely what they want. They also include the refinements described by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon.

	<p pid="a.1675.3/1">I shall be brief, for obvious reasons. I want the Lords to continue to oppose the inclusion of the word &quot;glorification&quot; on the face of the Bill. I am no more a supporter of criminal terrorist acts than is any other hon. Member, but using such loose wording in legislation could be very dangerous. It could lead to some very dangerous and perverse prosecutions.</p>

Over the years, I have been to many meetings when the virtues of the Easter rising have been extolled, and the speeches made at those meetings could well be construed as glorifying what some people would call a terrorist act. In my part of London, Sir Roger Casement is a figure of veneration, rather than of condemnation, and there is no doubt that that is true in many other places. I have also attended celebrations of India's independence day, when speakers have extolled the virtue of the various figures who played a part in bringing that about that independence. In certain circumstances, I am sure that those speakers could be prosecuted under the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.1676.0/1">I always read Yeats' great poetry to myself, quietly at home, and never in public. However, I take the point: plenty of writings extol things that could be caught by the Bill. Indeed, history is full of accounts of the dreadful things done by British forces abroad&mdash;such as massacres in India and elsewhere&mdash;that I would argue could be interpreted as terrorist acts. I am not in favour of prosecuting anyone for talking about such matters, but that is the danger of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1676.0/2">The Home Secretary said that the leaders of the Muslim community in this country have condemned the language used in the demonstration outside the Danish embassy. That is true, but as far as I know, they have not supported the use of the word &quot;glorification&quot; in the Bill, because they see the dangers that would ensue. It does not take a huge imagination to work out that utterly ridiculous and perverse prosecutions could be brought under the Bill. However, it is also possible that a very serious prosecution could be brought&mdash;for example, in respect of what an imam might have said after Friday prayers. The matter would be dragged through the courts for months. The prosecution case might collapse, or the imam might be declared innocent, but a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre and a martyr will have been created in the meantime, and community relations will have been damaged. That is the danger of having such loose wording in the Bill.</p>

The argument makes the Government appear to be strong on terrorism, while leaving everyone else who oppose the Govt&mdash;on the Conservative, Liberal Democrat or even Labour Benches&mdash;looking somehow weak on the matter. Does he agree that this dangerous legislation could have been introduced for such cynical reasons?</p>

	<p pid="a.1676.2/1">No. I always want to be kind to the Government. I am sure that they would not want to promote any such cynical thoughts, although I admit that cynicism sometimes does creep into politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1676.2/2">A person who plants a bomb that kills people is committing a criminal act, and I remind the House that 12 people from my borough were killed on <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> last year. Obviously, those responsible should be prosecuted, as it was a criminal act. We already have a law under which such people can be prosecuted for such acts, but I do not understand how loose wording such as &quot;glorification&quot; can help anything. I believe that the use of that word is damaging, and that the perverse prosecutions that I mentioned earlier could create a dangerous situation in community relations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1676.3/1">Does my hon.

	<p pid="a.1677.0/1">Absolutely. The point is that this creates an atmosphere that becomes perverse and dangerous. As has been indicated in earlier debates, my constituency, like many other London constituencies has been the home of many people who were exiled leaders of revolutionary organisations in other countries. We had the leadership of the African National Congress, the SWAPO leadership, people from the Congress party in India and many others who have been condemned for terrorism. In public meetings from time immemorial through to the present, they would make speeches about liberation struggles in other parts of the world that could be construed as glorifying terrorism. I would probably argue that that was not the case, but as has been said, it only takes the failure of one prosecution to damage the law and create martyrs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.0/2">The Bill creates an atmosphere in which people feel constrained from speaking out or discussing anything in a rational, political way. It is important that we defend the right to free speech and to discuss history. It is important for teachers and professors to deal in detail with what may or may not have happened in a historical context. Free speech is a precious and important thing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1677.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. He made the point that the person who placed the bomb that affected his constituents was committing a criminal offence. I think that he will agree with me that the person who caused that bomb to be placed should be committing a criminal offence. That is the case because we have the incitement laws. Does he understand why the incitement laws are suddenly felt to be entirely inadequate for the purpose for which they were passed, and why they are not used to prosecute people who should be prosecuted?</p>

	<p pid="a.1677.2/1">I can only agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is clear that placing the bombs on the bus and the train, which killed my constituents and many others, was an illegal, criminal act. The same is true of supplying the material and planning the attack. I fail to understand how putting the word &quot;glorification&quot; on the face of the Bill makes anybody more secure. I think that in reality it creates a more divided community. The police say privately that what is important for security is co-operation between communities. If we reduce that co-operation by criminalising sections of the community, we are on a slippery slope.</p>

	<p pid="a.1678.0/1">There is a feeling in Government&mdash;it is the same in all Governments&mdash;that when something awful happens, they have to be seen to be doing something. The only thing Governments can do, apart from making statements and providing resources for the forces of law and order, is to pass new legislation. So that is what they do, and I suspect, to some extent, that is what we are doing here today. I hope that the Lords stick with it on the issue of glorification. I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> wants to intervene, or maybe he is just waving at me.

	<p pid="a.1678.1/1">In partial, but only partial, defence of the Government's intention, it is fair to point out that while terrorist acts and incitement offences occur, the convention against terrorism requires the Government to introduce a measure against indirect encouragement or incitement, which is what the Bill does. However, as the Joint Committee on Human Rights pointed out, the convention does not require the inclusion of the word &quot;glorification&quot; for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman and other Members have given, which is that it is too vague and too broad.</p>

	<p pid="a.1678.2/1">I can but agree with the hon. Gentleman. If the wording is vague and too broad, we will end up with a dangerous situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1678.2/2">We are all concerned about many issues in the UK and around the world. We want an inclusive society, where people feel able to express their political point of view and to represent causes all over the world. The Bill has international reach; indeed, it has global, even intergalactic, reach&mdash;it knows no limit. So let us suppose that we invited elected Members of the Palestinian Authority to address a meeting in the House, as many of us have done over the years. Their speeches describing the situation could be construed as glorifying terrorism. I do not necessarily think that would be the case, but it could happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1678.2/3">We are moving into dangerous, uncharted waters with the Bill. Perverse prosecutions will bring about serious breakdowns in community relations, and I urge the Government to think carefully and seriously about such a vague and sloppy word as &quot;glorification&quot;, when a much closer definition would meet the need for decency and security and deal with people who commit criminal acts, because that is what we are talking about.</p>

	<p pid="a.1678.3/1">I have been listening to the debate for some time, and if there has been any serious examination of the meaning of the word &quot;glorification&quot; it has escaped my notice. One might be forgiven for assuming that there was no reference to its interpretation in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1678.3/2">In earlier debates on the measure, I pointed out that I thought it would be extremely difficult for courts to construe a meaning. The definition in clause 20 notes that glorification</p>

	<p pid="a.1678.5/1">I think not, and that is not because I suspect that my hon. Friend will raise a point that I had not thought of.</p>
	<p pid="a.1678.5/2">With respect to the context of the use of the word &quot;glorification&quot;, I entirely endorse my hon. Friend's view that the Prime Minister is on a bit of an ego trip. The Prime Minister has stuck closely to the assumption that the word has to remain in the Bill. The word is defined in various dictionaries and that, after all, is the only basis on which the courts can make a construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1678.5/3">For people who are concerned about the connection between glorification and terrorism in the Islamic context, the rather dangerous first definition&mdash;from the point of view that things could spin out of control&mdash;is that the word means to praise and worship God. Those who know and understand something about the meaning of Islam and the proper reverence attached to the word Allah will realise that it could mean that anybody who was found to have glorified God in that context would automatically find a conflation between God on the one hand and terrorism on the other. That is an extremely difficult area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1678.5/4">I notice that the Home Secretary is chuntering and saying &quot;Ridiculous&quot;. If he thinks that that was ridiculous, he should look at the dictionary. The courts will have to construe those words and that was the first definition given.</p>

	<p pid="a.1679.0/1">My hon. Friend is making an important point. As he is showing, one of the things that the Home Secretary has done is to give constant illustrative definitions but no comprehensive definitions, so the scope is wide. As my hon. Friend says, glorification could be much more than praise and celebration, even though praise and celebration are singled out in the Bill. Does he agree that that is part of the mischief of passing such opaque legislation? It leaves people in uncertainty, which is a bad principle on which to legislate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1679.1/1">I could not agree more with my hon. Friend, and I go further and say that the second definition that is given is to</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/2" class="indent">&quot;reveal the glory of God by one's actions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/3">Even the Home Secretary, even the Prime Minister, cannot ignore the definitions that are given, for example, in the &quot;Oxford dictionary&quot;. When we are dealing with words, as Lewis Carroll said, words mean what we choose them to mean.</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The question is&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/5">who is</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/6" class="indent">&quot;to be master&mdash;that's all.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/7">In that context, we know from the &quot;Parkinson&quot; interview where the Prime Minister puts himself in this case. He raises his eyes to heaven; he invokes God for guidance. So we are moving into very deep water here.</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/8">My next point relates to the alternative definition that is given, which is to</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/9" class="indent">&quot;describe or represent as admirable, especially unjustifiably&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/10">If that is the definition that the Government want&mdash;I am amazed that they have not attempted to define the word &quot;glorification&quot; more precisely&mdash;they could have chosen that definition, which might have helped them out of some of the difficulties, but no, they insist that the only definition that they want is the one that I started off with, which merely includes any form of praise or celebration. They have moved into dangerous territory; they are actually inviting those of the Islamic fundamentalist disposition to make the worst of this when it crops up. The courts will be forced into a definition. The Government are negligent in not having provided a more precise definition. If the Government cannot come up with a precise definition, they should abandon the words and go back to the wording that has been suggested by the Conservative Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="a.1679.1/11">It is perfectly simple. The Home Secretary is in a trap&mdash;the trap that has been laid for him unwittingly by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister should take note of what is being said. I have no doubt that, as a result of the lack of a definition, the Bill is seriously defective and the Lords have every right to reject the amendment if a majority in the House sends it back to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1680.0/1">I shall try to be briefer than some of the speakers this afternoon, but we should think carefully before we pass a clause that is so open to misinterpretation, as hon.

	<p pid="a.1680.1/1">Nor is the list as narrow as some might suppose. Would my hon. Friend not accept that it is not simply a question of forming a view and commenting on particular events?

	<p pid="a.1680.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point and he is renowned for his interest in human rights. But I think that we have a right to ask ourselves how confident we can be that a measure that will impinge on freedom of speech should be passed by a Government who have probably lost the confidence of members of the public. Two days before the Queen's Speech in 2004, which was when this legislation was first mooted, the front page of the <i>Daily Mail</i> contained a headline about a hijack attempt on Canary Wharf by al-Qaeda operatives. I have looked in vain ever since for any evidence of arrests or of people being charged, but there has been absolutely none.</p>
	<p pid="a.1680.2/2">I suggest to the Home Secretary that that article was deliberately placed into the <i>Daily Mail</i> before the Queen's Speech in a shoddy attempt to stoke up public opinion to get people to support this measure in the first place. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Home Secretary laughs&mdash;so perhaps when he sums up, he will tell us whether or not the security services were briefed to talk to the <i>Daily Mail.</i> If the security services were briefed to talk to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, perhaps the Home Secretary could tell us why. If they were not briefed to do so, perhaps he could tell us why he did not order the same sort of investigation to hunt down the mole in MI5 or MI6 who spoke to the <i>Daily Mail</i> in exactly the same way that the Government shamefully hunted down&mdash;</p>

It is virtually unprecedented in my experience of the House that an important Bill coming to its final stages is suddenly hoicked from the Order Paper for no reason, and the Government do not have the courtesy to give the House an explanation.</p>

I raised that point of order two weeks ago, and I have heard nothing since then, apart from noisy night flights out of that airport.

	<p pid="a.1690.2/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to raise what is becoming one of the most serious issues for local people in West Sussex, which is the shortage of water. The past two years have been the driest period in the south-east since 1922, surpassing even the most serious post-war drought, which many of us remember, between 1974 and 1976. Many parts of the south-east have experienced less than three quarters of their long-term average rainfall in that period, and last winter was the second driest in Sussex since 1904. Only four of the past 16 months have seen rainfall reach average levels, and research commissioned by the south-east counties leaders group in 2004 found that less than half of the rainfall experienced in the region recharges water resources, which means that the south-east has less water per head than Syria.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.2/2">Current water levels continue to cause concern. Despite some rainfall last month, river levels in West Sussex are at their lowest level for three decades&mdash; for example, the Ouse was flowing at only 41 per cent. of its long-term average last month. Almost 70 per cent. of water supplies in the south-east come from underground, so it is particularly worrying that groundwater levels are still below the long-term average for this month. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March</phrase>, the Bewl reservoir, which serves 400,000 people in Kent and East Sussex, was only 53 per cent. full, which is the lowest level that the reservoir has reached at this time of the year since it was built in 1974&mdash;for comparison's sake, the average level for this time of year is 84 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1690.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important Adjournment debate. He is aware, because he is coming to an infrastructure seminar tomorrow in East Grinstead in my constituency, that the Weirwood reservoir is even lower than Bewl. Is he aware that the Government have imposed on West Sussex county council a target to build 4,000 new houses at East Grinstead and that the requirement for extra water for those houses will be 6.75 million litres a day? Where does he think that that water will come from, and does he agree that that is not sustainable development?</p>

	<p pid="a.1690.4/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend and agree with everything that he says. That is indeed the worry&mdash;where will the water come from in order to support the additional housing demand? I pay tribute to him for holding his infrastructure seminar tomorrow, at which leaders of the county councils and others will discuss the problem of the infrastructure deficit. That was also addressed by the private Member's Bill promoted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1642" name="Francis Maude">my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude)</phrase>, which West Sussex Members were delighted to support and which suggested that there should be a proper audit of the infrastructure requirements of a development before it goes ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.4/2">The Weirwood reservoir is at about half its normal level, and the Environment Agency has confirmed that only one of the seven reservoirs serving the southern region is at normal levels for this time of year. That has a serious impact in several ways. First, it affects farming. The south-east is one of England's most important regions for arable farming and horticulture, which takes place in the south of my constituency. The drought is already causing concern as the key growing season looms. The Environment Agency's report, &quot;Drought Prospects&quot;, published last month, set out three possible scenarios for the summer: average rainfall for February to April, 80 per cent. of the average during that period, or 60 per cent. of the average. The report stated that if the south-east were to receive only 60 per cent. of the average for this time of year,</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.4/3" class="indent">&quot;Farmers would find groundwater and surface water sources to be very unreliable and could expect restrictions on spray irrigation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.4/4">That will have a direct impact on the supplies of the food that they produce and on their profitability, which is already being challenged.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.4/5">Secondly, there is an environmental impact, including on local wildlife. Some of the finest wetland nature reserves in England are located in the south-east, such as Pulborough Brooks in my constituency. I suspect that the Minister may know about that. The ground is increasingly dry for the hundreds of pairs of lapwings and redshanks that traditionally breed in the south-east, and as flood plains dry out there are ever fewer places where these birds can breed and nest. At Pulborough Brooks reserve, just one pair of lapwings produced chicks last year, compared with 10 pairs in a normal year. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that that is because of the drought.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.4/6">In terms of the prospect now confronting us, the Environment Agency has warned that water companies in the south-east, such as Southern Water, which largely serves my constituency, will need to do several things, all of which I wish to discuss. They include maintaining hosepipe bans, educating the public further about the severity of the drought, increased leakage control, and ensuring that their own drought plans are taken in good time. What worried me, and was one of the reasons why I called the debate, was the Environment Agency's comment that</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.4/7" class="indent">&quot;Any delay increases the risk later in the year of extreme steps to manage public water supply, such as the introduction of standpipes and rota cuts&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.4/8">That public statement by the Environment Agency has begun to worry people who already face hosepipe bans in their households. I understand from a meeting that I had with Southern Water this week that it hopes that standpipes will not have to be introduced. However, the fact that the agency has warned of that underlines the need for further measures to deal with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.4/9">A hosepipe ban has already been in place in West Sussex for eight months. It is extraordinary to impose a hosepipe ban during the winter months. The current hosepipe bans affect more than 3.4 million people in the whole of the south-east. Following Thames Water's announcement of a hosepipe ban, that extension will affect another 3.5 million people. Folkestone and Dover Water has applied for water scarcity status and has become the first water company to be successful in being given the go-ahead to install compulsory water meters, as legislated for by the Water Industry Act 1999. I should like to explore the extent to which the Government are willing to see a further use of water meters and what impact they think that that will have on consumption and on some of the poorer households who may be adversely affected if there is a further move towards water metering.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.4/10">I want to deal specifically with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> raised about population growth in the south-east.</p>

	<p pid="a.1692.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. People watching it may be confused because, only a few years ago, there were television images of villages that were almost washed away. Barrels from the brewery in Lewes in another part of Sussex were seen floating down the river and the city of Chichester was severely damaged. However, we have long-term water shortage problems in the south-east, which will be compounded for reasons that my hon. Friend will outline. Does he believe that there is any scope for designation as an area of water shortage, as is possible under the Water Industry Act 1999, to draw attention to our long-term problems?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1692.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" speakername="Nick Herbert" colnum="1692"  time="016:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-32.htm#60316-32_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1692.1/1">I should like to ask the Minister precisely that question. Perhaps such a measure is necessary but we need to understand its implications for local people and the move to compulsory water metering.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/2">A big population increase is projected in the south-east. That is set to happen against a background in which, nationally, household water use has increased by more than half since 1971. Just over 8 million people currently live in the south-east but that population is projected to grow by more than 1 million in the next two decades. The South East England regional assembly, at the behest of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that it wants an additional 578,000 homes built in the next 20 years. That is an annual average of 28,900 across the south-east. Fifty-eight thousand homes will be located in West Sussex&mdash;a build rate of 2,900 a year. Yesterday, a report in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> highlighted Government projections and estimated that, on top of those figures, up to 5 million new homes will be needed in England in the next 20 years. Ironically, a subsequent report in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> ran a feature on the hosepipe bans and water shortages in the south-east. There is a clear connection between the increase in population, the projected increase in house building and the current scarcity of water. It is important that all concerned take that connection on board and plan properly for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/3">The Water Resources in the South East group concluded in September 2004 that</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/4" class="indent">&quot;increased demand from new development in the South East can only be accommodated through a combination of demand and supply side activities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/5">That was based on a forecast that, by 2025, more than half the households in the south-east would be on meters. The group states that, unless that takes place, we will not be in balance in 20 years. It is therefore important for the additional number of households to be on meters. The question is whether we will hit the target.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/6">Last year, WaterVoice, which is now the Consumer Council for Water, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Adequate water and sewerage services are a fundamental requirement and development/growth cannot proceed until robust water and sewerage infrastructures are in place to meet the demands placed on them . . . Water resources in the South East are already closely balanced with current customer demand. Any significant increase in population, as forecast in the plan&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/8">the housing plan, to which I referred&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/9" class="indent">&quot;will place an unsustainable pressure on existing water resources. Improving water efficiency and minimising leakage are essential components of the plan . . . The intention to promote water efficiency in new homes through the planning process is supported but it remains unclear how existing housing stock can be made more water efficient without some form of financial incentive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/10">The current planning, which the Bill that my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham presented tried to tackle, puts water companies under a statutory duty to provide the water only when planning permission is granted for house building. It does not provide for any formal water consultation process to involve water companies in the planning system. When we are considering house building on the scale suggested in the south-east, such formal consultation would be a good idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/11">The Environmental Audit Committee of the House of Commons concluded last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/12" class="indent">&quot;No proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without ensuring that there is a strong evidence base to support them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/13">I have mentioned the Infrastructure Audit (Housing Development) Bill, which was introduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham and given a First Reading in the House. Last year, I also asked the Deputy Prime Minister to what extent he had assessed the infrastructure improvements that would be necessary to meet the house building targets in the south-east. I received a reply that simply stated that the Government were committed to &quot;exploring&quot; the infrastructure needs. Given the serious water shortage in the south-east, exploring is not going to be good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/14">At Prime Minister's questions two weeks ago, I asked the right hon. Gentleman whether he accepted that the Government had a responsibility to deal with the infrastructure deficit before putting in place the additional homes in the south-east. He replied that</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/15" class="indent">&quot;that is what we are doing.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 253.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/16">I want to be sure that that is the case in regard to water, roads, health care and so on&mdash;all of which are under great pressure in West Sussex. I remain to be convinced&mdash;indeed, I am far from convinced&mdash;that that infrastructure investment is going ahead before the housing programme begins.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/17">There is also a possibility of an extension to the proposed hosepipe ban, which would involve a ban on non-essential use. That idea has been floated in the local media, and I understand from meetings with Southern Water that there is every likelihood that such a ban will be introduced in its part of West Sussex shortly. A non-essential use ban would mean not only that people could not use a hosepipe to wash their car, but that they would not be able to wash their car at all. Under such a ban, people could not even wash their car using a bucket and a sponge. As the public become increasingly aware of the severity of these measures&mdash;which will be put in place at the beginning, not the end, of the summer&mdash;they will quite rightly make further demands to find out what is being done to ensure that a proper water supply is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/18">I understand that the water companies plan on the basis that there will be a drought once every 10 years, and that measures such as those bans are therefore acceptable. I believe that that planning scenario should be revisited. It is unacceptable to work on the assumption that there will be hosepipe bans once every 10 years. That is not the case in other parts of the world, and I do not see why people living in the south-east&mdash;and in West Sussex in particular&mdash;should have to live under that presumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/19">There are two ways of dealing with this situation. First, there should be an increase in supply. Local people will want to know what the water companies are doing about investing in new reservoirs, for example. Secondly, and more contentiously, we could moderate demand by introducing water meters. I fully accept that there is a case for that, but if metering is to be extended, the water companies must address their leakage problems first, in order to maintain public confidence in their actions. If the public were being asked to pay the price of the shortages through water metering, but the water companies were not meeting their responsibility to deal with leaks, that could lead to a breakdown in relations between the water companies and the public. I am sure that the water companies are alive to that risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/20">Water meters are now on the agenda, following the application for water scarcity status in Folkestone by Folkestone and Dover Water. The number of metered households in the country has increased, and more than a fifth of properties in Sussex now have metered water. That is partly as a result of meters being installed automatically in new homes. Also, as someone who is about to purchase a new home in West Sussex, I have discovered that simply transferring ownership within the county means that I shall have to install a water meter. People can also volunteer to have a water meter. I appreciate that it is intended to increase the numbers of homes with water meters by those means, and Southern Water aims to increase the take-up to 44 per cent. by 2010. However, that is some way short of the target that will be necessary to ensure that we have adequate demand management measures, in concert with supply, to supply the additional housing over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/21">It is clear that water metering has a beneficial impact. Consumers cut their consumption by some 10 per cent. on average when meters are installed. It is significant that the Isle of Wight, where more than 90 per cent. of the 65,000 homes are metered, has not had a hosepipe ban since 1976. One has now been introduced, but much later than the bans introduced in other parts of the south-east. That suggests that metering is a successful part of the formula for dealing with that problem, but it is only a part.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/22">On international comparisons, as so often in relation to environmental matters, we are behind many of our peer group countries. There is 100 per cent. water metering for the supply to the six Scandinavian cities of Oslo, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm&ouml;. There is 100 per cent. water metering in urban authorities in Australia and very high levels of water metering in the Netherlands. As politicians, we have to decide the extent to which we recognise our responsibilities to take decisions that might be unpopular but are in the interests of the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/23">It has also been suggested that we should have a national grid for water. However, it would be prohibitively expensive. Because 1 cu m of water weighs a tonne, it would require enormous amounts of energy to pump the water from the north of England to the south. The water would also have to be clean. It would not be possible to pump untreated water and put it into rivers, because of the environmental impact of shifting wildlife from one part of the country to the other. It is important that if such measures are to be put aside, the Government and the water companies tell us precisely what will happen to ensure that every household has a water supply in parts of the country such as West Sussex, especially given the huge increase in housing that is expected. We may disagree about the merits of that housing and its location, but it is perfectly reasonable of local people to request that it should be accompanied by an adequate water supply. There is plainly insufficient water at present, which undermines public confidence that supplies will be available in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.1/24">I am grateful to the Minister for replying to the debate and I hope that he will be able to offer some reassurance to our constituents, who are genuinely concerned about this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.1695.0/1">I offer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">my sincere thanks to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> for allowing me to contribute to his Adjournment debate on this important issue. Members who represent West Sussex are not divided politically about the difficulties that we face, although we might not agree on how to tackle the problem and the factors that contribute to the water shortage in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695.0/2">I note from parliamentary questions that many Members with constituencies in West Sussex have taken a deep interest in the problem and have been keen to ensure that Ministers are pressed on it. Owing to the very dry periods that we have experienced lately, our area is being described as semi-arid, which may shock our constituents but is entirely accurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695.0/3">We should recognise, however, that such periods are cyclical, occurring&mdash;as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs pointed out&mdash;every 10 years. We need a measured and reasonable response to what is a sad state of affairs, especially in our part of the world. Our reservoirs present a picture that makes us all feel incredibly concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.1695.1/1">The hon. Lady is right to say that this is not a political matter. She is also right to say that there is a cyclical element in climate changes of this sort. Nevertheless, the cyclical element has occurred at a time when the Government have imposed massive house building targets on West Sussex. In mid-Sussex alone, an infrastructure deficit of over &pound;1 billion has been necessary to cope with the projected new building. How does the hon. Lady think the Government will deal with that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1696.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="1696"  time="016:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-33.htm#60316-33_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1696.0/1">I was about to say that this is probably where the divide occurs. I do not consider it responsible to say that because of water shortages we should not have the houses that our area needs so desperately. The hon. Gentleman, who knows the constituency of Crawley extremely well, is aware of the pressure for new housing. I believe that we can accommodate the building of houses for people in desperate need, while developing a sense of self-awareness among those who are lucky enough to have homes already, with access to fresh potable water.</p>
	<p pid="a.1696.0/2">A series of parliamentary questions and letters to, in particular, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have asked what is considered when new housing is proposed. It is important to ensure that a precious resource is taken properly into account before any new building takes place. I have found the advice I have received extremely useful, and I make sure that my constituents receive it as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1696.0/3">I was interested by the hon. Gentleman's proposition that the water company should be a statutory consultee. I have spent quite a bit of time with the water companies, particularly South East Water. I was impressed by the work that South East Water is doing to reduce leakage, improve supply and ensure that people think carefully about how they use their precious resource, but I do not think that making the company a statutory consultee is the answer. The water company's business is to supply water, and I suspect that no matter what question it is asked, it will say, &quot;We can supply water.&quot; The guidance from the ODPM is therefore an important element in ensuring that that is so. I do, however, firmly believe that the water companies are playing a significant role, as are local authorities, in making us understand our responsibility as tenants and home owners in West Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="a.1696.0/4">Interesting measures have been taken in Crawley to ensure that we conserve our precious water supplies. Recently, my constituents were able to buy water butts for their gardens at an incredibly low price, subsidised by the local authority. It understood that people are keen to take such steps and the service was very heavily used. In fact, we had a really jolly weekend. Some of the people who came to get a water butt decided to come back for a second one when they discovered another drainpipe on their roof that could enable them to save even more water. There was also an education centre, which gave advice on saving water. We know that we could accommodate more house building if more people took such steps. Putting just one brick or &quot;hippo&quot; in our cisterns can enable others to access fresh water. We should share much of that advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.1696.1/1">This debate is of course about water, and the hon. Lady is rightly telling us about the excellent and admirable things that Crawley borough council is doing. I do not want to interrupt this cosy consensus, but the problem is not just water. In fact, as she rightly says, water can be produced and it can be pumped from Wales, Scotland or anywhere. The problem is the overall infrastructure package, which includes not just water, but sewerage, roads and railways. All of that requires enormous investment if Crawley or anywhere else in West Sussex is to cope with the demands being imposed, which will come under the heading of sustainable development.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-16a.1697.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="1697"  time="016:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060316/debtext/60316-33.htm#60316-33_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.1697.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention and I do not disagree one bit. I am simply trying to ensure that water is included in that very important overall infrastructure package, because it is sometimes forgotten about.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.0/2">Many steps can be taken. Personal responsibility should extend not only to our own homes&mdash;we should also take steps to help others. Self-awareness and self-promotion for home owners is very important, and we can create a much better infrastructure if we make sure that people understand that water is part of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.0/3">There have been some fantastic campaigns, such as Water Wise. South-east water companies have taken a very active role, alongside Government officials, in examining all aspects of water supply. Importantly, a statutory duty will be placed on the Environment Agency to ensure that it properly examines the water supply in a particular area. That follows on from the Water Act 2003, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for helping me to understand how that duty will impact on future consideration of water supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.0/4">So much is being done on this crucial issue. We should not alarm people to the point where they feel that all future house building should be rejected because of possible water shortages. We should ensure that we take a responsible attitude to this issue, which the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs certainly did in his speech. Labour Members will want to ensure that water metering does not result in water being a scarce resource for low-income families. My son is an environmental health officer and his entire reason for becoming one was to help ensure that people have decent living conditions. He would be absolutely horrified if we tried to impose water metering on everyone, although it is a good idea for many. People who have meters find it very upsetting to watch others on relatively high incomes wash their cars and then aim the hosepipe down the drain when they have lunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.0/5">Finally, we can tackle the problem in other ways. A young man in Crawley, who was educated in Crawley school, has developed a no-water car-cleaning product. I hope that such technologies will help to ensure that we in West Sussex keep our precious resource of water.</p>

	<p pid="a.1697.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> on securing this very important debate. I also want to thank the Minister for allowing me to speak at short notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/2">We have had problems in Roehampton in my constituency that tie in with what has been said already in the debate. I want to give a view of the problem as it appears in a part of Greater London that is well developed and increasingly heavily populated. About two weeks ago, Thames Water decided to reduce the water pressure at the Putney pumping station, partly as a result of the increasing population in Wimbledon. There has also been a big problem with leaks locally, with two having to be fixed in my road in the past month.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/3">As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, it is incumbent on water companies to tackle leakages when they happen, but reducing the pressure at Putney pumping station has had a negative impact on some of my most disadvantaged constituents living on the Alton estate. They occupy very high council tower blocks, but the lower pressure means that the highest flats cannot get water pumped up to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/4">As a result, Thames Water has proposed to install what it calls a water booster pump in each of the tower blocks, at a cost that I believe will be in the region of &pound;50,000. The council is being asked to meet that cost, but the flats' leaseholders will also have to pay their share. Some 300 people in my constituency have received bills of between &pound;800 and &pound;2,000, with the money going to pay for the water booster pumps in their tower blocks. Other taxpayers&mdash;myself included&mdash;are also contributing to that payment, as we are paying for the council tenants' contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/5">I am especially worried about this matter. As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, the water companies must be careful to protect their relationship with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">their customers. The hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> said that water companies will never say that they cannot supply water, but I wish that she was right. In Roehampton and Putney, we are facing the problem that the water companies are saying exactly that&mdash;that they cannot supply water to some homes. Ironically, it is people on lower incomes who live in affordable housing or council stock&mdash;they may have managed to buy their own council property several years ago&mdash;who now have to pay huge bills of up to &pound;2,000. I have written to Thames Water and to Ofwat about the problem, but unsustainable development in the south-east or West Sussex will ensure that the constituents of other hon. Members soon face problems similar to those that my constituents face. It is often the people who can least afford to pay who are being charged in the way that I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/6">I hope that the Minister will be able to give advice or guidance to Ofwat and the water companies about the appropriateness of their behaviour, given that Thames Water made an after-tax profit last year of nearly &pound;200 million. A great deal of that profit is distributed to shareholders, but the company would do better to invest a little more in local pipe infrastructures before it asks tenants to pay for its inadequacies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1698.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> on securing this debate and raising a series of important issues in relation to water supply. Water supply, which is heavily regulated, is a crucial part of the infrastructure of this country. We have had some bad droughts, and the hon. Gentleman referred to the last serious one, which affected Yorkshire Water badly. It was at the time when people were being urged to shower with a friend and take similar steps. I do not think we are quite in that situation yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/2">Measures have been introduced, particularly since the water summit of 1997, which was chaired by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. The 1999 legislation and the Water Act 2003 were designed to make sure that we do not have the major problems of severe water shortages that we have had in the past. That is not to say that we should be complacent. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we have had some of the lowest rainfalls since 1921 in the south-east of England and we are facing what may be one of the worst droughts for nearly 100 years. There are serious issues, and water companies have a duty to put drought plans in place&mdash;I shall say a few words about those&mdash;and they have been responding responsibly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/3">I want to touch upon a point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the hon. Gentleman and by my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase>, that of development. It is true that for development, it is necessary to have the infrastructure to go with it. I shall concentrate on water tonight, but that is not to say that I do not recognise that there are other issues, such as transport, roads, schools, and hospitals, that go with new development. They are addressed in the structural plans. However, whatever the argument about numbers, it is clear that there is an overwhelming need for more homes, particularly in the south-east. That desire for more homes, which is felt by the constituents of hon. Members who are in the Chamber this evening, is something that we as a Government, and local authorities, cannot ignore. It is also true that we have to approach new communities on the basis of sustainable communities. Planning for water is part of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/4">The hon. Gentleman asked what steps were being taken in relation to development to ensure that there will be an adequate water supply. The South East England regional assembly is about to submit the complete draft of the regional special strategy for the south-east, the south-east plan, to the Government. The plan is on course for submission on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase>. It will then go through consultation, independent testing and public examination before being approved by the Government in 2008. That plan addresses the issue of water supply. Water companies are statutory consultees in relation to structure plans and planning authorities will be statutory consultees on water company resource plans. It is a two-way process so that both know what is going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/5">The Environment Agency, together with the water companies and the regional assembly, has undertaken modelling work on the impact of new house building on water supply. It has modelled six options based around the figures in the draft south-east plan and the impact of growth areas. It has concluded that a combination of supply and demand side interventions will mean that numbers can be accommodated. I want to make that clear. In relation to expansion of homes, numbers can be accommodated in terms of water resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/6">Interventions include an assumption on increasing water efficiency, and the possible construction of new reservoir infrastructure. New homes are much more water-efficient than existing stock, because of improvements in building regulations. The hon. Gentleman might be interested to know that the draft south-east plan, policy NRM2, sets out policy for a number of reservoirs. There are five in the draft plan. I have a list of all the reservoirs that are planned for the south-east. New reservoirs are planned for Southern Water at Broad Oak, for South East Water at Clay Hill, for Portsmouth Water Ltd.&mdash;which supplies part of Sussex&mdash;at Havant Thicket and for Thames Water at Abingdon. There are proposals to extend existing reservoirs. The plans include raising Bewl for Southern Water and Mid Kent Water, where the proposal is to raise the banks and increase capacity significantly, the Bray enlargement for South East Water and Abberton for Essex &amp; Suffolk Water. I was in Essex recently, talking to the local water company. I know that raising the banks at Abberton will increase the reservoir's capacity by 60 per cent. I am sure that the effect will be similar at Bewl. There is also provision for water transfers within regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/7">I shall go through some of the measures introduced in the 2003 Act to manage future demand for water resources. They include time limits for all new abstraction licences; the facility to revoke without compensation abstraction licences where serious environmental damage has been caused, which relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs about damage to river ecosystems; greater flexibility to raise or lower licensing thresholds according to local pressure on water resources; and the extension of licensing to abstractors of significant quantities who are not included in the current licensing system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/8">Water company drought plans are a statutory requirement. Each water company must have plans to deal with drought, which has been helpful in dealing with the current situation. Water resource management plans are to become a statutory requirement. Consultation on the regulations is in progress and ends in April 2006. They will require water companies to look at future demand on a 25-year time scale. The 2003 Act also introduces new duties on the Secretary of State, regulators, water companies and public bodies to further water conservation. My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley made the important point that people can take simple measures to reduce water consumption: for example, not leaving the tap running or fitting water-saving devices such as spray taps, low-pressure shower heads and twin-flush toilets. None of those devices is particularly expensive and can be installed when modernising a bathroom or replacing fittings. We are also addressing such matters in new regulations on housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/9">The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned water scarcity status. As he said, an application from Folkestone and Dover has been granted and the company's case was subject to a six-month examination. Any water company can apply for water scarcity status and such applications will be treated on their merits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/10">I was impressed that the hon. Gentleman had faced head-on the issue of water meters. They can be controversial, although the response from Folkestone and Dover was muted; 40 per cent. of the company's customers were already on meters, which may be part of the explanation. The company calculated that up to 70 per cent. of its customers would pay less on a meter, which is quite a significant number. Many people underestimate the benefits of water meters, although of course 30 per cent. will pay more because they are big users of water.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/11">Meters may pose problems for vulnerable groups, as my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley pointed out. I can reassure her, because the vulnerable groups regulations are designed to protect large families on low incomes and people with certain medical conditions. A pilot scheme on water affordability is running in the south-west, which is helping us to understand how we might refine the regulations to improve them and make them more effective. We have an open mind about such things, but we want to make sure that water metering would not cause suffering for the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/12">There is an argument for metering; it reduces demand and is a fairer way of paying for water, but there is no water shortage in the north of England&mdash;the most severe pressure is in the south and the south-east&mdash;so there is not really a strong case for compulsory water meters nationally. We want an expansion in the use of water meters, but it should be undertaken as it is at present&mdash;by the combination of people volunteering to use them and installing them in new homes or when people move. That means that their use is constantly increasing, but people still have a choice. It also spreads the cost of fitting the meters, which has had to be borne by the companies. So I think that is going okay.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/13">Where there is water scarcity, though, there is clearly an argument for compulsory metering, as one tool. It is not the only tool. Companies have a responsibility to ensure that there is proper supply management, which includes such things as addressing leakage; that is taken into account when companies apply for water scarcity status.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/14">I must correct the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. He had me worried for a moment when he talked about washing cars with recycled water. When there is a hosepipe and sprinkler ban, it is permissible to use the bathwater to wash a car, or to take water out of the bath with a bucket and put it on the dahlias; that is not a problem and people do that. And of course one can collect rainwater, as my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley rightly said. In fact, I also benefited from a promotion by my local authority, which was giving away water butts. I was very enthusiastic. When I collected my water butt I found a party atmosphere, as my hon. Friend did. I suppose that the idea of getting something free from the council is always popular, so that probably explains the party atmosphere. It must have affected me, because I was so excited about my new water butt that I sawed through next door's downpipe when I connected it; but never mind&mdash;it is connected now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/15">My hon. Friend also mentioned the range of measures that can be taken. She mentioned Water Wise, a group set up by the industry; I very much welcome that. We have also set up a water saving group, which I chair. It brings together the regulator, the Consumer Council for Water and industry representatives. The idea is to have working streams to look at ways of promoting water saving, in terms of demand and supply management, awareness and new technologies. That process is under way and I am grateful for the enthusiastic support that we have had from the entire industry. Water Wise is also represented on that group and I very much appreciate that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/16"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1771" name="Justine Greening">The hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening)</phrase> mentioned a constituency problem of reduced water pressure. I quite understand the point that she makes. Water pressure is sometimes reduced as a way of combating leaks, and leaks are a problem in the Thames region. Thames, like all water companies, has targets to reduce leakage, but it has been missing those targets in recent years. I am glad to say that currently it is on target and I very much welcome that, but it has much more to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/17">Funnily enough, I had the opposite problem in my constituency. People had complained of low water pressure, and I asked the water company whether it could be increased. The company was very co-operative; it increased the pressure, with the result that the water main burst in the street concerned and no one got any water at all. My involvement in that was played down.</p>
	<p pid="a.1698.0/18">The hon. Lady asked for some advice on what she could do. I understand that there is an obligation and a duty on water companies to provide minimum pressure to pump water to the topmost storey of a block of flats.</p>

	<p pid="a.1702.0/1">I am extremely grateful for that clarification, because I looked into the matter, and my understanding is that under the Water Industry Act 1991, the uppermost limit was 10 m. My flats were above that level, and there was no statutory duty to supply to any level above 10 m. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that. If I am incorrect, I shall be delighted.</p>

	<p pid="a.1702.1/1">I acknowledge that this is a local, constituency issue and an important one for the hon. Lady. I will find out exactly what the regulations are on that point, and I will write to inform her.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702.1/2">On Thames Water, I want to make it clear that while it has met its target for this year, it has not met its overall target for leakages, and I do expect it to get on track in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702.1/3">I do not want to say very much more, because I think that I have addressed the main points made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. I recognise that those points are important, but the water supply in the south-east is not in crisis, although neither we nor the companies can ignore the fact reserves are very low. Of course, the companies have a duty to ensure that they match demand and resource management and to look ahead for future management.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702.1/4">Some companies are also considering desalination. A small desalination plant is working in the southern region. Thames Water has also been talking about a desalination plant for peak management in the London region.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702.1/5">Companies can apply for drought orders to minimise water loss and if they have to manage water by taking it away from non-essential users. No application for a drought order has been made at the moment. It may well be that, between now and the summer, we may have a bit more rainfall. It may well be that we do not have a dry summer. As I say, we cannot be complacent about these issues, and we must look at the long-term weather patterns. We must take into account issues such as climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702.1/6">Droughts are not new&mdash;droughts come and go&mdash;but we need to be careful about whether we are seeing long-term trends. If we are seeing them, we must ensure that adaptations are made for them. That involves planning for water resource management, tackling issues such as leaking pipes and considering the powers available to water companies and their responsibilities in ensuring that water supplies are reliable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702.1/7">This country now has one of the highest standards of drinking water quality, internationally. My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley is quite right to say that people should not order bottled water in restaurants; they should order jugs of water. Not only is ours some of the best quality drinking water in the world, but it has not been dragged halfway around the country or sometimes across the continent in trucks to be sold in restaurants. So on grounds of sustainability, I would certainly encourage people to ask for jugs of water in restaurants, not for bottled water. In fact, perhaps we should do a bit more of that in the Committees of the House of Commons, rather using bottled water.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702.1/8">The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs has raised some important and serious issues. I hope that I have reassured him that not only do we have measures in place to deal with drought and with future water demand, but we are working closely with the companies on their legal obligations to ensure the security of water supply, so that his constituents and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley and the other hon. Members present tonight can be assured of a top-quality, reliable and continuous water supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702.1/10" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at thirteen minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
