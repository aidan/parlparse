<p>The information is not available in the form requested.

<p>Have not the vast sums of taxpayers' money which have been pumped into agriculture through

<p>There are obviously many factors involved in the rise in the price of agricultural land. It is certainly not the case that increasinly only institutions and wealthy farmers can afford to farm. The amount of land in institutional hands is still, relatively speaking, very small.<br/>

<p>My hon. Friend will know that we have examined several proposals in the past, some of which he has advocated, such as control over farm size and the impact of the institutional farmers.

<p>The Agriculture Commissioner has made it clear that most member states have the necessary national legislation in force.

<p>I wish the hon. Gentleman a pleasant trip to Brussels next week. I welcome the efforts of the Select Committee in persuading the Commission to make sure that every member state implements the rules properly.

<p>I congratulate my right hon.

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his initial remarks, but I remind him that I have raised that issue at the last three meetings of the Council of Ministers. As I said earlier, there is no ban on production outside quotas. With a levy of up to 100 per cent. of the target price, we expect most producers to make a strenuous effort to comply with their quotas over the year as a whole. Frankly, it is an expensive business if one does not comply with one's quota.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman were to look at the outgoers scheme, bearing in mind that there is a large preponderence of small farmers in his part of Wales,. I think he will agree that my intention to give preference through the scheme, to redistribute the quota particularly to smaller farmers, will be of particular benefit to farmers in both Wales and the south-west of England.</p>

<p>Despite all that my right hon. Friend has just said, is he aware that dairy farmers in this country have presided over a 9 per cent. reduction in production and witnessed a &#x00A3;1,875 loss of income? How can we justify a policy of milk quotas to our dairy farmers if it is continually disregarded by our Common Market friends?</p>

<p>The cut that British dairy farmers have to make is not 9 per cent., as my hon. Friend said, but 6&#x00B7;5 per cent. Within the Community I see evidence that member states are moving towards their levy quantity. The latest information that I understand the Commission has about the French dairy industry is that the French authorities expect that the current trend in milk production in France and the response from their outgoers scheme will mean that no levy will become due at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Our outgoers scheme has been oversubscribed in terms of applicants. We have already issued invitations to a sufficient number of applicants to reach the 2&#x00B7;25 per cent. of quota which will take up the &#x00A3;50 million that I have provided. So long as that amount of quota is made available for redistribution, I hope that the smaller dairy farmers will enjoy most of the benefits by having their quotas brought back to 1983 production patterns.</p>

<p>We all know that the quotas are not being properly implemented in other European countries, whereas in the United Kingdom they are being properly implemented. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Northern Ireland, where 5,000 dairy farmers stand to pay a levy of &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;2 million. Is the Minister aware of the serious damage that this will do to Northern Ireland, agriculture and does he regard it as fair in view of the absolute failure of the buy-out scheme in Northern Ireland which has not come up to his expectations?</p>

<p>I am aware that a smaller proportion of Northern Ireland dairy farmers than we expected have applied for the outgoers scheme. Many dairy farmers throughout the Community will be liable to pay a levy, but for Northern Ireland producers who have overshot their quota the Commission recently agreed that 50 per cent. of the levy should be collected as planned at the end of the present quarter, but that the remainder would be due at the end of the 1984&#x2013;85 marketing year.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman cares to put down a question on this I shall do my best to answer it in the detail that he might prefer. I should point out, however, that many Community countries were reducing their milk production towards quota levels in the first months of the scheme. For instance, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg made reductions in the April to July period. As the hon. Gentleman and I well know, however, the United Kingdom reduction has been greatly accelerated due to the exceptionally dry weather which our dairy industry had to put up with in the summer.</p>

<p>The new stricter model byelaws have been adopted by most district councils in the cereal growing areas, and the National Farmers Union has issued a revised code of practice. Together they have brought about a considerable improvement in straw and stubble burning practices this year. The number of incidents has been much reduced.

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for saying that the majority of farmers are responsible people.<br/>
I am sure that that is true and that the number of farmers who have been irresponsible has never been less in recent years in regard to straw burning. The whole arrangement still needs careful attention. I am conscious of the difficulties that still sometimes occur, perhaps in windy conditions, with smoke and smut. I shall look into those difficulties.</p>

<p>How many prosecutions have there been under the byelaws, and what sort of penalties have been imposed as a result of the introduction of those byelaws? Does the Minister accept that neither the byelaws nor the code of practice has made any difference? The majority of farmers were already carrying out good practice, and the irresponsible ones do not appear to have taken any notice of either the code of practice or the byelaws. They have continued to cause a nuisance to their neighbours, to put lives at risk on motorways, and to put a large number of wild animals at risk when the burning gets out of control and hedgerows and other areas are damaged.</p>

<p>I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. I think that there has been a great deal less trouble this year than last year. That is reflected in the number of complaints received by my Ministry, which is about a quarter of the number received last year.<br/>
I have no information about the number of prosecutions. That is not information that we would normally collect. However, like the hon.

<p>I wholly condemn the infernal nuisance caused by irresponsible straw burning, but will my right hon.

<p>I endorse what my hon. Friend says. I am sure that what he has said about Cambridgeshire could be said of many other counties too. I know that farmers have tried hard to stick to the code of practice and the byelaws, and that many of them have suffered considerable inconvenience because, in order to avoid causing a public nuisance, they have not burnt straw at weekends, even though that might have been the best time to do so.</p>

<p>I remind my hon. Friend that, at the end of 1984, funds ran out.

<p>I should be surprised if the effect of decommissioning grants was as the hon. Gentleman outlined. I shall write to him about the Norway pout by-catch issue.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows that the British Government insisted on the setting up of the Inspectorate of Inspectors. There is already clear evidence from several fishery closures that the inspectorate is working. We are awaiting Commission reports on one matter relating to the Dutch Government.

<p>Perhaps I might make the rhetorical point that hardly any Danish vessels have been decommissioned under schemes such as this. Does the Minister agree that the English industry's real need is not decommissioning grants, which go to the owners rather than to the fishermen and simply reduce our ability to catch fish that are rightfully ours, but operating help to keep the industry going. whether in the form of a fuel subsidy such as the French enjoy or measures to keep ports such as Grimsby open? Grimsby has been threatened with closure recently and may be again unless the entire industry becomes more profitable.</p>

<p>My rhetorical answer to the hon. Gentleman's rhetorical point is that the Danes have had to close fisheries this year as a result of the inspectorate's action. I saw that for myself when I went to Denmark last week. The hon. Gentleman is tenacious on the second matter that he raised and I shall have to give him an equally tenacious answer. We see no prospect of operating subsidies. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not overlook the impact of the decommissioning grant&#x2014;&#x00A3;7 million has already been paid, some of which has gone to Grimsby. By December 1986, &#x00A3;15 million will have been paid. That helps to bring our fleet's capacity more into line with fishing opportunities in pressure stocks. That is bound to help fishermen.</p>

<p>I shall consider my hon. Friend's suggestion. I am keen to encourage the increased consumption of English wine by United Kingdom consumers. One way in which that could be done would be to draw greater attention to the results of a "What Wine?" competition for white wines, in which two of the top three and five of the top 12 European wines were English. The winner was from a village in my constituency. I think that that is a tribute to the successful development of this young industry.</p>

<p>Has my right hon.

<p>My hon. Friend will agree that the settlement reached with the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers yesterday was a fair one. It was a settlement reached between a union which was anxious to settle but had certain points to put to the NCB, and it was a settlement which suited NACODS and the NCB because it enabled the latter to run the coal industry efficiently and in accordance with its statutory obligations. I hope that any other people on strike will agree that that was a good settlement and join NACODS in accepting it and ending the strike.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) for giving me this opportunity to make a brief statement on the collapse of Budget and Excel Holidays.<br/>
The Budget group of companies went into receivership yesterday, triggered it seems by the refusal by Brittania Airways, owed money by the group, to carry any more passengers booked with it. The consequences of this failure are inevitably upsetting for those who have paid in advance for holidays with Budget and Excel but who have yet to take those holidays. Those currently abroad on holiday must be very worried about getting home. I am pleased to be able to give the House total reassurance on both these points.<br/>
Those who have paid for but not yet taken holidays will get their money back in full. The Budget group's financial bonds should be enough to meet all refunds. If not, the air travel reserve fund stands in reserve and has ample funds. Subject to availability, travel agents should be able to offer immediate alternative holidays to those affected at no extra cost.<br/>
The Civil Aviation Authority and the Association of British Travel Agents already have arrangements in hand to repatriate those overseas. Last night's flights left on time, bringing home those due to return yesterday. Aircraft have been chartered through to 11 o'clock tonight to return those finishing their holidays today. Further flights are being arranged and both the CAA and ABTA are doing their best to ensure that everyone overseas gets their full holiday. Everyone will be repatriated at no cost to themselves.<br/>
It may be helpful if I explain briefly to the House the position of the CAA's monitoring of this group of companies. The CAA began to have serious concerns about these companies a few weeks ago. The authority has also put its own auditors into the group. It was, of course, always faced with the fact that many of the holidays were booked well in advance. In the absence of the group satisfying the CAA, it seems likely that its air travel organiser's licence would shortly have been revoked in any case. It is a matter of judgment whether the CAA should have moved to revoke the air traffic organiser's licence earlier in the season and thus have left stranded even more holidaymakers.<br/>
The holiday industry has been going through a difficult period. There have been a number of recent failures brought about by price cutting and a switch to late booking, which has dried up cash flows. The signs are, however, that brochure prices next year will be substantially higher. Despite the recent problems, the financial arrangements of the industry coupled with the air travel reserve fund are such that, as in the Budget and Excel cases, holidaymakers need not fear for their money.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is also considering an independent report by Sir Peter Lane which suggest ways in which the present arrangements might be

further strengthened. We are giving this the closest consideration and the CAA is currently consulting the industry on higher bonding levels. I hope shortly to make a further statement about this.</p>

<speech hansard_id="278688" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-10-25a.810.0" hansard_membership_id="3559" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30854" speakername="Mr. Douglas" colnum="810" time="15:30:00">
<p>I thank the Minister for that reply, but his last remarks involve considerable disquite. Sir Peter Lane reported in July and one of the recommendations was that the CAA should tighten up the procedures. Has this not been done? What is the total cost of repatriation procedures involving holidaymakers? Will there be any recourse to the funds of the air travel reserve fund? What is the morality of a position whereby holidaymakers pay well in advance&#x2014;sometimes eight weeks&#x2014;for holidays, which means that the funds are with the travel company? If such companies collapse, the holidaymakers have to pay again, through an increased levy or by other means. Are those the ethics of capitalism today?</p>

<p>Obviously, it is difficult to get a definite cost, but we think that at the moment it is about &#x00A3;2 million, which would be fully covered by the &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;8 million bonding arrangements. The answer to the question whether there will be any need to draw from the air travel reserve fund is no. That is how we see the position at the moment. The answer to the question whether one can give any total guarantee to holidaymakers that the companies with which they book will not run into financial difficulties must clearly be no. The present guarantees that holidaymakers obtain through the various arrangements must be far higher than those obtained by any other customers who obtain any other form of service.</p>

<p>Although I regret the inconvenience to which holiday-makers will be subjected, is it not wise to underline the fact that the state of consumer protection for package holidaymakers is such a combination of CAA bonding and the air travel reserve fund means that, unlike the position a decade ago, when considerable financial loss was incurred, the people who are affected now will suffer no more than inconvenience? In the event of further tour company failures, which are being predicted, will my hon. Friend examine the efficiency of the operation of the combined system of bonding and the ATRF and decide whether Sir Peter Lane was not unduly dismissive of the possible alternative of insurance arrangements?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for what he said in the first part of his question. We believe that holidaymakers are well covered at the moment. We are not, however, complacent about that, as is implied in the second part of my hon. Friend's question. Clearly, there is always room for improvement. If one of the biggest operators went under in the middle of the peak season, there would be pressure on the combined funds. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State asked Sir Peter Lane to ascertain whether there were ways in which we could strengthen the funding arrangements. That is why we are looking at his report and why we have every intention of doing what we can to strengthen the funding further.</p>

<p>No doubt the House is glad that it has been confirmed that no money will be lost on these occasions, but a great number of holidays for members of the public will be spoilt. The Under-Secretary of State will realise, of course, that Budget Holidays is the


leading direct-sell firm in this area and that the collapse involves the failure of not one but four firms&#x2014;Excel Holidays, Budget America, Bargain Travel and Airsave Travel. The hon. Gentleman will realise also that this year there were two earlier failures&#x2014;of Ventura Holidays and Vantage Holidays. In the light of those facts, does not the hon. Gentleman believe that there is a need for greater safeguarding of the public? Does he realise that many have thought that his earlier statement did not convey the kind of urgency that is required in these matters?</p>

<p>This is not, of course, a happy event for holidaymakers. It is a matter not just of their being threatened with losing money&#x2014;they have not&#x2014;but of having their holidays disrupted. As I said in my statement, we are doing everything that we can to ensure that those who wish to continue their holidays can do so for the next few days of those holidays. We accept that there may be a case for strengthening the arrangements. There will always be a case for strengthening the arrangements. We are certainly doing everything that we can in that respect. We shall shortly publish a statement about that matter.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that, short of nationalising all the people involved in the travel business, there is no way in which one can guarantee that companies will not go bust? I should not have thought that that would appeal to my hon. Friend, and I do not think that it would appeal to the people as a whole to have nationalised holidays. This industry gives better cover to its consumers through the two plans that are available than is available to any consumer of any other industry.</p>

<p>I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. The fact is, of course, that this is a dynamic industry which during the past few years has grown from 600 to 700 operators. In those circumstances, from time to time there will doubtless be some companies that are not financially prudent. Bar the kind of ghastly alternative that my hon. Friend has suggested, there is no way that one can give a complete guarantee; it does, however, give the best possible customer protection of any industry.</p>

<p>Are not the Government now becoming over-complacent?

<p>While accepting that there is always need to strengthen requirements and protection, this industry has substantial protection. Does my hon. Friend agree that many hundreds of thousands of people in the United Kingdom have enjoyed what can only be described as bargain holidays over the past 18 months because of the price cutting that has been going on? That is the plus side for all those people who had bargain holidays. It is an industry that employs a great many people and provides work for our airline operators as well as the tour operators. We must therefore always look carefully at the plus as well as the down side.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that it is disturbing that there should have been a further major failure in the travel industry, which inevitably causes great inconvenience and disappointment, particularly when it follows a number of other failures in the industry in recent weeks? We accept, of course, that when the Government's economic policies are doing such enormous damage to the economy and producing so many record insolvencies, it would be unrealistic to expect the travel industry to be immune. We are worried about the fate of those who are disadvantaged by these failures. In that context, I wonder whether the Minister could say a further word about the estimated 2,000 holidaymakers who booked their holidays with Excel Holidays after 16 October. Given that the Association of British Travel Agents' protection offered by that firm expired on that date, can he say what steps were taken to draw to the attention of holidaymakers who bought holidays after that date the fact that the protection no longer existed? Finally, will he say whether he is satisfied that adequate consular protection will be available to those holidaymakers already abroad whose holidays have been disrupted?</p>

<p>On the second point about consuls, I shall certainly ensure that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is made fully aware of what the hon.

<p>I will, with permission, make a statement on developments during the recess in the negotiations between the British and Chinese Governments on the future of Hong Kong.<br/>
During my discussions in Peking with Chinese leaders in late July I was able to resolve most of the major issues outstanding in the negotiations. I gave a progress report in a statement in Hong Kong on 1 August. Copies of that statement were placed in the Library of the House on the same day.<br/>
Negotiations continued on the remaining unresolved issues and were brought to a successful conclusion on 22 September. As a result, a draft agreement consisting of a joint declaration and three annexes was initialled on 26 September by the British ambassador in Peking and the Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zhou Nan. It was published on the same day in a White Paper in London and Hong Kong and laid before the House.<br/>
I should like to draw the attention of the House to the following important features of the draft agreement. It constitutes a formal international agreement, legally binding in all its parts. This is the highest form of commitment that can be given by one sovereign state to another. It deals in considerable detail with Chinese policies towards Hong Kong after 1997 and thus provides a framework in which the people of Hong Kong can plan and work for a secure and prosperous future. It thus provides for Hong Kong's distinctive economic and social systems, freedoms and lifestyle to continue unchanged. It makes it clear that the policies which it spells out for Hong Kong will be stipulated in a basic law to be passed by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and will remain unchanged for 50 years after 1997.<br/>
It is now for the people of Hong Kong to give their views on the draft agreement. The House has already been informed of the arrangements which have been made to enable them to do so. More than 2 million copies of the White Paper have been distributed in the territory.<br/>
I am very glad to be able to tell the House that the Executive Council of Hong Kong has felt able to recommend the draft agreement to the people of Hong Kong&#x2014;in the words of the senior unofficial member&#x2014;"in good conscience." The House will also wish to know that at the conclusion of its debate last week the Hong Kong Legislative Council gave the draft agreement its overwhelming support and similarly commended it to the people of Hong Kong. Beyond that, I have been encouraged by the favourable reactions which have come from many other public bodies and individuals in Hong Kong and by the wide international welcome which the draft agreement has received.<br/>
The House will in due course wish to know the extent to which the draft agreement as a whole is acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. It was made quite clear in the White Paper that the draft agreement itself cannot be amended, but the views expressed in Hong Kong on all parts of it will be of value in our continuing discussions with the Chinese, particularly in the joint liaison group. I am sure that the House would wish me to urge everyone in Hong Kong to submit their views on all these aspects to the assessment office.<br/>
The report of the assessment office, together with that of the monitoring team, will be published at about the end of November. The House will, of course, attach great importance to these reports when it debates the draft agreement and I know that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House will be seeking to give the House an early opportunity to debate the matter after the publication of the reports.<br/>
It would not be right to anticipate that debate, but the Government have made quite clear their own view that the draft agreement provides the assurances which are necessary if the people of Hong Kong are to face the future with confidence. In the words of the White Paper:
<q>Her Majesty's Government believe that the Agreement is a good one. They strongly recommend it to the people of Hong Kong and to Parliament.</q></p>

<p>I congratulate the right hon. and learned Gentleman on the skill, patience and flexibility that he has shown in conducting an exceptionally delicate negotiation, which may set important precedents in other areas. The agreement must be regarded as the most outstanding achievement of British diplomacy since Lord Carrington concluded the Rhodesian negotiations and the state of Zimbabwe was born. In Hong Kong, as in Zimbabwe, the role of the Foreign Secretary was critical, because the Prime Minister's intemperate intervention at an earlier stage had threatened to torpedo the negotiations before they had even begun.<br/>
I hope that the Foreign Secretary will agree that the Opposition have given him every assistance when it would have been all too easy for an irresponsible Opposition to seek to exploit some of the difficulties, to party advantage.<br/>
I am glad to hear that the House is to debate the agreement before the end of the year when the consultations are complete. If, as I expect, the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House receives representations from both sides, I hope he will agree to a two-day debate so that the matter can be fully explored and all points of view fully expressed.<br/>
In the light of that impending debate, I shall not raise any points of detail now. I would say only that in my view it is the best possible agreement and very much better than many believed possible even six months ago.<br/>
However, let me make two points at this stage which arise out of the agreement or which are not included in it. First, I gather that there is some concern in Hong Kong that the assessment office, which is responsible for gauging public opinion, is insisting that all comment should be given in writing, properly signed, with the full name and address of the writer. I understand why that is so, but there is some anxiety in the colony that information about the views of individuals might later become available to persons and used for victimisation. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman can assure the House that such letters will remain strictly confidential and that he will ensure that there is no risk that they could ever be used at a later stage to victimise the writers.<br/>
The second point is much more general. Inevitably, a change of status in a territory of this magnitude has disturbed some of the older citizens of the territory and led them to consider packing up sticks and going somewhere else. Knowing a little the character of the Chinese in Hong Kong, I am certain that two new millionaires will spring up where every one old millionaire has left.<br/>
I am more concerned about the conduct of British business men in Hong Kong. It has been noticeable that


the American business community has taken a far more optimistic view of the future in Hong Kong than have some of the more self-regarding and old-established British firms, perhaps because they expect to be able to compete on more equal terms for business from now on. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that it would be a pity if in Hong Kong, as in so many other ex-British colonies, constitutional change led to foreign firms taking business from British firms which were incapable of adjusting to the new status.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will understand if I do not endorse his observations about the Prime Minister's part at the outset of negotiations. Subject to that, I want to express to the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues on the Opposition Benches my appreciation of the congratulations that he has tendered today, and, rightly, for the support that I have received in the course of the many discussions and consultations which we have all had to have about this. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House will certainly take note of what was said about the length of the debate.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the desirability of allowing the assessment office to obtain evidence as widely as it can. It is an impressive feature that in a territory with not many more than 5 million people 2 million copies of the agreement have been taken up. That shows the intensity of interest there. For those who are unable to submit written evidence when arrangements can be made they will be able to do so orally through local offices, although it is obviously preferable for such evidence to be in writing wherever possible. The Government of Hong Kong and I are aware of the right hon. Gentleman's point about the need for confidentiality to be preserved in order to avoid any threat of subsequent victimisation. We shall be taking steps to deal with that.<br/>
It would be regrettable if the confidence expressed were affected by decisions hereafter of an investment or other nature which were differentiated by reference to nationality. The key point which I sought to emphasise many times in my discussions with the Chinese is that confidence depends on the way in which the system is established and will behave. It is confidence that will command the decisions of a multitude of individual investors. I am sure the House will hope that British investors will continue to play an active part.</p>

<p>I also congratulate the Secretary of State and his officials warmly not only on the agreement achieved, but on the co-operative atmosphere that has been created.<br/>
Has the right hon. and learned Gentleman had any discussions with the Chinese about involving Hong Kong Chinese with both sides of the liaison? Has he encountered any objection from the People's Republic to the development by the United Kingdom over the next 13 years of directly elected institutions in Hong Kong?<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman is correct in saying that the agreement cannot be amended, but could it be flexibly evolved to take account of views?</p>

<p>I dealt with the hon. Gentleman's last point in my statement. I said that while the agreement cannot be amended representations made about it in the years that lie ahead are appropriate to be taken into account by the joint liaison group.<br/>
The agreement provides for the Legislature of Hong Kong in the future to be on an elective basis and for the Executive to be accountable to that Legislature. The Hong Kong Government have published a Green Paper foreshadowing the certain changes in the representative arrangements in Hong Kong. They are now considering public comment on those proposals. The comment that has been made generally gives support to the principle of gradual development of representative institutions, perhaps along the lines that the hon. Gentleman has in mind. It is hoped that a White Paper setting out the reaction of the Hong Kong Government will be published shortly.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman made an important point on the joint liaison group. It is clear from the text of the second annex to the agreement that each side will determine the composition of its delegation. We shall ensure that Hong Kong is appropriately represented.<br/>
I thank the hon. Gentleman for what he had to say about the negotiation of the agreement and I endorse specifically what he said about the part played by the officials, who gave sustained and dedicated service through many long months of negotiation which became increasingly intense as the months went by. No Government could have wished for more devoted service from the civil servants taking part from Britain and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. and learned Friend aware that Conservative Members will endorse the judgment of the right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) when he said that this was the best possible agreement that could be obtained in the circumstances? I say that because of the detail that it contains and the grounds that it gives for believing that it is likely to last.<br/>
In endorsing what my right hon. and learned Friend said about the role that officials played in securing the agreement, will he accept my congratulations on his role, not least in July, when it is pretty clear that he played a big role in unblocking the log-jam which existed, at which time I understand that he earned the admiration of the Chinese negotiators for his inscrutable diplomacy?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for what he has had to say. I should also like to take the opportunity of saying how large a part was played in the management and conduct of the negotiations by my opposite number, Mr. Wu Xueqian, the Chinese Foreign Minister. It was crucial to our capacity to succeed that we were able to establish a cordial, friendly and practical relationship with each other.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman aware that the agreement is most welcome, but that its effectiveness will depend not only on events in China but on the readiness of the people of Hong Kong to develop a form of government that can continue after 1997? Can he confirm that the White Paper on constitutional developments in Hong Kong will be published before the debate in the House so that we can debate it? Is he aware that it is most important that that White Paper should provide at least as much as is already in the agreement&#x2014;the election of the Legislative Council and the election for appointment of the chief executive after consultations within Hong Kong?<br/>
Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman aware that while the emphasis in Hong Kong is on the maintenance


of stability and gradualism in the development of representative institutions, there is very little time and the people of Hong Kong look to the House to set the pace for what is already an ambitious time scale?</p>

<p>I take note of the point made about the date of publication of the White Paper by the Hong Kong Government. I cannot give an absolute assurance as to the date, but I shall certainly draw that point to their attention. Clearly, it would be helpful if it could be published before the debate took place.<br/>
I know that the hon. Gentleman has thought carefully about the pace of development of representative institutions, because he has taken a close interest in the matter. It must be borne in mind that the general position supported by those who have commented in Hong Kong is one of support for the gradual development of representative institutions. The position stated in the agreement is that we start from where we are now. The precise pace of development will be a matter for consideration in the White Paper and after its publication.</p>

<p>I was in Hong Kong when the agreement was signed and remained there for a week afterwards, and therefore was able to form some impression of its reception there. Will my right hon. and learned Friend accept that there was general admiration for the achievement of himself, the governor and the team of diplomats in arriving at such a detailed, comprehensive and understanding agreement? However, the agreement will not come into operation for 14 years.<br/>
Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that the maintenance of confidence over that period will depend very much on the conduct of the signatory powers? For instance, the Chinese Government should produce a basic law which is a faithful reflection of the agreement, and it is equally important that Britain should appear genuinely to be committed to Hong Kong right up to 1997 and should retain a great interest in the area long after that.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for what he has said, and, in particular, for his reminder of the important part played throughout the process not only by the Executive Council members and the members of the Legislative Council, to whom I have already referred, but also by the governor of Hong Kong. The governor bore a double burden, being a continuous member of the negotiating team as well as governor of the territory. I am sure that the House will wish to pay tribute to him.<br/>
My hon. Friend is right to say that the maintenance of confidence depends upon the continuous pattern of behaviour of both the signatory powers. The agreement provides for the text to be reflected in the basic law to be introduced by the People's Republic of China. That is an important feature of the agreement. Continued participatory confidence by the United Kingdom is equally important.</p>

<p>My right hon. and learned Friend has rightly been praised by hon. Members in all parts of the House for his achievement.

If both the political extremes are opposed to what is being done, should not the vast majority of people in the middle take pleasure in the fact that the two parties have probably got it right?<br/>
In view of what has been said by the hon. Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray), I urge my right hon. and learned Friend to take careful note of what is being said in Hong Kong about the need for the White Paper to be rather more forthcoming than the Green Paper.

There is, of course, a distinction between those who are British dependent territory citizens and those who are not. Non-Chinese British dependent territory citizens will be eligible to retain appropriate status under the British Nationality Act after 1 July 1997 if they obtain a British passport or are included in one before then.<br/>
There is specific, express and extended provision for civil rights in section XIII of annex I to the agreement, including the provisions of the international covenant on civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights.<br/>
The agreement provides that defence and foreign affairs are the concern of the Chinese Government. The question of conscription is not mentioned in the agreement, but that does not mean that there will be conscription. The Chinese Government have certainly not suggested that there will be.<br/>
Public order is explicitly the responsibility of the government of the Hong Kong special administrative region.</p>

<p>I told you a few moments ago, Mr. Speaker, that I would beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order No. 10 for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the situation created by the decision of the court to seize the assets of the National Union of Mineworkers.</q>
I was not able to give you notice before noon, Mr. Speaker, because the news only reached the Press Association at 2.30 pm and came on the tape during Question Time. It was therefore too late for notice to be given, but the Standing Order provides that when it is too late, provided that Mr. Speaker is told at once, it is open to him to rule or announce that he will rule later.<br/>
In support of my application, I point out that the court's decision is an unprecedented act which will be seen by those who have contributed to the NUM funds as theft. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Mr. Janner) said in a different context earlier, it will bring the law into disrepute and greatly worsen the crisis in the industry where an official strike has been in progress for seven months. It will put at risk the headquarters of the NUM in Sheffield, which I understand is subject to the sequestration order.<br/>
One hon. Member is a member of the executive of the NUM, in accordance with the practice relating to the miners parliamentary group. The European Assembly has found time to discuss the matter, but this House has not. I must repeat as clearly as I can that, as I said two days ago, there is a relationship between the tension on the

picket lines and the readiness of Parliament to discuss the greatest industrial dispute of the century. If Parliament will not discuss matters of manifest concern to people in the coal industry and in other industries and to those who cannot get coal, that will certainly bring the House into disrepute.<br/>
I strongly urge you, Mr. Speaker, to follow your judgment and to allow us to debate the matter before the new Session.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The Bill as introduced into Parliament, and as passed by this House, gave effect to the Phillips Royal Commission's recommendation that powers of stop and search should not be restricted to police officers in uniform. It was decided in another place that the powers conferred by the Bill should be so restricted. That decision was taken against the Government's very strong advice, and we continue to believe that it would seriously and unnecessarily fetter the ability of the police to deal with street crime and burglary.<br/>
The Phillips commission made its thoughts on this matter quite clear. Paragraph 3.22 of the report said:
<q>We considered whether the power to stop and search persons should be available only to a constable in uniform, and one of us favours this. Clear identification as a police constable is necessary to avoid misunderstanding, friction, and, later, disputes. We accept this as a principle but do not believe the wearing of uniform essential to its attainment in practice. The police officer should take the necessary steps to ensure that the person whom he has stopped has his name and number.</q>
Exactly so; and that is why clause 2(2)<i>(i)</i> places a duty on a plain clothes officer, before he undertakes a search, to produce his warrant card to identify himself as a police officer. If he does not do so, the search will be unlawful, and may lawfully be resisted.<br/>
It was suggested in another place, as it was when this issue was debated in Committee here, that plain clothes officers might be mistaken for muggers, and that the Bill would create the possibility of uncertainty and conflict on the streets. But this suggestion ignores the fact that powers of search, which are already on the statute book and which may be exercised by plain clothes as well as uniformed officers, have not given rise to this kind of problem. There is no evidence that either the results obtained or the effects on relations between police and public differ according to whether the officer concerned is in uniform. If there have been isolated cases of misunderstanding, the clause 2 safeguards recommended by the Royal Commission are more than sufficient to deal with them.<br/>
The recent Policy Studies Institute report on the Metropolitan police found that 93 per cent. of stops were made by officers in uniform, 5 per cent. by officers in plain clothes and 2 per cent. by uniformed and plain clothes officers acting together. Those figures do not suggest that excessive use is made of their present powers by plain clothes officers. But the 5 per cent. in question is important in terms of the ability of the police to deal with the kinds of offence for which powers of stop and search

are particularly useful to them. This is, of course, because plain clothes officers can keep observation and patrol inconspicuously. It would make no sense if they then lacked powers that they were in a particularly good position to exercise.<br/>
It is, for example, well known that shop theft and pickpocketing are major problems in the Oxford street area. One important part of the police strategy for controlling and detecting such crime is the deployment of plain clothes officers. A plain clothes officer who reasonably suspects someone of carrying stolen goods or articles intended for use in offences of theft or deception should surely be able to stop and search him, subject to the usual safeguards, in exactly the same way as a uniformed colleague. If he lacked this power, he would have either to let the person who had aroused his suspicions walk away, or fall back upon his powers of arrest. The former would be a breach of duty; and the trouble with the latter is that many arrests will be made which a quick negative search would have avoided. That would hardly be a result which was conducive to police effectiveness or good community relations.<br/>
In short, we can see no case for agreeing to the amendment, which departs from the Royal Commission's express recommendations.</p>

<p>It has been suggested here and in another place that the powers of stop and search included in the Bill are those that existed previously in London, but were not needed in other parts of the country. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Bill seeks to apply the London power throughout the whole country? That has been the basic argument against the provision.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is right to say that much of the Bill and many of the powers are deliberately designed to provide properly co-ordinated arrangements throughout the country. Many aspects of stop and search are ludicrously different in various parts of the country.<br/>
Surely the plain clothes officer has a crucial part to play in detecting and helping to prevent crime on the streets. It would be sensible that the power in the Bill should not be confined to officers in uniform.<br/>
The Lords amendment introduces a strange anomaly because it applies only to the powers in the Bill. Yet there are already powers on the statute book, including those relating to drugs and firearms, that may continue to be exercised by uniformed and plain clothes officers alike. That anomaly is indefensible and I suggest that the amendment is unnecessary and harmful.</p>

<p>I welcome the Minister to his duties at the Home Office, but I had better warn him that we get through Ministers of State at the Home Office at quite a rate, and the length of time that he will remain there cannot be guaranteed. The hon. Gentleman read very eloquently from his brief, but his knowledge to date seems about the same as his predecessor's when he left for the Northern Ireland Office.<br/>
We are talking about a power that in the best of circumstances is open to abuse. Indeed, that is widely agreed upon. One strongly held view on the topic of stop and search states:
<q>Statistics on the use to date of powers of stop and search indicate that in most cases no such article"&#x2014;</q>
that is, an article of a particular kind being looked for&#x2014;


<q>is found, and there is strong evidence that on many occasions these powers have been used where reasonable grounds to suspect the individual concerned of having the article in question on him did not in fact exist. There is also strong evidence that such misuse plays an important part in mistrust of the police among such sections of the community.</q>
That is the view of stop and search that is in the draft code of practice on the excercise of those powers, which has been issued by the Home Office in connection with the Bill. Therefore, everyone acknowledges that the power of stop and search is dangerous, and should be used only in a rational way.<br/>
It has been pointed out that that power has existed in the Metropolitan and other police areas, but it should be remembered that the power as originally introduced into the Metropolitan police area was very specific and limited. It came under the Metropolitan Police Act 1839 and its aim was to deal with goods in transit at a time when London and other big cities were prey to rogues and vagabonds of various kinds. The whole purpose of the original Act, under which the stop and search power in London is being deployed, was, as the original Act says, that any person reasonably suspected of having or conveying in any manner any stolen or unlawfully obtained goods could be stopped and searched by a police officer.<br/>
Over a century and a half that power has been expanded in London to the extent that it is now used for a wide range of purposes. As we know from the report of the Policy Studies Institute, to which reference has been made, there are now about 1 million stops in London alone. We are dealing with the exercise of those powers&#x2014;which the Home Office itself says are misused&#x2014;not by a constable in uniform who is clearly identifiable and who has a number that can be taken down by anybody who has a complaint that he wishes to put, but by someone in plain clothes.<br/>
When people talk about a plain clothes policeman, I suspect that they imagine someone dressed in what one might call plain clothes police standard issue: double breasted suit, big black shoes and, if the weather is a bit cold, perhaps a white belted raincoat. But that is not the sort of plain clothes in which the police dress. Let us consider the sort of plain clothes that the police now wear: very tight blue jeans, an open-necked shirt, black jacket and training shoes, and a chain around the neck. That is how a plain clothes policeman who appeared in court last week described the clothes that he would wear any day. He described them as plain clothes, although they seem far from plain to me.<br/>
It is clear that if someone young dressed like that accosted a person late at night in a street in my, or any other, constituency, that person might run away or anticipate a potential assault in a violent manner.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between the two, and I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman, who did his

59 sittings with the rest of us, should have forgotten. Arrest is a different matter. Arrest is something undertaken only with a due sense of responsibility, because wrongful arrest is a dangerous thing to indulge in. We are talking about stop and search, and between 7 million and 8 million people will be subjected to it every year when the Bill is enacted. So there is a very great difference.<br/>
If someone dressed in what one might call the customary casual dress of the mid-1980s accosted a man or woman late at night, that person might well believe that he was going to be attacked. He might well run away, or decide that the best thing to do is to get in first and thump the man. However, if the person accosted did either of those things he would then be liable to arrest. That arrest, of course, would then add to the threadbare statistics that are being quoted by the Government to justify stop and search.<br/>
I shall cite an example that has been supplied to me. It involves the case of a Mr. Derik Donaldson. He was driving his car in Notting Hill, near his home, and was followed by plain clothes officers in an unmarked car. They shouted to him to stop. He thought that he was being pursued by people who may have wanted to attack him. In this violent era with, under this Government, record crime figures, that is not very surprising. However, he refused to stop, drove to his mother's house and jumped out of his car. The officers then got out of their car and attempted to apprehend him. There was a struggle in which it appears that the identity of the officers was mentioned. Mr. Donaldson was charged with assault. The police had made their arrest&#x2014;the sort of arrest that we will find for the sort of offence that will be detected in order to justify stop and search. However, Mr. Donaldson was acquitted and the judge criticised the officers for making stops and searches without specific suspicion of a defined offence.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend have any statistics about the assaults on police officers that have occurred when stops and searches are carried out by them when they are not in unifirm? In the courts I have often found that is exactly the same sort of situation that has occurred.</p>

<p>If it will not embarrass the hon. Gentleman, may I say that, judging by what he has said throughout the Bill's passage, I welcome him calling me his right hon. Friend. His approach to the Bill has been creditable to a degree. However, I do not have the statistics. In a moment I shall deal with the problem of statistics in relation to this power which is to be conferred on the police.<br/>
The Minister, Lord Elton, said that under the Bill the person concerned must identify himself right away. But such identification might come too late. Split seconds are involved. If one is approached by a man late at night, one may well decide not to wait and see whether by any chance the man in tight blue jeans and necklace is a police officer trying to stop and search one. One may decide to react. It is not easy for a plain clothes police officer to establish his authority immediately. A warrant card is usually produced for a split second. It may or may not be believed or understood. Can any hon. Member guarantee that he would accept it? During the first vital seconds, all this causes fear and apprehension in the person stopped,


particularly in a secluded spot late at night. The constable might be viewed, reasonably, as an attacker or at least a person to be avoided.<br/>
5 pm<br/>
A procedure is set out in the code of practice, but who is to say that when such activities are taking place the procedure will be followed? The Minister of State quoted the Policy Studies Institute report, so he must accept the validity of that authoritative document. The report, which says that in the metropolitan area the procedure is often ignored, states:
<q>It is clear from the way that police officers talk about stops that the question of what their legal powers may be does not enter into their decision-making except in the case of rare individuals.</q>
That is a serious criticism in a document commissioned by the Metropolitan police. The report continues:
<q>They do, of course, consider the chance of getting a result, but factors that they associate with the chance of getting a result are often unconnected with any concept of reasonable suspicion.</q>
Recent cases confirm that.
<q>One reason why the legal powers have little relevance is that most people do not know what they are. We never saw anyone openly challenge the right of the police to stop, search and question them, nor did anyone ever refuse to answer questions.</q>
That is important, because the contents of the 1984 Act will not be in the minds of my young West Indian constituents who may be subjected to stop and search. The PSI report makes it clear that two thirds of all stops in metropolitan London are of West Indian boys and young men between the ages of 15 and 24. They will not know their rights. They will not know that the person who stops them has to produce identification. They will either accept what takes place or resist. Either way they are likely to be in trouble.<br/>
We are told that the safeguards are now different and that we have a code of practice. That code of practice is much to do with my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Dubs). Without his amendment there would be no code of practice and without his constituency Labour party there would be no amendment. This is an excellent example of Labour party democracy in practice.<br/>
Who is to say that the code of practice will be used? 'The PSI report says that the existing safeguards are not observed in many instances. One of the reasons that it gives is:
<q>Consequences for individual police officers, where they were shown to have exceeded their powers in stopping and searching people or vehicles, would probably not be very serious. That being so, there is an incentive for police officers to exceed their powers.</q>
The PSI report says that the penalty for not observing the existing rule is not great enough to ensure the observance of it. The safeguards are not worth the paper on which they will be printed.<br/>
What is it all for? The PSI report states that of the 1 million stops in London, which we can extrapolate to the rest of the country, only 3 per cent. result in arrests. The hon. Member for Leicestershire, North-West (Mr. Ashby) asked me what statistics I had. We do not have statistics on this matter. Thanks to the PSI, we know that 3 per cent. of stops result in arrest, but we do not know how many arrests result in charges or how many charges result in convictions. By definition, 3 per cent. or less must be involved.</p>

<p>Because of the hon. Gentleman's experience he always asks the right questions. Sometimes charges result not in connection with the reason for the stop&#x2014;which is usually to look for stolen goods or weapons to be used in a crime&#x2014;but in connection with traffic offences which are discovered incidentally. The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on the truth.<br/>
The results in terms of apprehension and the punishment of crime from stop and search powers are minuscule. Although the outcome in terms of protecting the community is so minute as to be scarcely worth considering, we are introducing a power under which every year between 7 million and 8 million people will be stopped.<br/>
The Minister told us how many stops were undertaken by plain clothes officers currently. We cannot extrapolate those statistics because we are talking about a power which is to be extended to areas which have never had it before. Once we give these men in their blue jeans and necklaces the right to stop and search, they may decide to take greater advantage of it because Parliament has given them extra power.<br/>
The amendment is sensible and useful. It was supported in the House of Lords by many peers who are not members of the Labour or Liberal parties, who have no party allegiance or who are even Conservatives, such as Lady Macleod. The amendment would eliminate some of the worst abuses. It would do no more than that. We believe that it should be retained. We shall therefore vote against the Government.</p>

<p>I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister of State to the Home Office and to the Bill. I am sorry that the previous Minister of State has had to go elsewhere although I congratulate him on his elevation. We are fortunate to have my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Shaw) as one of the ministerial team at the Home Office to help us with our deliberations.<br/>
In the presence of the Home Secretary I should also like to welcome the fact that the Government are sticking to their principles and standing on their policy in respect of this important amendment. With possibly one other hon. Member, I served on the Bill through all its painful progress. When this amendment was produced in the first Standing Committee, Ministers rightly demonstrated, as I shall, how absurd it would be to limit the power to search to officers in uniform. The Government, on a whipped vote, rejected it.<br/>
During the second Standing Committee the Opposition again made the same proposition, and again on a whipped vote it was rejected. It must be right when precisely the same proposal comes from the other place for the Government to stand firm on their principles and on their policy and, on a whipped vote, carry what they believe to be right for the police service.<br/>
I make that point at the outset because I think it right that a Government should stand by their policy and principles. I shall ask the Government to do so on all the amendments before the House. I am entitled to do that because I have not stood on my head at any time&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Opposition might be wise to allow small internal matters on the Conservative Benches to be fully developed. I cannot understand why they should wish to interrupt a little local difficulty on this side of the House.<br/>
I listened carefully to the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman), as I always do. He has been consistent in his arguments, as I have been in mine, throughout the passage of the Bill. One objection to preventing police officers not in uniform from doing their duty on stop and search is that that would put 25 per cent. of our police officers out of action in the stopping of suspects on the street. My advice is that officers on duty, but not in uniform, amount to a quarter of the force.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, bearing in mind the need to preserve good police-public relations, it is sufficient to allow the 25 per cent. of police officers in plain clothes to exercise their power to arrest only if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence is being committed? Does he further agree that to enable 75 per cent. of our police force to stop and search is more than adequate?</p>

<p>No, I do not agree. Indeed, we need more rather than fewer policemen to deal with the tide of crime that we now face. To remove 25 per cent. of the effective police strength at any one time would be absurd. No police officer is ever technically off duty. Although police officers usually work seven or eight hours a day&#x2014;unless they are in the CID, when they may work longer hours&#x2014;when they go about their business off duty they still have a responsibility laid upon them by this House and the law, under that oath of office and under their discipline code, so that if an offence appears to be committed, or is likely to be committed, or the Queen's peace put at risk, they have a duty to seek to uphold the law, and must do so.<br/>
Whether or not a police officer is in uniform is immaterial. For example, a police officer may not be in uniform because he has just come off duty and hung up his uniform on a peg in the police station. While he is going home he may see in the street someone who bears a very real resemblance to a wanted criminal who has committed a serious assault, rape, an act of terrorism or murder. He has a duty to stop that person and ascertain whether he is a wanted criminal. He may not wish to arrest him, but only to stop him.<br/>
If such a police officer faced someone whom he felt it right to stop and question, or perhaps to stop and search, if he had to be in uniform he would be in the absurd position of having to say to that person, "Excuse me, Sir, do you mind if I go back to the police station to put on my uniform so that, under the Act, I can stop and question you?" That is an absurdity and everyone knows it, but a police officer could be placed in that position if the amendment were carried.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is seriously misleading the House.

<p>I did not use the word terrorism; I used the words rape, murder and serious crime.<br/>
A police officer cannot remove himself from the duty that this House has laid upon him simply because he is not wearing a uniform. He must carry out his duty. If the amendment were carried he could be disciplined for not carrying out a wide range of duties which he would be prevented by the Bill from carrying out.<br/>
I accept the point made by the right hon. Member for Gorton about police officers dressed in the fashion that he described, perhaps on a dark evening. That is why the Government have been wise to include in the Bill the safeguards proposed by the Royal Commission. It is essential to note that a police officer in plain clothes would have to do all the things set out in clause 2. I believe this to be the first time that it has been set out in a statute.<br/>
The police officer would have to tell the person whom he wished to stop and search his name and the name of the police station to which he was attached. Before he performed any search, he would have to tell the person the object of the search and give his grounds for proposing to do so. He would have to have regard to the other safeguards in the clause, among them the important new safeguard that he must make a record, which must be available to the person who has been stopped and searched during the statutory period provided.<br/>
Those are very real safeguards. Their effect is what the Royal Commission proposed and what my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary has always maintained, namely, that wherever a new power is provided, it is balanced by a safeguard. In this case, there are a whole series of safeguards.<br/>
The amount of paper work and additional operational problems that will be created by the safeguards&#x2014;which mean that a police officer, often in difficult circumstances in the street, must provide all that information&#x2014;will present some real difficulties. However, the Government have included the safeguards to maintain a balance. When the other place considered the matter, it simply did not recognise those safeguards.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman fairly said that there is always the danger that, although the police will seek&#x2014;and I assure him that they will&#x2014;to fulfill those safeguards, there will be times when that does not happen. For one reason or another, there may be a misunderstanding. It is important that the House should appreciate the documentary evidence which a police officer henceforth will have to present to anyone when he wishes to stop and search. I refer to the warrant card. I have one with me, and it is important that the House and the country should recognise that it is not simply a bit of paper that can be flashed. The warrant has on it a photograph of the police officer concerned, and if he does not look like his photograph&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that the Member of Parliament's photocard has a distinctive appearance only to those who know what its distinctive appearance is? Most of us have never seen a police officer's warrant card. The fact that the hon. Gentleman produces that card in the House means nothing. We take his word for it that it is a warrant card, but somebody stopped in the street might say, "Pull the other one." Why should that person believe the officer?</p>

<p>I understand the right hon. Gentleman's scepticism, but he must look at the amendment in the context of the safeguards that are provided. One of the safeguards about which he was sceptical was the requirement on the police to provide documentary evidence of their status, as proof that they are police officers attached to a particular force or station. The warrant card has the advantage that it has a photograph, and it also has the signature of the officer in question.- It is open to anyone, if he wishes to throw doubt on the warrant card, to challenge the officer to sign his name. I realise that in the real world it is unlikely that that would take place, hut, nevertheless, that must be recognised.<br/>
In addition, the warrant card contains the signature of a senior officer&#x2014;I do not know whether it is the chief constable&#x2014;of each force. The warrant card is as good a piece of documentary evidence to establish the identity of the officer as it is reasonable to expect. Therefore, for the reason that I gave at the beginning&#x2014;that it is right that the Government should stick to their principles and their guns&#x2014;I hope that the House will go along with my hon.

<p>I welcome the hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Shaw) to his new post in the Home Office. Like his predecessor, he is already showing the skill to stonewall skilfully, despite his late entry into the match.<br/>
It is important to have a proper perspective of the powers contained in clause 1. Even without the stop and search powers in clause 1, plain clothes police officers in England and Wales have considerable powers, as has already been said. They have the power to stop and search for controlled drugs, for firearms, for items connected with terrorism and, incidentally, also for eggs of certain protected birds. Leaving the last category aside, because it comes in a special sector, those are extensive stop and search powers; and they are not anomalous, contrary to what the Minister said.<br/>
Those powers were placed on the statute book for the specific reason of dealing with particular problems that were arising in the streets of the country. They were placed on the statute book as they were, not as anomalies, but as acts of good sense to counter those problems. It is wrong for the Government to seek to extend such a coercive

power, one that involves severe interference with the liberty of the individual to walk in our streets, by introducing it across the country.<br/>
It is important to remind oneself that the stop and search powers in clause 1 are not the same as the power of arrest. That power will continue. In his arguments the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) reduced the issue to an absurdity. With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, who made a fine contribution in Committee, I suspect that an average custody officer could have made a better job of arguing the case than he did.<br/>
Can one really believe, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, that a police officer suspecting reasonably that someone had committed the crime of murder or rape would even think about using merely stop and search powers? He would not&#x2014;he would arrest. The hon. Gentleman drew our attention to the requirements placed by the Bill on the officer stopping and searching. If the officer were seeking to use the stop and search powers, he would be required to go through all those requirements; and in any event he would not be permitted to stop and search on suspicion of murder under the power in the Bill unless he had reason for suspecting that the person being stopped and searched had prohibited articles or stolen goods in his possession.<br/>
I suspect that one of the reasons for the extension of the stop and search power in the Bill, and in particular for the Government's desire to give the power throughout the country to plain clothes police officers, is to make up in some way for the continuing shortage not so much of police officers as of uniformed police officers on the beat in the community. It is now conventional wisdom, and right, that the best way to prevent the crimes mentioned in clauses 1 and 2 is by putting uniformed police officers known to the community on the beat. In particular, young people do not commit offences such as theft from motor cars or carrying offensive weapons when they know that there are policemen ever on the beat nearby.<br/>
We have to bear in mind, too, that in most of the towns of England and Wales, and in all the country areas, the power being created by clause 1&#x2014;that of stop and search&#x2014;is an entirely new power. The people in those communities have not been accustomed to dealing with such a power. Its very introduction in those areas creates a considerable risk of tension between the community and the police.<br/>
There is also the problem of the way in which the power is used. There is a great deal of evidence, though much of it discursive, about the use of the power. We have already heard some of the evidence from the PSI report. There is some evidence in Lord Scarman's report on the Brixton disorders, albeit mentioned in passing. There is also evidence from another and distinguished document, which has not yet been mentioned. That is a detailed survey, carried out earlier this year in the London borough of Hillingdon by Dr. Vorhaus.<br/>
I shall summarise the way in which the powers are used where they have been available. The evidence points to their having been used almost exclusively, and certainly primarily, against young people, black people and oddly dressed people. In her study, Dr. Vorhaus said that the study of attitudes to stop and search among juveniles in Hillingdon showed that 52 per cent. of the juveniles questioned had been stopped and searched by the police. Although it is a surprisingly high figure, it is consistent with what has been reported by the PSI. She added that


<q>whereas a notable characteristic of the sample was their pro-police and pro-law and order outlook, the experience of being stopped seemed to have a strong negative influence. It appeared to make juveniles hostile towards the police and alienated them from the law.</q>
Among the 52 per cent. of the juveniles in Hillingdon who were stopped and searched, she found the feeling that it was a bad experience subjectively. She found, too, that it had the consequence, possibly for a long time to come, of setting those juveniles against the police and even the law itself.<br/>
5.30 pm<br/>
It is right, too, to remind the House that in paragraph 4.67 of his report on the Brixton disorders Lord Scarman observed that
<q>stop and search operations in particular require courtesy and carefully controlled behaviour by the police to those stopped.</q>
We should be aiming to ensure that whatever stop and search powers are produced by the Bill meet Lord Scarman's recommendation that they should be courteously and carefully controlled.<br/>
I suggest that we can be assured that such powers are carefully controlled and, we hope, courteously implemented only if they are limited to police officers in uniform. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) mentioned the case of Mr. Derik Donaldson. The hon. Member for Leicestershire, North-West (Mr. Ashby) said that he had come across many other such cases in his experience as a practising lawyer. There cannot be many practising lawyers in this place who have not come across a similar state of affairs.<br/>
An even worse situation than that which faced Mr. Donaldson is often encountered by young and perhaps fancily dressed women in London who find themselves being accosted by quite fearsome looking plain clothes police officers who wish to stop and search them. We recognise and accept that police officers have to indulge in verisimilitude if they are to detect crime. We accept the need for criminal intelligence, and those of us who have seen many plain clothes police officers have recognised that they are bound to acquire extraordinary hairstyles, tight torn jeans, as has been mentioned in a case recently, and other similar clothing. They sometimes look extremely unpleasant.<br/>
A young woman faced with a request, however polite, to be stopped and searched by a plain clothes police officer dressed in that way is entitled to be afraid and to take to her heels. If she is handled by a police officer in those circumstances, she is entitled to use violence to escape from him, even though he may be saying that he is a police officer. Young women often face risk in our city streets and it would be unreasonable to require of them a different standard in respect of plain clothes police officers from that which we would expect of them in respect of any other ordinarily dressed young man.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for bringing that matter to my attention. Those of us who believe in a liberal society believe in a free society subject

to constraints. We must examine those constraints carefully before they are placed. Sometimes constraints have to be placed upon society in the public interest. The examples to which I referred with approval earlier are constraints which we accept as being required in the public interest. The constraint that is now required by the Government is, in my judgment, not in the public interest.<br/>
Plain clothes officers' powers to arrest are not affected by the amendment that was accepted in another place. That amendment had the support of some distinguished and experienced lawyers, not least a former Lord Chancellor, who moved the amendment on behalf of the Opposition, and my noble and learned predecessor, Lord Hooson, who has enormous experience of practising the criminal law throughout England and Wales. They are two examples of the experience that was brought to bear on the amendment when it was discussed in another place. With that in mind, I ask the House to accept that the balance of public and private interest achieved by the requirement that the police should be in uniform is a proper one, and that it should vote against the Government's proposal.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) that this is a matter of balance. Reasonable arguments could be advanced from both sides on this issue. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman), who introduced the Opposition's view, rested his case primarily on the assertion that the informality of the clothes worn by plain clothes police officers might be such as to make the exercise of the powers either difficult or unreliable. That, in substance, is the argument that the Labour party has deployed on this issue.<br/>
As the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery has said, this is a matter of balance. We have been reminded that there are many instances where plain clothes officers already possess the power to arrest or the power to stop and search&#x2014;for example, terrorism, firearms or drugs. I have no doubt that, in theory at least, the informality of the dress of plain clothes police officers could cause problems. Yet in the past Parliament has decided to introduce legislative powers and I do not think that they have been the subject of substantial complaint thereafter.<br/>
The power of the plain clothes police officer is set out by limitation in the Bill. He can exercise the power only if the circumstances that are prescribed in clause 1 arise. He can exercise the power lawfully only if he complies with the statutory requirements that are set out in clause 2. If he does not comply with those requirements, he commits an assault and he is, in theory at least, liable in damages.<br/>
The issue is one of balance. I am not trying to say that what the right hon. Member for Gorton and the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery have argued is absurd. However, there must be occasions when to deny a plain clothes police officer the right to exercise the power under clause 1 would be to prevent him either preventing crime or apprehending a criminal. As a matter of balance, the Government have it right and I support them.</p>

<p>I welcome the contribution of the hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg). Those of us who sat through the 59 sittings in Committee noted his silence in his then capacity as a Government Whip but suspected that that silence was the result of restraint. The hon. Gentleman makes the good point that we are discussing a


matter of balance. Surely no one would disagree that it is always a question of balance in these matters. However, perhaps the evidence should be tested dispassionately.<br/>
When the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) made what might be described as almost an impassioned contribution, he took the argument into the ridiculous and the absurd and missed the point. That is why I intervened in his speech to ask him whether, if it was thought that a mistake had been made ab initio, it would not be wiser to listen to the counsel of others before enshrining the mistake in tablets of stone, as it were, by incorporating it in an Act of Parliament.<br/>
This is a matter of balance, and there is considerable evidence to show that the House should go along with the Lords amendment. That has been said by the Opposition on numerous occasions in the Chamber, in Committee and in many parts of the country. A number of police officers would not be averse to the arguments on this subject put during the past year by me and by many others. This is a matter of balance. At the end of the day, we must ask ourselves whether the power to stop and search given to officers not in uniform will enhance the police service and its powers of detection or whether it will detract from the service and increase the friction that regrettably exists so often between the general public and the police.<br/>
The point that we are debating is perhaps best and crucially demonstrated in the Policy Studies Institute report. That report showed that, of the 1 million stops and searches in the capital in the year under review, 95 per cent. were carried out by officers in uniform and 5 per cent. by plain clothes officers. Of those 1 million stops and searches, only 3 per cent., or 30,000, led to the next stage, which might have been arrest. The hon. Member for Leicestershire, North-West (Mr. Ashby) asked how many of those 30,000 arrests resulted from the findings of the stop and search, the fracas that occurred because of the stop and search or some trivial point that was later used to justify the stop and search. The answer is that none of us knows the facts accurately, but those who have had experience in metropolitan and other areas where those powers of stop and search exist know that often charges of threatening behaviour or assault on a police constable are laid or some nefarious traffic matter is cited. That is the way in which stop and search is thought to be carried out. The vast number of contacts between the police and the public under the provisions of stop and search powers result in no charges being laid.<br/>
We must consider the other side of the coin. The powers of stop and search may be extended to the whole country, as they are being extended to constables in uniform. Parts of the country do not have the stop and search powers of London and the Metropolitan police force area. During the past 150 years the rest of the country has got on very well detecting crime without such powers. Those powers have not been needed in rural Derbyshire or Leicestershire, parts of South Yorkshire or other such places. On many occasions the stop and search powers are counterproductive, because in cases of serious crime&#x2014;for example, drug trafficking, terrorism, murder and rape&#x2014;a police officer has more than adequate powers in criminal law to carry out his duties.<br/>
Suggestions have been made that if the provisions of clause 1 were extended to the country as a whole, approximately 7 million or 8 million stops and searches a year would occur. If stop and search is to continue in the same proportion as that found by the PSI in its

investigation&#x2014;95 per cent. of stops and searches being carried out by officers in uniform and 5 per cent. by officers in plain clothes&#x2014;we must ask why so many people are worried about that 5 per cent. The answer to that question is known to most practical and practising lawyers&#x2014;that the 5 per cent. of stops and searches give rise to problems associated with the issue of assault. With the best will in the world, I cannot honestly say with my hand on my heart that I believe that the provisions of clause 2 will be followed meticulously if this power comes into force. The reality is that the man in blue jeans&#x2014;plain clothes officers do not always wear blue jeans; I have seen them wearing many other things over the years&#x2014;flashes his warrant card. We have already had a demonstration of how little that means. Most people do not know what a bank card is, let alone a warrant card. These days if someone flashes anything in front of anyone else he is likely to think that that person is up to no good.<br/>
Even if all the pedantic steps of clause 2 were taken into account, a problem would still exist. The problem concerns the person in the street being approached by someone who asks questions and says, "You must do this". If approached by a person in uniform, the natural reaction of members of the public is to co-operate. That happens with the vast majority of requests made by police officers. If approached by someone not in uniform., the natural reaction is to be wary. We are all conditioned by what we read in the newspapers and watch on television day in, day out. We see members of the public approached by people who have no good intentions towards them. Frankly, if someone comes up to me in a street late at night, my first and natural reaction is to get out of the way. In the past few years, too many horrific things have happened late at night in the streets of our cities and in our rural areas. That is the point at which problems will begin to arise when this power is extended.<br/>
5.45 pm<br/>
If the police service is to succeed, it requires the public's co-operation and assistance. The PSI report clearly showed that an extensive power to stop and search, with 1 million people stopped every year and only 3 per cent. of the stops and searches justified at a later stage, resulted in 97 per cent. of people taking offence. ft is suggested that we should extend that power to the whole country, so that 7 million to 8 million people a year will be stopped and searched. That means that 97 per cent. of those people may take offence at being stopped and searched&#x2014;never mind those within the 3 per cent. who take offence because they have been stopped by someone dressed up as a thug. I regret to say that my experience is that on occasions plain clothes officers have dressed in no better fashion than many of those they were supposed to be apprehending. It does the police service no good for its plain clothes officers to be dressed in the way that has been described and seen on a number of occasions.<br/>
The more the public is upset, the more its co-operation decreases. Regrettably, that will be the increasing result of the Government's attempts to overturn the amendment. The amendment is sensible because it recognises the balance between the need to detect crime and to elicit the co-operation of the general public. I hope that at this last moment the Government will think again, if for no other reason than that policing needs the public's co-operation if it is to succeed.<br/>
Let us get out of our trenches of party politics. The Government should listen not only to the Opposition's arguments but to what was said by those in the other place and the commentators outside this place who have experience of these matters. Time and again, they have said that if a person is approached in the street by a man or woman in uniform, the public recognise that authority is requesting assistance. People do not object to being asked for assistance. If people are approached by someone who, in the first moment of contact, is not readily identified as a police officer, resentment begins to grow.<br/>
The PSI report has shown that a considerable number of people have been offended by the way in which a stop and search has been conducted. When people feel offended by authority, their willingness on another occasion to co-operate with authority is diminished. Are the Government really asking that 7 million or 8 million stops and searches should take place in a year? If so, they are asking for a decrease in co-operation between the police and the public, and that can only be to the detriment of society.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) that this is very much a matter of balance. The stop and search power is necessary for the police, but it must be used sparingly and, as Lord Scarman said, with a great deal of tact. The other place has tried hard to introduce that element of tact by saying that stops and searches must be carried out by a police officer in uniform.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) said that 25 per cent. of police officers may be out of uniform at any one time. If that is the figure, and I have no reason not to accept it, there must be occasions when a stop and search is necessary and the police officer is out of uniform. That gives rise immediately to the problems which have been so carefully explained to us by the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman), who referred to the case of Derik Donaldson. I intervened because on many occasions I have represented people who have said that they thought that the people who had approached them were thugs. Invariably, on those occasions I have been defending people who have been charged with assault on police officers.<br/>
I accept that there is a need for a stop and search power and that there will be occasions when it will be carried out by officers who are not in uniform. It would be unfortunate if that stop and search were found to be illegal. I should like safeguards to be introduced, because we have pinpointed the problem that offences arise out of the stop and search. Those are not offences of having an offensive weapon, possessing drugs or any offence, however trivial, which is the reason for the stop and search, but offences that arise out of the stop itself. Those offences are invariably of obstructing the police or assault on the police.<br/>
People with no previous convictions have often been charged and convicted of assault on police officers. The evidence in the case is invariably of a police officer saying, "I produced a warrant card." There is no reason to disbelieve that, but why should people who have never been in trouble before start fighting a police officer who has produced a warrant card? They were not hiding drugs

or offensive weapons, and therefore the only logical reason for it is that there was a misunderstanding between the two parties.<br/>
I should like safeguards introduced so that cases in which an offence arises out of a stop and search are referred to someone else before prosecution. If we are talking about a figure of 3 per cent.&#x2014;30,000&#x2014;which may rise because this provision will cover the country, as the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) said, and assuming that a large proportion of those offences will not have arisen out of the stop and search&#x2014;such as hiding something that was found during the stop and search&#x2014;we are not talking about a large number of cases.<br/>
I should like all the cases of assault and obstructing the police that arise out of stop and search referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions before a prosecution is instituted. There would then be a safeguard and I should be able to support the Government in opposing the amendment with a happier conscience. That is why I am asking for the safeguard which would please so many of us.</p>

<p>I have to report to the House that I have been stopped and searched twice by the police. On both occasions the policeman was dressed in uniform and it was in daylight. On the first occasion the police constable insisted that I empty my bag, which contained a large amount of dirty washing, on to the pavement and replace the dirty washing in it before proceeding on my way to the launderette. On the second occasion the police officer showed considerable curiosity about why I should be carrying an empty suitcase. I am glad to say that that was some years ago. Nevertheless, it left me at the time, and subsequently, with the same feeling as 40 out of every 100 Londoners had when they were surveyed after being stopped and searched by police&#x2014;that there was no good reason for the police to stop and search them.<br/>
Had I been a little younger, I am sure that my view would probably have been that which has already been expressed as the view of more than half the teenagers in Hillingdon who, after being stopped and searched by the police, were transformed into being anti-police and anti-law from being pro-police and pro-law.<br/>
In his impassioned speech the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) referred to the rising tide of crime. Over the years we have all witnessed that rising tide with considerable anxiety. Today, as on all other occasions, the House must be interested in how society and the police combat crime effectively. My worry, which is one which has been voiced by a number of hon. Members today, is that the extensive new powers for the police to stop and search will be counter-productive and will do nothing to improve the level of crime detection which, unhappily, is extremely low in many parts of the country, particularly London. They will do nothing to improve relations between the general public and the police, which many of us believe are at the core of trying to combat the rising tide of crime.<br/>
We are aware from the figures that extensive powers of stop and search result in a minimal level of arrest. It is clear that if the stop and search powers are introduced they will do nothing to combat crime effectively. They will,


however, I fear, do a great deal to alienate further large sections of the community; in particular, the young whites, blacks and Asians.<br/>
I represent a consitituency which has a large ethnic community. Many members of that community are already extremely worried by the level of racial harassment which they, their parents and families face. I ask the House to try to imagine the position in Bradford late at night in a community which feels great anxiety about racial attacks against and harassment of black and Asian British people if a young casually dressed white seeks to stop a young black or Asian for the purposes that we have been discussing. There will inevitably be a suspicion in the mind of that young black or Asian that the person who is seeking to stop him is not a detective seeking to combat crime in Bradford, but is possibly seeking to attack him or her. This is not a question of balance as some hon. Members have sought to argue.<br/>
I plead with the House to consider whether the amendment will serve the best interests of our communities. Will it effectively combat crime and will it improve relationships between the police and the community? In my view, it will not.<br/>
6 pm<br/>
I also invite the House to consider some of the views advanced by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds when he waxed eloquent about the warrant cards which will be carried by detectives wearing casual clothes and seeking to stop and search individuals. What will be the situation, for example, for many of my constituents who do not speak English well? How will they easily understand that the persons seeking to stop them&#x2014;persons who they think may be seeking to attack them&#x2014;in reality are police officers seeking to combat crime in my constituency?<br/>
It is nonsense. It is a recipe for increased racial tension in my community and many others. For that reason, I agree with the amendment accepted in the other place and with the views expressed by a former Lord Chancellor. I am fundamentally opposed to stop and search powers because I do not believe that there is a need for them. What is more, they will be counter-productive and will not effectively reverse the tide of crime about which we are all concerned. However, if we are to have the powers, they should be limited to police constables in uniform. If the amendment is overturned by the House and we have possibly thousands upon thousands of stops and searches at all hours of the day and night in inner cities such as mine, they will represent a recipe for many unfortunate incidents which will do nothing to reverse the rising tide of crime but will do a great deal to alienate further large sections of the community against the police. That would do a grave disservice to the community. It would certainly not be in the interests of the police.</p>

<p>I wish to express my support for the proposition that we should oppose the Lords in this amendment.<br/>
It was interesting to hear both the Minister of State and my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) refer to the safeguards in clause 2(2) and (3). These are new safeguards, and I suggest that they are justifiable when officers are not in uniform. However, I think that the House will accept that in putting forward those safeguards we are expecting the officers to be trained

to a new standard, and that brings me to the question which I wish to raise in this debate, although I suppose that it could be raised in debates on nearly all these amendments.<br/>
I should like to know the Government's proposals for implementing this legislation, and I refer especially to the timing of the implementation. Before clauses 1 and 2 come into force we need to see a lot of training for police officers. For many months police officers have been tied up in defending civil liberties in mining areas and on the picket lines, and training for the regular police has suffered. Much training which would normally have taken place has been allowed to slip.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will be able to assure the House that it is not proposed to bring in any of this legislation, especially this provision, until the training programmes of local police forces have returned to the levels which we should have seen but for the industrial action in the mines, and that time will be allowed for the full training of officers before any pressure is exerted to make the legislation effective.<br/>
I hope that that assurance will be given. If it is given, I shall be only too pleased to support the Government in opposing the amendment.</p>

<p>I welcome the view expressed by the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) and I hope that the Government will respond positively to his proposal that, if they succeed in reversing the Lords amendment, they will seek to delay the implementation of this provision until there has been due time for the training of police but possibly also until the Government have put forward their proposals about the establishment of an independent prosecution service.<br/>
One of the complaints made with most force by those who have experience, especially the hon. Member for Leicestershire, North-West (Mr. Ashby), of conducting the defence of those subsequently arrested by the police is that the very fact of a search can provoke a chain of circumstances which in itself may lead to the commission of a criminal offence. It is highly desirable, if those circumstances are alleged, that the allegation should be subject to consideration by the independent prosecution service. The hon. Member for Leicestershire, North-West spoke of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but I think that what the Government have in mind may be more appropriate. If the Minister can give some assurances about that, he may assist the House considerably. However, it has to be said that, despite that safeguard, that is not really the only situation that gives rise to doubts about whether these powers are necessary.<br/>
On this recommendation I felt that the Philips commission was less than adequate in its argument about the necessity. It was not one of the most forceful of the commission's recommendations. In fact, the commission was divided about it, and it is precisely the kind of matter on which it is not suitable for the House to be divided by the Whips or on party lines, as the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) suggested. It is essentially a matter on which the judgment of those involved in the prevention of crime should be before the House to enable right hon. and hon. Members to consider their evidence. It is precisely the kind of case where it would have been useful for a prelegislative committee to have the opportunity to listen to the arguments before recommending the appropriate approach to the House.<br/>
The hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) was right to say that it is a matter of balance. It is plainly undesirable that so many people should be stopped and searched by police officers in plain clothes, as undoubtedly will flow from this provision if the Lords amendment is rejected, if it is not strictly necessary that that should be done. We have not heard about the necessity for this power. We have not even heard anecdotal evidence about it. We have had all kinds of assertions from the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds about its necessity. Some rather high-flown language has been used, but we have heard nothing persuasive in terms of practical operational necessity from the spokesman for the police. I should have preferred an opportunity to hear from the police directly why it is seen as an operational necessity.<br/>
It is against that that we have to judge what is the clear evidence that a power of this nature will create a backlash of hostility against the police, especially among the young and ethnic minorities in our cities where already there is an observable erosion of confidence in the police and where it is more necessary than anywhere else to have the full co-operation of the public if the appalling crime figures are to be diminished.<br/>
I cannot see that it is in the interests of the police and those whose task it is to maintain the rule of law in our cities that the House should pass measures which further alienate those among whom they have to move. For that reason, if, regrettably, the House votes against the Lords amendment, this measure must be used with extreme care and most exceptionally.<br/>
There appear to be two circumstances in which it is argued that it is possibly justifiable to have searches made by policmen not in uniform. The first is where a policeman, when he is not in uniform, has his suspicions aroused and seizes the opportunity to find out whether the suspicious behaviour is indicative of an offence having been committed. If he encounters suspicious behaviour of that sort, he is presented with a difficult judgment. He has to consider whether he may damage the interests of the police by making an unjustified assumption. He runs the risk of alienating the sympathy of the person who is searched.<br/>
I do not think that the Minister or anyone will doubt that to be stopped and searched, even by a policeman in uniform, is not an experience to which the public take kindly; but they take even less kindly to being stopped and searched by someone of whose credentials they are not sure. Although there are safeguards in clause 2, I do not think that they will eliminate hostility on the part of the public or provide any certainty in the mind of the person who is stopped or searched that the policeman is justified in doing so.<br/>
The other circumstance is where certain members of the police feel it necessary or are instructed to go in plain clothes to make investigations. It is not by mere hazard that they embark upon such a search. It is an altogether more dubious practice than the first one that I mentioned, especially if it is not related to some specific and very serious offence.<br/>
It is perfectly possible to draw a distinction between serious and less serious offences, despite what the Minister said to the contrary. This House has frequently had to face

that dilemma. I do not believe that it is justifiable for policemen not in uniform to have the power to stop and search, except for serious offences.<br/>
For the reasons that I have given, I should be reluctant to support the Government in their motion to reject the Lords amendment. However, if the Government, with their huge majority, decide to overturn the freely expressed views of the other House, I beg them not to allow the police to embark on the process before the Government have brought in provisions for an independent prosecution service, or before the police have had proper time to establish training facilities to minimise the undoubtedly damaging effects that will flow from the provision if the greatest sensitivity is not used and if it is not used most sparingly.</p>

<p>I do not think that anyone in this House would accuse me of being on the wet, liberal left of my party on questions of law and order. I do not usually ally myself with hon. Members who seek constantly to use the police as a whipping boy, and who persistently attack a police force that I consider to be the finest in the world and which needs the support of this House rather than its criticism and constant attack. Nevertheless, I do not support the Government in the step that they are proposing to take this evening.<br/>
Although I do not support the Government now, 10 years ago I would undoubtedly have done so. In the past 10 years there has been a significant change in our society. For that reason, it is more important than ever before that there should be a proper and appropriately high degree of identification and recognition of police officers before they discharge their duties. Our society has degenerated to the point at which there is a lot of aggravation. It arises in situations in which it would never have arisen 10 years ago.<br/>
6.15 pm<br/>
The issue before the House is one on which hon. Members on both sides have said that what is involved is a question of balance. Even Lord Denning&#x2014;not the greatest friend of Opposition Members&#x2014;said in their Lordships' House that his mind had wavered to and fro as the arguments had gone on in the Committee, and that the question was whether the safeguards in the Bill were sufficient. It is true that he said that the safeguards were just sufficient to warrant the Bill going forward without the amendment. That comment emboldens me to say that honourable men of experience in the exercise of police powers in our society are entitled, on balance, to come to different conclusions. I am emboldened in my conclusion by the fact that a number of very distinguished and eminent people share my view and, incidentally, the views of those who are opposed to the Government tonight.<br/>
For three reasons, I think that it is undesirable, on balance, that the police powers should be extended beyond the powers they have to arrest without being in uniform in the most serious cases&#x2014;those involving drugs, firearms and terrorism. We must not forget that those powers are very extensive.<br/>
I accept from my own experience that it is likely that many innocent people will be aggravated. They will be young; they will be coloured. They will also be middle-aged; they will also be old. It is only in recent months that I have begun to receive post from reputable constituents complaining about what they consider to be encroachments upon their freedoms, or the freedoms of their


families, by over-zealous police officers. I have never noticed that before throughout the 10 or 11 years in which I have been a Member of this House.<br/>
Ordinary, middle class, decent people who uphold and support the police are beginning to be aggravated. It may be that much of their aggravation is without justification, but it only underlines my point that the threshold of pain in our society today is now much lower. Whereas 10 years ago people were prepared to give police officers the benefit of the doubt and to accept their authority, they are now, for all kinds of reasons, less willing to do so.<br/>
Secondly, all too often in our society&#x2014;it never happened 10 years ago&#x2014;people are set upon, stopped or halted in the street by people who they fear are about to mug or rob them. It used not to happen, but it happens now in some of our cities on a scale never before imagined. That seems to be very dangerous for police officers who are not in uniform and thus are not easily recognised.<br/>
Thirdly&#x2014;this follows from the second reason&#x2014;I have little doubt that more police officers stopping more citizens in the new social atmosphere of high aggravation and a low threshold of pain will be assaulted. Frankly, it is a surprise to me that the Police Federation is in favour of taking away the uniform as a basis for stop and search in the lesser offences because it seems to me to be their protection against assault and attack.<br/>
For those three reasons, based upon my judgment&#x2014;which may not be shared by others&#x2014;our society is far more vulnerable and volatile than it ever was. I feel the gravest hesitation in inviting police officers to be assaulted, inviting young people to be more resentful and inviting people to go in greater fear of attack on our streets than they might otherwise have done.<br/>
I have also gone to and fro as I have heard the debates over the days, particularly tonight, and on balance I would say that we are giving a dangerous extension of power. The safeguards, the name, the police station, the object of the search, the grounds for proposing to make a search, the necessity to record&#x2014;all those things are desirable. They are no less than we owe the police. They are not only justifiable but necessary. However, there is one problem in that they are not enforceable. A person stopped in the street and subjected to a search by a plain clothes officer would have to be extremely persistent to go along to the police station and to take advantage of the rights that we are giving to the citizen in clause 2. I do not think that the safeguards are sufficient to protect the police in the current situation of violence and aggravation in our society.<br/>
Sadly, for the reasons that I gave at the beginning of my speech, I feel that I cannot support the Government in their bid to overthrow what some distinguished, honourable and knowledgeable lawyers in the other place thought was right.</p>

<p>By leave of the House, I shall comment briefly on the points raised in the debate.<br/>
I thank the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) for his kind remarks on my arrival, which were echoed by hon. Members on both sides of the House. I find it extremely difficult to deal with the Bill, albeit in its last stages, with the same facility as others, but I shall do my best.<br/>
I detected that there were three separate strands in the debate. First, there was concern about the possible abuse of the powers that might be involved; secondly, there was concern that the police should require to have such powers

extended to plain clothes officers; and thirdly, there was concern that the relationship between the police and the public would be endangered if the police took the powers that we propose to introduce by deleting the amendment that the other place inserted in the Bill.<br/>
The House would do well to recall the background against which the Bill has proceeded. In the fight against crime, it is necessary to provide the police force with certain additional powers. It is also necessary to codify and co-ordinate some of the procedures that are needed. The necessity to make the policy more effective is important. The need to allow plain clothes officers to exercise stop and search powers when uniformed constables are also allowed to do so is also important.<br/>
We must also put on the record the extent of the safeguards that are in evidence&#x2014;first, the safeguards in the Bill to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) referred. They may not be sufficient, but I should like to remind the House of the ones that are to be found in the code of practice relating to these powers. The draft code of practice recognises the specific problem to which the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) referred in relation to the sensitivity of these issues. Paragraph 1B of the draft states:
<q>Statistics on the use to date of powers to stop and search indicate that in most cases no such article is found, and there is strong evidence that on many occasions these powers have been used where reasonable grounds to suspect the individual concerned of having the article in question on him did not in fact exist. There is also strong evidence that such misuse plays an important part in mistrust of the police among some sections in the community.</q>
It is right that that should be set out clearly as the very important context in which any use of those powers is undertaken. The draft continues:
<q>It is therefore important to ensure that the powers are used responsibly and sparingly. Over use of the powers is as likely to be harmful to the police effort in the long-term as misuse.</q>
The point is therefore specifically recognised in the code of practice to be issued that this is a crucial power, that the context in which it is used must be most carefully weighed and that it must be used responsibly and sparingly. The paragraph concludes:
<q>It is also particularly important to ensure that any person searched must be treated courteously and considerately if police action is not to be resented.</q>
Therefore, that second element of safeguard that is in clause 2 and in the code of practice that has been drawn up for this purpose significantly reflects much of the anxiety that we have heard, for example, from my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Burton (Mr. Lawrence) and Opposition Members.</p>

Gentleman will recognise that, under clause 64(7), when a code of practice is ignored, a disciplinary offence by the officer is created. That should be a significant deterrent for those who may seek to avoid implementing the code of practice.<br/>
The third element of safeguard was strongly urged on me by two of my hon. Friends&#x2014;the Members for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) and for Leicestershire, North-West (Mr. Ashby). They were both concerned about


training, as was the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin that the training period is crucial to the implementation of this part of the Bill, as it is crucial to so many others. Likewise, I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that the time provided for implementation of those portions of the Bill requiring training will be so judged. In consultation with the police, an adequate period will be provided for their training in the new powers embodied in the Bill. I assure my hon. Friend too that it is important that the training be carried out with the full sympathy and understanding that the code of practice lays upon the individuals, quite apart from the fact that many of the powers will also require training for the legal profession in its acceptance of what is involved.<br/>
6.30 pm<br/>
I put it to the House, therefore, that there will be considerable safeguards in relation to the implementation of the Bill. I conclude, however, that the need to provide such powers is important if we are to have full confidence that the police, whether in uniform or not, can operate effectively in stopping and searching when so much material&#x2014;prohibited articles and stolen goods&#x2014;can frequently be found on persons if they are correctly suspected of having been involved in taking them.</p>

<p>These amendments relate to custody officers and to the detention which flows therefrom.<br/>
One of the most important concepts in the Bill is that of the introduction of the custody officer. The Royal Commission recommended, in paragraph 3.112 of its report, that as soon as a suspect is brought into a police station under arrest accountable responsibility for his welfare, for seeing that he is aware of his rights, for answering inquiries about his whereabouts and for decisions about his detention pass out of the hands of the arresting or investigating officer and into the hands of another officer. Following the Royal Commission, we have called this other officer the custody officer, and clause 34 provides for the appointment of custody officers.<br/>
The responsibilities and duties of custody officers are set out in clauses 35 to 37 and in the draft codes of practice for which clause 63 provides. To a large extent, these responsibilities and duties involve a distillation of current best practice&#x2014;the custody officer inheriting the mantle of the present station sergeant. However, as his title implies, his role will involve a new and necessary emphasis on the treatment of the detained persons and a new element of direct personal accountability for their welfare and the safeguarding of their rights.<br/>
In Committee, clause 34 attracted criticism from both sides. It was urged that the custody officer's role was so significant a development of that of the station sergeant, and that the range of new safeguards provided by the Bill was so extensive, that clause 34 incorporated too casual an approach. We concluded that there was force in the criticisms. The difference in reality between the busy city centre police station manned round the clock by a number of officers and the unmanned rural station which is unlocked and used for only a couple of hours a day is greater than the distinction between subsections (1) and (2) of clause 34 implies. In the light of the Committee debates, we took into account some other inherent practical

problems which we had originally underestimated and which the Committee did a service in exposing. We therefore proposed in another place that clause 34 should be replaced by a new clause&#x2014;amendment No. 94.<br/>
The other amendments deal with the necessary changes which flow from the new scheme in the new clause. Amendment No. 93 paves the way for the change. The new clause defines the term "designated police station". It requires each chief officer to designate sufficient police stations to provide accommodation for persons who are detained in his police area. These will be fully manned stations, generally open for 24 hours, to which the great majority of arrested persons will be taken.<br/>
Amendment No. 294 is consequential to the new clause, and adds the definition of a "designated police station" to the general interpretation clause.<br/>
The first five subsections of amendment No. 94&#x2014;the new clause&#x2014;provide for the appointment of at least one custody officer, who must be at least of the rank of sergeant, at each designated police station. The important feature of these subsections is that custody officers are to be specifically appointed as such and that those appointed must be of at least sergeant rank, although subsection (4) permits other officers, who might sometimes be of lower rank than sergeant, to perform the functions of the custody officer if he is not readily available.<br/>
Subsection (5) retains in the case of designated stations the division of investigative and custodial responsibilities at present prescribed generally in clause 34(3).<br/>
Subsections (6) to (9) address the problem of small rural police stations. Subsection (6) defines who is to perform the functions of the custody officer if an arrested person is taken to a non-designated station. If possible, an officer who is not involved with the investigation will perform this task. It may be that in the case of a two-man station the other officer would be available to do so. However, no such officer is readily available, or if both officers had been involved in the arrest, the demarcation between custodial and investigative responsibilities may be suspended.<br/>
The institution of custody officers is a major development in the ethos of policing. It is vital that the scheme should be workable and practicable. Clause 34 as printed would cause difficulties. It would lead in a minority of cases to considerable inconvenience to the arrested person and the depletion of local police cover. The amendments made in another place will meet this problem and introduce extra safeguards to balance the increased discretion given to the police.<br/>
Finally, we propose small additional amendments to the revised detention scheme. They will not in any way affect the 43 police forces in England and Wales which are governed by the Police Act 1964, but they are necessary to enable other forces such as the British Transport police and the various ports or docks police to continue to work effectively. I trust that the House will accept the amendments.</p>

<p>I am particularly concerned with Lords amendment No. 94. However, I should first like to welcome the new Minister of State to our deliberations. He joins us shortly before the second anniversary of the long saga of the Bill, which has spanned two Parliaments and survived two Home Secretaries. The


Minister is the third Minister of State to have been involved, and the Bill may well have attracted a record number of amendments.<br/>
I have to commiserate with the Minister, who resembles an actor taking over in the last act of a play. The lines have already been written, and he is forced to go through with the part. He has undoubtedly done his homework, but he may not be as aware of some of the debates that have taken place as we are. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) and myself are the only survivors of the whole saga of the Bill.</p>

<p>I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon: there are three survivors.<br/>
It is significant that, despite the many changes to the Bill and the long hours of debate, the question of the custody officer and his key links with the provisions for lengthy periods of detention without charge continues to cause concern. Concern remains despite the changes which the Minister has described and the many changes made to the provisions for detention without charge made here and in another place. The worry has not been allayed. We have not yet been convinced that Scotland's six-hour maximum is not much more sensible than a 96-hour maximum.<br/>
The task of the custody officer is the key issue as he is responsible for authorising detention without charge in a police station. The Bill clearly states the reasons for that. They are to secure or preserve evidence or to obtain such evidence by questioning. The custody officer has a fundamental part to play. We believe that the result of his decision may be an oppressively long period of detention without charge during which a person is subjected to questioning. We know from cases that have come to light that that sometimes results in people being induced to confess to crimes that they have not committed. We quoted some examples in Committee. Safeguards against the abuse of such powers are few and far between. We have not yet had the safeguard which the Government conceded&#x2014;it is still in its experimental stage&#x2014;of tape recordings of interviews in police stations. That safeguard should be in place because of the custody officer's decision. When will that safeguard be forthcoming?<br/>
7 pm<br/>
As a result of the custody officer's decision, a person is held. Although the codes provide some right of access to legal advice, there is no absolute right. Some people who are kept for a long time may not be allowed access to solicitors. That is provided for in the code. It is important that access be safeguarded when a person can be held in custody for 96 hours. The Bill does not remove the right of habeas corpus, which is basic to our liberties, but these clauses significantly reduce a person's right to apply for it. That represents an erosion of people's rights and liberties.<br/>
New clause 94 worries me because it gives the responsibility of being a custody officer to a police officer of at least sergeant rank. I read in the October issue of Police that a Metropolitan police working party has examined the Bill's procedures and the requirement to provide custody officers. The working party sent a message to Sir Kenneth Newman and, the article runs,

<q>he duly applied for a considerable increase in the establishment of sergeants. The Home Office turned him down.</q>
The police are worried that the duties of custody officers will be so wide ranging and onerous that more sergeants will have to be appointed, at least in London. I find it alarming that the Metropolitan police envisage such an increase in the number of custody officers. That implies a large increase in the number of people who are detained without charge, some of them for quite a long time. New clause 94(4) provides:
<q>An officer of any rank may perform the functions of a custody officer at a designated police station if a custody officer is not readily available to perform them.</q>
If the Metropolitan police working party is to be believed, that will happen quite frequently.<br/>
The Government are saying that responsibility for holding someone without charge may quite frequently rest on an officer who does not have the seniority and experience of a sergeant. I entirely accept that sergeants must have served for some years, but they are not normally regarded as being all that senior. However, an officer of less experience might have the onerous responsibility of detaining someone for a long time. That is not good enough. We challenge the fundamental principle of long hours of detention without charge and the detail of new clause 94 which provides that the responsibility might be exercised as I have described.<br/>
In spite of the anxieties that hon. Members and others have expressed, these provisions damage civil liberties and could be used oppressively. We still lack safeguards. That is a great cause for concern. We shall vote against the principle and attach our objections to voting against new clause 94.</p>

<p>We now come to clause 53 which is concerned with the powers of intimate search. I know that this issue has been of concern to hon. Members on both sides of the House as well as to their Lordships. The amendments permit, in the first place, nurses as well as doctors to undertake an intimate search, and, in the second place, the authorisation of doctors and nurses to search for class A drugs in certain circumstances. In addition, the Customs' powers of investigative intimate search are unaffected by these provisions.<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
The Bill as passed by this House made no provision far intimate searches to be undertaken by anyone other than a registered medical practitioner or police constable, nor did it provide for an intimate search to be carried out for


any reason other than to remove a concealed or potential weapon. The first Bill provided for an intimate search to be carried out for investigation purposes&#x2014;to obtain concealed evidence of a serious arrestable offence&#x2014;but when my right hon. Friend reviewed the provisions of the Bill before reintroducing it into this House he took the view that this investigative power should be removed from the police.<br/>
However, in another place there was general agreement on all sides that this position was not satisfactory. It was urged that nurses and midwives as well as doctors should be able to undertake intimate searches, on the basis that, if such a search had to be undertaken in the first place, it was preferable for it to be undertaken by someone who was better qualified than a police officer. The Government were wholly sympathetic to this argument. We have always made it clear that intimate searches should be undertaken by police officers only as a last resort, where the risk of injury to the detained person himself or those guarding him outweigh the risk of injury caused by the search. Accordingly, after consultation with the relevant professional bodies, amendments were brought forward which would permit registered nurses to carry out intimate searches. These are amendments Nos. 162, 171, 172 and 174.<br/>
I should like to stress several points. First, intimate searches now take place only in exceptional circumstances. The new safeguards contained in the clause will ensure that the need to resort to a compulsory search of this nature arises only where there is no acceptable alternative. Secondly, if the need for such a search arises, the first port of call for the police is, and will remain, their own police surgeon, if this is practicable and he or she is available. It follows that the participation of nurses will be far from a routine occurrence. Thirdly, the Bill does not oblige any doctor or nurse to undertake a search on the authorisation of a senior police officer; it simply provides the authority in law for a search to be made.<br/>
The second point on which there was general agreement in another place was that, in view of the threat to the life and health of many young people posed by the growing trade in dangerous drugs, there should be a clear provision in the Bill for an intimate search to be carried out when a dealer or carrier is suspected, on reasonable grounds, of internally concealing drugs, particularly heroin. The amendments now before the House meet this need. They provide a power of search related to a class A drug which is being carried with intent to supply or export it. So the power is focused on those directly concerned in trading in these evil substances. It is also limited in other ways. Unlike a search for a concealed weapon, considerations of great urgency will not arise, and search for a class A drug may be carried out only by a registered medical practitioner or nurse&#x2014;not by a police officer&#x2014;and only at a hospital, surgery or other medical premises&#x2014;that is, not at a police station. Because the power to remove class A drugs is vested solely in doctors and nurses, we have to recognise&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>The police will not seek to interpret the powers in that restrictive way. They will recognise that the medical practitioner may&#x2014;not must&#x2014;carry out a search if invited to do so and that it is lawful for him to refuse.<br/>
I take note of the hon. and learned Gentleman's other remarks and hope to reply later.<br/>
We naturally hope that if doctors or nurses are called upon to help the police to remove drugs from a suspected dealer or carrier, they will co-operate to the maximum degree possible, consistent of course with conscience and their own professional and ethical responsibilities.<br/>
Because of the restriction of the power to searches involving suspected supplies of class A drugs, it is much more limited in scope than the power in the Police Bill mark I. Since the decision to remove that power was taken over a year ago, we have all become much more aware of the threat posed by heroin and other hard drugs; and I believe that a strictly controlled search power should remain a weapon available for use in the campaign against hard drugs.</p>

<p>The powers are not confined to one sex. It is accepted that in legislation "him" also means "her". We are talking about medical practitioners of either sex or nurses of either sex.<br/>
We have restricted the power to class A drugs on the basis that an exceptional power of this type should be limited to the most serious crimes. No one will doubt that drug smuggling is a very serious offence. The smuggling of lesser drugs, such as cannabis, remains a very serious


offence, but it does not follow that the same threat is involved. Trafficking in heroin and other hard drugs is unique, and we believe that such powers are appropriate.</p>

<p>The BMA says that class A drugs comprise 85 substances, some of which are not addictive and not dangerous. If the Minister wants to deal with the heroin problem, why is heroin not named in the Bill? The BMA is worried because so many substances are in the class A category. The BMA is worried in case the power becomes a licence to search unnecessarily. The Minister has not justified the power to search for so many different substances.</p>

<p>We have no intention of using the reference to class A drugs as an invitation to search for every drug in that category. We are dealing with the classification of drugs and their potential seriously to damage health. It is most likely that heroin will be the drug for which a search is made. Searching will not take place if no criminal element is involved in the drug concerned. Trafficking in drugs, particularly heroin, is the cause of much crime and drug addiction.<br/>
The power can also be regarded as consonant with the protective intimate search power already in the Bill, since the internal concealment of toxic substances is very dangerous for the person concerned because of the risks of leakage or rupture.<br/>
I wish to stress one point. The Government brought forward the amendments, not&#x2014;as has been suggested in the press&#x2014;in response to pressure from the police, although it is certainly no secret that the police have indeed pressed us for the power to search for drugs. The reason that we brought forward the amendments was a genuine consensus in the other place that the repeal of the investigative search power should not extend to the most dangerous drugs. The Opposition there made it clear that they supported the retention of a power narrowed in that way, and we decided that it would be right to respect and to respond to that concern from all quarters.</p>

<p>The statistical evidence is of drug abuse, drug carrying and drug trafficking. We are discussing whether the use of an intimate search power would be an effective way to deal with one aspect of criminal activity. I cannot give any statistics about intimate search recovery, because the power has not previously been available.<br/>
In this group of amendments there are amendments that permit Customs and Excise to apply to itself the power of protective intimate search contained in clause 55. That is a desirable safeguard that should clearly be available to Customs officers. However, Customs and Excise does have investigate search powers that derive from section 164 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. That permits both intimate and non-intimate searches. In keeping with Customs' role in controlling the movement of goods in and out of the country, its search provision is not limited to class A drugs. Unlike the power now proposed for the police, the Customs provision permits searches only of persons within ports or airports, or entering or leaving the United Kingdom, and is therefore

exercisable only at those places. In short, section 164 of the Customs and Excise Management Act is shaped expressly to enable it to fulfil its particular functions.<br/>
Were Customs to adopt clause 53 in full, the investigative power provided for the police would call its own power into question. The first amendment to clause 107, therefore, limits its adoption of the clause to the protective power and search. Its present power of investigative search is maintained intact by the second amendment, in accordance with undertakings given here and in another place.</p>

<p>The House will be grateful to the Minister for dealing with the amendments at some length. There is concern in every part of the House about the explosion in the trafficking and use of drugs such as heroin. It is a scar on many of our inner city areas. I say quite frankly to the Minister that a contribution to that has been the reduction in Customs and Excise staff at ports of entry. It has been estimated that at the major ports of Dover and Heathrow millions of pounds worth of heroin are smuggled into the country. The Minister may be interested to know that recently a member of the Customs and Excise staff told me that at an airport outside London at certain times of the day and night&#x2014;and I am being careful not to mention the exact times&#x2014;it is not possible to man even the red channel, let alone the green channel with its random searches.<br/>
We are now discussing intimate body searches and the possibility of their being carried out under compulsion. The Minister does not need me to remind him that the Opposition find that an offensive principle, and we have opposed it throughout the lengthy passage of the Bill. However, I am pleased that the Government now accept that such searches should be carried out only by a suitably qualified person, only at a hospital or similar premises, and that they will not, in any circumstances, be carried out by other people.<br/>
7.45 pm<br/>
I listened carefully to the Minister's argument in favour of changing the status of a suitable person from a registered medical practitioner to suitably qualified persons, such as nurses and midwives. I was glad that he made it clear that it would not be just any old body who had taken a first-aid course.<br/>
I grudgingly welcome the fact that under no circumstances will a constable be allowed to carry out intimate searches for drugs. For the life of me, I cannot foresee any circumstances in which, when an intimate search is required, it will prove impossible to find someone suitably qualified. It is going too far even to envisage circumstances in which, on the authority of a superintendent or senior police officer, a constable could be asked to carry out the search.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend appears to be suggesting that it is inconceivable under the clause that a constable could carry out an intimate body search on the suspicion of drugs being carried.

<p>The hon. Lady is under a misapprehension, and I apologise if I contributed to that. When she


intervened in my speech, I thought that she was referring to police surgeons, as opposed to doctors and qualified people. I wish to make it clear that there is no power for police officers to carry out intimate searches for drugs. Such searches must be carried out by a police surgeon or another qualified person, such as a medical practitioner or a registered nurse or midwife. If doctors, nurses or the police surgeon are not available to undertake a search, there will be no search.</p>

<p>I am glad that the Minister has clarified that point.<br/>
The Opposition have two major objections to the Government's proposals for intimate searches for drugs that could be carried out with the use of force. In all the consultations during the passage of the Bill the doctors have made clear their distaste at being required to search for evidence. Doctors and others in the medical profession have found that prospect alarming. They are reluctant to be asked not simply to search for evidence during an examination, but, if necessary, to do so with the application of force. I am sure that the Minister and others will take on board the fact that it is a matter of medical ethics, which must not be taken lightly in this place or elsewhere. It is certainly not taken lightly in the medical profession. Many members of the medical profession may decline to become involved in such practices. I noted that the Minister was careful to say that, where someone in the medical profession came to that conclusion, that view would be accepted.<br/>
A doctor, or, in the terms of one of the amendments, a "suitably qualified person", does not have ethical problems when the search&#x2014;perhaps involving the use of force&#x2014;of an arrested person is justified on ground of danger to the life of the individual. As the BMA has told us:
<q>It is our view that there can be no objection to a medical practitioner carrying out an intimate body search where the purpose is to remove an object which is of immediate danger to the life or personal safety of the suspect or of those people responsible for the suspect's custody and supervision.</q>
I am glad that the Minister acknowledges the strength of that argument. In other words, the BMA accepts that where the concealed drug could cause danger or physical injury to the suspect, its members would be prepared to search.<br/>
As the Minister and the House will recognise, this is an important distinction, because we are being told that the BMA does not support the search for evidence but would support a search if the reasons for it involved the safety of the suspect and that is the reasonable judgment of the suitably qualified person. That is a mile away from the clumsy compulsion in other parts of the Bill.<br/>
The second problem relates to the class A list of drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The BMA was in consultation with the Home Office and made some proposals to the Department, but then the lines went dead. It was expecting a response from those responsible in the Home Office, but, in the words of the old song, "Answer came there none." As the Minister and the House will be aware, more than 85 drugs are listed in schedule 2, part I, to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The House will be delighted to know that I do not intend to read them out, mainly because of the problems that I anticipate over pronunciation of names of the drugs.<br/>
A wide range of drugs are set out in the list. There are a few of immediate interest, such as heroin, which the Minister mentioned. The others are the cocaine and cocaine-based drugs and the morphine and morphine-derivative drugs. I have taken advice, and I am informed that those are a small number of the drugs listed in the class A schedule. The amendment implies that we expect police officers not simply to be able to suspect that there may be morphine or cocaine-related drugs concealed in the intimate parts of the suspect, but to be able to spot the difference between cannabinol, either with or without cannabis or cannabis resin around it.<br/>
Amendment No. 156 allows for forceful intimate searches where a superintendent or more senior officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the suspect may have a class A drug concealed on him. Are we saying that a superintendent, or the generality of senior officers above that, can tell his ethylmethylthiambutene from his 4-Cyano-2-dimethylamino-4? It is ludicrous to suggest that, and, with the greatest respect to those in the medical profession, I should think that one would have to go a long way round that profession before one could find a qualified doctor who could instantly tell one the use of most of the drugs on the class A list.<br/>
The BMA further tells us that it acknowledges the point about the need for much better efforts to be made to stop the entry of heroin, the trafficking in it and its use. It is very much a linked process. As I have already said, if better efforts were made to stop heroin coming into the country in the first place, it would help to solve the problem.<br/>
The BMA also says this:
<q>We appreciate the size of the current problem relating to the illegal importation of heroin but we believe that any provision made in respect of heroin would need to be a specific temporary provision. It appears to us that this could be done within the Bill by giving the Secretary of State the power to permit searches for heroin by laying the appropriate regulation. We believe these powers should be covered by an Affirmative Regulation.</q>
It goes on to make the point that on the class A schedule is a drug called Fentanyl. It is used in carefully controlled circumstances in operating theatres, and there is no known case of addiction to it.</p>

<p>We should listen to what the BMA and those who practise medicine say. Throughout the passage of the Bill, the hon. Gentleman has been telling us how important it is to take notice, through him, because of his links with the Police Federation, of what he described as the people at the sharp end. The BMA also has people at the sharp end and has stated its objection to what is suggested in the amendment. We should take on board what it is saying.<br/>
The list is far too long to be sensible. There is no need for it. As the Minister has already implied, if the main purpose of the amendment is to do something about the heroin and hard drugs problem, why do the Government not say so and limit what they are proposing precisely to that problem? I hope, although I am being optimistic, that it may not be too late for the Minister to change his mind.<br/>
I think the Minister appreciates that the medical profession dislikes being involved in intimate searches,


perhaps with the use of force, where evidence is being looked for by the police on the suspect. A suitably qualified person may be involved in a case in which the police are on the verge of requesting an intimate search and are able, under the terms of the Act, to use force. In this case, the medical practitioner may come to believe that there is no danger to the life or safety of the individual. For example, there may be a suspicion of the concealment of heroin in an intimate part of the body, and a suitably qualified person may have to make a judgment. Why not let nature take its course? Nature will eventually produce what the police suspect may be concealed.</p>

<p>I am not a "not always" man but I accept that there is no such thing as 100 per cent. of anything. In the generality, and with suitable patience and given suitable time, the drug, if that is what is being concealed, will be produced from the suspect. That is the alternative to be set against the judgment of suitably qualified persons who, in a general sense, are able to examine the suspect.<br/>
The Opposition dislike the powers that are set out in the clause. We think that they are far too wide and that they are dangerous in what we like to regard as a free society.

<p>I agree with the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett) that we are talking about matters that are dangerous to a free society. The most dangerous feature that we face is the avalanche of drugs that are coming into the country. When the Bill was discussed on Report the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) suggested that the use of hard drugs was taking on epidemic proportions. We must judge the danger to our society against that description.<br/>
I am obliged to three police officers for the information that they have made available. The chief constable of Sussex reported that in 1983 he executed 69 search warrants in his police area with a positive result for hard drugs. In 1984 he successfully executed 120&#x2014;nearly double the 1983 figure. Seven arrests were made in 1982 involving heroin and 50 in 1983. So far this year 29 such arrests have been made at his count. The progression is clear. It is, of course, steeply upwards.<br/>
Secondly, I refer to the report of the chief constable of Lothian and the Borders police area. I have chosen areas that are representative of the country as a whole. The chief constable of Lothian and the Borders, in his annual report, stated:
<q>Drug abuse in Edinburgh has reached the stage where heroin is in prolific use in several districts of the city.</q>
He reported that there was a
<q>serious involvement of the criminal fraternity in the market for heroin, morphine and cocaine, that large sums of money are readily available for financing drug dealings and that there is evidence that the so-called customers are turning to crime to raise the money to feed their addiction.</q>
Those are the considered words of the chief constable in his report to his police authority.<br/>
<i>The Times</i> reported recently that a survey
<q>of those arrested for theft or house breaking in Edinburgh in a six-month period last year showed that more than 34 per cent. of those offences had direct links with drug abuse.</q>
The connection between hard drugs and violent crime is proven beyond peradventure.</p>

<q>The epidemic is spreading from the cities into the towns and is affecting more and more young people.</q>
He speaks eloquently, in my view, of the tragedy, and says:
<q>In the past few years the age of addicts has become younger and the accessibility of drugs is moving towards younger people in our society.</q>
That is what he said while chairing a conference of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Hutton in Lancashire. In my view, Lord Lane said it all in a recent speech. He said that the hard drugs problem is becoming deadly serious and that its link with violent crime is clear cut. It is against that background that we must consider&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

How do we deal with it, and is it necessary to have the disagreeable business of intimate searching? No police officer wants to be involved with a distasteful and unpleasant practice. The suggestions made in some of the anti-police literature that has been put about by the Greater London council and the hard Left, that the police are slavering at the lips to get into intimate searching, is a perversion of the truth. However, the police have a duty, and they have often to carry through a disagreeable duty.<br/>
The power to carry out an intimate search, whoever performs it, is most valuable, because often it causes the offender to produce the drugs himself or herself rather than submit to an intimate search. I recall giving one example in Committee which bears repetition. I think that the matter arose in the Gloucester police area, but I am not sure. There was a series of offences involving thefts from


parked cars at a beauty spot. The police were keeping observation and a couple were observed. To use the rather quaint language of the police description, the lady was walking rather peculiarly.</p>

<p>Yes, it is revolting. It emerged that many of the keys that had been used in stealing from the parked cars had been carried in what is politely known as the body orifice. When challenged by the police, the lady produced those keys, because she knew, and was told, that it was possible that she would be submitted to an intimate search. The intimate search was, therefore, unnecessary.<br/>
When we debated this subject previously, we considered the problem of the police search for evidence. The House, in its wisdom or otherwise, disagreed on the issue of whether the police could search for evidence. The Government now propose to add a much more limiting power to the Bill. The power deals specifically with two points. It deals with the possibility of searching for those things that could be used to cause harm to the individual concerned or to others in his proximity and&#x2014;I am glad of this measure&#x2014;class A drugs.</p>

<p>As this is the last occasion on which the hon. Gentleman can do so, will he answer the question that I asked him previously when he referred to the Gloucestershire story? The question is simple: upon what authority was the lady told that she could be subjected to an intimate search? Even under the provisions of the new Bill, a bunch of keys could not be said to be a weapon, and certainly not a class A drug.</p>

<p>I understand that, even before we came to debate this Bill, the power of the police to require a search to be carried out already existed. That may well be a common law power, and the hon. Gentleman might wish to comment on that point later.<br/>
The amendment will allow a search for items that can cause injury to the person concerned or to others in his vicinity. Without going into distasteful detail, I point out that it is extraordinary to note the remarkable collection of items that have been carried in the body orifices. I shall not go into detail, save to mention two examples. In one case, a man was found outside a police station with a listening device within his body. He was listening to an interrogation that was going on in the police station.<br/>
I must mention another case, because we are living in the aftermath of the terrible events in Brighton. It is not uncommon for microdetonators to be carried within the body. No one can exclude the possibility of terrorists carrying in their bodies the microdetonators or radio timing devices that can be used to trigger explosions. I know that hon. Members do not lke to hear about those matters, but they are the facts of the modern technological age, and the police service must cope with them. It is right to have this power to cause a search to take place if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person is carrying items that can damage himself or those within his immediate vicinity. I am glad that the Government have included this measure in the Bill.<br/>
I am sorry that hon. Members were not able to dispose of the drugs matter on Report. I moved an amendment to that effect, but at that stage the measure was not favoured

by the Government. I am pleased that the other place has been more persuasive than I was. I have two questions to ask, one of which has been asked already by the hon. Member for Erdington. I do not understand the logic of the class A drugs list. I do not believe that all the drugs on that list are addictive. Having read what the British Medical Association said, I am inclined to feel that my opinion is correct.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
If the class A list does not hang together because the items on it are addictive, what is the peculiar justification of that classification? I regard other class B drugs as damaging. I certainly do not think that people should traffic in those drugs in this country, but they are to be excluded. As the hon. Member for Erdington said, no police officer, when he requires a search to take place, can possibly tell the type of drug he is searching for. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question about how police officers can tell the type of drug for which they are searching is that they do not know. In practice, the police turn over any evidence of drugs of that type to the forensic department. The police require the forensic department to determine what the particular drug is.<br/>
There is a danger with this practice. Suppose there is good reason to believe that a person is a trafficker in these terrible things which place children in the most appalling danger and is carrying such drugs and a search is made and the forensic people determine that the drug found is not class A but class B. The police have a certain amount of humour. One police office said to me, "I suppose that if it is a class B drug, they have to put it back". That is preposterous. No one imagines for one moment that that would happen. There must be a more logical explanation&#x2014;I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will provide it&#x2014;why the classification of class A is appropriate. No doubt at some stage this measure will be embodied in force orders so that the forensic people will know how to handle the drugs.<br/>
The BMA lectured the Committee about how we should conduct our business. I, among others, asked the BMA to meet us and explain its difficulties. I do not know why the BMA did not do so. Perhaps it was frightened that its case was not very good. I do not believe that the BMA's professional performance in advising Parliament on this Bill has been very good. Moreover, there is no evidence that the BMA speaks for the Association of Police Surgeons of Great Britain. The police surgeons have their own professional body. I should be interested to hear from my hon. Friend the Minister of State&#x2014;if not now, perhaps on some other occasion&#x2014;whether the Association of Police Surgeons, which is separate from the BMA, has a considered view.<br/>
I believe that the Government have got the amendments right. They should be passed. They will assist in the fight against terrorism and hard drugs.</p>

<speech hansard_id="279019" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-10-25a.878.0" hansard_membership_id="82" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2427" speakername="Mr. Bermingham" colnum="878" time="18:45:00">
<p>Once again I listened with great care to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths). Much of what he said tonight was said in other places, including in Committee. I do not believe that the Bill can be allowed to go on to the statute book without, at some stage, someone answering certain fundamental questions. I have posed those questions to Government Ministers and to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds on a number of occasions, but have not yet received answers.<br/>
I intervened during the speech of the Minister of State to draw his attention to the wording of Lords amendment No. 156, which is in the male, rather than the male or female, form. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds inadvertently misled hon. Members in Committee, on Report and in the House. I appreciate the cause that he seeks to espouse, and I understand his position in these matters, but I do not see how the listening device referred to in the first example can be said to be an object likely
<q>to cause physical injury to himself or others; and
(ii) he might so use while he is in police detention or in custody of a court;</q>
I cannot see how the type of detonator that needs other firing devices can be said to fall within the provisions of amendment No. 156. I have often puzzled over the Gloucestershire case and I have never been able to understand how a bunch of keys would come under the terms of the amendment.<br/>
When one talks about intimate body searches, whether of male or female persons, one is beginning to go down the road which says that even the human body is no longer sacrosanct within the English legal system. It is easy, in the context and times of dreadful events, to use a dreadful event as an excuse to pervert&#x2014;if I may put it as strongly as that&#x2014;some of the basic principles that we have held strongly for a long time.<br/>
Everyone in the House wishes to facilitate the fight against crime, to ensure that the guilty are captured and sentenced and that society is protected, but liberty also has its price. I have heard no evidence at any stage of the discussions on the Bill which has convinced me that intimate body searches will assist in the fight against the drug pusher. Not one example has been given, as far as I can recall&#x2014;if anyone can think of an example I shall stand to be corrected&#x2014;of intimate body searches having facilitated the conviction of a drug pusher. The reality is that when a person suspected of being a drug pusher or carrier is taken to the police station it is easy to make a claim, "We suspect that you are." What worries me is that if the amendment reaches the statute book that allegation will become the justification for the extensive use of intimate body searches.<br/>
I am also worried that the amendment talks of a class A drug only. How is anyone to know beore the search whether one is searching for&#x2014;I believe that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds recognised the point&#x2014;class A or class B drugs? It will be sought to justify the search by saying that it might be a class A drug, even if it turns out to be a class B drug or nothing. How, why and what justification will be sought? We all know that in practice it will be recorded in the notebook, "I believed that". That is a justification, but it is not good enough. We have stepped down the road of licence. We have started licensing intimate body searches. The moment one starts down that road, one starts to negate liberties.<br/>
In a civilised society we do not need these provisions. There are many other ways in which we can secure the protection of our liberties. For example, we could employ people to find these offenders, but I shall not waste the time of the House by canvassing what has been said by other hon. Members about other methods.<br/>
I shall leave the House with one last thought. It goes back to something that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said tonight. He asked whether the Association of Police Surgeons of Great Britain would take the same

ethical view as the BMA. The BMA objects to intimate body searches on the ethical ground that it is wrong to probe the human body where there is no danger to life or limb from whatever that person has been using his body for. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the letter from the BMA dated 23 October, of which no doubt he has received a copy, he will see that it sets out clearly the basis of its ethical objections. It is simple. If there is no danger, there should be no probe.<br/>
I cannot see how the Association of Police Surgeons can take a different view. Its members are invariably members of the BMA and no doubt are subject to the same rules of the ethics committee. Perhaps we could end the argument if the members of the medical profession stood united. Whether they be doctors, nurses or midwives, the basis of their ethics is the same. They believe in the sanctity of human life and the protection and sanctity of the human body. If they stand firm, as the Minister said, there will be no intimate searches and our country will be that little bit more civilised.</p>

<p>I rise to speak lest my silence on the amendment be interpreted as enthusiastic support for it. I believe that intimate body searches are distasteful and disagreeable, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) said, the power needs to exist because more often than not the simple threat that it can be used is sufficient to produce what would otherwise be found by the search.<br/>
The first Bill that we discussed codified powers of intimate search as being for a weapon or evidence of an offence. The latter part was dropped in the later Bill for reasons that I have yet to hear clearly explained. In Committee, I endeavoured to reintroduce the proposal because I believe that the police should have the ultimate power to search for evidence of an offence. I suggested that it was easy for people to conceal on their person evidence of an offence such as keys, money, credit cards and drugs. I was unable to persuade the Government despite the long list of offences where such evidence had been found, but I am pleased that they considered the strong representations on this issue made in another place. My regret is that the solution they reached is most unsatisfactory and the worst of all worlds.<br/>
The amendment specifies certain drugs only and, therefore, we have the ridiculous position that an intimate search can be carried out if it is believed that a person is carrying within him or herself heroin but not if it is believed that he is carrying cannabis. The other is the difficulty, highlighted by the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham), of what the position is if the police require an intimate body search to be carried out on the ground that the person is believed to be carrying within himself a class A drug but it is found that he is not carrying the drug but is carrying something else which is evidence of an offence such as keys, money or a credit card.<br/>
As I understand it, although it could be argued that the search should not have been carried out, having been carried out and the evidence having been produced, it can then be used. The opportunities for improper procedures and abuse are self-evident. I believe that that is an unsatisfactory solution to the problem, but on the ground that half a loaf is better than no bread, I shall reluctantly support the amendment.</p>

<p>I cannot let the amendment pass without objecting to the provisions that the Government


are introducing. When one discusses the Bill with members of the public, women find the provisions that permit the police to organise intimate body searches the most objectionable.<br/>
When we discuss the Bill's provisions we tend to talk as though such searches will be made only when they are justified. But in the nature of the provision that is not so. When we say, "If there is reasonable suspicion this can be done," it follows inevitably that people will be searched who are not guilty and forcibly searched in the most intimate parts of their bodies when there is nothing incriminating to be found and they should not be searched in that way.<br/>
8.30 pm<br/>
I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that, in the case of drugs, with this widening of the power it will not be possible for the police to search an individual forcibly if a nurse or a doctor is unwilling to agree to it. But I fear that this will not be the protection that it may be in these days of massive unemployment and poverty, even in the medical profession and especially amongst nurses. I fear that there will always be someone willing to carry out such a search in return for the money that he or she will be paid.<br/>
In our inner cities especially, in the name of looking for drugs the police can and do stop and search every young black whom they feel like stopping and searching. It follows inevitably from this provision that the police will be able to threaten with an intimate body search every young black whom they pick up whenever they feel like doing so. That is what will flow from this provision.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) talked with relish, as he did in Committee, of the need for intimate body searches. In doing so he demonstrates the low level to which society is descending. I find it appalling that we happily and openly take powers to search forcibly the most intimate parts of the bodies of human beings. We do not appear to justify reluctantly the powers being taken and we hear from Government supporters calls for even more powers so that the police will be able to search forcibly anyone in these intimate places whenever they like.<br/>
There has to be some basic standard of decency. Probing around in the most intimate parts of the bodies of human beings or threatening such probes is indecent. We should not take this power. It is disgraceful and objectionable. I object to it strongly.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, perhaps I may respond to one or two matters raised in the debate.<br/>
I ought perhaps to remind the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) that the amendment approved in the other place was moved by my noble Friend Baroness Masham of Ilton. If my noble Friend had heard the remarks of the hon. Member for Ladywood she would be rightly shocked. It is not an issue which anyone takes any relish in debating or legislating about. It is unfortunately an issue which the length to which members of the criminal fraternity are prepared to go in drug dealing has brought to our attention. We are doing our best in the amendments approved in the other place to solve the problem.<br/>
I wish to comment on three issues raised in the debate. The first refers to class A drugs. By their definition, class A drugs are highly dangerous. There is no doubt that some

are more dangerous than heroin. LSD is an example. As for addictiveness, since the power is restricted to possession with intent to supply in practice it will bite only in the case of drugs which have a market and for which there is a demand.<br/>
Our main concern at the moment is with heroin. But there are other drugs which are also of concern although they are not so common or popular with addicts at present. I have in mind some of the pain-killing drugs&#x2014;the opiates, morphine, pethidine and, of course, cocaine. But there are reasons for saying that the class A drugs are the most dangerous and that those drugs which become marketed as part of the criminal intention to create addiction are the ones which in due course will be covered by police activities in this area.<br/>
As for the BMA, the medical profession has made it clear that doctors can ethically and properly carry out intimate searches to remove articles which pose an immediate threat to the lives of the persons concerned or those guarding them. The BMA has now accepted that, because of the threat posed by heroin to the health of society, it may be right and necessary for doctors to participate in its removal from a suspected dealer. But the amendments are not limited to heroin, because there are other class A drugs, and there can be no logical difference between the removal of one dangerous drug and that of another. Internal concealment and danger to the health of the carrier which is posed by it make the drugs even more dangerous, and we hope that doctors will be able to agree to act upon police requests for assistance.<br/>
The nursing professions have accepted that the voluntary involvement of their members is permissible in the exceptional circumstances for which this power provides. The Royal College of Midwives has not accepted it, but in many cases members of that college are also registered nurses. The Bill makes it clear that the searching for drugs in terms of the intimate search powers will have to be carried out by a registered medical practitioner or a registered nurse.<br/>
My final comment relates to the remarks of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett). The real issue at stake should be the prevention of drugs coming into the country, anyhow. We know that this is a big world-wide traffic. We have to do our best to improve the sources of detection before they reach the market. I assure the House that the Government have taken action in terms of additional customs provision. My right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Health announced recently that 100 new customs posts will be provided to fight drug smuggling alone, that there will be additional customs staff on the Central Drugs Intelligence Unit and that senior customs officers have been posted to Karachi to improve operational intelligence about that market from which so many drugs come. I accept entirely that what has to come about is stifling the trade at birth rather than being involved in pieces of legislation which give no one pleasure when discussing the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill and these amendments.</p>

<p>Clause 54 requires the police to inform the parents or guardian of a juvenile in police detention of his arrest and whereabouts. That duty already exists at present by virtue of section 34 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Clause 54 was intended to update that section. Unfortunately, however, we realised while the Bill was in another place that it did rather more than that. Whereas the 1933 Act obliges the police to take such steps as may be practicable to convey the necessary information, clause 54 as printed imposes an absolute duty. But of course there may be cases where the duty cannot be carried out because the whereabouts of parents are simply not known. Amendments Nos. 179, 180 and 181 accordingly set out what the police practicably can and must do after arresting a juvenile.<br/>
Amendment No. 182 covers the case where a juvenile is in the care not of a local authority but of a voluntary organisation having parental rights and responsibilities for him.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="279044" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-10-25a.886.4" hansard_membership_id="2128" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32908" speakername="Mr. Alex Carlile" colnum="886" time="18:45:00">
<p>I am very concerned abut the earlier part of this set of amendments. In broad terms what is suggested is acceptable and good, sound common sense, but there have been many cases in which the police have said from time to time in evidence, "We would have told the parents," or "We would have told the guardian or foster parents,"&#x2014;such cases often arise&#x2014;"if it had been practicable to do so, but we telephoned their home and they were out." Alternatively, the police might say, "We sent a bobby round to their house, but they were out." Where a child or a young person is taken into custody and often, nowadays, regrettably, charged with an extremely serious offence, it is desirable that the police should take more than merely cursory steps to ascertain the whereabouts of the person responsible for the welfare of the child or young person. Perhaps the Minister will tell us that the Government will issue guidelines and, if so, what guidelines will be issued to ensure that that happens.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="279045" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-10-25a.886.5" hansard_membership_id="6837" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29663" speakername="Mr. Deputy Speaker" colnum="886" time="18:45:00">
<p>Order. Interventions should be brief.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="279046" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-10-25a.886.6" hansard_membership_id="12064" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30222" speakername="Mr. Shaw" colnum="886" time="18:45:00">
<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman is right. There are important distinctions between having a juvenile and having those of more mature years in custody. All that I can do is to assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that the police are to take this duty seriously and that in the case of a juvenile they must take as many practicable steps as possible to inform the next of kin, parent, guardian or person who has responsibility. That is what the amendment is designed to do. There will be guidance on this matter in due course. I must also tell the House, as the hon. and learned Gentleman will probably concede, that the police try extremely hard, when they have young


persons in custody, to find the parents. It is astonishing sometimes how lax parents are about knowing the whereabouts of their children.<br/>
Amendment No. 182 covers the case where a juvenile is in the care not of a local authority but of a voluntary organisation. In such a case it is clearly desirable that the police should have to give the organisation the information required by the clause. The amendment ensures that they will.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="279047" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-10-25a.887.0" hansard_membership_id="5205" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32455" speakername="Mr. Eldon Griffiths" colnum="887" time="18:45:00">
<p>I am glad to support these amendments.<br/>
Often children who come into the custody of the police are terrified of their parents. In some cases children will lie when the police ask them where they belong because they are frightened. Sometimes there is child abuse and child beating. I can only say from personal experience that, although I do not wish to generalise because all generalisations are untrue, there is a remarkable amount of kindness in police stations towards young people&#x2014;terrified children, children who are wet, cold and hungry. Sometimes even when the social workers are on strike the police station is the last recourse, and the police take the children in. They do not have many facilities, but in wide areas of the police force there is such kindness to children, which should be put on record.<br/>
Of course, it is right that the police should get in touch with the parents as soon as possible if they can, but amendment No. 181 is right to insert the words
<q>as soon as it is reasonably practicable".</q>
For my part, I am confident that the police service will do that in the overwhelming majority of cases.<br/>
I should like to ask my hon. Friend about amendment No. 182, which concerns cases when the child or young person is in the care of a voluntary organisation. Manifestly, the same duty must lie upon the police in such cases. One of the problems is that such organisations frequently do not have a night number. For one reason or another, there may be no one on duty or available. I hope that in any guidance or advice by circular to chief officers the Home Office will take account of the fact that not every voluntary organisation which has custody of children is necessarily easy to contact late at night.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="279048" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-10-25a.887.1" hansard_membership_id="4209" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2828" speakername="Mr. Douglas Hogg" colnum="887" time="18:45:00">
<p>The purpose of the amendment is clearly highly desirable. It is also clear, however, that there is no inherent sanction. I appreciate the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) that in some areas some officers may not be so assiduous as others in carrying out this duty. As there are no sanctions attaching to this statutory obligation, it is important that police forces should lay down very careful guidelines as to the steps that officers should take in given circumstances. I am sure that the House will welcome any observations that the Minister can make on that.</p>

<p>The points raised in all three interventions relate to the same matter. I accept that if juveniles are held in custody, the duty on the police to inform those responsible for them must be taken very seriously indeed, and that is how it will be.</p>

<p>These amendments excuse the police from having to record a request for legal advice made by a person already at court. Clause 56(2) rightly requires the police to record a request for advice made by a person who has been arrested and is in custody, but it is frankly not sensible to require them to make a record when the person is already at court. Once there, he is in the custody of the court, whether he is in the court room itself or in the cells below. It is thus for the court and its staff to deal with any request for legal advice, and no useful purpose would be served by a police log. Indeed, it might cause the police some administrative difficulty as the person's custody record would have been left behind at the police station. I hope, therefore, that the House will agree that the amendments are sensible and should be accepted.</p>

<p>Defendants often assert in court that they asked for a solicitor to be called, but that that was not done. One purpose of the custody record is to ensure that any request by the accused for a solicitor is recorded. The amendments will bring about a hiatus&#x2014;a period during which it will be provided that no record should or, indeed, can be kept of such a request. One can foresee the police admitting in court that a request for a solicitor was made, but saying that, as it was made at court, no record was kept, while the defendant claims that the request was made before leaving the police station. The Minister laughs, perhaps with some justification, but I assure him that the criminal mind is well capable of spotting such a problem area and the news gets around quickly, especially in the remand centres. I hope that the Government considered that problem before deciding that this was the appropriate course. If not, perhaps they should think again.</p>

<p>Again, I am in some sympathy with the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile). Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will clarify the position. If a defendant makes a request to the court for a solicitor, that is almost certainly a matter of public record or at least something that can be established. The worrying point, however, is where the request is made after leaving the court because there is then a matter of controversy. If the request is made before going into the court, the defendant can clearly repeat it to the court, so in that case the difficulties are largely overcome. There is a period between the moment when he ceases to be in the court and the moment when he leaves the court building when there is no record and no means of establishing fact.</p>

<p>I am not entirely sure whether I agree with that. If a request is made, albeit in the most informal of


language to the court, the probability is that that request will be acted on either at the behest of the court through the duty solicitor scheme or by some other method.<br/>
I am more concerned with the situation when the defendant has left the court room and gone down to the cells. He could then make a request and, under the amendment, there would be no record of it. Therefore, there is a period which is not covered either by an existing record or by an application to the court. It would be helpful if my hon. Friend the Minister could amplify that matter.</p>

<p>Whether the application has been recorded is not the only question that arises. After all, the purpose of recording whether or when a defendant makes an application for legal advice is to ensure that he or she should get legal advice when it is required. Has the Home Office given its mind to the substance of the problem rather than to the formalities? One of the Bill's difficulties is that it will result in a great deal of paperwork. We are concentrating here on the paperwork side. When a defendant goes to court, it is all very well to say, as my hon. Friend the Minister did, that he is in the custody of the court and therefore it is the court staff who should see that the defendant has access to legal advice, but my experience is that in the courts any prisoner might well be forgiven for not realising whether he is in the custody of the court or of the police. The person whom the prisoner is likely to ask to provide him with legal advice is the police officer.<br/>
What is the real justification for that lacuna when one tests it as a matter of practicality? I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will go into this in some detail. In the course of his period at the Home Office he will no doubt have had to visit a number of courts and probably the passages and spaces between the prison and the court. Perhaps my hon. Friend will tell us whether he has had to visit Strangeways where there is, or used to be, a passage between the prison and the court. If the application is made in the course of passing through that passage, at what point does the matter have to be recorded? I see hon. Members laughing, but it is a serious problem, and I must ask my hon. Friend the Minister to give his views on it.</p>

<p>I acknowledge the points made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Lyell). It is an important point despite its amusing aspects. We must realise that the magistrates courts are not courts of record. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) expects that if such a request were made in court it would be noted somewhere, my experience is that whatever is said in court is noted nowhere and that nobody knows what goes on in court. I have had the experience in a magistrates court of calling two or three people from such courts to say what went on only to be given two or three different versions.<br/>
We cannot be satisfied about what goes on in the court. There is a gap. It would be easy for my hon. Friend the Minister to speak to the Attorney-General and consider whether the magistrates' courts could not be asked to make a record of any request made in the court. That would be a small amendment and would present no problem.<br/>
The court officials have to give written reasons when applications for bail are refused. The change which I envisage would be only an extension of that duty, and it would be quite within the capabilities of a clerk to the

court. This is an important gap and one that should&#x2014;if I may use a term from the world of advertising&#x2014;be bridged.</p>

<p>We have had an intellectual debate of the highest order on something which the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) has described as a significant matter of substance, but which has also been aptly described as that woolly animal, the lacuna.<br/>
I can offer some advice to my hon. Friends who are concerned. There are clauses in the Bill which provide for the establishment of custody officers. At long last, the situation is much more precise. So long as the prisoner is in the custody of the police, a direct record will be kept of all that is involved in the progress of his case. The purpose of the custody record is to record the person's treatment while he remains within police custody. As I understand it, once he arrives at the court he moves out of the custody of the police and into direct supervision of the court. The hiatus which worried the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery does not exist. The prisoner moves from one direct form of supervision to another.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Leicestershire, North-West (Mr. Ashby) pointed out, the problem is that the court is very lax in the supervision of the details of administration in regard to those within its jurisdiction at any time. That is a matter which I would have to draw to the attention of my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor if the House wished me to pursue it, because it is not a matter which is directly related to the Bill.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) referred to the time when the prisoner moves from the court. Surely the prisoner either leaves the court to go back into police custody&#x2014;in which case the custody officer resumes his duties&#x2014;or he goes to prison or, presumably, he is put at liberty.</p>

<p>The hiatus arises when the prisoner leaves the court room and, for example, goes downstairs to the cells. He may stay there for a couple of hours. During that time he has not left the court but he has left the court room. That is the hiatus.</p>

<p>I am not as proficient in the matter of law as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham, but I assume that, when he goes downstairs, the prisoner remains within the jurisdiction of the court in so far as the court takes responsibility for all that happens within the building. If that is the case, if the prisoner has made a request to see a solicitor, for instance, the court officers should make a record of the fact.</p>

<p>Although when he is in the cells underneath the court room the prisoner is still at a court, he is guarded by the police officers who brought him from the police station and will take him back again. There is no court officer or prison officer there to whom the prisoner could make such a request. He is in police custody, because he has been remanded in police custody from the court room, but he is still at a court. There should be provision for a request to see a solicitor to be recorded if it is made in that situation.</p>

<p>I appreciate the hon. and learned Gentleman's clarification. If that is seen to be a serious gap in the provisions about access to lawyers or the maintenance of records, it should be considered and


rectified. However, what we are discussing is the role within the Bill of police custody and its relationship to a person who is, for the purposes of a hearing, already transferred to court. The amendments make it clear that, in that case, no useful purpose would be served by the maintenance of a police log. The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) has said that there is a gap. It requires observation. I note that and perhaps in the meanwhile the House will agree with the Lords in the said amendment.</p>

<p>I tried to emphasise that people need legal advice when they get to court. The Bill is designed to protect people when they are kept in custody for a long time but its provisions are irrelevant if a case comes on quickly. In those circumstances, ensuring that people who need legal advice get it is most relevant. There is a gap in the provisions that ensure that people who need legal advice get it and have their requests recorded. My hon. Friend appears not to have dealt with that issue. He says that it will be dealt with by the court. The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) and my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) have rightly observed that such a person will be in the custody of the police. I appreciate that it is difficult for my hon. Friend the Minister to amend at this stage but perhaps he could have the matter looked into and comment on it briefly now.</p>

<p>I am grateful for my hon. and learned Friend's intervention. The role of the custody officer and the maintenance of a prisoner's contacts and requests should be ordered properly and a log should be kept. I agree that if, on transfer to court, there is a gap in the provision of access or in the recording of requests, the matter is primarily one for the court authority. If it fails to do that, we should have to consider amending the guidance notes that are given to the police, if that would help alleviate the problem. We should examine that after the new provisions have been in practice for some time.</p>

<p>The amendments replace the provisions in clause 56 (19) to (22) relating to legal aid with a new clause. Provision is made for solicitors' clerks to act under the scheme and for those at a police station voluntarily to receive the assistance under the scheme. Other minor drafting amendments are also made.<br/>
The amendments transfer the provisions of clause 56 (19) to (22) into a new clause and extend their scope. The provisions deal with the making of arrangements&#x2014;duty solicitors' schemes&#x2014;to provide advice and assistance at public expense to persons at police stations, so making fully effective the right to legal advice conferred by clause 56(1). The new clause differs from subsections (19) to (22) in some important respects. First, it provides for solicitors' representatives to be permitted to act under the arrangements where necessary. Second, it extends the scope of the free schemes to those who are at police stations voluntarily as well as those who are there under arrest. That is an important new provision which will help to ensure that there is no grey area between liberty and detention and that persons who are at police stations under caution, but not under arrest, are indeed there voluntarily and not under a form of disguised compulsion.</p>

<p>I hope that the House will warmly endorse the amendments. The Bill has been criticised for being too oppressive, but the amendment is a good example of how the Bill has enlarged the rights of people who are in police custody.<br/>
I particularly welcome two aspects mentioned by my hon. Friend the Minister of State. First, the amendment enables representatives of solicitors to act under the Legal Aid Act 1982. If advice is always to be available, it is desirable that solicitors' representatives should be permitted to act, because it is not always possible for solicitors to be present. If we are to give full expression to the purpose of legal aid, representatives should be permitted to act.<br/>
The even more important advance is that the amendment applies to those who are voluntarily at a police station. It is often said that those who are attending "voluntarily" are under some form of compulsion, but the Government have gone a long way towards ensuring that everyone attending a police station is either under arrest or attending truly voluntarily. In the latter circumstance, legal aid is available and those people can discover their rights. The amendments are a valuable extension to civil rights and the Government deserve our congratulations.</p>

<p>I concur with what my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) said about the substance of the amendments, but the wording leaves much to be desired. New subsection (1A) in amendment No. 191 consists of 97 words and refers to solicitors designated by reference to other types of solicitors.<br/>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify something about the types of solicitors referred to? It will be noted that someone may find a solicitor available and then discover that that solicitor is precluded from giving him advice because he is not a solicitor of the type specifically referred to in the new subsection.<br/>
The new clause states:
<q>A scheme under section 15 of the principal Act which relates to advice and representation at magistrates' courts may provide that arrangements made under it may be so framed as to preclude solicitors from providing such advice and representation if they do not also provide advice and assistance in pursuance of arrangements made by virtue of the scheme under that section which relates to the provision of advice and assistance for persons such as are mentioned in section 29 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and for persons arrested and held in cusiody.</q>
It is clear that section 29 refers to people who are arrested other than at police stations. But I hope that my hon. Friend will carefully consider how one is to recognise that the solicitor from whom one wishes to seek advice is or is not one who also provides advice and assistance
<q>in pursuance of arrangements made by virtue of the scheme under that section which relates to the provisions of advice and assistance for persons such as are mentioned in section 29".</q>
I see my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) in his place and perhaps he can give my hon. Friend the Minister some guidance if he does not have a note in front of him. But it would seem that there are considerable practical difficulties in placing this restriction. If my hon. Friend the Minister can explain how one identifies whether the solicitor available is entitled to give advice under this rather complex section, I should be grateful if he could then explain what rationale precludes a solicitor who is not prepared to give advice to those not arrested at police stations from giving advice under subsection (1A). Normally, amendments from the other place are very carefully thought out, and I therefore accept that there may be a sound rationale. Indeed, I look in the direction from which it might be forthcoming. However, at present I find it difficult to understand what it is. Perhaps other hon. Members can help. But failing that I should be most grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister could enlighten me before the provision is enacted.</p>

<p>The main point at issue is, of course, the range of solicitors from which the prisoner may choose to take legal advice at the point at which he continues in police custody. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Lyell) is right to say that that brings into play the question of the legal profession's range of services which are available to the prisoner at any given time. Perhaps I can couch my answer in terms of the 24-hour duty solicitor scheme, as that represents for most people the most effective way of obtaining legal advice that they wish to have, and for which&#x2014;under clause 56&#x2014;we are making provision.<br/>
Some doubts have been raised about the extent of the Government's commitments to the successful operation of duty solicitor schemes, but the facts simply do not bear that out. The provision contained in clause 58 providing a statutory right to legal advice for those arrested and held in custody, reinforced by the extensions of rights to advice

contained in the statutory code of practice, represent an important consolidation of the existing position, and an improvement upon it.<br/>
The Government have recognised that there would be considerable difficulty in attempting to make the rights as newly set out in the Bill effective using the existing legal aid provisions, since advice will need to be quickly and simply available throughout the 24 hours of the day. We have therefore attempted to assist the legal profession to meet the new demands on its resources&#x2014;my hon. and learned Friend was right to say that by virtue of the provision there will be increased demands upon it&#x2014;by explicitly extending the Law Society's powers to enable it to make specific arrangements for duty solicitor schemes, and giving the committees that will administer them a discretion to link membership with the existing schemes at magistrates' courts to help with manpower.<br/>
9.30 pm<br/>
Considerable changes have been made in the usual requirements on the financial limits for eligibility and liability to contribute because of the special circumstances in which the advice will be sought. Additional financial provision has already been made in forward estimates towards the likely cost of the schemes. The Government have demonstrated their willingness to respond to helpful criticism by amending the original form of the legislation to enable the schemes to provide fully for those who are not under arrest.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend should be reassured that the changes to the duty schemes and the provisions made with the Law Society's agreement go a long way towards providing the legal support and aid for persons in detention which is the bedrock of this clause.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for that answer, which clarifies the position. Am I right to espy what might be described as beneficent restrictive practice?<br/>
I shall not elaborate at too much length, but it seems clear that those solicitors who take the trouble to provide the 24-hour service will have reserved for them the right to give advice which people need during that period and that other solicitors who happen to be around will not be able to benefit.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The amendment is important. It allows a refusal to give an intimate sample to be used by the prosecution as the basis from which inferences can be drawn, those inferences to be capable to amounting to corroboration.<br/>
Hon. Members will, I trust, forgive me if I explain at some length the rationale behind this amendment to a clause which deals with a sensitive and difficult subject&#x2014;the taking of intimate samples. At present, refusal to provide an intimate sample may, if it has been possible to bring a case before the court, be referred to as part of the prosecution evidence. If the defendant exercises his right not to give evidence at the trial that is all that can be said. Even if he does give evidence and is cross-examined on why he refused, the prosecution has to recognise that he is entitled to refuse.<br/>
Hon. Members will recall that it was agreed by the House that the present position should be altered by providing that consent to the taking of an intimate sample must be in writing in accordance with one of the main objectives of the Bill, which is to move towards carefully recorded investigations and more formal opportunities for the accused person to exercise his rights. But the requirement for written consent creates the difficulty that it may encourage the guilty to refuse, secure in the knowledge that if they are eventually brought to trial they will be at no disadvantage for having refused to cooperate. Hon. Members will know that it is often in relation to offences of the greatest gravity, of which rape or sexual assault on a child are obvious examples, that the evidence obtained from an intimate sample is most likely to be relevant.<br/>
The problem is how to ensure, so far as can be done by acceptable means, that refusal of consent does not give the guilty a virtual immunity from prosecution where the case requires evidence of that sort. The House will recall that when that was discussed in Committee there was wide support from all parties for a provision suggested by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) that refusal to give a sample without good cause should be capable of corroborating the prosecution case. That is exactly what the amendment provides, as agreed to in another place. That means that it would be for the jury to determine the weight to attach to a refusal, which we believe is the best way of providing for the wide variety of motives&#x2014;some, of course, wholly innocent&#x2014;which might be behind a refusal to provide an intimate sample.<br/>
The person asked for an intimate sample might be drunk and belligerent, or he might simply be afraid of the process.<br/>
If that were explained at any subsequent trial, the jury might attach little significance to the refusal. On the other hand, where it was thought that the suspect refused because he had something to hide, the jury would be allowed to take the refusal into account as evidence against him.</p>

<p>I cannot answer my hon. Friend's question now, but will do so in due course.<br/>
I should explain to hon. Members why the amendment refers in particular to the refusal to corroborate the prosecution case. As hon. Members will know, in general the English law does not require corroboration; if testimony is given by a single witness who is believed, that is generally sufficient. In all trials for sexual offences, however, which as I have said are amongst those where, typically, evidence from an intimate sample may be crucial, the judge is obliged to warn the jury that it is unsafe to convict solely on the evidence of the complainant. If the complainant's evidence is not corroborated, a charge of rape, for example, may well fail.<br/>
In those circumstances, it seemed to the Committee of this House, and to the Committee in another place, important that it should be open to the jury, if it thinks fit, to attach virtually the same weight to the refusal as it would to evidence from an intimate sample that directly implicated the defendant. I hope that the House will agree to the amendment.</p>

<p>We have come a long way in this clause. In the early 1960s, when I was first called to the Bar, we had drunken driving offences. The new breathaliser laws were introduced by Barbara Castle, and I remember the uproar throughout the country because someone was being forced to give evidence against himself, which was contrary to the law as we knew it. Any refusal to give a sample was construed in the same way as this amendment will be construed&#x2014;against the defendant. It was justified because there was a great deal of drinking and driving that resulted in accidents and deaths. It was thought to be a motoring offence rather than a serious offence that would involve the liberty of the subject.<br/>
This clause is to be used for criminal, not driving, offences and therefore involves the liberty of the subject. Hitherto, people had been allowed the right to silence. Hitherto, a defendant had been allowed to say to a police officer, "You make these allegations against me, so you must prove them." Now the police officer can say, "We want to take a sample from you and if you refuse to give one that can be taken as evidence against you and the jury can consider that evidence."</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has made an important statement&#x2014;that a police officer can tell the defendant that a refusal wall constitute corroborative evidence against him. I was searching for that provision in the Bill, and if my hon. Friend can find it, that would be a great help.</p>

<p>The provision is not in the Bill. My hon. Friend raised a point with my hon. Friend the Minister


earlier about an officer warning a motorist that refusal to give a sample could result in that being used as evidence against the motorist, but that point does not appear in the Bill. However, it is contained in a printed form which police officers have as part of their administrative duties. The form sets out the formula through which they have to go when somebody is breathalysed under the Road Traffic Acts. I foresee that, as a result of the Bill, the form that the police use at the station will be a complex but readily understood document that will go from one stage to the next. I hope that it will contain some formula along the lines of the station sheet for motoring offences. The arrested person will have to give a sample, but if he does not it will be construed as evidence against him.<br/>
That is the simple way to do it and I expect that the Home Office will produce such a document. Legislation is not needed for such a form, but I hope that one will be incorporated. There must be a personal station sheet that will have such directions for the police officer, custody officer or whoever is responsible. The officer will be able to go through the formula from one stage to the next, so no mistakes will be made. There has been much talk about the complexities of this Act, but I think that in practice there will not be so many complexities if the Home Office considers carefully, as no doubt it will, the way to provide the best kind of station sheet, and one that will be uniform for everyone.<br/>
We are taking a serious step with this clause. It touches on a fundamental point to do with the way in which British justice is administered. No man should have to give evidence against himself. Some of the offshoots of British law, such as American law, enshrine such a right in the constitution. If this clause were enacted in the United States of America, there would be a furore.</p>

<p>Is not my hon. Friend in a dilemma? On the one hand he said that this is a profound move that greatly diminishes the rights of the individual, while on the other hand he says that it is sufficient, by a procedural device, to introduce the principle that refusal to give a sample will be corroborative evidence. If there is such a profound change, should there not be a statutory requirement, if not in this Act at a later stage, to bring to the notice of a defendant the fact that refusal will be used as corroborative evidence?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend should be addressing that question to the Minister, and I am not the Minister. If it was considered in 1967 that such a provision did not require a legislative basis, there will not be any more need for it in 1984 when we have seen so much erosion of our rights and civil liberties. It is now becoming accepted practice that failure to give evidence can be taken as evidence against someone. I suppose that I must accept that at the end of the day, but I hope that the House will be fully aware of what it is being asked to accept. It must understand that it is being asked fundamentally to change the criminal law.</p>

<p>The amendment represents an important change in the law and it is one which I welcome, subject to the proviso that I have just made to my hon. Friend the Minister of State. In the generality of cases, intimate samples will be taken only when the person concerned is accused of a serious offence; for example, rape. We have been reminded that the consent must be in writing. It would be intolerable if a suspected person could frustrate the process of the law by refusing to give consent without there being any sanction attached to that refusal. It would be especially intolerable in cases such as rape, where there are frequently very few witnesses, and sometimes only the complainant, and, as a matter of principle, the complainant's evidence must be corroborated.<br/>
Once the requirement of consent is introduced the individual is being given the opportunity, unless we accept the amendment, of frustrating the main thrust of the Bill. Therefore, I welcome the proposition that a refusal to give consent should be treated as corroborative evidence. That is extremely sensible. I for one have never believed in the rule of silence. If a defendant refuses to give evidence, that, too, should be corroborative.<br/>
I am concerned that there is nothing in the Bill or the amendment to bring this important exception to the individual's attention. My hon. Friend the Member for Leicestershire, North-West (Mr. Ashby) knows all about the 1967 legislation, but not everyone who appears in a police station has that knowledge. Moreover, my hon. Friend relies on the pro forma document, but those who appear in police stations are often confused, drunk or in some other way incapable. I would not expect them to read the pro forma document, and in the confusion of the moment the police officer might not make the requirement absolutely clear.<br/>
If we are to change the law in such a marked way, the consequences of not giving consent should be brought to the attention of the person required to give it. I am not going to stand in the way of the passage of the amendment, but I shall be greatly comforted if the Minister will say that he regards my point as important, that he will reflect upon it and that if necessary he will consider what legislative steps can be taken in another place or on another occasion to meet it.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has told us that he has never believed in the rule of silence. I must welcome his voice back to the Chamber, he having drifted in and out of Hades. Now that he is no longer a Whip, he is making substantial contributions to our debates.<br/>
My hon. Friend is saying that there must be more provision in the Bill to warn someone that corroboration might be created if he refuses to consent to give a sample. Is he not tilting at a windmill? A person must be warned if it is an offence to refuse to give a sample, as in the drink-driving legislation. The amendment states:
<q>Where the appropriate consent to the taking of an intimate sample from a person was refused without good cause".</q>
Surely it would be the best possible cause for establishing grounds for a refusal if an ignorant person were not told that if he refused to give the sample some harm might befall him. Furthermore, the amendment goes on to say, not that that refusal is an offence, but that the court
<q>may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper".</q>


Is there not, on the face of the amendment, an adequate deterrent to a charge being based upon the failure to allow the intimate search, when it is clear that such a charge will not prevail because of the absence of good cause and because of the court's discretion to deal with the matter as is proper in all the circumstances?</p>

<p>My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Burton (Mr. Lawrence) made an intervention which appeared to be a speech. If I make a speech which appears to be an intervention, I hope that there will not be any objections.<br/>
I am surprised at how long the defendant's right to obstruct the course of justice by refusing to provide an intimate sample has survived in our law. I think that any outside observer would be amazed to learn that that measure has not been laid to rest before now. I therefore welcome the amendment. Although my hon. Friend the Minister of State appears to be impressed by the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg), I hope that, on more mature reflection, he will not allow himself to be persuaded by them.<br/>
If we accept my hon. Friend's suggestion and reach the stage where a defendant has to be warned that failure to supply an intimate sample is capable of being regarded as corroboration, where does the argument stop? In justice,

should the defendant not be warned also that if he tells a deliberate lie that is capable of being corrobation? Should he not be dissuaded from indulging in all sorts of other conduct which under present law is capable of being regarded as corroboration? On mature reflection, my hon. Friend the Minister may come to the conclusion that the amendment as drafted amounts to sufficient justice and may be well advised to leave it exactly where it is.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I respond to the cogent point of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) with support from other of my hon. Friends?<br/>
I make no apology for describing the amendment as important. The debate has made that abundantly clear. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham asked whether the person from whom the sample was requested was to be informed of the possibility that a refusal would be put in evidence. That is not plain on the face of the Bill, as my hon. Friend pointed out. I can give him the reassurance that he seeks. We intend to include this reference in the next draft of the code of practice. It will require the police to warn a suspect of the consequences of refusal.<br/>
The suggestion that a warning be prescribed came not just from my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham but from the Lambeth police community consultative group which has made a substantial and praiseworthy contribution to the improvement of the Bill. I give my hon. Friend the assurance that he seeks, and I assure the House that if it accepts the amendment, as I trust it will, it will be accompanied by at least a definition that the corroborative quality of the refusal will be notified to the person making it.</p>

<p>I am grateful for this opportunity to debate the effects being felt by the recipients of benefit as a result of the current industrial dispute at the DHSS centre at Newcastle. Since I intend to concentrate on the national impact of the strike, it would be churlish and wrong to deny the local Member of Parliament, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), an opportunity to intervene in this brief debate if he sought to do so and was lucky enough to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.<br/>
I am aware that the Minister will have to tread with trepidation and be extremely careful about how he words any remarks of his in response to the debate. I understand that the current negotiations between the Department and the two unions, the Civil and Public Services Association and the Society of Civil and Public Servants, are adjourned. Although a date has not been fixed for the resumption of the negotiations, I am confident that there is still an opportunity to resolve the dispute by negotiation, and certainly that is the solution sought by right hon. and hon. Members on the Liberal Bench.<br/>
I wrote to the Minister on 12 October asking a series of questions. I do not want to elaborate too much on the difficulties of the current negotiations, because they are extremely delicate. However, some elaboration of them would help, since I for one have found it difficult to make a judgment of the issues involved because of the failure to make much of the information public. This is the first chance that the Minister will have had, at least in debate, to air some of the issues, and in this debate I ask him to address his mind to a couple of the questions that I put to him in my letter. If he feels that he cannot deal with them tonight, perhaps he will be prepared to do so in due course by a written answer or in reply to my letter.<br/>
I have visited the strike centre and, although I was not there for long, it appeared to me that these were ordinary people who were worried about their working conditions. There was no evidence that I could see of any Left-wing militancy or of any other influences. It seemed to me to be a perfectly straightforward dispute.<br/>
One of the questions raised with me during my visit and one that requires an answer is why the Government set about their reorganisation on the basis of an organisation and methods report which did not involve the trade unions in its compilation. That seems to be the industrial relations of the Stone Age. If important and swingeing changes in work procedures are to be introduced, it is quite wrong that the report from which they stem should not involve the trade unions at an early stage.<br/>
I know that the details are complicated, but I should be obliged if the Minister would confirm that the new shift system, as well as having the potential of reducing shift allowances, interferes with the possibility of shift workers anticipating their work schedules week on week for the future. In the one-in-three shift system it is possible for a shift worker to say when he will be at work and when he will not be. I understand that in a one-in-five shift system it is impossible for him to say what shifts in the near future he will be asked to work.<br/>
I have not seen the Government's response to the union's claim that there are other ways of making substantial savings&#x2014;almost the &#x00A3;700,000 that the Minister is looking for with his shift rota changes. The unions seem to think that they can save &#x00A3;610,000 by making savings outside the proposed changes in the shift allowance. Before trying to make any objective judgment I should like to hear the Government's view. These are fairly low-paid workers, and if there were a change in the shift allowance it would require a reduction in the wage packets of some of them of about &#x00A3;10 to &#x00A3;14 a week. That is a considerable sum in their terms.<br/>
There is confusion in regard to the cost to the public purse, which is an important factor in the dispute. The official spokesman for the Opposition, with his characteristic hyperbole, suggested that the dispute was costing &#x00A3;100 million a year. I do not know whether that is a correct figure. He said that it had cost &#x00A3;43 million to date and that it would continue to cost a further &#x00A3;2 million a week.<br/>
Apart form the cost of the additional post office staff, there must be additional overtime and bonus payments to the DHSS staff at Newcastle. The cost must be extensive, although I am prepared to believe that it is a good deal less than &#x00A3;100 million. The Minister is hoping to make savings. If one believes the union, the figure is about &#x00A3;50,000; according to the Department, it is about &#x00A3;700,000. The saving is relatively small in relation to the large sums of money being spent in the course of a long and intractable dispute.<br/>
The dispute started in November 1983. As soon as the organisation and management report was produced, there was a work to rule, and a full strike began on 14 May 1984. Clearly, the Government have been guilty, prima facie, of ham-fisted industrial relations. However, I do not know the details and I accept that it may be sensible for the Minister to reply at a later stage to the points raised.<br/>
The social services correspondent of <i>The Guardian</i> estimates that it may take until the year 2014 before there are any savings to be made over and above the additional costs, if the dispute is not ended soon.<br/>
The effect of the dispute on the Post Office was made clear to all hon. Members in a letter dated 9 October from the managing director of the counter services of the Post Office. He made several cogent points to which I should like to refer. The Post Office, whom I consulted today on the matter, said that the current price for the emergency payment for each stamp has not yet been negotiated between the Post Office and the DHSS. Some press reports say that the price is 38p and some say it is 50p. The Post Office, if I understood correctly this afternoon, said that the fee had not yet been negotiated. Therefore, it may well be that the Government do not yet know what the cost will prove to be in the fullness of time.<br/>
There are 20,600 post offices and at the end of last week they were processing manually 4&#x00B7;65 million pension books. That is producing intolerable strains on the post office network. I am sure that the Minister is aware that the Post Office is required to take action to keep on stream some of the sub-post offices and other Crown offices that it was intended to close. The Post Office is now having to go back to sub-postmasters and others and ask them to stay on until they can cope with the damage caused by the dispute. I am in favour of keeping sub-post offices open but not in the way that the Government are operating.<br/>
I was told by the Post Office that, even if the dispute were to be resolved tomorrow, it would take until February 1986 before the mess was sorted out at the post office level. That is a very long time.<br/>
The most worrying aspect is the effect on the people who are suffering as a result of the dispute. I am sure that the Minister will confirm that the dispute is affecting retirement pensions, national insurance, widows' benefit, child benefit, and child special allowance. The worst effects are being felt by people in those categories, particularly in relation to the procedures for claiming pensions for those who are overseas, ill or on holiday.<br/>
The Government have undertaken a fairly extensive campaign of press advertising, and I agree that it was the only way to handle the situation in the prevailing circumstances.<br/>
I have had correspondence in my postbag, particularly from Scotland&#x2014;I am sure that other hon. Members have heard similar stories&#x2014;about the difficulties and distress caused by some of the emergency procedures. That is happening willy nilly. It is inevitable that if we operate emergency procedures there will be difficulties. I am told by Age Concern that some pensioners have not received benefits for many weeks. I have not been able to corroborate any cases myself, but there are difficulties. I am told that in Scotland about 3,500 new pensioners are also in difficulties because they must go through the emergency procedure of going to the DHSS office. Even some dead pensioners are still getting books. All those anomalies and difficulties are being thrown up as a result of the manual emergency payment procedure.<br/>
The real difficulty is that only one payment per week can be made through the emergency procedure so that people who have been accustomed to storing up three or four payments and collecting them every month are no longer able to do so while the strike continues. That is causing a great deal of distress and hardship. Evidence of that has been sent to me through my constituency and contacts up and down the country as I am the spokeman for my party.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I agree with all the points that he has raised so far. I also thank him for raising this important matter on the Adjournment.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is right to stress the hardship that the dispute is causing. I should like to make a point on behalf of the constituents whom I represent, as the dispute is taking place in my constituency. It was caused by a management review of the shift working of computer operators at Washington and Longbenton, the Newcastle branch of the DHSS. It particularly affected the automatic process workers. The key recommendations of the management review are contained in paragraph 24 of its very full report. The crux of the recommendations was that the shift times be altered, particularly so that the computer operators finished before 12&#x00B7;30. That has a peculiar effect on Civil Service terms and conditions&#x2014;it claws back part of the bonus that forms part of the remuneration of the employees. I should like to give the House an example of what that would mean in practice to a constituent of mine. A junior data processor who is paid &#x00A3;120 a week top line&#x2014;his gross wage&#x2014;would suffer a reduction by 9&#x00B7;5 per


cent. to &#x00A3;110&#x00B7;50. My constituents, not unreasonably, and like everybody else in the world, do not want to take a reduction in their wages.<br/>
Like the hon. Gentleman, I have visited the workers at the strike centre. They are not on high wages or a group of people noted for their industrial militancy. Some have told me rather bitterly that they voted Conservative at the last election and will not do so again. They do not want to cause all the difficulties that are being caused by the dispute. They feel strongly that they want to help pensioners and those in receipt of child benefit, but&#x2014;this is the crucial point&#x2014;they do not want to take a wage cut. The industrial action that they are taking is symptomatic of the increasing resentment and desperation that are being felt not just by the workers at Longbenton but by the whole community in the north-east of England. They feel that their community is being killed off by several aspects of Government policy and that the Government's behaviour is mean and irrational.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that constructive intervention, which adds positively to my argument.<br/>
The purpose of the debate for all Opposition Members is basically to seek two assurances from the Minister. First, will he give a categorical assurance that the upratings due on 26 November will be paid in full, on time and with precision? The whole country needs that assurance and should accept nothing less. Secondly, will the Minister take charge of the negotiations as soon as possible, personally if need be, to bring this intractable dispute to a speedy conclusion?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) not just for choosing this important subject for debate but perhaps even more, in the present circumstances, for the very moderate, reasonable and sensible way in which he recognised the difficulties that I face while negotiations are going on.<br/>
There is no doubt that this is an important matter which has given rise to a good deal of anxiety among pensioners. If nothing else, today's debate gives me the opportunity to convey to the two hon. Members who have spoken and to the House in general the best assurance that I can give&#x2014;that we expect the uprating to be carried out on time and accurately in the vast majority of cases. Clearly I cannot give a 100 per cent. guarantee about this uprating or indeed any uprating because the size of the problem means that there are bound to be errors in almost any circumstances. Nevertheless, we are confident that for the vast majority the uprating will be accurate and on time.</p>

<p>And the Christmas bonus. I shall have more to say about that in a moment.<br/>
Before dealing with the specific details of the uprating, it is appropriate for me to say something about the background to the dispute, although my comments will naturally be cautious in the context of the current negotiations.<br/>
As has been pointed out, the dispute arose due to management plans to change the shift working arrangements in the computer operations area so as to improve efficiency, make better use of equipment and meet current and emerging operational requirements. The need for change was brought to notice in a report by a routine internal audit which questioned the arrangements which then existed. In response to the auditor's questioning, management initiated a review which found that the arrangements that had been in operation since the early 1970s were no longer appropriate to current operational needs. At this stage, I merely say that, in my view, no responsible Government could or should ignore evidence that such an important complex in the social security system was not being run as efficiently and economically as possible.<br/>
Briefly, the proposed changes involved the introduction in some areas of a rotating night shift to meet changing operational requirements arising, for example, from the increasing number of pensioners and to do so in a way which made the fullest use of very expensive computer equipment. In other areas, an existing night shift which had proved unnecessary in the light of experience with new equipment would be discontinued. Some shift starting and finishing times would also be adjusted so as to end the situation in which staff on evening shifts receive a full night shift allowance although working only until shortly after 12.30 am.<br/>
The total effect of the changes would be to save the taxpayer an estimated &#x00A3;700,000 per year as well as ensuring a fully efficient service to beneficiaries. Those savings would derive from three main elements. The work would be done by fewer staff, expensive overtime working would be eliminated in some areas and reduced in others&#x2014;an objective that we share with the unions&#x2014;and there would be less expenditure on shift allowances.<br/>
On the subject of union involvement at the outset, I should add that there are procedures governing this. They involved notification to the unions that the examination by the management services people was to begin and copies of the report were supplied to the unions before any communication was made to the individual staff involved. That was both sensible and fulfilled our obligations.<br/>
We commenced negotiations with the unions in January this year. They were continuing when the unions broke them off and called for a strike from 14 May. The numbers on strike have varied a little over the intervening period, but there are currently 379 of the computer operations staff in the shift working areas on strike, together with 114 staff who are in associated areas but not affected directly by the shift working proposals. To put that into perspective, that total of fewer than 500 is only a tiny minority of the overall staff at Newcastle central office which numbers some 10,500 in all.<br/>
I can tell the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), that we have always been aware that for a small minority of the shift workers the changes would mean, other things being equal, a loss of take-home pay. Throughout we have been anxious to negotiate transitional arrangements which would safeguard those shift workers' earnings. The offer that has been on the table for months means that no existing shift worker who accepted the new arrangements need lose any take-home pay. I cannot emphasise that too strongly. We are and have been


concerned about the position of our staff and shift workers need not lose any take-home pay as a result of our proposals.<br/>
Indeed, in our efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement we have always been more than willing to talk to the unions. Perhaps the most striking evidence of that was the previously unprecedented step in the Civil Service of involving the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service when our officials spent some 15 hours attempting to find a way to settle the dispute.<br/>
Those proposals which have been on the table for many months concerning transitional protection, the need for which we have consistently recognised, go significantly further than the existing negotiated arrangements nationally for transitional protection in such circumstances. I do not accept that management and Ministers have been intransigent either in what we have offered or in the way in which we have been willing to talk, in particular by being willing to accept conciliation through ACAS.<br/>
We have reaffirmed our willingness to resume negotiations on many occasions since the ACAS discussions. We have demonstrated that again by our response to the unions' recent request for further talks. Those negotiations started yesterday, as has been recognised, and are continuing. Therefore, the House will understand that in the circumstances it is not right to say more tonight about the points which are themselves issued in those negotiations.<br/>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire referred to costs. It is difficult at the moment to be sure about precisely what the costs are, for reasons which he touched on. First, the exact arrangements with the Post Office for the emergency arrangements remain to be fully negotiated. Therefore, I cannot be certain what those costs will be. Secondly, quite a lot of overtime is being worked. One of the ironies of the dispute is that the pay of DHSS staff is operated by the computers which are not operating&#x2014;indeed, the pay of DHSS Ministers as well. Because the computer is not working normally we have had to make emergency arrangements for pay and therefore we are also in a difficult position to estimate precisely the cost of the dispute. There are inescapable uncertainties. I can only say that on the best estimates that we can make at the moment the figure of &#x00A3;100 million which has been quoted is about three times higher than what we would estimate.</p>

<p>I apologise for not being here for the beginning of my hon. Friend's speech, but I was otherwise engaged. If by any chance those who are paying themselves what they hope is too little are paying themselves too much, will the Minister be gentle in asking them to pay back what they have overpaid themselves over, say, six months or a year? I know that this is a matter of great concern to DHSS employees who are having to assess themselves.</p>

<p>I hope that I shall not find myself in that position. We shall wish to be as helpful as possible in dealing with any difficulties which may emerge after the dispute. We would need to deal with the matter case by case. However, I believe that our handling of the dispute has been very reasonable, and I can assure my hon. Friend

that we would seek to be reasonable in any such problems which may affect our own staff, or indeed social security beneficiaries, in the afterrnath of the dispute.<br/>
Even if the dispute ended now, it would be long past the stage when the uprating could be carried out by normal methods. I shall explain how the main categories concerned will be dealt with.<br/>
There are 7 million pensioners and 7 million recipients of child benefit whose payments are normally made by order book issued from Newcastle, and who are currently being paid by the Post Office on the stub of an expired order book. For those cases, new covers have been prepared showing the new rates coming into operation during the week beginning 26 November. Those covers have all been printed. Most of them have been enveloped, and they will be sent out to post offices and attached to the stubs of the old books between now and mid-November. Anyone who holds the stub of an old order book which does not show the new rate and had not has a new cover attached to it by 19 November should get in touch with the local DHSS office. Those arrangements are being publicised by advertisements in the press and posters in post offices. Hon. Members may have seen the first advertisements which appeared just over a week ago.<br/>
Secondly, there are 1&#x00B7;6 million supplementary pensioners paid on order books issued manually by local DHSS offices. They will continue to get their new books in the normal way, and in their case the uprating will proceed as usual. We have been able to issue the necessary information from Newcastle to make sure that the retirement pension element of their payments can be accurately calculated.<br/>
Thirdly, there is a substantial group of beneficiaries who are paid either by automatic credit transfer through the banks or by payable orders sent out from Newcastle. There are about 600,000 to 700,000 on ACT, about 430,000 on payable orders in Britain and about another 300,000 overseas. Those are the cases for which it is most difficult for us to make adequate emergency arrangements, because we have had no reliable means of identifying the beneficiaries being paid by that means.<br/>
We remain confident that in most cases we will be able to carry out the uprating: effectively. Most of the pensioners involved have been in touch with us, and we have been paying about four fifths of the pensioners in this country and a similar proportion of those abroad by manual means from Newcastle. Of those, all who are entitled to an uprating increase will receive it on time, and I hope that by the time the uprating is due we shall have been able to identify from the computer the remainder of those who have not yet been in touch with us direct and thus put the emergency procedures into operation for them. If we are successful in identifying the remainder, they too will get the uprating increase due to them, together with the benefit owing to them since the dispute started. Similarly, we hope to be able to make the necessary arrangements for those on automatic credit transfer. At the same time, I hope to be able to eliminate those distressing cases where payment has continued automatically from banks to pensioners who have died.<br/>
There has been much interest in the payment of the Christmas bonus. We expect that this, too, will be paid on time, in the first week of December, in the vast majority of cases. Locally issued order books will contain the appropriate voucher. For stub payments&#x2014;the re-covered


Newcastle books&#x2014;the post offices will pay out an additional &#x00A3;10 that week, and &#x00A3;10 will be added to the payable orders or ACT payments relating to that period.<br/>
Although there have been difficulties, a remarkable job has been done by the vast majority of DHSS staff both in coping with the emergency arrangements and in making sure that the uprating should proceed successfully. I hope

that the whole House will join me in expressing our heartfelt thanks for the dedicated work of the vast majority of officials at Newcastle and the tens of thousands of DHSS officials in local offices who have done a first-class job in very difficult circumstances.</p>
