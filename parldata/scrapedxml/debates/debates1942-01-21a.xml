<p>I would refer my hon. Friends to the "Declaration by the United Nations" signed at Washington on 1st January, the text of which has been published in the Press.

<p>In an Air Force of large size a number of aircraft must always be unserviceable for short periods awaiting spares The current proportion is not, however, abnormal, and the supply of spares is improving. The Air Ministry is responsible for stating its requirements for equipment, including spares, and the Ministry of Aircraft Production for meeting them.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Air whether he is aware that maintenance and repair instructions for air units are supplied, some by the Air Ministry and some by the Ministry of Aircraft Production; that this division of responsibility is resulting in contradictory instructions and to a large number of errors in the spare parts volume; and whether he will take steps to unify the instructions?</p>

<p>The Director of Servicing and Maintenance in my Department and the Director of Repair and Maintenance in the Ministry of Aircraft Production issue instructions within their respective spheres. They are in constant touch with each other and are fully aware of the need for co-ordination in order to avoid overlapping or conflicting instructions. The "spare parts volume" to which the hon. Member refers is presumably Technical Publication Vol. III. This is a schedule of components and spare parts based on information supplied by manufacturers. It is affected by design modifications and changes in manufacturing practice, and amendment lists are issued regularly to all concerned. I am in consultation with my right hon. Friend the Minister of Aircraft Production as to whether any further action is required.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Air whether he is aware that the Director of Repair and Maintenance under the Ministry of Aircraft Production is stationed in one town, that his technical staff are stationed in another town, that the Air Ministry organisation for the provision of spare parts is situated in a third town, and that the actual supply of spare parts is the function of a director of depots situated in a fourth town; that this system involves inordinate delays due to correspondence and other paper work; that important communications upon which the supply of equipment depends frequently take two or three months to make the complete circuit of reference; and whether he is prepared to consider proposals for a better arrangement?</p>

<p>I am aware that the dispersal to which the hon. Member refers is


administratively inconvenient, but in the existing circumstances governing Government Department locations and accommodation this must be accepted as inevitable. Because it causes delay in the transit of correspondence, special arrangements for the delivery of urgent communications have been made. The supply of spare parts to the Royal Air Force is carried out by maintenance units under the control of a group commander whose headquarters are adjacent to those of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Maintenance Command; therefore I cannot agree that the arrangement must involve any considerable delay in the supply of equipment. If the hon. Member has any suggestions to make, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Aircraft Production and I will, of course, be glad to consider them.</p>

<p>This took place the day before the German prisoners escaped. These boys were, in fact, observed, but so large was the aerodrome that they were able to do a certain amount of damage before being approached. They then got away, but were apprehended afterwards. Some of our bomber aerodromes are twice the size of Hyde Park, and it is impossible to prevent an occasional snooper from getting into so large an area. But, as regards sabotage, there has not been a single case since the war began. Sabotage can be done on a dangerous scale only by a considerable organisation, and we have our own methods of preventing it.</p>

<p>The aircraft was engaged on night flying training, and it crashed soon after taking off. It was so badly damaged that it was not possible to ascertain from the wreckage the cause of the mishap.

Unfortunately, the five Service occupants of the aircraft and four members of the family living in the farmhouse were killed. One other civilian was slightly injured. I am sure that the House will join with me in expressing sympathy with the relatives of those who lost their lives in this tragic occurrence.</p>

<p>Subject to the exigencies of the Service, all ranks serving at home may be granted leave, at the discretion of commanding officers, on the basis of 61 days a year for flying personnel and 28 days a year for ground personnel. In addition, week-end leave may be granted as circumstances permit. Local leave in overseas commands is at the discretion of the air officer commanding.

The leave year begins on 3rd September for personnel who were serving on 3rd September, 1939, and on the date of entering the Service for others. Flying personnel may be given leave at any time. Ground personnel are encouraged to take seven or 14 days' leave within every period of three or six months respectively, but air officers commanding may authorise the whole or part of this leave to be carried forward in exceptional circumstances. Leave may not, however, be carried forward from one leave year to another. This rule is applied throughout the Royal Air Force, and in the other Fighting Services as well. I have no reason to think that the arrangements generally are unsatisfactory.</p>

In the case of an officer who, without there being any medical grounds for his failure, has forfeited the confidence of his commanding officer in his reliability and his willingness to face danger, he is called upon to resign his commission. When he has resigned his commission, he becomes available to be called up under the National Service Acts, and to be given such duties as he is suited for.</p>

<p>As part of the Government's policy for taking greater responsibility for training the youth of the country from the school leaving age, the Admiralty have arranged to take over the direction of the training and organisation of recognised Sea Cadet Corps, while leaving matters of administration in the hands of the present Central Associations, of which the most extensive is the Navy League. The revised arrangements will cover cadets between the ages of 14 and 17. These will be expected on attaining the age of 15 to give an honourable undertaking, supported by consent of the parents, to join the Navy upon or before attaining the call-up age.<br/>
An annual capitation grant of 12s. will be paid to the associations in respect of each cadet between the ages of 14 and 17. Cadets who, on attaining the age of 17 have enrolled under the "Y" Scheme and continue in the Sea Cadet Corps, will also be eligible for the increased grant. Uniform will be provided free for all cadets who come under the scheme. Details are not yet settled, but I hope to make a further statement on this point shortly.

<p>asked the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (1) the reasons governing the decision that pyrethrum may only be grown in Kenya under licence;<br/>
(2) how many licences to grow pyrethrum have been issued to Africans in Kenya during the year 1940; whether he is satisfied that the charge of 50s. per annum for a licence is not in practice prohibitive for Africans; and whether he will consider reducing the cost to a smaller sum, such as 5s.?</p>

<p>Pyrethrum is a daisy, the flowers of which if properly picked and dried, yield a valuable insecticide; but considerable care is necessary in its preparation, if the proper standard of quality is to be reached. Price is dependent both on quality and on the quantities available not exceeding the requirements of the market. Careful control both of the quality and of the quantity of production is therefore essential if the prosperity of

the industry is to be maintained, and is exercised under the Pyrethrum Ordinance 1938. The proceeds of the licence fee of 50s. are paid into a fund which meets the cost of the Board established under the Ordinance and of research, advertisement and other objects connected with the welfare of the industry. Having regard to the needs of the fund, a less sum than 50s. would be inadequate, and persons competent to produce pyrethrum are at present well able to bear a charge of 50s. My Noble Friend has no information regarding the number of licences granted to Africans and Europeans in 1940, but he is making inquiries.</p>

<p>The Service Departments notify casualties to next-of-kin by telegram confirmed by letter, or by letter. The second part of the Question, therefore, does not arise. In the absence of speedier


means of delivery the purport of a telegram relating to a case of dangerous or serious illness may occasionally be conveyed to the next-of-kin by the local police in advance of the physical delivery of the telegram. This may have given rise to the mistaken impression that the police are used to notify casualties as a routine measure. As regards the last part of the Question, every endeavour is made to ensure that the official notification to the next-of-kin is the first intimation of a casualty. But in some cases casualties occur in circumstances which are made the subject of Press announcements before the next-of-kin can be officially informed. If my hon. and gallant Friend has any case in mind where it appears to him that the procedure has been open to criticism, perhaps he would communicate with the Service Department concerned.</p>

The Ministry will also take over any surplus unsold by growers on 31st May, 1942.

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
It is a small but, I think, a useful Measure, and I believe it will prove non-controversial. It is, of course, inevitable that in war-time there must be a very large number of requisitions of property, and also that some people whose property is requisitioned must feel a very real sense of grievance, and it is obviously very desirable that we should do everything possible to see that the necessary requisitions are conducted in such a way as to inflict a minimum amount of inconvenience and discomfort on the people affected. That can in part be done by courtesy, by tact, and by realising that, although, of course, the interests of any individual must give way to the interests of the welfare of the country as a whole, yet, in considering whether any premises should or should not be requisitioned, one of the factors always to be taken into account should be the interest, the welfare, of the persons affected. If you can with equal convenience obtain other premises which will not inflict hardship upon individuals, there is always a strong case for obtaining those other premises. It is, however, surprising, in view of the very large number of requisitions there have been, how small is the volume of complaints in regard to what has been done.<br/>
That is no reason why we should not try to see whether we can do something to get rid of the grievances that remain. Accordingly the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked Mr. John Morris, an eminent member of my own profession, to conduct an inquiry into the matter. In due course he reported, and I am sure that Members of all parties will be grateful to Mr. Morris for the care that he has shown in making the report, which is a White Paper, Cd. 6313, in which he sets out the results of his experiences. He sets out the fact that there have been a very large number of requisitions and that on the whole complaints have been few, and he analyses, as far as he can what


those complaints come to. In so far as they can be met by departmental administrative action, steps have already been taken to that end, but there are two respects in which legislation is required if Mr. Morris's proposals are to be carried out, and it is to give effect to them that the Bill has been introduced.<br/>
It is, therefore, a Bill to amend the law in relation to landlord and tenant in the case of requisitioned premises, and it proceeds according to the Chancellor's promise on 11th September that he would bring in legislation of this sort. The proposals given effect to by the Bill are, firstly, that in certain circumstances tenants whose premises have been requisitioned shall be given an option to disclaim their leases and, secondly, that in certain other cases tenants of requisitioned premises shall have the right to a readjustment of the rents payable to the landlord. I think it is obvious that a tenant who is, in effect, in residence in certain premises, which he is using either for his own residence or for that of his family or as his business, is in a position which may cause him to suffer special hardship by requisitioning. Not only, if the premises are requisitioned, may he receive less rent than the rent that he is under an obligation to pay to his landlord by reason of a fall in the value of the premises, but, in order to live, or perhaps to carry on his business, he may find himself under an obligation to acquire a lease of other premises, and thus he may find himself under an obligation to pay the rents of two premises, the One that has been requisitioned and the other that he had to take by reason of the fact that the first had been requisitioned. He is obviously in a very different position from a tenant who is not living or carrying on business in the premises that are requisitioned. If such premises are vacant, the requisitioning may be actually a boon to the tenant. He may get something for them instead of having a liability on his hands.<br/>
Therefore Mr. Morris recommended that tenants who are actually ejected from premises in which they are residing, or from which they are effectively carrying on business, should be given the right, if they so desire, to disclaim their leases, and the first four Clauses of the Bill substantially give effect to that recommendation. We provide in Clause I that residence

must be real and continuous and that the use as business premises must be substantial, and therefore we have to concede to the landlord the right to apply to the court to have it determined, if he controverts it, whether the conditions&#x2014;effective residence and the like&#x2014;are or are not complied with. We desire to help in the main the tenant who, as a result of requisitioning, is forced to seek alternative accommodation, and we do not think we ought to help the man who has premises to spare or premises of which he is making little use.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1942-01-21a.386.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Morris" colnum="386" time="">
<p>further recommended that it would be unreasonable to give the right of disclaimer where there is a long period of the lease still to run. Otherwise a lessee with a long and onerous lease would be able to get rid of his obligation merely because the premises had been requisitioned for a short time. Mr. Morris therefore recommended that the right to disclaim should be available only where the requisition is likely to last for a period which constitutes a substantial part of the remaining period of the lease, and that will be given effect to in Clause 8. Speaking by and large, we give this right only in cases where the unexpired term of the lease is five years or less. The material date is either the passing of the Bill into an Act, in the case of previous requisitions, or in the case of future requisitions you date your five years from the date of the requisitioning. The right to disclaim is retrospective in this sense. Tenants who have suffered from a requisition before the passing of the Act, and whose premises remain still under requisition, can give notice to disclaim within three months from the passing of the Act, and in that case the disclaimer operates from the date of the passing of the Act. We felt that it would be undesirable and, indeed, impracticable to go right back and give further retrospective effect to these proposals, because to do so would lead to very complicated results in regard to money which had already been paid.</p>

<p>The Bill gives the tenant the right to say, "I give up my lease." We call it "disclaimer." Under the Landlord and Tenant Act if premises are sufficiently damaged by


enemy action, the tenant has the right to what is called "disclaimer." We propose to give him the same right in the event of requisitioning.<br/>
The second matter with which the Bill deals is this: It is designed to resolve the difficulties of those tenants whose leases do not correspond with the hypothetical lease on which the right to compensation under the War Compensation Act is based. Under the War Compensation Act, compensation has to be assessed as provided in Clause 2 (1<i>a</i>); that is, broadly speaking, on the basis that the tenant undertakes all the usual tenants' rates and taxes and has to bear the cost of repairs insurance and other expenses, if any, "necessary to maintain the land in a state to demand that rent." It may and frequently does happen, particularly in the case of flats and offices, that the landlord provides certain services, such as heating and a lift and things of that sort and, consequently, the tenant pays a much higher rent than he would pay if those services were not provided. What is to happen if those premises are requisitioned and the tenant goes out of them, and cannot any longer avail himself of those services? As the law stands, if the requisitioning does not put an end to the tenancy, the tenant has to go on paying the amount fixed by the lease, although that amount is swollen by reason of the fact that the landlord has provided those services to which I have referred. In practice, I am glad to say that requisitioning Departments have, largely, been able to resolve these difficulties by bringing the landlord and the tenant together. If often happens that the requisitioning Department requires these services, and in those cases, an arrangement is made between the requisitioning Department, the landlord and the tenant, and in the great majority of cases that arrangement works well. There are, however, some cases in which it has not worked and in which the landlord has been insistent on getting the full rent, although he is no longer required to provide the services.<br/>
This Bill, in Clause 5, provides that the rent payable by the tenant, in the cases which I have put, may be adjusted so that the tenant, although he may be liable under the lease, is to be liable only for such rent as is attributable to those premises on the basis of the compensation, and not of the rent as swollen by the fact

that those extra services have been provided. The landlord, of course, is relieved from his obligation to provide the services unless the requisitioning Department requires them, in which case the Bill provides that they shall be available for the remainder of the teen of the lease, upon the Department undertaking the obligation to pay for them on the basis of the lease. That is to say, in the case which I have indicated, the tenant will pay the rent on the basis of the Compensation Act, and the Department will pay such part of the rent as represented the services.<br/>
I give another instance. Suppose a floor in a block of offices is taken over by a requisitioning authority, that authority will probably need the use of the lift and possibly also a hot water supply. The Bill provides that, so long as the lease lasts, the Department concerned may require the landlord to continue to provide such services on the same basis as that contained in the lease, the requisitioning Department paying to the landlord the appropriate part of the rent in respect of those services. Technically, therefore, that may involve a charge on the Exchequer, and that is why it is necessary to have a Money Resolution. In practice, I do not think it should involve any additional expenditure. It is really a more convenient way of obtaining services which the Department concerned would, in any case, have to secure and which it would otherwise secure by direct negotiation with the landlord, or by getting the outgoing tenant to require the continuance of these services and paying compensation to the outgoing tenant in respect of them.<br/>
It is hoped that this little Bill will give tenants a useful measure of relief in cases in which they are suffering hardship and inconvenience as a result of requisitioning. We have tried to hold the scales fairly between landlord and tenant, and I believe we have done so. Restricted as it is to leases which have only a short period to run, and to those cases in which the tenant is in actual effective possession, I do not think landlords can regard the Bill as an injustice to them. We invite the co-operation of the House, to see whether the Bill can be improved in Committee, but, as far as the Second Reading is concerned, I feel confident that all parts of the House will welcome the proposals and will agree that they merit consideration in subsequent stages.</p>

<p>No one who has read the report submitted by Mr. John Morris can fail to appreciate the care with which he has examined the difficulties submitted to him or the reasonableness of the proposals which he has made to resolve them. I rise, on behalf of myself and a number of my hon. Friends, to express our appreciation of the action of the Government in having put into effect administratively as many of these proposals as they could, and in now implementing their promise by introducing legislation to cover the two points which could not be dealt with administratively. In the second place, I should like, again on behalf of myself and my hon. Friends, to say how much we appreciate the clear explanation of the two matters which are dealt with in the Bill, just given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General. He has covered the ground in such a way that it is unnecessary for me to make more than one comment of a general character on the Bill.<br/>
My comment is a curious one. It will be appreciated, I think, that hidden in the interstices of this technical and complicated Measure is to be found the Government's forecast of the duration of the war. It will be noted that the proposals for the disclaimer of leases are meant to cover only those leases which, roughly, coincide with or extend a little beyond the probable duration of the requisition. The material date we have to look at is that on which the premises were requisitioned. The earliest date at which premises could have been requisitioned, broadly speaking, was the date of the outbreak of the war. I suppose that requisition will extend a little beyond the duration of the war, and the period given in Clause 8 is five years. I deduce from that that it is the considered view of His Majesty's Government that we are now more than half-way through the war. I can, therefore, express my appreciation of this Measure, not only on what it directly seeks to achieve, but on what it indirectly reveals in hopefulness for us.</p>

<p>No, but it would not be a great sum. The question would only arise when the arrangement had to be come to which my right hon. Friend outlined, when the requisitioning Department put into the shoes of the existing tenant wanted to enjoy the various services, such as lifts, hot water and so on, which are attached to the lease. It is for purely technical reasons that a Financial Resolution is put down at all. No great sum is involved, and it would be impossible to work it out now.</p>
