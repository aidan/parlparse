<p>That is a pathetic answer, but typical. The Minister must be aware of the economic and strategic importance of the line to Stranraer, not only for south-west Scotland but for Northern Ireland. Will he seek some assurances from British Rail that that line will continue if the ill-thought-out privatisation of British Rail goes ahead?</p>

<p>The question of the Stranraer rail link is a matter for the Secretary of State for Transport. As far as Northern Ireland is concerned, we have decided not to

carry out an assessment of the impact of rail privatisation for the following reasons: most business between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is road-based, for logistical reasons. We believe that privatisation will result in a more efficient rail system in Great Britain, thereby offering welcome choice for Northern Ireland businesses.</p>

<p>The Minister will be well aware that, even though many cars travel between Larne and Stranraer, a considerable number of foot passengers travel from Belfast to Glasgow and vice versa. They use the line that was mentioned by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), and it is an essential line for that reason.<br/>
When the Minister consults his hon. Friends in the Scottish Office, will he also remember that the terminal facilities at Stranraer are vastly inferior to those available in Larne? Perhaps he would discuss obtaining some funds from Europe to update those facilities in Stranraer, which would help the economy of Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>I am pleased to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the future of the Stranraer rail link is part of the minimum service requirement. It is included in the proposed ScotRail franchise, and that is currently out for consultation. The hon. Gentleman said that foot passengers use the ferry, but only about 1 per cent. of passengers travelling from Northern Ireland ports arrive at those ports by rail, and only about 10 per cent. of passengers travelling from Northern Ireland ports to Great Britain complete their journey by rail.</p>

<p>The outlook is very encouraging. Employment and output are rising and unemployment is falling. Business confidence and investment intentions are at high levels. New opportunities are opening up for tourism and inward investment, and exports are increasing as our indigenous companies expand. With continuing peace, Northern Ireland's economic prospects are the best that they have been for a generation.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that unemployment in Northern Ireland has reached its lowest levels since 1981, that manufacturing output increased by 7 per cent. last year and that exports from Northern Ireland are growing faster than the United Kingdom average? Will my hon. Friend join me in welcoming the announcement of the proposed &#x00A3;100 million investment in the Province by a major supermarket chain which will bring with it 2,000 new jobs? Finally, I suggest that much of that success is due to the wholly improved atmosphere in Northern Ireland which is due in large part to the initiatives undertaken by my right hon. and learned Friend and by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for those remarks and I certainly endorse the welcome that he gave to the investment that we are now seeing. I thank him for highlighting the improvements that are occurring in the Northern Ireland economy. It is indicative of how much things have improved that not only has unemployment


fallen to its lowest levels since 1981 but also, as of March this year, the number of those in employment has reached a record high. That figure speaks for itself. It is evident that enormous opportunities are available to the people of Northern Ireland in terms of economic growth if peace is sustained and political stability can be achieved. That is what the people of Northern Ireland are asking of their political representatives.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that permanent peace will provide a prize in economic terms in which all law-abiding people in Northern Ireland can share? Does he accept that the new investment arising from the successful conferences held in Belfast and Washington, which were promoted by Prime Minister Major and President Clinton, will be of greatest economic benefit if the new jobs created are accessible to both sections of the community so that all can share in the prosperity that follows?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point. It is absolutely right to underline the fact that peace is the key to future growth and prosperity in Northern Ireland. It is not just temporary peace that will achieve that outcome, but confidence that the peace is permanent. At the end of the day, that can be underlined only by the creation of political stability through political agreement.<br/>
I also endorse the hon. Gentleman's comments that inward investment, particularly as a result of the two conferences to which he referred, will bring the greatest degree of confidence to the community in Northern Ireland if the benefits of that investment are shared as widely as possible.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that the economy of Northern Ireland would be boosted considerably if Shorts, as part of the Westland team, were successful in securing the Ministry of Defence's order for attack helicopters with its Apache version? Does the Minister recognise that that would open the way for Starstreak to be used in the United States? Does he accept that the Government should push from within the Cabinet to ensure that the order goes to Westland and that Shorts benefits as a result?</p>

<p>Can the Secretary of State explain what he meant in his letter last week in <i>The Times</i> when he said that the future prospects of Northern Ireland have already been much damaged by the quarrelling among

Tory Members of Parliament? Is the Secretary of State satisfied that whoever happens to be elected leader of the Tory party in due course&#x2014;be it in the first, second or any other ballot&#x2014;will be committed fully to the peace process and to the framework document? Does he agree that the peace process is far too precious to be sacrificed through Tory quarrelling and civil war in the party ranks?</p>

<p>I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman, very uncharacteristically, is engaging in party political games on a subject that is far too serious for that. Of course everybody in the present Government is fully committed to what has come to be called the peace process, and of course it is the case that instability in the position of any Prime Minister having the commitment demonstrated by my right hon. Friend has a deleterious effect. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well what I mean. If he does not, he can read my article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> today.</p>

<p>No doubt the Secretary of State read his own piece in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> today, but did he read the report of the release of an IRA prisoner who was found guilty in Germany? Did he read the outrageous remarks made by the judge, who said that prisoner was being released although guilty because of the connotations of the peace process? The judge said also that the Roman Catholic people of Northern Ireland had a desire to bomb their way into a united Ireland and that there was never any religious or civil liberty in Northern Ireland for Roman Catholic people. Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman do something to correct the German authorities about the present situation?</p>

<p>It is important that the true facts about Northern Ireland, its democratic status and the applicability of the rule of law there should always be made clear at home and abroad. As to the first part of the hon. Gentleman's question, tempting though it is I do not believe that I should depart from my rule of not commenting on judicial decisions.</p>

<p>Can the Secretary of State assure the House and the people of Northern Ireland that the peace process and political considerations will not be allowed to interfere with the normal operation of the criminal justice system&#x2014;so that when, as is likely now that we have had peace for some time, witnesses are prepared to come forward and give positive identification in respect of specific criminal acts, the normal processes will be followed? If so, there would be no further repetitions of the reported incident in which a leading member of the IRA identified as the trigger man by a witness was released in breach of normal procedures, simply because the police feared that the Northern Ireland Office would be upset if a major provo were charged.</p>

<p>The answer to the first part of the hon. Gentleman's question is, of course. The remaining parts of his question proceed on a number of premises that I do not accept. The Northern Ireland prosecution system, as I recall from the many years that I had responsibility for it, is entirely independent and impartial. The Law Officers of the Crown are there to ensure that it remains so. I am certain that my hon. and learned Friends will do so.</p>

<p>I gave that assurance. A certain amount of turmoil resulted from a remark that I made when doorstepped a couple of days ago. I have looked at the transcript and it seems entirely orthodox, and in fact rather trite. It was put to me that Mr. McGuinness has said that there was not a snowball's chance in hell of decommissioning until a political settlement had occurred&#x2014;to which I replied, if that was the case, the political talks process would continue in the absence of Sinn Fein. I cannot believe that anybody in the House wishes that I had replied otherwise.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State agree that the peace process cannot be considered meaningfully without taking account of prisoners? I make no apology for raising this matter over and over again. Many believe, as I do, that Private Lee Clegg will be released shortly. If that happens, will the Secretary of State ensure that Patrick Kane, Sean Kelly and Michael Timmons, who did not kill anyone, will be released forthwith? While the right hon. and learned Gentleman is doing that, will he consider the question of Irish prisoners in Britain, have them returned to Northern Ireland and look with generosity at the whole question of republican and loyalist prisoners? Some of us, at least in Northern Ireland, could truly say that there but for the grace of God go I, depending on the environment at that time.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman raises five or six items, on each of which, perfectly properly, he feels strongly. He cannot expect me to deal with them all.<br/>
It is extremely important to note the distinction of the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State under statute in the case of a power to release upon licence someone who has been sentenced to life imprisonment, and the absence of any jurisdiction on the part of the Secretary of State to second-guess the finding of a court as to guilt or innocence.<br/>
I must not comment in response to the hon. Gentleman's question upon the other case that he mentioned, and I do not propose to do so. These matters arouse great passions and feelings and it is important that they should be dealt with in a cool and analytical way. That is not to ignore the human aspects of any of them.</p>

Will he accept also that although there is reason to be cautiously pessimistic about the continuation of the period of no more deaths since the tragic murder of Frank Kerr of Newry, Gordon Wilson's courage in meeting the IRA, although he thought afterwards that it had been a failure, may have been one of the triggers for success?</p>

<p>I am grateful for that answer.

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has long taken close interest in these matters. We have said for a long time that we would be prepared to enhance protection for human rights in Northern Ireland. There is obviously a passage in each of


the framework documents that bears upon that. If all the parties were to agree that the best means of such protection were a Bill of Rights, the Government would obviously take account of that view in the light of prevailing circumstances. At this juncture, we would not wish to rule anything out or in.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that the most important human right of all is the right to life? Is not it remarkable that there has been freedom for such a long time from sectarian killing and destruction in Northern Ireland, a situation that many people thought would never happen?

<p>I very warmly endorse what my hon. Friend has just said. I do not believe that any body of opinion in Northern Ireland would disagree with what he has said, both as to the Prime Minister's skill, and certainly his commitment, and as to the level of surprise that what has come about in the past 10 months has occasioned. The right to life is the most fundamental human right of all, and one must always continue to stress that, not least when discussing the activities of people who presume to impose punishment without charge, without trial and without appeal.</p>

<p>Will the Secretary of State confirm for the record that the Ulster Unionist party tabled specific and detailed proposals for a Bill of Rights at the very start of the 1992 inter-party talks and was the only party to do so, but that neither the Irish Government nor the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party showed any interest in discussing those proposals?<br/>

<p>First, I confirm that the hon. Gentleman's party did introduce substantial proposals for a Bill of Rights. I readily acknowledge that. The question of a Bill of Rights gives rise to an interesting debate, which is not all one way but, as I said, and I now repeat, if everyone agrees upon it, that will obviously weigh heavily with the Government.<br/>
As to the hon. Gentleman's assertion, I and my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office are grateful to the hon. Gentleman for meeting my right hon. Friend last night and making him aware of information that has come to him. That is the only source of such information in the Government's possession at the moment, but I simply say that if anyone in Northern Ireland has any intention to return to violence, that will meet with outrage from the people of Northern Ireland. I can assure the hon. Gentleman and the House that the security forces will take all appropriate precautions to ensure that it is thwarted.</p>

<p>I associate myself with the remarks about Senator Gordon Wilson, who was a friend and a colleague and someone for whom I had enormous respect. That is also the view of my colleagues.<br/>
Does the Secretary of State agree that in any society based on human rights there are two principles&#x2014;one is the principle of equality before the law and the other is

the principle that those who govern and those who are governed at all times and in all circumstances uphold the primacy of the law?<br/>
Does the Secretary of State further agree that if he makes a decision in the Clegg case, an Executive decision made by a politician on the advice of civil servants, which overrules a decision of the Northern Ireland High Court, the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal and the House of Lords, that, in effect, will devalue and demean the whole process of law in Northern Ireland?<br/>
Will the Secretary of State accept from me that at this moment that would be tantamount to throwing a lighted match on to a tinder-box in Northern Ireland and, moreover, would rub salt in the wounds of those who have served long sentences according to due process, not according to Executive decision? Will the Secretary of State answer that? Does he uphold the primacy of the law and will he in this case?</p>

<p>Of course I will. I have no intention of overruling, nor have I any jurisdiction to overrule, the decision of the High Court, the Court of Appeal, or the House of Lords. The hon. Gentleman is confusing that notion with the concept of the jurisdiction that Parliament has conferred upon the holder of my office&#x2014;as it has conferred it on the Home Secretary in Great Britain&#x2014;to deal with the question of whether a sentence for life should mean for the whole of someone's natural life or not. I imagine that there are many people in prison of whom the hon. Gentleman has some knowledge&#x2014;though very little sympathy, I feel sure&#x2014;whom he would not wish to see languish in prison for the rest of their natural lives simply because that is the character of the sentence that has been imposed upon them. He can be perfectly certain that any individual case that falls within my jurisdiction will be dealt with in the best way that seems to me to accord with the rule of law and the jurisdiction conferred upon me by Parliament.<br/>
At the risk of going on for too long&#x2014;I hope I am not&#x2014;I can say that of course we uphold the concept of equality before the law. That does not mean to say that every individual case receives equal treatment in terms of years or whatever. It means that the same considerations are applied, but does not mean that the identical result appears in every case. If that were the case, the individual circumstances would be neglected</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his reply but, in the context of his earlier reply to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Spring), is he not deeply concerned about the gross inequality in the distribution of job creation in Northern Ireland? The southern part of Northern Ireland has been neglected by inward investment projects. He will be aware that, for the years 1990 to 1995, 39 projects were created, but none in my constituency of South Down; in fact, only 3 per cent. of the inward investment visits of the past 10 years have come to South Down. Will the Minister take direct action to redress that inequality through a new inward investment strategy, allied perhaps to a decentralisation of jobs from Government Departments to the more rural areas?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows that I am not responsible for that particular aspect, but I shall certainly

ensure that Lady Denton is made aware of his remarks. He will have heard me say that it is very much the intention of the Government to ensure that the benefits in terms of inward investment which will, we hope, flow from a sustained peace will be shared by all parts of the community in Northern Ireland.

We have long recognised the important role that integrated education can play in bringing the two parts of the community together. Indeed, in the schools that I mentioned in my answer about 5,000 pupils are now involved in integrated education.

As the four constitutional parties have been engaged since 14 July 1987&#x2014;eight years ago&#x2014;with the Secretary of State and his two distinguished predecessors, does he feel that he can now proceed to reward those parties and that ministerial diligence and patience by giving us at long last some real influence over the affairs of our Province?</p>

<p>When speaking to Tory party chairmen recently, the Prime Minister resorted to the language of Gerald Ratner in describing the processes of the European

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman may be referring to a private remark that appeared to have been bugged by the BBC at some stage over the weekend. I have learnt that, from time to time, one mike can be left on by mistake. However, I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he take no notice of that. He should concentrate on the fact that under this Government the changes that we have seen in prospects and prosperity for the future are greater than any that we have seen for many years. Not within his adult lifetime has this country ever faced the benign economic prospect for the future that we can today honestly offer the British people.</p>

<p>May I thank the Leader of the House for that information on future business as far as he knows it? On this somewhat momentous day, will he join me in asking you, Madam Speaker, as the first woman to occupy your position, to send a message of congratulations on our behalf to Lisa Clayton, the first British woman to complete a lone, non-stop, around-the-world voyage in her boat, the Spirit of Birmingham?<br/>
On the information that the right hon. Gentleman has given us, what is the status of the business that he has announced, especially from Tuesday onwards? Is that business provisional and conditional on the outcome of the Conservative leadership election, or does he speak with the authority of both candidates? If so, will the economic debate, which he confirmed will take place on 12 July, be a new Budget debate and would he care to speculate on who might open that debate for the Government?<br/>
Also, in view of the contempt shown for the House by the Prime Minister and others last Thursday, what steps will the Leader of the House take to ensure that the House is kept fully informed of the constitutional implications of any uncertainty that may arise next Tuesday as a result of the Conservative leadership ballot, especially in the event of a second or subsequent ballot, or, indeed, of the Prime Minister receiving only a bare and unconvincing majority?<br/>
Does the Leader of the House acknowledge that, constitutionally, the Prime Minister should be able to command a majority in the House and the support and confidence of the country, and that what the British people want is not an internal contest in the Conservative party, but a general election?</p>

Lady's initial request that you, Madam Speaker, should convey the congratulations of the House to Lisa Clayton, I am sure that that would command unanimous support.

<p>May I draw the attention of my right hon. Friend to early-day motion 1267 on the prosecution of British paedophile tourists, which has been signed by at least 140 right hon. and hon. Members from both sides of the House and is likely to acquire further signatures in the next few days and weeks?<br/>
[<i>That this House notes that over 300 members from all parts of the House have recently expressed their deep concern at reports about citizens of developed countries travelling overseas as tourists to procure child prostitutes and pornography in poor countries in Africa, India, and Asia; noting further that the Governments of Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United States of America have legislated, or are in the process of legislating, to give their domestic courts jurisdiction to prosecute such residents and nationals for sexual offences inflicted on children abroad; further noting that prosecutions under such legislation have proved feasible, urges Her Majesty's Government to give British courts extra-territorial jurisdiction for prosecuting such offences committed by British nationals abroad either by enacting the Private Member's Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill [Lords], or by introducing a comparable government measure.</i>]<br/>
In particular, will my right hon. Friend note the two options at the end of the early-day motion, including the possibility of the Government introducing a measure that would give effect to its aims? Could he arrange for the Home Secretary to monitor progress on the Bill and, if necessary, make a statement in the House about what Government action may be forthcoming?</p>

Secondly, will he look at the possibility of bringing forward at an early date a by-election writ to fill the vacancy in Littleborough and Saddleworth? If that is not done before the summer recess, it will leave electors in that constituency unrepresented for an untoward period of time. Thirdly, will he look at early-day motion 1258 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace)?<br/>
[<i>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Roads (Transitional Powers) (Scotland) Order 1995 (S.I., 1995, No. 1476), dated 8th June 1995, a copy of which was laid before this House on 9th June, be annulled.</i>]<br/>
The Leader of the House will be aware that the Roads (Transitional Powers) (Scotland) Order contains detrunking orders for a raft of roads throughout the length and breadth of Scotland and it would be to the advantage of hon.

[<i>That this House warmly welcomes the stepping up of the campaign by the non-party political group, the Families of the Disappeared, to put increased pressure on Sinn Fein/IRA to release details of those killed by the Provisional IRA and buried in unmarked graves; supports this group's sole objective of allowing the relatives of the disappeared, who number at least 12 people, to bury their loved ones with Christian dignity; welcomes the public pleas of many, including President Clinton, to Sinn Fein/IRA to accede to this basic humanitarian demand; notes that, as a result of these appeals and the excellent campaign of the Belfast Telegraph on the issue, Sinn Fein has acknowledged the aims and validity of the campaign by the Families of the Disappeared but have so far failed to provide any significant information; and further notes the campaign's decision to popularise the wearing of light blue ribbons as a symbol of hope.</i>]<br/>
Will the right hon. Gentleman provide time to discuss the impact of the peace process in Northern Ireland on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland? The early-day motion shows that the families of the disappeared, just like in El Salvador, would like the bodies of their loved ones returned for a decent Christian burial. Is he aware that when I was in Belfast last week, people told me that, on the streets of both west and east Belfast, people are still being beaten up by paramilitaries in an abandonment of the rule of law, which should cover the ordinary people of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom? May we have a debate to stop the expulsions from Northern Ireland by paramilitaries of people whose lives they think they can govern? When may


we debate the return of the rule of law to the ordinary people of Northern Ireland, so that they can have a peace that is not just a peace process at national level, but peace on the streets of their towns and cities?</p>

[<i>That this House, concerned at the anger felt amongst the British Sikh community about the impact on the employment prospects of Sikhs of the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992, introduced as a consequence of a European Directive, notes that British Sikhs have for many years been exempt from wearing hard hats in many areas, including service in the British Army and on construction sites; and urges Her Majesty's Government to introduce amending legislation urgently so that British Sikhs may continue to work in all non-construction employment whilst wearing turbans.</i>]<br/>
The Leader of the House will be aware that the Government are always keen to show how they have sought to protect United Kingdom employment from the encroachment of the European Union. If that is so, why do they not do the same towards the Sikh community and seek to protect their jobs rather than witness their jobs disappearing, as they will as a consequence of that directive?</p>

<p>Is it not a matter of urgent necessity that we debate early-day motion 1248?<br/>
[<i>That this House deplores the decision of the Government of France to resume testing nuclear weapons in the South Pacific; notes the universal hostility to that decision by the countries in that area, who form a voluntary nuclear-free zone; considers that the safety of the weapons excuse proffered by France for resuming the tests is lame because there are plenty of computer simulations of nuclear explosions available, and the same argument could be used by any nuclear state following the introduction of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty thereby destroying such a treaty; further notes that these proposed tests run contrary to the obligations entered into by nuclear weapons states at the recent Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty conference; further notes that the response from No. 10 Downing Street to the announcement of these tests was a pathetic absence of any criticism whatsoever; and so this House urges the French Government to change its mind and abandon these deplorable nuclear weapons tests.</i>]<br/>
That would be particularly appropriate at the moment, as groups of children from Chernobyl are seeking aid outside the Ukraine for the thyroid cancers that they contracted after the Chernobyl accident. Is it not an act of ultimate stupidity and irresponsibility on the part of the French President to plan nuclear tests in the Pacific? Is not our Prime Minister's response weak and supine in the face of the antagonism displayed by many other states in Europe?<br/>
If France goes ahead with nuclear tests, there is a danger that we might repeat the worst peacetime contamination of the atmosphere, other than Chernobyl, which occurred during the 1950s and 1960s principally as a result of Chinese nuclear tests. Other nations may follow France's example and test their nuclear weapons in the atmosphere and in the ground. Does not the threat of poisoning and polluting our planet concern not just Europe but the entire world?</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
I urge the House to support new clause 1, which would establish a proper system of independent advice to the Home Secretary about the way in which victims of violent crime are compensated. In Committee, the Minister made a number of concessions. He accepted our proposal that the adjudicators who deal with appeals should form the membership of an advisory body that would include trade unionists as well as employers and those with medical and legal experience, and he agreed that they should give wide-ranging advice, not just advice arising out of their experience on appeal cases.<br/>
So far, so good. However, the Government amendment is vague, and leaves everything to the Ministers. We are invited to trust the Home Secretary about the way in which the promise is delivered, and that is where the problem arises. The Home Secretary has demonstrated a total incapacity for seeking advice when that is necessary and for listening to advice when it is offered.<br/>
There was no lack of advice when the Home Secretary sought to change the criminal injuries compensation scheme illegally, without the blessing of Parliament. Labour told him not to do it, lawyers and victims' representatives advised him not to do it, and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board told him not to do it&#x2014;yet only after being dragged through the courts of the land and being told by the Law Lords that which we had told the Home Secretary all along did he finally and grudgingly accept that he was wrong.<br/>
The Home Secretary seems just as unpopular when he seeks to give advice as when he is trying to avoid taking it. Yesterday, <i>The Guardian</i> recorded that the Home Secretary's unilateral decision to join the Prime Minister's campaign team
<q>was not, it was thought, greeted with much joy by the loyalists".</q>
That seems to have something to do with the Home Secretary's response to the manifesto of the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). The Home Secretary said:
<q>it is not rooted in the real world</q>
and a few minutes later said that the manifesto
<q>substantially reflects Government policy.</q>
Those statements taken together sum up the state of the Conservative party, but the Home Secretary's colleagues may be forgiven for thinking that his words best describe the right hon. and learned Gentleman's frenetic, ill-judged attempt to cut the cash without proper regard for the victims of violent crime.<br/>
The amendment will not guarantee that the Home Secretary or his successor will listen, or that his judgment will improve&#x2014;but it will at least ensure a statutory advice framework and that the whole system is out in the open. U-turns have been forced on the Home Secretary, which is why the Bill contains some provisions for loss of earnings and care costs arising from violent crime, inadequate though they are.<br/>
The fact remains that the Conservative party, on the Home Secretary's own figures, is cutting compensation to the victims of violent crime by &#x00A3;700 million over the next five years. When the right hon. and learned Gentleman is still disregarding advice to such an appalling extent and has ignored the possibility of consensus offered by Labour's clear promise, "If you don't cut the cash, we won't cut the cash," we need a system of independent advice at the heart of the Bill, not just promised verbally in Committee.<br/>
On Tuesday, the Minister sought to persuade us that we can leave it to him to make sure that an advisory system is implemented according to our principles. Since then, I have seen a letter in which the Minister personally rejected the possibility of receiving expert advice. The Association of Personal Injury Lawyers offered its help and advice. It sought to share its concern with the Minister in good time for him to give prior consideration to its views, instead of having a public debate.<br/>
In view of the fact that the last time the Minister ignored the association's advice, he ended up in the House of Lords losing an appeal, one might have thought that the Minister would jump at the chance. But no, the association received a letter dated 19 June from the Minister's assistant private secretary, saying in essence that the Minister was too busy.<br/>
The whole point of an adequate system of advice built into the Bill is to ensure that Ministers receive good advice at an early stage and consider it before coming forward with proposals. Hard, half-hearted, half-baked, headline-grabbing obstinacy by a Home Secretary who would not listen has turned criminal injury compensation into a live political issue, when it should be a topic for consensus.<br/>
Despite the history, we have sought to protect Ministers from their own worst instincts and the consequences of their folly, as we do in this new clause&#x2014;which the Minister should accept as a positive and helpful


contribution to the Bill. It would guarantee an independent source of advice when establishing or changing tariff levels or making provision in relation to loss of earnings, special expenses or fatal cases, and in relation to other key aspects of the scheme in clause 3(1).<br/>
That is vital, to ensure that changes to the scheme are made on the basis of expert advice and that the Government do not again fall into the trap of making proposals for criminal injury compensation that are opposed by anyone with knowledge of the effect of criminal injuries on victims.<br/>
It would have been more impressive when the Minister suggested that people who deal with appeals might also offer advice if there had been anything in the Bill or in the notes on clauses provided by the Minister to suggest that was his intention. I believe that he has given some way, sensibly, under pressure from the Opposition. It would be far better, however, for the changes that we recommended to be included in the Bill so that they become clear or transparent. They should be guaranteed for the future. We should not have to depend on the Minister's interpretation being continued by future Home Office Ministers.</p>

<p>There were lengthy debates in Committee about the need for an independent body to advise the Secretary of State on tariffs, the other heads of damage and the general running of a compensation scheme for criminal injuries. At first, it was suggested that yet another new body should be set up to fulfil that role. We, the Government, said that that was unnecessary, because there would already be an independent body with the necessary expertise to provide such advice&#x2014;the appeals panel. We argued that it would be established to consider appeals against awards made by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority.<br/>
We argued also that the panel, with members drawn from the present Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, the medical profession, commerce and industry, the TUC and other organisations, was the ideal body for the purpose. We made it clear that we would expect the panel to offer advice to the Government on any matters relating to the scheme, both when asked for such advice and of its own accord when it felt that matters should be brought to the attention of Ministers. Although it was not necessary, we amended the Bill in Committee to provide that the scheme included provision on the giving of advice by the panel to the Government.<br/>
We want the new, enhanced tariff scheme to be user-friendly. It should be flexible and capable of responding quickly to the needs of victims or to wider interests. We do not want a scheme that is hidebound by overly detailed rules and procedures that militate against speedy reactions to needs or demands because of an imposed structure that is overly bureaucratic. We want the panel to be able to operate flexibly. We do not want to restrict its freedom of action by imposing a duty on it to advise the Secretary of State on a range of prescribed issues, especially a duty that, while clear enough about the issues to which it relates, fails to make clear by what circumstances it is triggered.<br/>
Exactly when should the panel give its advice? The amendment refers to both formal and informal advice. It is yet another recipe for internal bureaucracy. I am content

to leave the panel to provide whatever advice it thinks appropriate when it thinks appropriate, without it having to decide whether it is giving it as formal or informal advice.<br/>
The new clause would give the panel another duty. It would require it to report any formal advice that it gave to the Secretary of State. Clause 6 already contains a provision about annual reports to the Secretary of State by such persons as he thinks appropriate relating to the discharge of their functions. The report will be laid before Parliament. The scheme will make it clear that the panel will be required to produce an annual report as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year. That will have to cover advice that is given in accordance with the scheme.<br/>
The panel will be free to record any other comments that it feels it right to make about the scheme and its operation. There is no need, therefore, for the part of the new clause that requires a report to be made "each calendar year". I am happy for the panel to decide how it wants to give advice to the Government. It is unnecessary to include express provision for that.<br/>
I respect the point of view of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), as always, but I consider the clause to be unnecessary. We have made it clear that we shall look to the panel as a ready source of expertise and advice on any matters touching on the tariff scheme. We have made it equally clear that the panel is free to give unsolicited advice to the Government if it wants to do so. We have amended the Bill to ensure that the scheme will include provision for panel advice. We shall ensure that the scheme deals adequately with that. The over-prescriptive new clause before us is not necessary for that purpose.<br/>
The Government are interested in the contents of a new clause&#x2014;the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and I had an excellent relationship in Committee&#x2014;to which we shall be coming shortly. We shall not be able to accept the exact wording of that clause, but we are interested in its contents. We may be able to go further with it. I cannot, however, accept new clause 1. If the hon. Gentleman does not withdraw it, I shall have to ask this packed Chamber to reject it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
New clause 2 seeks to establish something extremely important&#x2014;accountability and proper scrutiny for the administration of the criminal injuries compensation scheme. The Bill seems to be specifically designed to exclude from the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the ombudsman, the actions of the administrative staff involved in running the scheme.<br/>
I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice), who first raised the issue in Committee and has brought to the attention of many of us who were concerned about accountability and transparency under the new scheme the importance of ensuring that the ombudsman's jurisdiction does run.<br/>
In Committee, we debated the provision which states that those appointed for the purpose of administering the provisions of the scheme which relate to the appeal system should
<q>not be regarded as having been appointed to exercise functions of</q>
or on behalf of
<q>the Secretary of State".</q>
The Opposition said that it seemed likely that that exclusion would be dangerous, and would go way beyond the Minister's intentions. The Minister said that his only intention in those words was to avoid interference by Ministers in the operation of the scheme with regard to individual cases.<br/>
It is right that Ministers should not interfere in individual cases, and that an assessment of the circumstances of a case should be made by those dealing with it administratively and by adjudicators dealing with appeals without interference from the Minister. But, as we said in Committee, why was that form of words used? Why not use a form of words that has been tried and tested? The Minister was unable to give any justification, but he said that that was the limit of his intention.<br/>
When the Bill is examined more closely, it is seen that the words have the effect, whether intended or otherwise, of excluding the administration of the scheme from the jurisdiction of the parliamentary ombudsman. In Committee, the Minister gave no suggestion that that was his intention. I am sure that he would have explained to us any such intention. Therefore, I am not suggesting that he, individually and personally, intended the words to

have the effect that I suggest they will have. But unless new clause 2 or something similar is included in the Bill, the operation of the scheme will be excluded from the ombudsman's scrutiny.<br/>
Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept the new clause. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East also wishes to refer to the important arguments in support of the new clause.</p>

<p>I support new clause 2, which extends the powers of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration to this area of government. As a member of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, I am only too well aware of the extensive work done by the ombudsman and his team. I think that I speak on behalf of the Committee when I say that we have a most outstanding ombudsman in Mr. William Reid, and we should recognise him as such.<br/>
Last year, when the Select Committee investigated the powers, work and jurisdiction of the ombudsman, we said in our report that one of the indications of the success of that office was the fact that further ombudsmen have been established to bring the advantages of an independent and impartial investigator of complaints into other areas of public life. We went on to say that an added testimony to the office's achievements has been the gradual extension of the ombudsman's jurisdiction to more branches of the Executive.<br/>
The Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 is a case in point&#x2014;the administrative actions of court and tribunal staff appointed by the Lord Chancellor now come within the ombudsman's jurisdiction. Only last year, the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Malone), who is now the Minister for Health, successfully piloted, with all-party support, a private Member's Bill that extended the ombudsman's jurisdiction to other tribunals.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1076972" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1995-06-29a.1099.0" hansard_membership_id="8391" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2989" speakername="Mr. Maclean" colnum="1099" time="16:15:00">
<p>I can well understand the intention behind the new clause. It no doubt seeks to achieve high standards in the administration of the new scheme by making the administrative actions&#x2014;actions other than the actual determination of awards, for which other provision will be made in the scheme&#x2014;of those running it subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, more commonly known as the ombudsman.<br/>
I make it quite clear that it is our firm intention that the new scheme should be run as effectively and efficiently as possible, and mechanisms will be built in to facilitate that. For example, the authority will be required to set standards of performance and targets, and will have to report on how it has measured up to them in its annual report. There will also be a fully developed and effective complaints procedure, enabling those who feel that their cases have not been well handled to make a formal complaint in the sure expectation that it will be speedily and properly considered, and that, where appropriate, redress will be made.<br/>
I accept, however, that there may be an argument for saying that such provisions do not go far enough, and that applicants who believe that their case has been subject to maladministration should have some means of seeking external reassurance. That is, of course, the role of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in other contexts, and hon. Members have therefore, reasonably enough, looked to the ombudsman in this instance.<br/>
The fact is, however, that the administration of the scheme does not currently fall within the jurisdiction of the ombudsman. To give him such jurisdiction would therefore be a significant step, and one that should not be taken without prior discussion with him and other interested parties.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to intervene on the issue of discussions with the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. The commissioner raised the matter when he saw the Bill in draft form, because he was extremely concerned about the fact that he will not have jurisdiction in this sphere.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1076974" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1995-06-29a.1100.1" hansard_membership_id="8391" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2989" speakername="Mr. Maclean" colnum="1100" time="16:15:00">
<p>I am well aware of that. I was merely suggesting that, before we lobbed all sorts of things at the commissioner, we would need to have detailed discussions to work out the whys and wherefores and where the boundaries are. If the hon. Lady will permit me to continue, she may not be disappointed by what I have to say.<br/>
We would also need to consider carefully with the commissioner the resource and other implications of such a change, and to think very carefully about what might be, and what might not be, within his remit. I am sure that we are all aware of constituents who complain persistently, and perhaps unreasonably, and who demand referral of their case to the ombudsman, no matter how carefully their complaint or grievance&#x2014;whether real or imaginary&#x2014;has previously been handled, and no matter how many other appeal tribunals they have been through.<br/>
We must not lose sight of the fact that about one third of the 60,000 or 70,000 people who apply for compensation each year are, quite properly, turned down on grounds of eligibility, because they provoked the assault or for some other good reason. Inevitably, a number of those claimants will feel aggrieved, even after they have exhausted the scheme's extensive appeals process. If they then feel that they can try yet another tack&#x2014;perhaps complaining to their Member of Parliament and, through their Member of Parliament, to the ombudsman that their case was rejected, not for perfectly proper reasons but because of some alleged maladministration&#x2014;they may well do so. That could clog the system with bogus claims, which would create a substantial extra burden, first, for the ombudsman himself,


and secondly, for the scheme's administrators, who would have to demonstrate that the real issue was one not of maladministration but of technical eligibility.<br/>
Thus, while on the one hand, I can see a need for workable and transparent checks and balances, I can also see a potential danger that such mechanisms&#x2014;unless they were carefully defined&#x2014;could be open to abuse. That would create a lot of nugatory work for everyone. That is why I say that we must think carefully about it and consider all the implications.<br/>
None the less, I can assure the House that, having listened to the arguments put forward and having heard other views, including those of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, we have decided that we must consider those views carefully and discuss them with him and others to see if that is a sensible route down which we should go.<br/>
In the meantime, it may not surprise the Opposition when I say that I cannot accept the technical terms of the amendment, which is technically flawed. That is not an accusation aimed at the Opposition. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) will rightly say that he does not have the resources and facilities that I have to ensure that amendments are legally and technically correct. I shall not go into the reasons why it is technically flawed, but I repeat my assurance to the House that we shall consider it carefully.<br/>
There may be merit in considering the parts of the scheme that in other Departments would come within the scope of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration to find out whether it would be possible to draw clear boundaries between matters that are the responsibility of the Secretary of State&#x2014;the overall administration of the scheme, for example&#x2014;and those that are not, and how one could clearly ring-fence other matters, such as decisions on individual claims, in which the Secretary of State would not be involved.<br/>
I hope that, on the basis that we shall carefully consider the idea with a positive attitude, the hon. Members for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) and for Cardiff, South and Penarth will feel reassured and will not wish to press the new clause.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1076975" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1995-06-29a.1101.0" hansard_membership_id="9116" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3097" speakername="Mr. Michael" colnum="1101" time="16:15:00">
<p>Of course I am pleased that the Minister has accepted that what we seek to do in the new clause is right. I am pleased that he has promised to consider it. But that does not go far enough. He has not promised to accept the principle that the ombudsman should have jurisdiction over the criminal injuries compensation scheme, or the necessity of building it into the Bill.<br/>
The Minister says that our new clause is flawed. That is curious, because we used the wording of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. If the new clause is deficient, there must be deficiencies in the Act that the Minister appears not to have identified.<br/>
In any event, the right hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that we do not have the expertise of Ministries and parliamentary draftsmen&#x2014;but may I point out to him that after today's debate there will be a Second Reading debate in the House of Lords, and also opportunities in Committee in the House of Lords for two days in October? There will then be a Report stage in November. Moreover, amendments are still acceptable on Third Reading in the House of Lords, so there are plenty of opportunities for the Home Secretary or his representative in another place to fine-tune what we have

proposed or to introduce changes, provided that that is accepted by those who will take part in the debates in another place.<br/>
There is therefore no reason why the Minister should not accept our new clause today, put the principle into the Bill and deal with any adjustments needed at a later stage. We want the ombudsman to have jurisdiction over the criminal injuries compensation scheme. So do the public, and so does the ombudsman. The new clause should be added to the Bill now, and if the Minister does not accept that, we shall divide the House.<br/>
<i>Question put,</i> That the clause be read a Second time:&#x2014;<br/>
<i>The House divided</i>: Ayes 183, Noes 248.</p>

<p>The purpose of the new clause and the schedule is to lay down some important principles under which the criminal injuries compensation scheme should operate. We have two main aims. First, the proposed changes will achieve the transparency that is so lamentably lacking in the Bill. We have said from the beginning that the Bill leaves far too much of the decision making in the hands of the Home Secretary and fails to include some details and principles. Time and again in Committee, we drew attention to the Government's failure to provide adequate details in the Bill.<br/>
We accept that every detail cannot be contained in the legislation; that would of course make it cumbersome and difficult to amend minor details. That is the excuse that the Minister has given on a variety of occasions for not putting basic principles in the Bill. We accept that some details can be contained in statutory instruments. The trouble with the Bill is that too many key aspects of the scheme are to be buried in statutory instruments, and other important elements, for example, in relation to reviews, appeals and time limits do not have to come before Parliament. Parliamentary scrutiny of the criminal injuries compensation scheme is of particular importance because of the history of this set of proposals and the Home Secretary's attempt to evade parliamentary scrutiny, even when he needed to observe it.<br/>
Our difficulties in Committee were compounded by the fact that the Government are yet to publish the scheme, which is the subject of the Bill. Opposition amendments have prised more details out of the Minister. Indeed, on 13 June in Committee, in column 57 of the <i>Official Report,</i> he gave us what he called a "golden assurance" that, if provision were included in the 1990 common law scheme, the new tariff scheme would operate in the same way.<br/>
Operating in the same way as the 1990 scheme is a clear principle, but it is also clear from the Minister's other answers that people will lose out. The cutting of finances by some &#x00A3;700 million demonstrates that there will be changes. That will be to the detriment of some of the people who seek support from the scheme.<br/>
The failure to have the schedule in draft makes it much more difficult for the Committee, Members of Parliament and people outside the House who take an interest to be absolutely clear on what principles the Home Secretary is operating. That is not unusual. I recall the Immigration Act 1988&#x2014;the first piece of legislation in which I was involved as a Whip. In meeting after meeting, we asked the Home Secretary to bring forward the immigration rules, without which that legislation meant virtually nothing. We have the same position with this legislation.<br/>
The Minister went part way by at least offering a letter to members of the Committee, together with information on the 1990 scheme and on the interim scheme that was found to be illegal, and he sidelined both those documents in such a way as to show which elements he intended to incorporate eventually in his scheme. That was helpful and I commend him for at least going part way, but he said to us that it would not be long before the scheme was prepared.<br/>
We know that the Bill will reach its Second Reading in the House of Lords in a couple of weeks. Will the Minister ensure that the scheme is published in full before Second Reading in another place? If those details are about to be prepared, presumably on the time scale in which the Minister expected to have the legislation through the House before the summer recess, will he give us a cast-iron guarantee that they will be published before the recess so that we can examine them?</p>

<p>A golden assurance.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1077001" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1995-06-29a.1107.1" hansard_membership_id="9116" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3097" speakername="Mr. Michael" colnum="1107" time="16:45:00">
<p>Will the Minister give us a golden assurance, as my hon. Friend suggests, that the full draft will be available to us before the summer?<br/>
This refers in a way to the previous debate, where the Minister cast aside the offer of advice from people involved in litigation by suggesting that his scheme would be available shortly and that they would be able to comment on it. There are plenty of reasons why the Minister should give us a golden promise to publish his scheme before the recess.<br/>
Publication before the recess would have a second benefit: it would enable the people who will deal with the debates and the people who will advise them in another place fully to consider the matter and the Minister's intentions before the debates in October in Committee, on Report and on Third Reading in another place. It would give an opportunity therefore for the Bill to proceed with some hope of its coming back to us, towards the end of this parliamentary Session, with reasonable amendments having been made in another place and with many of the difficulties that we have highlighted in Committee having been met by Ministers.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will give us that assurance because there is no excuse not to do so. From his own words at the beginning of Committee proceedings, it was

clear that the draft was at a complete stage in his in-tray. On the basis of his own assurances in Committee, it is clear that it would be bad faith for the Home Office not to publish the draft scheme, as well as its final draft of the tariff, before the summer and, certainly, before the debates in another place after the summer. There is no reason therefore for the Minister not to give a clear and unequivocal commitment on that aspect.<br/>
Our new clause and schedule show how the basic principles of the scheme could have been set up in legislation in the first place so that people were aware of the key elements of the scheme. That is the right way to proceed. Our proposal is transparent, clear and fair. The Minister should therefore accept those improvements, as well as promise to give us in quick time the small and more detailed elements that will be in the schedule.<br/>
Our second aim is to list some of those key principles which should be in the scheme. The first is that compensation paid under the scheme should be broadly the same as that available before the passing of the Act. From comments that have been made and quoted in the debate already, it seems that the Minister accepts that as a principle, but does he? It is crucial. In Committee, the Minister tried to tell us that victims would not lose out&#x2014;which would mean accepting that principle&#x2014;but the one thing that is transparent about the Bill is that the Government's key intention has been to cut the money available to innocent victims of crime.<br/>
The explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill makes that crystal clear. The amount that the Government intend to save over the next five financial years is &#x00A3;700 million, in a drop of 40 per cent. on planned expenditure. It surely cannot be said that no one will lose out. Many victims will lose out as a result of the proposals. The victims of the most serious crimes of violence will lose out.<br/>
We have highlighted how those savings will be made: by not paying loss of earnings in the first 28 weeks, by failing to upgrade the tariff between 1994 and 1999 and by capping maximum amounts. That cap will affect a small number of people, but, again, the victims of the most horrendous injuries will suffer. Savings should not be made at the expense of individual victims.<br/>
Secondly, there must be adequate compensation for loss of earnings. A large part of the savings that the Government are generating results from the decision not to pay loss of earnings in the first 28 weeks after injury. The Minister suggested in our debate on 15 June that all the savings would be the result of that one measure alone. We do not believe that to be the case, but it is certainly a substantial element.<br/>
The Government have justified their choice of 28 weeks by pointing to statutory sick pay. The inference is that victims will be adequately recompensed during that period. That is not the case. Statutory sick pay is &#x00A3;52.50 a week&#x2014;hardly an adequate recompense for those unable to work because of a serious criminal injury. Many people are not entitled to SSP, including the self-employed, those on a low income and those on short-term contracts. Some may be entitled to incapacity benefit, but that is no more generous than SSP. Others will get income support, but that is even less than SSP.<br/>
Some people have their SSP enhanced by occupational sick pay schemes, but there is considerable variation in entitlement from one scheme to another. It is common for five years' length of service to be a condition before a


half-year's full sick pay is given. Taking all those factors together, it has been calculated that 12 million people&#x2014;at least half those in employment&#x2014;do not receive full pay during the first 28 weeks of sickness and will therefore be at risk under the Government's proposals. They will be worse off.<br/>
The third principle that we want to enshrine in the Bill is proper provision for special expenses to allow the individual to remain in employment or to retrain, to provide the additional costs of alleviating the effects of disability, to make provision for reasonable child care costs and to pay for medical treatment where that is not readily available from the national health service.<br/>
The scheme must make provision for relatives or others who give up their jobs to care for the victims of crime. Very often, Ministers and others pay lip service to the carers, who are often the silent sufferers after someone suffers an accident or is in ill health. Those silent sufferers should be provided for in the scheme and that should be made clear in the Bill.<br/>
I hope that the Minister's golden assurance means that all those areas of special expenses will be covered to help those incapacitated for more than 28 weeks. I hope that, even at this late stage, he will rethink his proposals and allow expenses to be paid where appropriate when the individual is incapacitated for less than 28 weeks.<br/>
The next point of principle is that provision should be made for the impact of a bereavement on the former dependants of the deceased. I do not think that this is a matter of contention between the Opposition and the Government. It was discussed in Committee and it would be helpful if the Minister would now make his commitment clear. In Committee, he responded positively when we referred to the impact of special requirements for funerals&#x2014;for example, cultural and religious requirements may lead to additional costs for a family who are already in enormous pain and difficulty because of the death of a family member. That element should be allowed for in the Bill and I hope that the Minister will make as clear today as he did in Committee his agreement with us on that point.<br/>
We believe that the ability to make interim arrangements should be clearly written into the Bill. In Committee on 20 June, the Minister admitted that the wording of the original discredited tariff scheme for interim payments was unsatisfactory. He said that it needed a tweak. It needs more than just a tweak; clear principles need to be set out in the Bill.<br/>
The new schedule makes provision for reasonable time limits for the determination of reviews and appeals. It is important that victims receive prompt and efficient treatment. Many references to the tariff scheme have suggested that speeding up the system is one of the benefits. We want to ensure that the determination of reviews and appeals, as well as the original decision, happens quickly. Victims, especially those where there are special circumstances and therefore, in many cases, special stress, should not have to wait a long time for a determination of their cases simply because they have asked for a review or for an appeal against a decision. All those principles are important in ensuring that victims receive the prompt and efficient treatment that we believe they are entitled to expect.<br/>
We have attempted to bring flexibility into the scheme. That, too, is an important principle. When we suggested improvements in Committee, the Minister said that we

were trying to constrain the scheme. We made it absolutely clear that we wanted a scheme that would respond quickly to the needs of victims and that could be flexible where necessary. I do not mean unnecessarily flexible, which might result in a long-winded system to deal with the cases that come before the body and the appellate body; we want a reasonable flexibility so that fairness can be guaranteed.<br/>
We propose that for multiple injury, sexual assault, chronic psychiatric illness and injuries to children there should be a mechanism to allow compensation to be calculated having regard to awards at common law. I think that the Minister will accept that those cases are difficult to value. That is especially true with children's cases, which do not readily fall within a tariff scheme. Complex injuries can have a traumatic effect on an individual. Those factors should be taken fully into account in decision making within the new system. We need some mechanism to ensure that awards in such cases are comparable with the awards available at common law.<br/>
We believe that the new clause and new schedule lay down clear and fair principles to underpin a just criminal injuries compensation scheme. We believe that the speeding up of matters through a tariff system that deals with the simpler cases quickly and effectively will be enhanced by building in the principles set out in the new schedule.<br/>
I commend both the new clause and the new schedule to the House.</p>

<p>I commend the diligent work of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). From the time of the original proposal by the Home Secretary to use the prerogative to destroy the 1964-based Act right through to this debate, my hon. Friend has harried the Government and made them amend many of their original proposals.<br/>
I also commend the work done in the other place. For me, it would be a happier circumstance if I could commend a second Chamber whose Members had been elected and were therefore representative rather than hereditary. However, it shows that where honest men gather the Government are tripped up and sent packing.<br/>
I declare an interest, as I am sponsored by the Union of Communication Workers. I do not represent that body with any lack of pride, although I do it with some sorrow because, on many occasions, it has been shown that the membership comprises people involved in a dangerous occupation. When, in parts of Northern Ireland, there was talk of the peace process, postal workers in Newry were being attacked and one was killed. Recently in Birmingham, while this Bill was being discussed, a postman emptying a post box was subjected to a fatal assault, just so that the attacker could rob the contents of the post box. I therefore commend the new schedule, which would provide for clearer details and more compensation for fatal injury cases.<br/>
My hon. Friend referred to the Government's proposal for 28 weeks without compensation, other than whatever might come through a Government scheme. The Government are treating the matter like a workplace injury. Of course, such an injury should not necessarily be demeaned. It is ridiculous to treat an injury that is the result of a criminal act&#x2014;in the case of a postal worker, it will probably be an attempt to seize money, postal orders or some other thing in the custody of the Post Office&#x2014;in


the same way as any trip-and-fall accident at work. Clearly, the Government have made no allowances for the difference. This is all about saving &#x00A3;700 million, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said, regardless of the impact on the victim.<br/>
5 pm<br/>
Clearly, additional living costs and traumas come with a criminal injury that would not come with any other form of injury and such injuries should not be compensated by a tariff method. They should not be put into a banding. Although the tariff has been increased after a splendid campaign by the Trades Union Congress and other honourable people, it is not adequate and I think the Government realise that. Previous compensation schemes took into account the concept of trauma: one may get over a physical injury quickly and go back to work, but one will not necessarily get over the trauma of having been the victim of a criminal attack.<br/>
I am pleased to see some consideration for carers in the scheme in the new schedule. Often, the burden of the traumas, deterioration in life style and inability to cope with life some years after a criminal attack fall on the family and the carers. The Government take no account of that and have, in fact, ignored it, pretending that it is not real. It is as if medical science is ignored by the Government if it cannot be afforded by the Government.<br/>
I am unhappy about the fact that the Government have not considered tariff levels that would be adequate for cases of sexual criminal attacks. It is clear that they are turning away from something of which more and more people are becoming aware&#x2014;that the traumas caused by a sexual attack will last for the rest of the victim's life.<br/>
The maximum awards will be capped, which will adversely affect the small number of victims with the most catastrophic injuries. It is as if the Government are saying that previous compensation was too generous&#x2014;they use that word pejoratively. How can compensation for a criminal attack be too generous? Presumably, the assessments are made on the basis that the trauma, the injury and its life-long effects are such that the money paid will never rub them out but will help to make life a little more bearable&#x2014;that is all that the money ever does.<br/>
The Government's proposal is not tough on crime and the consequences of crime but tough on the victims and the families of victims, especially as regards members of professions who handle money regularly and are likely to be attacked regularly. Statistics show that members of the Union of Communication Workers&#x2014;formerly the postal workers&#x2014;are attacked regularly. If the Government do not take on board my hon. Friend's suggestion and introduce a scheme based on the new schedule, they should be ashamed.</p>

<p>When we attempted in Committee to convince the Minister of the merits of the issues in new clause 3 and amendment No. 4, it would be fair to say that his general view was that he did not want to burden the Bill with details and minutiae. We tried to convince him that the issues were not details or minutiae but important principles. Although we accepted his argument that we were clearly not arguing for every t to be crossed and every i dotted&#x2014;clearly that would be irresponsible and unrealistic&#x2014;by the same token, he appears to have

gone to the opposite extreme: he views all the issues of principle that we try to incorporate in the Bill as minutiae that should be discounted.<br/>
To be fair, the Minister told us that the details would be there for everyone to see when the scheme was made available. "Trust me" was the general tenor of his proposition. Fair enough, but if we are talking about principles, why on earth can they not at least be reflected in a schedule to the Bill? What does the Minister find so objectionable about the principles to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) referred?<br/>
We are not talking about details and they will not burden civil servants in the Home Office, making them burn the midnight oil. They are important principles and I hope that, even at this late stage, the Minister will reflect on that fact and recognise it. It is important for those principles to be contained in the Bill, albeit in a schedule.<br/>
In Committee, when the Minister described the Government's scheme, he repeatedly said that it is the best in the world.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman will know that, every time I said that our scheme is the best in the world, I was referring not merely to how it is administered but to the huge sums available. Financially, it is as big as the United States scheme and bigger than those of the rest of Europe put together. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the extra money that we envisage making available during the next few years is spelt out in the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill? That is not something that the Opposition have spelt out.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1077007" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1995-06-29a.1112.3" hansard_membership_id="234" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3352" speakername="Mr. Stevenson" colnum="1112" time="16:45:00">
<p>I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out that important issue. I am prepared to recognise that the Government intend to cut the resources available to people injured by criminal activity by &#x00A3;700 million. That is part of the financial package to which he referred.<br/>
I will not be deflected from my argument. If the scheme is so good, why are the Government so secretive? The Minister has yet to answer that question, but it is a fair one. Why not list in the schedule the principles on which this so-called world-beating scheme&#x2014;although it will cut &#x00A3;700 million from the available resources&#x2014;is based?<br/>
Another significant matter that all hon. Members should consider is that the Bill is the result of Government mistakes during the past couple of years. The Government rushed through their first attempt to introduce a tariff scheme and did not consider the implications carefully enough. They had to backtrack on it because of the mistakes made, and here we are considering a revised tariff scheme. That is a direct result of the fact that the sort of principles that we want included in the Bill were not being fully considered in the first place.<br/>
One can give example after example of Acts of Parliament that the Government have bulldozed through the House without thinking them through. Minister after Minister has had to come to the Dispatch Box and do U-turn after U-turn. If the Minister would agree with us


about anything, I am sure that he would agree that the Government do not want to be in that position again; but unless those principles are contained in the Bill, we suspect that that is inevitable.<br/>
I shall deal with just a couple of issues in the time available as I do not wish to repeat what my hon. Friends have said. The first issue worth underlining is the principle of uprating contained in amendment No. 4. The new tariff scheme will be based on 1994 tariffs, will not come into effect until 1 April 1996 and will not be reviewed for three years. That means that a five-year period will pass before those tariffs are reviewed. Is that not a matter of profound principle? Will not families and everyone who is tragically injured as a result of criminal activity be interested in that? Could not the Minister reasonably seek to deal with that? Is it right that people should be faced with a built-in devaluation of the tariff award? Five years of inflation will eat away at the value of the tariff award. That is an important principle, not detail or minutiae.<br/>
The second point relates to the Government's insistence on the 28-week rule. Having listened to their arguments, I am convinced that they insist on it because it is administratively convenient&#x2014;it happens to fit in with activities in other areas and it saves money. After a criminal injury, many people will have no income, other than &#x00A3;52 a week if they qualify for statutory sick pay, which many will not. The income of others will be dramatically reduced. Their lives will have been transformed through criminal injury and they will need support. I can think of no time when they will need that resource more than in the first 28 weeks; to deny them it during that period is the worst thing that the Government could do.<br/>
For those and many other reasons, I hope that, even at this late stage, the Minister will recognise the strength of the arguments in both the new clause and the amendment, and consider our points sympathetically.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1077008" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1995-06-29a.1113.0" hansard_membership_id="8391" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2989" speakername="Mr. Maclean" colnum="1113" time="16:45:00">
<p>Perhaps I might deal briefly with the last point the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) made and the sheer illogicality of his suggestion. He said that people who receive lesser injuries and are off work for 28 weeks need support immediately after the injury or trauma. With the best will in the world, in those first, crucial, few weeks, there is no chance of anyone applying to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, completing the paperwork, being assessed and having an award made. Even the most efficient scheme in the world will take a few months to process the application, so the hon. Gentleman's argument that, by setting a 28-week threshold, we are disadvantaging people who would have had an instantaneous pay-out from the moment that they were injured does not hold water.<br/>
5.15 pm<br/>
New clause 3 and amendment No. 4 seek to prescribe on the face of the Bill some of the features of the new scheme which, although not mandatory&#x2014;the Secretary of State would, in theory, have to have regard only to general principles that are cast in such terms as the scheme "ought" to make the provisions in question&#x2014;would, in practice, clearly circumscribe the Secretary of State's actions. He would obviously be vulnerable to challenge if, without good reason, the scheme did not reflect each and every one of the principles.<br/>
We have a much more fundamental objection, however. I am afraid that, while we have no difficulty with some of the principles set out in the new schedule, others are unacceptable, as Opposition Members will know from the lengthy and detailed debates that we have had on the Floor of the House and especially in Committee.<br/>
I do not propose to discuss all the principles in great detail yet again. The arguments are clearly set out in the <i>Official Report</i> for all to see. I shall, however, mention just a few of the more unacceptable items. First is the requirement that compensation payable under the new scheme should be broadly the same as that available under the old one. We have made no secret of the fact that one of the main reasons for seeking to bring in a new scheme was to rein back the cost of the old scheme, which was rising at an unsustainable rate. It is inevitable, therefore, that we shall spend less under the new scheme than we would have under the old scheme if it had continued unchanged.<br/>
It is also clear that we shall spend huge and increasing sums of money. I remind the House and the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), who kept talking about cuts, cuts, cuts, that, under the enhanced tariff scheme proposed in the Bill, we anticipate that the liability to compensation in 1996&#x2013;97 will rise to &#x00A3;175 million. In 1997&#x2013;98 it will rise to &#x00A3;190 million&#x2014;some cut. The year after, it will rise to &#x00A3;205 million, and the following year we reckon that it will be up to &#x00A3;240 million.<br/>
Under the scheme that I recommend to the House today, and which the Opposition keep saying is mean and will impose cuts, the annual liability will have risen to no less than &#x00A3;260 million by 2000, and the cumulative liability in the five years to then will be no less than &#x00A3;1.1 billion.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that the words that he used were carefully chosen? He said that he anticipated an increase in liability. That is not the same as an increase in what is available to compensate individual victims of serious crime. Surely the Minister understands the difference.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1077010" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1995-06-29a.1114.1" hansard_membership_id="8391" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2989" speakername="Mr. Maclean" colnum="1114" time="16:45:00">
<p>I understand the difference, but the Opposition do not. That remark is typical of them. They call for more money for individuals, but everyone will get more money. The shadow Chancellor, the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown), says that, overall, the Labour party will not spend more. "We are going to be prudent. We shall be tighter than the Tories in global expenditure terms," says the Labour party, but in every debate in Committee, it sought through its amendments to spend more money, widen the banding, increase the awards by 20 per cent. and remove the 28-week threshold.<br/>
Every argument advanced by Opposition Members in Committee and here today is to increase the amount of money available. I do not criticise that view if they want to give even more money than we are giving to victims of crime, but if that is their policy, they should have the decency to say so and spell it out clearly that, by 2000, the scheme will cost &#x00A3;700 million more than the &#x00A3;1,000 million that we estimate it will cost.<br/>
It is no good the Opposition uttering weasel words and saying, "We won't change the scheme if you won't." The Bill shows that we are changing the scheme because the


exponential growth in awards&#x2014;they are rising higher and higher each year and way above inflation&#x2014;is not sustainable.</p>

<p>Once I have finished this point I shall happily give way to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
With our new, enhanced tariff scheme, not only will liability increase each year, but we expect it to remain the most generous in the world.<br/>
The starting point for what we are doing in the Bill is the fact that, in the United Kingdom, the money paid to innocent victims of crime is as much as the whole of the United States of America, with its huge economy and large number of victims of violent crime, can muster. Little old Great Britain is paying out in compensation to victims of crime more than every other country in Europe put together.<br/>
We are usually criticised by the Opposition at every opportunity&#x2014;whenever they perceive that countries in Europe are better than Britain. No one is better than the Opposition at criticising Britain for not being as good as other countries in Europe but, in Committee and on Report today, we have heard not a cheep from the Opposition about other countries in Europe. They cannot say anything, because they know that the figures I have given to the House are correct.</p>

<p>I did not know whether the Minister would ever be able to stem that flow, he was getting so carried away with his own words. It is a pity that no one else believes what he says these days.<br/>
The proposed new schedule refers to fatal injury. Does the right hon. Gentleman think it unreasonable to operate a scheme that provides adequate compensation for "appropriate funeral expenses"? Does he not think it reasonable that the scheme should provide for the dependants of people such as the members of my trade union who were killed while on work duties? The cost to the state of such families falling into benefit and encountering other problems because of the loss of their main breadwinner and fathers would be offset by an adequate payment from a compensation scheme in the first place. Does not all the money come out of the same pocket at the end of the day? Compensation stops further deprivation, so does not that save the state money?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman had bothered to read any of our debates in Committee, he would have known fine that those commitments were given. I assured hon. Members that those who were eligible in broad terms under the 1990 scheme would be covered by the new scheme, which we intend should mirror the 1990 one. I gave the assurances sought on benefits and fatal awards. I give a similar assurance now to the hon. Gentleman about the different expenses of multi-cultural funerals.<br/>
I have no problem with some of the provisions suggested in the "principles" because I have already given the assurance that we intend to bring forward as soon as possible a scheme that mirrors the 1990 scheme in most respects. I have also said, however, that I cannot accept some of the other principles that the Opposition have proposed, which would mean spending more and more money without declaring when the bottom line would be reached.<br/>
The "principles" also suggest that loss of earnings should be payable from the date of the injury. Our scheme will make provision for the loss of earnings, so that those most seriously affected by their injury receive generous compensation. There needs to be a trigger for that, however, so that the extra help is given to the more seriously injured, and so that the authority is not swamped with a large number of comparatively small claims for loss of earnings&#x2014;which are very time consuming to process.<br/>
It is not acceptable that loss of earnings should be payable from the date of the injury. That would, in effect, be a recipe for a return to the old scheme and all its attendant shortcomings. We must not forget that there is still an element for loss of earnings and the other heads of damage payable under the old scheme in every tariff award, since the tariff award was based on the median&#x2014;the most typical&#x2014;award for the injury concerned.<br/>
We have made it clear that we are going to pay special expenses; we have also made it clear what is meant by that term. In broad terms, it means that if something qualified for expenses under the 1990 scheme, it will qualify for special expenses under the enhanced tariff scheme. If it did not qualify under the 1990 scheme, it will not qualify under our new enhanced tariff scheme. I do not think I can make things much plainer than that. I repeat the golden assurance that I gave in Committee.<br/>
We will not extend the scope of special expenses to cover the completely new items mentioned in the schedule, which would cost a lot more money than the Opposition suggest.<br/>
In fatal cases, in addition to the basic tariff award which all qualifying claimants will receive, we shall pay reasonable funeral expenses. I confirm to the hon. Member for Falkirk, East that reasonable funeral expenses will be paid in all cases. That will reflect not only regional differences in costs, but differences in religious or cultural practices and expectations. We are, of course, well aware of the different funeral arrangements that are necessary in different circumstances and the different costs that can arise. The new authority, just like the old Criminal Injuries Compensation Board will, of course, consider all claims sympathetically and reimburse reasonable expenses.<br/>
Where there was financial dependency on the victim, payment for that dependency will be payable as well as payment for loss of parental support. In that case, too, provision is generous and will be broadly in line with what is payable under the present scheme.<br/>
The "principles" next mention interim awards. Here, too, we are one jump ahead. We have made it plain that interim awards will be paid whenever it is considered appropriate.<br/>
The "principles" finally suggest that there should be a return to the common law method of assessment for cases involving multiple injury, sexual assault, chronic psychiatric injury or injuries to children. I have to say there can be no question of returning to the common law method of assessment for any class of injury.<br/>
The tariff scheme was derived from 20,000 awards made by the board. That extensive exercise showed quite clearly that it was perfectly possible to group all injuries into bands of comparable severity and to assign a typical value&#x2014;the median value&#x2014;to each band. We believe that the enhanced tariff fairly reflects the relative seriousness


of the injuries listed, and we see no justification for assessing the basic award other than on the basis of the enhanced tariff. If victims are more seriously affected by their injury, they will, as I have just explained, be eligible for loss of earnings and the costs of special care.<br/>
I must tell the House about the inevitable consequence of allowing individual assessment in the case of multiple injury. Most claimants&#x2014;or, more probably, their clever representatives&#x2014;would claim that they had suffered multiple injury. They would therefore demand individual assessment. Even where the claim turned out to be manifestly bogus, it would still take time and resources to investigate it. Our formula for determining multiple awards&#x2014;100 per cent. of the tariff award for the most serious injury, plus 10 per cent. of the award for the next injury and 5 per cent. for the third&#x2014;broadly reflects what happens under the present scheme and in the civil courts. I believe that it is the right way to assess those cases quickly and fairly.<br/>
In conclusion, I think our enhanced tariff scheme is already based on the right "principles". I can tell hon. Members that we hope to be able to make a draft of the new scheme available to the House shortly. It will set out more clearly and more fully just what the new scheme will cover and what it will not cover. The so-called "principles" set out in the amendment are overly prescriptive and, in many instances, unnecessary.</p>

<p>Could the Minister offer us a definition of the word "shortly"? That word has been used on many occasions. We were told that the Committee stage would be completed "shortly".

<p>May I say to the hon. Gentleman in the nicest possible way that "shortly" means "not long"? It is my intention to publish those details as soon as possible. Perhaps I may be more unkind to the hon. Gentleman. It is a bit rich for him to ask me to define the word "shortly" and to be more specific about when I will be able to produce the details of the scheme when he has had ample time to add up the costs of his proposals.<br/>
Time after time, I have said from the Dispatch Box that we have included costs in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has spoken about cuts, but I have pointed out today that we will increase the amount of money available year after year. We expect liability to increase year after year. By 2000, we expect to be paying out &#x00A3;260 million as opposed to &#x00A3;175 million next year. We have been able to spell all that out, but the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) and other Labour Members, although calling for more money for victims here, there and everywhere, and promising that a Labour Government would be more generous, while saying that we are mean-spirited, have never once added up the figures.<br/>
We do not know the bottom line on the hon. Gentleman's proposals, just as we do not know the bottom line on any of the Opposition's policies. That is why the Labour party has been instructed not to cost its policies&#x2014;just in case some wicked Tory points out that all its promises will cost an awful lot. That is just not good enough. I call on the hon. Gentleman to state quite clearly how much his proposals would cost. We do not want to

hear the weasel form of words that the Opposition have used in the past, to the effect, "If you don't change the scheme, we won't either." I am telling him: we are changing the scheme. There it is. We have produced the Bill and we know what it will cost. What is he going to do?</p>

<p>I am glad that the Minister has finally come clean&#x2014;he is no longer saying that the scheme will be more or less the same as the 1990 scheme. He has accepted that the compensation payable under the scheme will be cut dramatically. He is cutting the compensation available for victims of the most violent crimes. He has admitted that he is cutting criminal injury compensation by &#x00A3;700 million in the next five years.<br/>
How on earth does the right hon. Gentleman have the cheek to ask for plain language from the Opposition when he talks about such cuts? How can he put such contradictions before the House? How can he say, "I am not cutting anything, but I am cutting &#x00A3;700 million"? He made that contradiction explicit this evening.<br/>
Plain language&#x2014;that will be the day, when we get plain language from Home Office Ministers. "Shortly"&#x2014;when does "shortly" mean? "Shortly" might have a clear definition; it might have the definition "tomorrow". The Minister might say, "I shall publish the details of the scheme tomorrow." He might promise to publish them next week. He could have published them during the Committee stage, because we know that the document has been drafted. We know that it is there in his in-tray. We know that it is available. He has simply chosen to delay its presentation until after Committee and Report.<br/>
The Minister cannot get away with continued prevarication. He needs to publish the details of the scheme before the summer recess. It was obviously his original intention to do so, because he believed that the Bill would have passed through the House by that time. There is no excuse for his not publishing the scheme and putting the details in the public domain before debates take place in another place. It could not be plainer than that.<br/>
5.30 pm<br/>
The weasel words of the Minister, who finds it so difficult to define the word "shortly", give no satisfaction to the House. He says that he accepts some of the principles that we propose in the new schedule. I welcome the fact that he dealt positively with the matter of funeral expenses. He also tried to say that things would be broadly the same as under the existing scheme but, effectively, everything that he says is an admission that he is cutting cash for victims, although he has continually tried to say that no one will lose out.<br/>
Listen to the Minister's words during the debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker. He says that he anticipates that liability will increase in the next few years. We have always known that. An increase in liability has been predicted&#x2014;although the figures are not totally dependable&#x2014;by the Home Office and other organisations such as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. What is being cut is the cash compensation available to individual victims of the most serious crime. Such people have been penalised by the Government.<br/>
The Home Secretary and the Minister tried to tell us that there had been a drop in crime&#x2014;that crime is 5 per cent. down. The Minister knows as well as I do that


violent crime has increased by about 7 per cent., and that the criminal injuries compensation scheme deals only with the victims of violent crime&#x2014;only with the victims of that increasing violence.<br/>
The Minister pulls schemes out of the bag, as his colleague the Home Secretary does. Do you remember schemes for secure places, Mr. Deputy Speaker? They were promised four years ago. Not a place has been provided. Youngsters were going to be locked up. Where are the places? What is happening? No, we get only rhetoric and talk about being tough on crime from the Government, not the action or the resources necessary to tackle the problems.<br/>
The Minister has no credibility when he tries to castigate us, when we have made it clear that we would maintain the level of compensation available for individual victims of violent crime. I said that clearly, in the words&#x2014;to which I am glad that the Minister has listened, even if he has not understood&#x2014;"If you do not cut the scheme, Mr. Minister, we will not cut the scheme." The Government are determined to make the victims of violent crime pay for the failings of the Conservative party in government. That is what it comes down to. That is what it is about.<br/>
Our proposal for urgent compensation in respect of loss of earnings is not as generous as the Minister suggests. We need a trigger; the trigger is the loss of earnings. Pain and loss do not start after 28 weeks. Indeed, very often pain, suffering and the problems of the individual and the family are greater during the first 28 weeks than afterwards. They are immediate. What is proposed is a cut. If the Minister is one jump ahead of the principles, if the scheme is so good, if he has the details of it so well sorted out, as he suggested, why does not he publish it? Why has he kept it secret from us? Why has he not given us the details?<br/>
Our suspicion is justified by what the Home Secretary tried to do, without being held accountable to the House&#x2014;changing the scheme dramatically and downgrading all its aspects. His U-turn does not go far enough. That scheme remains in essence a serious cut in the compensation available for the people who are most injured and damaged by violent crime.<br/>
That is why, in view of the unsatisfactory response of the Minister, we shall seek to place the new clause and the proposed schedule on the face of the Bill.<br/>
<i>Question put,</i> That the clause be read a Second time:&#x2014;<br/>

<p>Amendment Nos. 1, 2 and 3 seek to amend the Bill to ensure that appeals are dealt with properly. There has been considerable concern for a number of years that appeals should be dealt with in a proper and a transparent manner. The key sentence in the Franks report of 1957 states:
<q>tribunals should properly be regarded as machinery provided by Parliament for adjudication rather than as part of the machinery of administration".</q>
That is a particularly important principle, but it is not observed by the Bill or enshrined in it. We made progress in Committee with regard to adjudicators' responsibilities for giving advice, both as a body and individually on the basis of what occurs in particular appeals, and to perform by looking at the wider context of the operation of the criminal injuries compensation scheme and the ways in which it must operate in order to deliver compensation to victims effectively.<br/>
However, a system of transparency has not been established. The quotation from the Franks report makes it absolutely clear that the appeals mechanism should be a proper judicial or semi-judicial approach, rather than being simply another step in the administrative process. If that principle is to be observed, it is important to establish proper machinery for appeals and adjudication, which we believe should appear in the Bill.<br/>
Amendment No. 1 states that the appointment of a legally qualified chairman of the body dealing with appeals shall be made by the Lord Chancellor. That is not a new principle and it has been established elsewhere, but it is right to adopt it in this case. The Council on Tribunals commented on the qualifications of tribunal chairmen in its model rules of procedure:
<q>The constitution, general structure and composition of tribunals will, as a rule, be a matter for the enabling Act".</q>
The council's advice accepts that there are exceptions and sets them out, particularly in relation to the Finance Act. That general principle is right, but is not included in the Bill's phrasing. The council added:
<q>The division between what appears in the Act and what should appear in the rules may well be the result of Parliamentary or professional interest in the subject matter or jurisdiction; equally it may be arbitrary.</q>

I believe that all hon. Members agree that it should not be arbitrary, but properly considered and decided by the House. The council continues:
<q>It is usual where a presidential system is to be established for that to be done in the enabling Act, which will also prescribe the necessary qualifications for the President and his terms and conditions of service".</q>
It is difficult to understand why that should not be the case in the Bill. In Committee, the Minister said that there would be simple cases of an abuse of process or undue delay in which there was no merit, which a single adjudicator could examine and dismiss. Even so, in the general run of appeals where there is an issue to be decided, there should be a proper tribunal, properly chaired. Above all, the chairman of the appeals body should be legally qualified in the terms of amendment No. 3, to ensure that the system operates effectively.<br/>
The Minister said that in appointing adjudicators, it was the Home Secretary's clear intention to select not just legally qualified individuals but persons experienced in employment, trade union work and medical matters. There should be that spread of experience, but it is important also that the jurisdiction of the Council on Tribunals should apply and that a legally qualified person should chair the appeals body to ensure that proper procedures are observed.<br/>
The principle of a legally qualified chairman is enhanced by accepting the normal practice in relation to tribunal chairmen, whereby his removal or that of other individuals should be subject to the Lord Chancellor's agreement. In Committee, the Minister said that he was keen that there should not be the remotest opportunity for interference by the Home Secretary in the body that will deal with criminal injuries compensation when the Bill is enacted and the scheme implemented. He wanted to ensure that there could not be interference by Ministers, using a form of words that&#x2014;as I said earlier&#x2014;was ill advised because it could bear other interpretations, such as excluding from the appeals body the jurisdiction of the ombudsman. The Minister at least paid lip service to the principle of non-interference that we seek to enshrine in the Bill.<br/>
If it is ensured that persons appointed by the Home Secretary undertake their duties under the chairmanship of the overall body of a legally qualified individual appointed by the Lord Chancellor, there can be no doubt of the objectivity and transparency of the Bill's arrangements. If the removal of individuals is also subject to the Lord Chancellor's agreement, as with other tribunals, that will provide the public with a measure of comfort and clarity, that the body will not be the creature of the Home Secretary. The amendments will be helpful to the Minister in enshrining the principle that he agreed should be the one governing appeals&#x2014;objectivity and a lack of interference by Home Office Ministers. In other words, it would be a proper judicial or quasi-judicial body, whose fairness would be transparent, and the independence of the persons who made appeal decisions would be obvious. I hope that the Minister will accept these three minor but important amendments.</p>

<p>Clause 5(3)(b) enables the scheme to provide for the Secretary of State to appoint a chairman of the appeals panel from among the adjudicators who make up its membership. Amendment No. 1 would


amend that power, so that any such provision of the scheme would require the Lord Chancellor to appoint the chairman. It would also require the chairman to be legally qualified, and amendment No. 3 defines "legally-qualified". Amendment No. 2 would require the Lord Chancellor's agreement before the Secretary of State could remove an adjudicator from office under the powers provided by clause 5(7).<br/>
I listened carefully and respectfully, as usual, to the hon. Gentleman's opinions, but the amendments are not appropriate to the purpose of the Bill or the scheme. The most obvious objection is that the Lord Chancellor has no direct interest in the running of the scheme. It therefore makes no sense to involve him in responsibility for appointing the chairman of the appeals panel. The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland will have overall responsibility for the running of the scheme, and in appointing a chairman of the appeals panel, they will have to consider wider questions about the requirements of the post in the context of the efficient running of the appeals panel and its advice-giving role to the Secretary of State.<br/>
For the same reasons, it would not be appropriate to require the Lord Chancellor's agreement to the removal of an adjudicator from office. I have no doubt, however, that we would consult the Lord Chancellor in the unhappy and, I hope, remote event that we had to consider removing a legally qualified adjudicator from office. We would also consult as appropriate on the question of appointing a legally qualified chairman. Although this does not need to be stated in the Bill, of course we would consult the Lord Chancellor as appropriate on appointing a legally qualified chairman. Such matters are part of the Government's normal modus operandi.<br/>
As to whether the chairman should be legally qualified, our responsibility is to see that the most suitable person is appointed as chairman. The needs of the scheme and the needs of victims are paramount. As the House knows, we intend to appoint adjudicators from a wide range of backgrounds. It is certainly our firm intention that the first chairman at least should be legally qualified, but it would be wrong to rule out absolutely any possibility that at some future date it might be appropriate to appoint a non-lawyer as chairman. Legal questions frequently arise in the running of the scheme, and if the chairman was not a lawyer but, for example, a doctor, we would expect him to consult the legally qualified adjudicators as necessary. But to insist on a legally qualified chairman is an unnecessary restriction.<br/>
I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's points, but if we accepted the amendments, they would place an unnecessary restriction on the scheme's operation and the modus operandi for appointing a legally qualified chairman and other adjudicators. I cannot accept the amendments.</p>

<p>It is intriguing that something is a clear principle when it is wanted by a Minister, but is said to introduce unnecessary restriction when proposed by anyone else. The Government are always inconsistent in dealing with such matters, as we have seen today. It is sad that relations between the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor are so bad that a requirement to ensure transparency and fairness in the appointment and

removal of adjudicators is viewed as introducing convoluted and bureaucratic delay. I dare say that matters will improve in the near future.<br/>

<p>I beg to move, to leave out from "That" to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof:
<q>this House declines to give a Third Reading to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Bill because it provides for a tariff of amounts of compensation in respect of criminal injuries without flexibility in special cases, gives extensive powers to the Secretary of State to frame a Scheme for criminal injuries compensation with insufficient parliamentary scrutiny, includes provision for the contracting-out of what should be a public service function, and includes provisions to exonerate the Secretary of State of responsibility for the conduct of the Scheme.</q>
The country knows that today the Conservative party is in a deep crisis. The people of Britain have so lost confidence in the governing party that the party has comprehensively lost confidence in itself, as well as in its Cabinet and its leader. At the heart of the crisis of confidence is the issue of trust. The Conservative party made promises during the general election campaign, which it swiftly and cynically broke. It has broken promises on
tax&#x2014;</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My remarks are about the Bill and its contents. As I was about to say, the Bill writes into law a broken promise to the victims of violent crime. It was in the 1992 Conservative campaign guide that the Conservatives boasted of the generosity of the then common law scheme. They declared that, when a crime had taken place, the Government would give the utmost priority to supporting the victims. Nothing was said about any intention to cut or replace the scheme.<br/>
The manifesto on which the Conservatives fought and won the general election campaign promised that special attention would be paid to the needs of the victims of crime. However, the Bill cuts almost in half the compensation that will be payable, and punishes the victims of violent crime for the Government's failure to control that crime.<br/>
There are many major defects in the scheme that is before the House. There is no compensation for loss of earnings before 28 weeks, despite the fact, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) has eloquently testified, that at least 12 million people do not receive statutory sick pay for the preceding 28 weeks. There is no payment for special expenses. Maximum awards will be capped, adversely affecting those with catastrophic injuries.<br/>
In some instances the tariff is extremely low, especially for sexual offences. Tariff levels, which are basically the same as those in the discredited 1994 tariff, will not be reviewed until 1999. The tariff provides no flexibility in difficult cases.<br/>
Published this morning were the minutes of evidence given to the Select Committee on Home Affairs on 3 May 1995. Senior officials in the Home Office gave evidence about the compensation scheme, among other matters. The permanent secretary, when talking about the old scheme, referred to 33 awards for punctured lung injuries in 1991&#x2013;92. The awards ranged from &#x00A3;601 to &#x00A3;29,203. The permanent secretary said that he was struck by the "enormous range". So may we all be.<br/>
The common law scheme, however, was designed to provide compensation directly related to the individual's circumstances and needs. Under the new scheme, the tariff for a punctured lung will be set at &#x00A3;3,000. Save for the most exceptional cases, no one will receive more than &#x00A3;3,000. Those who might have received &#x00A3;29,203 will receive over &#x00A3;26,000 less than that.<br/>
At the heart of the justification for the Bill is the Government's desire to cut costs. They wish to cut the compensation that is available to victims, especially to those of the most serious crime.<br/>
The estimates that are used to justify the cuts are scarcely worth the paper on which they are printed. The Conservative campaign guide stated, in an attempt to justify the changes, that costs would rise to &#x00A3;570 million by the year 2000. In the explanatory and financial memorandum, we are told that the costs will rise instead to &#x00A3;460 million.<br/>
When I put this point to the Secretary of State on 23 May on Second Reading, the right hon. and learned Gentleman said:
<q>The latter is a more up-to-date estimate. The hon. Gentleman may not have noticed that inflation has gone down, which is one of the factors that has been taken into account."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 23 May 1995; Vol. 260, c. 748.]</q>
I have examined the estimates of inflation. I made it clear that I was speaking about the 1992 Conservative campaign guide, not the 1994 guide. The 1994 guide used the figure of &#x00A3;570 million. It was published after the November 1993 Budget, including the Red Book.<br/>
If we compare the estimates of future inflation in the 1993 Red Book up to 1999 with the latest estimates until that year, we see that there is hardly any difference between them. The 1993 Red Book predicted that inflation would reach 2 per cent. by 1998&#x2013;99, as does the 1994 Red Book. There is only a marginal difference between them. There is no difference that could conceivably explain why suddenly estimates would be reduced by &#x00A3;110 million or 20 per cent.<br/>
In Committee, the Minister of State was repeatedly challenged to explain the estimated fall of &#x00A3;110 million. Where had the estimated &#x00A3;570 million come from? Where had &#x00A3;460 million come from? He failed repeatedly to offer any credible explanation. The estimates on which this discreditable Bill is based are entirely unreliable. It is unfortunate that the Government have offered no serious explanation of the discrepancy and of other changes in costs. That does them no credit.<br/>
We know that the Secretary of State has wasted millions of pounds of the public's money by seeking to change the common law system of compensation without any statutory authority and in patent breach of the law of the land, as was found by a Committee of the other place earlier this year.<br/>
As a result of impetuous and unlawful acts by the Secretary of State, he set up the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, which has now had to be wound up. He first insisted that claims for the preceding year would be judged on the basis of the unlawful tariff scheme. He had to dismantle that scheme, but at the same time has had to ensure that those who would have been awarded more under the old scheme will receive more. Those who would have received less under the common law scheme will, at the same time, keep their higher tariff award.<br/>
What is the cost of the Secretary of State's unlawful behaviour? There should be the fullest investigation of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's profligacy by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee.<br/>
Had a local council gone in for unlawful expenditure in the face of explicit legal advice and court judgments, and wasted millions of pounds, the Home Secretary would have been the first to demand that the Audit Commission should investigate, and that the councillors be surcharged.<br/>
Throughout the Bill's passage, the Secretary of State has sought to evade responsibility for decisions to slash compensation, for which he is morally and politically responsible, by asking us whether we would restore the scheme in full in the event of a Labour Government. That evasion of responsibility will not wash. Labour would not have tricked the electorate as the Conservatives did at the last election.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth has said, Labour's position is clear. If Ministers do not cut the scheme now, we will not cut it either. If Ministers maintain the public expenditure survey allocation up to the election and beyond, as they have every right and, indeed, duty to do, we shall keep it there. But if funding for the common law scheme is removed, no guarantees can be given by any party which seeks responsibly to govern the country.<br/>
On 23 May, the Secretary of State could not even say what would be in the Chancellor's Budget this autumn. He could not say what the availability of funding would be in the Chancellor's Budget. Today, the Home Secretary could not even say who the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be, let alone what might be in the Budget.<br/>
If the Chancellor of the Exchequer who presents the autumn Budget is, God forbid, the nominee of the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who intends to give away &#x00A3;5 billion in tax cuts and pay for those tax cuts through wholly unidentifiable efficiency savings, the public finances that Labour will inherit when we form a Government will be in an extremely sorry state.<br/>
I hope that, when the Secretary of State replies, he has the same full-hearted condemnation for the right hon. Member for Wokingham as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had yesterday, when he accused the former Secretary of State for Wales of
<q>plucking figures out of the air"&#x2014;</q></p>

<p>Order. This is not a general debate on the views of members of the Cabinet on Britain's financial situation. This is a specific debate on the Bill. I urge the hon. Gentleman to get back to it, and the Home Secretary to resist the temptation to make any comment as well.</p>

<p>I was dealing merely with the further uncertainties that now afflict the Government and their


public spending plans. But speaking of figures that are plucked out of the air, one might say the same for the figures of &#x00A3;570 million and &#x00A3;460 million which the House has variously been given for the possible cost of keeping the old scheme going right up until the year 2000.<br/>
Just three months ago, the Leader of the House warned the Prime Minister that by these cuts in the criminal injuries compensation scheme the Government had placed themselves
<q>on the wrong side of an argument about the victims of crime".</q>
He was, of course, right.<br/>
The Government's shame on the issue has been graphically shown this afternoon. For much of the three hours of debate, not a single Conservative Back Bencher has been present in the Chamber. Still less has one spoken in support of the Bill. I might also add that the Liberal Democrat Benches have been vacant for almost the whole debate. There has been no contribution from any Liberal Democrat during the course of the debate. I am sure that the people of Littleborough and Saddleworth will be interested to know the Liberal Democrats' lack of support for improvements in the criminal injuries compensation scheme and for the Opposition's fight to maintain the old scheme.<br/>
It is little wonder that so few Conservative Members have been present and that none has spoken, because the Government's record on crime has been one of the shames of this Administration. Crime has doubled, and the number of victims has doubled, while there has been an absolute reduction in the number of people convicted of or cautioned for crime.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham was right about one thing in the manifesto he issued yesterday. He said:
<q>We catch far too few criminals&#x2014;detection rates have to be raised.</q>
The Government have failed the victims of crime. Worse, they are now punishing the victims for that failure. That is why we believe that the Bill should not be given a Third Reading tonight.</p>

<p>I invite the House to reject the reasoned amendment which has just been moved by the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), to the detailed terms of which I shall come in a moment. However, I say at this early stage that the use of the word "reasoned" has rarely been less appropriate than in describing the amendment.<br/>
The Bill paves the way for a new criminal injuries compensation scheme under which compensation will, for the first time, be paid to the blameless victims of crimes of violence on a statutory basis. Unlike the present, non-statutory arrangements, the new scheme will concentrate on a straightforward tariff approach for the majority of victims. But it will also ensure that the needs of those most seriously affected by their injuries are generously met. We believe that that strikes the right balance between the needs of victims and the interests of the taxpayer.<br/>
Continuation of the old scheme, based on common law damages, was no longer a viable option. Costs were rising rapidly, and many victims were having to wait a long time for their money, despite the best efforts of my noble Friend Lord Carlisle and the Criminal Injuries

Compensation Board&#x2014;efforts for which we remain very grateful. In contrast, the new, enhanced tariff scheme should enable costs to be more readily predicted and controlled, and once the new scheme has settled down and the remaining old scheme cases have been cleared, victims should get their money more quickly and with less fuss.<br/>
In devising the new scheme, we have of course listened to the criticisms of the earlier non-statutory tariff scheme which was withdrawn in April following the ruling of the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords. The new scheme incorporates many of the more helpful suggestions made in both Houses and elsewhere.<br/>
All successful claimants will get a tariff award, but, in more serious cases, victims will also receive additional payment for loss of earnings and for special care. In fatal cases, payment will additionally be made for dependency and loss of support.<br/>
We are doubling the upper limit for awards payable under the old tariff scheme from &#x00A3;250,000 to &#x00A3;500,000, and we are making provision for recipients of higher-value awards to opt for payment by structured settlements. Those can provide a stream of index-linked, tax-free payments for life, considerably increasing the net value of the award. In addition, the tariff of awards has been improved and refined, to reflect the experiences of operating the non-statutory tariff scheme in 1994&#x2013;95.<br/>
The Bill has already been discussed in detail in Committee. Among other things, it was agreed there that the benefits of structured settlements should be extended to claimants under the old scheme whose claims have still to be settled. We shall seek to give effect to that in another place. We also agreed to an express provision being made on the face of the Bill that the new independent appeals panel should be able to offer advice to the Secretary of State on matters relating to the scheme.<br/>
Perhaps I should also remind the House that, contrary to the completely erroneous impression given in the Opposition's so-called reasoned amendment, the Bill provides that the more important features of the new scheme will be subject to parliamentary approval, both before the new scheme starts, and before any changes are made subsequently.<br/>
The so-called reasoned amendment also claims that the Bill enables the Secretary of State to evade responsibility for the scheme. That simply beggars belief. The Bill does no such thing, as was explained at length to Opposition Members in Committee. What the Bill does is preserve the present position and make it clear that the Secretary of State is not responsible for the decisions in individual cases taken by claims officers or the scheme manager.<br/>
Of course the Secretary of State has responsibility for the scheme and for the rules and procedures under which it operates. The Bill is quite clear on that, and for the Opposition to claim otherwise is characteristically absurd.<br/>
Since I am dealing with uninformed comment, I repeat that the new scheme does not cut the amount of money which will be available to compensate victims&#x2014;far from it. We are simply controlling the unsustainable rate of growth in such expenditure. Ours is by far the most generous compensation scheme in the world, and it will remain so once the changes envisaged in the Bill come into force.<br/>
We pay out more compensation than the United States, and more than all the other countries in Europe put together. By the end of the decade, the liability to


compensation will be in the order of &#x00A3;250 million a year. That is no mean achievement, and one in which we can all justifiably take pride.<br/>
All that the hon. Member for Blackburn can do in the face of that is to nit-pick about some detailed estimates which have had to be revised in the light of more up-to-date information&#x2014;a process so foreign to the hon. Gentleman that he does not appear to understand even that simple state of affairs.<br/>
Let me explain to the hon. Gentleman why the estimates over which he spent such an inordinate amount of time have been changed. The estimates are affected by several different factors. I have to spell them out for hon. Gentleman, although I think that most people will readily understand what they involve. They include the number of cases settled; the success rate; the percentage of claimants receiving an award; inflation; and increases in the average award. Those estimates have to be based on long-term, 10-year trends. Clearly, those change over a period as circumstances change and later data become available.<br/>
The figure of &#x00A3;570 million over which the hon. Gentleman spent&#x2014;indeed, wasted&#x2014;so much time was derived before the outturn figures for 1993&#x2013;94 were available. We now have the outturn figures for two subsequent years. Our information is more accurate and up to date. We prefer to make our estimates based on the most accurate and up-to-date information available&#x2014;a process clearly completely alien to the hon. Gentleman and the Labour party.<br/>
The Labour party has no constructive alternative to the scheme which the Government propose in the Bill. There is no clearer evidence of that than the complete about-face demonstrated in its so-called reasoned amendment. On Second Reading, the bon. Gentleman and his right hon. and hon. Friends complained in their amendment about the inadequacy of provision for criminal injuries. When he was challenged to make a clear, specific commitment to increase resources, he refused to do so.<br/>
We now have a totally different reasoned amendment. It clearly was not drafted by the hon. Gentleman. It was clearly drafted by someone who understood the impossibility of complaining about inadequate resources while refusing to make a commitment to increasing resources. It was drafted by someone who had some glimmering of understanding that government is about making decisions&#x2014;often hard decisions.<br/>
The gulf between the person who drafted the reasoned amendment and its contents, and the contents of the speech of the hon. Member for Blackburn could not have been wider&#x2014;it was enormous. Indeed, it rather looked as though the hon. Member for Blackburn had not even taken the trouble to read the so-called reasoned amendment before he got up to make his speech. The Labour party is not prepared to face up to the need to make decisions. Until and unless it is, it should be treated with the derision it deserves.<br/>
We have now come up with as good a scheme as it is possible to devise, given the constraints under which any responsible Government must operate. It is a generous, straightforward and transparent scheme, and one that serves the interests of victims and taxpayers alike. The Bill provides the framework of that scheme, and I invite the House to reject the reasoned amendment, endorse the scheme and give the Bill a Third Reading.</p>

<p>I explained on Second Reading the view that I and my hon. Friends took of the Bill. My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), who served on the Committee, is not here today because he is on parliamentary duty in the United States. Neither his views nor mine have changed since then.<br/>
The Bill amends the present system in ways that the Home Secretary was right to say start from a need to reappraise the ever-escalating cost. I concede that. The most interesting and important question is how much money will be in the kitty. I do not dissent from the view&#x2014;indeed, it is unarguable&#x2014;that we have the most generous system in the world. That is clear.<br/>
It is also unarguable that the cost has grown over the years, and if the old system remained, it would go on growing. That is why, on Second Reading, I made it clear that I thought that all responsible politicians would be forced to accept a tariff-plus system. There is no other way, unless we accept uncontainable prospective costs.<br/>
I made that clear before, and I hold to it. My views have not been altered by the debate in Committee. The questions that arose in Committee and on Report have not gone to the fundamentals of the Bill. Again, the Home Secretary is right to say that they went to the margins of the Bill, but that is because the Bill, in large measure, does not itself address the practicalities.<br/>
The practicalities will be how much money is in the kitty; what will be the level of awards; who reviews that and how will it be upgraded; and the scheme under the delegated legislation that the Bill will bring into operation. That is why we have the same simple view that we had at the beginning.<br/>
There were certain things wrong in the original tariff that needed to be corrected. We need to make sure that we do not reduce the amount of money and keep it pegged&#x2014;not so that it escalates out of control, but at least so that it stays in line with inflation, so that people are compensated for the injuries they sustain at a real rather than an ever-reducing cost. The scheme must be flexible, so that it meets the variety of injuries and practical losses that people sustain through disability, on-going costs, loss of earnings and the rest.<br/>
This is not a Bill that we would have introduced, or one that needed to be introduced in this way or form. It is important that we continue to put more money and interest into the cause of victims. That is why the Home Secretary and his hon. Friends have not received our support for their proposals, either at earlier stages of the Bill or tonight.<br/>
I understand that there will be further challenges in another place. The legal and other interested professions, let alone the victim support groups and victims' representatives, are unhappy at the prospect of reduced funding. That is the greatest fear that people will have as a result of this debate. The scheme may have been the most generous in the world, but people will fear that, in future, it will be both less generous and less flexible, and that is a bad thing.<br/>

<p>I welcome the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the subject of Elstree studios&#x2014;a matter of deep interest to my constituents, who take a great pride in our cinematic tradition. No doubt, the House will be aware that Elstree is a proud name in the history of the British cinema. Such great British movies of the past as "The Dambusters" and "Moby Dick" were made there, and my constituents are used to seeing the great faces of British cinema in their streets. Throughout Elstree and Borehamwood, there is a rich heritage of cinematic tradition, and much film-making skill. More recently, Elstree has played host to some major Hollywood productions, including the "Star Wars" films and the Indiana Jones trilogy, with which hon. Members are no doubt familiar.<br/>
However, a great change took place in the fortunes of Elstree studios when they were acquired by Brent Walker in 1988. Brent Walker acquired the site on the strict understanding with the local authority, Hertsmere borough council, that planning consent would be given for the development of about half the site for retail purposes while the remainder was to be developed for use in the film industry. That was built into the planning agreement between Brent Walker and the council.<br/>
Since 1988, something of a saga has developed over Brent Walker's ownership of Elstree. I draw two material points to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister. First&#x2014;this is most important to my constituents&#x2014;Brent Walker has not carried out its undertaking to develop the remaining part of the studios for the purposes of film making. Sadly, the studios in which such proud British films were made remain dark and unused. Secondly, notwithstanding Brent Walker's assertions to the contrary, there has been much real and substantial interest among other film makers in continuing film production at Elstree. There is clear evidence of that, and Hertsmere council knows of it.<br/>
I am fortified in that assertion by the conclusion of the Select Committee on National Heritage, whose members came to Elstree late last year. The residents of Elstree and the council were grateful to the Committee for the interest that it took, and it was firm in its conclusions that there was interest in, and a continuing future for, the studios.<br/>
Having investigated the situation carefully, the Committee's conclusion was:
<q>The Committee applauds the efforts of Hertsmere Borough Council to enable film production to be resumed at the historic Elstree studios, welcomes Twentieth Century-Fox's indication of interest, and deplores the dog-in-the-manger attitude of Brent Walker. It hopes that the situation will be speedily resolved and that Elstree Studios will once again be listed among the UK's functioning film studios.</q>
My constituents would say amen to that.<br/>
"Dog-in-the-manger" is a good phrase to describe Brent Walker's behaviour throughout the saga, and many of my constituents would welcome a change in the ownership of the studios so that films could be made there again. That is why they fully support the efforts of Hertsmere borough council to bring that about.<br/>
After the long saga caused by Brent Walker's dog-in-the-manger attitude, the council finally brought matters to a head. Earlier this month, it gave Brent Walker 14 days to agree purchase by negotiation before compulsory purchase proceedings would be initiated. That deadline expired on 16 June, and Hertsmere is now pressing ahead with its stated intention.<br/>
I welcome the opportunity that the debate gives me to place on record my support for the council's course of action&#x2014;a course supported by all the parties on the council. There is also great support in Borehamwood. I also agree with the Select Committee's conclusions about the future of Elstree studios. Obviously, their immediate future is in the hands of the council, but their long-term future is linked to the overall health of the British film industry, and that is the subject that I shall talk about next.<br/>
Incidentally, Elstree studios are not the only film-making interest for my constituents. Not far away are the Third Millennium studios, which are using Leavesden aerodrome as the studios for the new James Bond movie "Goldeneye". That is of great interest to many of my constituents. No doubt, their film-making skills are being put to good use there. I am sure that they are glad to see that James Bond has followed such other important figures as Luke Skywalker, Indiana Jones and Inspector Morse in beating a path to Hertfordshire. With all those people coming to Hertfordshire, it is not surprising that our crime rate is falling.<br/>
Those are the ambitious plans for film making close to my constituency. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Mr. Garel-Jones), who takes a great interest in such matters and has spoken of turning Watford into the Hollywood of western Europe. No doubt, that is on the cards if we can bring major film productions such as "Goldeneye" to Hertfordshire.<br/>
I urge the Minister to give his full support to film making in Hertfordshire and to the British film industry as a whole. Earlier this month, the Government gave their response to the Select Committee report, and that response has been widely welcomed in the industry. It represented some good positive steps forward, based on the recommendations of the Select Committee and introducing measures for which the film industry has been asking for a long time, including the long-awaited London Film Commission to assist film making in London. That, too, will be warmly welcomed.<br/>
Measures have also been put in place to assist entry to this country for those with skills in film making, stars and so on, through changes in the work permit arrangements. The money to come from the national lottery should not be overlooked either. That will be an important source of funds for film making&#x2014;a fact that has been widely welcomed, not least in my constituency, where I understand that &#x00A3;85,000 of lottery money has been allocated to investigate the feasibility of a permanent display at Elstree studios.<br/>
One of the major proposals for reviving our film industry involves fiscal incentives. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State dealt with that idea in his statement to the House on 6 June. Rightly and understandably, he said that considering the merits of fiscal incentives was a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer when planning his Budget.<br/>
What my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for National Heritage said was welcomed by the film industry. In his statement, he went as far as to say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would
<q>carefully consider the Committee's recommendations together with the logic that underpins them."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 6 June 1995; Vol. 261, c. 20.]</q>
That has been interpreted, I hope rightly, in the film industry as a sign that the Government are listening to its concerns and proposals. The industry hopes that the proposals will be given the careful consideration that they undoubtedly merit. If there is an open door there, I shall, perhaps, push it a little further open this evening by urging my hon. Friend the Minister to do what the Chancellor said, and to consider carefully the long-standing and well-considered case that has been put forward by the film industry.<br/>
I press on my hon. Friend one particular measure&#x2014;accelerated tax write-offs for film production. The industry is asking for such write-offs to take place in the first year of production rather than over three years, as at present. That is one of the points that the industry has made firmly and on which there is said to be consensus in the film industry. Certainly, it was one of the proposals made by the Producers Alliance. I understand that it also had the support of the British Film Commission. The Select Committee on National Heritage treated the proposal with great seriousness and put it forward as one of its recommendations. There is a consensus view that, of all the fiscal measures, that one especially commends attention. I invite my hon. Friend the Minister to look carefully at the case put by the film industry. It says that, in the particular circumstances of film making in this country, with the independent productions that we tend to have, this measure would assist film making and encourage investment in film making. The industry believes that it could be just the measure needed to tip the balance in favour of film making, to give it the boost that would turn this country into a major source of film production and to improve our already very good standing.<br/>
I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to look carefully at the proposal and the merits that underpin it. He must look carefully at the great potential for film making. We have great natural advantages&#x2014;the skills of our technicians and film makers, and the excellence of our artists, actors, producers and directors. We also have the great advantage of the English language, which gives us a flying start over so many of our competitors. Everybody who has looked at our film industry believes that the potential is there.<br/>
Certainly, we have done well in recent years and there have been clear signs of revival in the film industry, which are very welcome. The measures that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for National Heritage announced earlier this month will undoubtedly help the industry. However, the help could go a lot further than that. We have seen tremendous films of great excellence made in this country in the past couple of years. I am thinking not just of the obvious choice that everyone mentions&#x2014;"Four Weddings and a Funeral"&#x2014;but of other good films such as "Shadowlands", "Remains of the Day", "The Madness of King George" and "Tom and Viv". Recently, we had the major American production "Rob Roy". All those films, especially the first four, are

major examples of the excellence of our indigenous film industry and of the great natural assets that we have. Major productions such as "Rob Roy", besides bringing employment to the country and giving a boost to our economy, are a great showcase for the country. Films such as "Rob Roy" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral" have brought the British countryside, the beauty of Scotland and our English way of life to the attention of people all over the world. They have been a showcase as well as providing welcome jobs.<br/>
That is the great advantage of the film industry. There is no doubt that it will be one of the growth industries, in which this country could be a major player. As I have said, the right steps have been taken. If the right fiscal incentives were given as well, the industry's potential would be increased. There is, clearly, an enormous advantage for this country to gain. I commend all my arguments to my hon. Friend the Minister. I know that the film industry has been putting those arguments carefully to him. I urge him to listen carefully to what the industry proposes.<br/>
It is the earnest hope of my constituents that Elstree and Borehamwood can, once again, play a proud part in film making, as they did in the past. I hope that the cameras can start rolling, that the studios can be lit, that, once again, the big stars will come through Borehamwood and that the big productions, which give employment to so many of my constituents and cause so much pride, will come to the area. I hope that once again, Elstree will be synonymous with excellence in film making and that we can light up not just this country, but the whole world with the excellence of our British films.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1077045" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1995-06-29a.1140.0" hansard_membership_id="6784" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20927" speakername="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for National Heritage (Mr. Iain Sproat)" colnum="1140" time="18:54:00">
<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) on securing this debate at a time when the National Heritage Select Committee's report and the Government's recent response have focused attention on the film industry.<br/>
My hon. Friend has referred to the impressive record the studios at Elstree have held in the history of the film industry. No one could deny the enormous contribution that Elstree has made to film making in this country, but the future of the studios is, subject to any necessary planning consents, a matter for the owners to decide. It is not for the Government to determine a matter that should be for the commercial judgment of private companies.<br/>
I shall put Elstree in the context of the current position of the film industry and the excellent opportunities which lie before it. Over the past three years, there has been a marked increase in the number of British-produced films made, from 32 films in 1992 to 49 last year. There has been an equivalent rise in the amount of investment by overseas production companies in the UK, up from less than &#x00A3;70 million in 1992 to more than &#x00A3;176 million in 1994. In all, 89 films were made with significant British involvement in 1994, with total budgets amounting to more than &#x00A3;450 million. This, coupled with a fast-growing audience for film and the development of new technologies in the audiovisual industry, presents us with a time of great opportunity for the film industry.<br/>
In his recent statement to the House, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for National Heritage referred to the two strands in which these opportunities


lie: first, the opportunity to attract film makers from overseas to the UK and, secondly, the opportunity for British film makers to take advantage of the acknowledged strength of their industry.<br/>
To help the industry respond to the opportunities offered by overseas production, the Government agreed last year to continue support for the excellent work of the British Film Commission in attracting foreign film makers to the UK. As my hon. Friend mentioned, we have recently announced that we shall also provide pump-priming support for the establishment of a film commission in London. The lack of a commission in London, where most of the UK's technicians and film and television facilities are based, has proved to be a notable gap in the network of film commissions throughout the UK and a material weakness when marketing the UK as a place to film.<br/>
In the production of British films, British Screen Finance has been extremely successful in encouraging investment in feature film production and it has an impressive record in recouping loans to reinvest in new productions, without compromising its remit of encouraging new talent. To date, it has invested in more than 100 feature films, including "Land and Freedom", which won an award at Cannes this year, and "Jack and Sarah", which was released this month. In recognition of its achievements, we intend to continue funding British Screen Finance beyond the present financial year.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State confirmed, in his statement recently, a new source of funding for film production&#x2014;the national lottery, which my hon. Friend rightly mentioned. The Arts Council of England has said that, depending on the quality of applications it receives, it could invest more than &#x00A3;70 million by the year 2000 in the production of British films, in partnership with others such as Channel 4 and the BBC.<br/>
We are also considering the ways in which the industry might be developed into a stronger and more established sector. To that end, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has announced that we intend to set up an advisory committee comprising representatives of financial institutions and production companies to examine the issues involved.<br/>
My hon. Friend called for 100 per cent. first-year tax write-offs for expenditure on film production. This is not a new suggestion; indeed, it was one of the recommendations put forward by the National Heritage Select Committee. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made it clear in his statement that the Government would bear in mind the Committee's tax recommendations in the run-up to the next Budget, but there is nothing that I can usefully add to that on this occasion because tax policy is a matter for my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<br/>
The Government support international co-production through membership of Eurimages, enabling 49 British productions to go ahead since the United Kingdom joined the scheme in 1993. Most of the Eurimages-funded films are low budget, but the UK has been particularly successful in gaining support for higher-budget films. The Government-funded European Co-production Fund, administered by British Screen Finance, has supported co-productions with 14 other countries, enabling film makers to access state support in each of the co-producer's countries.<br/>
Since the inception of the European Co-production Fund in 1991, the number of UK co-productions has increased from 12 in 1992 to 32 in 1994. There is, however, little point in encouraging production if the films made are not also shown widely to British audiences. Many British films do not achieve wide distribution because of inadequate marketing and because too few prints are available for circulation. The Arts Council has agreed that, provided it receives sound applications, it could make more than &#x00A3;14 million available over the next five years for distribution and cinema improvements.<br/>
As a well-planned London launch is important if a film is to generate effective media attention, the Government are also providing funding for a study to examine the feasibility of a west end showcase to provide a venue for premieres of smaller-scale British films. This would be intended to generate the publicity necessary for a successful UK-wide cinema release. We plan to involve other organisations in the study, and the BBC has already said that it would like to be involved. Should the feasibility study show that the scheme would be viable, others would need to take it forward.<br/>
In this year of the cinema centenary, we have a unique opportunity to promote cinema-going to the British public. Plans have been drawn up by an industry organisation, Cinema 100, to celebrate the centenary and the Government have agreed to provide &#x00A3;180,000 this year towards the cost of its initiatives. I have mentioned a number of new initiatives, but the Government's interest in film is long term, as support for existing measures demonstrates.<br/>
The National Film and Television School, which recently announced that it plans to move to new premises at Ealing studios, is supported annually by a Government contribution of &#x00A3;1.85 million. The school prepares graduate students for careers in film and television, and graduates enjoy a 100 per cent. success rate in finding employment. Since 1973, students have won more than 250 awards for films at international festivals and industry ceremonies.<br/>
Film is a cultural as well as an economic activity, and in recognition of this, the Government provide substantial support for the British Film Institute. The institute's primary role is to encourage the understanding and development of moving image culture in all its forms. The BFI operates a world-class library, the Museum of the Moving Image, the national film and television archive and, through the national film theatre and grants to the regional film theatres, enables the public to see and appreciate a wide range of world cinema.<br/>
The Government also provided support for the original five-year MEDIA programme, which is now coming to an end. It was designed to enhance the strength of member states' national audiovisual industries by encouraging greater collaboration and wider distribution of their products. The UK has pushed for its successor, MEDIA II, to focus on three areas: training, project development and distribution. The UK has played an active part in negotiations on MEDIA II, ensuring where possible that the views of the UK industry are taken into account in shaping the programme. Ministers have now reached a common position in the European Council on the decisions for implementing MEDIA II. The Government


believe that MEDIA II will help to consolidate the achievements of the current programme while maintaining its momentum.<br/>
During its presidency, the UK was a major driving force in refocusing Audiovisual Eureka, the pan-European initiative, designed to strengthen the audiovisual industry. The Government provide support in the form of a contribution towards the maintenance and work of the Brussels-based Eureka permanent secretariat.<br/>
I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that all the measures that I have mentioned add up to considerable evidence that the Government wish to encourage the future development of an exciting and vital industry. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is, at this time, actively taking steps to move forward the initiatives announced in his recent statement, which I am glad my hon. Friend so warmly welcomed.<br/>
