	<p pid="a.10.8/1">Welcome back, Mr. Speaker. The national chlamydia screening programme has been rolled out successfully to 25 per cent. of PCTs, and we expect to see national screening in all other areas during 2006, which is well ahead of the 2007 target. We have also contracted Boots the Chemist to evaluate the potential of retail pharmacies as chlamydia screening venues. Screening started on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-14">14 November 2005</phrase>, and the two-year pilot will be independently evaluated by TNS Healthcare.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.2/1">The total number of GDS&mdash;general dental services&mdash;and PDS&mdash;personal dental services&mdash;dentists as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> was 21,025; a 25 per cent. increase since 1997. The great majority of those dentists are now working under new NHS contracts. In the minority of cases where dentists have chosen not to take up a new contract, primary care trusts are successfully using the funding for these contracts to re-provide services using other dentists.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.3/1">We gave dentists until <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> to sign up to the new contract to ensure that the payments could go through, starting in May. To get the data on to the computer system, dentists had to make the decision by <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase>, when the new financial year started. There are areas where around 30 per cent. of dentists have signed in dispute. I have had meetings with representatives of primary care trusts and strategic health authorities and they are confident that many of those disputes can be resolved by the local resolution procedure. In some areas, sets of dentists all decided to sign in dispute, which has caused particular difficulties, but I am confident that through the work that PCTs are doing, they will be able to sort out many of the problems fairly quickly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-18a.19.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" speakername="Peter Hain" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"  colnum="19"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/debtext/60418-06.htm#60418-06_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.19.1/1">First, let me warmly welcome you back to the joys of Northern Ireland business, Mr. Speaker. I know that there will be cross-party unity on that in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/2">With permission, I wish to make a statement about the future of Northern Ireland. The last 10 years have seen many crucial decision points in the peace process. One was eight years ago, when the people chose peace over conflict, consent over coercion and a positive future over a poisonous past. Now there is another choice. Before the end of this year, Northern Ireland's political leaders and elected Assembly members must decide whether to take responsibility for their people's future, as they have been mandated to do, or to opt for political cryonics. They must decide whether to bring an end to Northern Ireland's democratic deficit, or to see locally unaccountable direct rule stretch into the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/3">I firmly believe that Northern Ireland is governed best when governed locally, and I firmly believe that that view is shared by the people of Northern Ireland. Now is the time to prove them right. Direct rule was a 1970s solution to a 1970s problem. Since then, Northern Ireland has moved on and changed beyond all recognition. It is light years away from the troubles. Where once there was economic stagnation, there is now vibrancy. Where once there was the futility of cyclical violence, there is now the stability and prosperity of peace. And where once the political landscape was riven by sectarianism, there is now a shared desire among all the parties to move forward and take their proper places in the devolved institutions to which they were elected. The only real argument is when and how.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/4">The experiences of devolution in Scotland and in Wales have demonstrated the huge benefits that local politicians exercising locally accountable power can reap. Both nations have seen increased self-confidence, increased economic growth, increased social cohesion and an increased international profile. Northern Ireland has also undergone a positive transitional experience, but the potential of full devolution remains tantalisingly out of reach.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/5">The blunt truth is that Northern Ireland is in great danger of being left behind as not only the rest of the United Kingdom strides on successfully, but the Republic of Ireland continues to be one of the biggest global success stories of our generation. It is now for Northern Ireland's politicians to catch up&mdash;and catch up fast. Northern Ireland's people demand nothing less. From sport to science and from culture to business, Northern Ireland has some of the brightest talent anywhere in the world. It is time that its politicians lived up to that promise and showed vision and courage.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/6">The arrangements that the Prime Minister and Taoiseach outlined on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> give Northern Ireland's politicians the chance to close the chapter on the mistrust that has blighted the process since the suspension of the institutions in October 2002. However, if the parties do not choose to close that chapter of mistrust soon, the Government will be forced to close the book on devolution for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/7">The Independent Monitoring Commission has stated unequivocally that the IRA no longer represents a terrorist threat. That is momentous and should be acknowledged as such. Where there are issues around criminality, they must be&mdash;and indeed are being&mdash;addressed by the police, with the support of the whole community. Where there are issues of trust, they can be resolved only by political dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/8">Over the past few months, we have held discussions with all political parties in Northern Ireland with a view to restoring the political institutions. However, as the Prime Minister and Taoiseach made clear in their joint statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase>, we cannot, and will not, try to force Northern Ireland's politicians to take that final step forward. We can only point them towards what we believe to be the best road ahead. We have come to the point at which those outside the Northern Ireland political parties themselves can do little more to facilitate the process. I know that the decisions that will have to be taken are not easy, but honestly believe that history will not look kindly on those who miss the opportunity that stands before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/9">Copies of the joint statement made by the Prime Minister and Taoiseach on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> have been placed in the Library of the House, as have the speeches that they delivered. I will further place the Prime Minister's speech on record in a written ministerial statement tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/10">The joint statement indicated that the Northern Ireland Assembly would be recalled on <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase>, with a view to reaching agreement to restore the institutions by <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>. Last week, I nominated a new Presiding Officer, Eileen Bell. I have every hope that she will soon be overseeing the transition of the Assembly to full devolution. A woman of real courage, strength and ability, she is highly regarded by all, and could be the symbol of a new political era of co-operation and progress, leaving behind sectarianism and division.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/11">We will aim to discuss with the parties next week how the Assembly will function after <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase>, including its standing orders. I will also be introducing an emergency Bill on <phrase class="date" code="">20 April</phrase>, for taking through the House next week. I know that this is an extremely tight timetable, but the Bill will have only about half a dozen clauses in total and hon. Members will appreciate the urgency. We need to get the parties back in the Assembly and talking now to provide them with the maximum opportunity for securing agreement by <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> at the very latest.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/12">The Bill will arrange for the Assembly to be recalled with the express purpose that it sets about electing a First and Deputy First Minister on a cross-community basis, and then forms an Executive, under the d'Hondt formula. As soon as that is done, power will automatically be devolved, as happened in December 1999, and all the Assembly's other functions will be resumed.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/13">Our hope and intention is that the Assembly will elect an Executive within six weeks, as envisaged by paragraph 35 of strand 1of the Good Friday agreement. However, if that time frame proves to be too short, the Assembly will have a further 12-week period after the summer in which to complete the task. During that period, it will be open to the parties to engage in further discussion, both among themselves and with the Government, on improving the running of the institutions. The Assembly will also have opportunities to prepare for government by considering issues that are crucial to the future of Northern Ireland, such as the economy and reforms to education, water charges and public administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/14">The Bill will have obvious implications for Orders in Council. Some of the forthcoming Northern Ireland legislation on transferred matters will obviously be appropriate for consideration by the restored Assembly, and Ministers will naturally be willing to take account of views on such matters, if they are provided on a cross-community basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/15">It would be preferable to all democrats if the parties were quickly able to take up the mantle of government so that the decisions that affect the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland were taken by locally accountable politicians. However, in the meantime, I will not delay implementing vital reforms that this Government consider essential to the better running of Northern Ireland. While those decisions may not always be popular, they are necessary in the public interest, to put Northern Ireland on the road to becoming world class.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/16">If, however, the Assembly has been unable to achieve a power-sharing Executive by <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>, there will be no choice but to cancel Assembly Members' salaries and allowances forthwith, and to cancel the election due in May 2007. It would be absurd to elect Members unwilling to discharge their duties to an Assembly that would not have sat for more than four and a half years.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/17">Restoration of the Assembly and Executive would then be deferred until there was a renewed political willingness to exercise devolved power. The two Governments would then continue their commitment to developing north-south co-operation and structures as set out in the Good Friday agreement. In this scenario, the agreement would remain very much alive.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/18">It is crucial that the parties keep talking&mdash;not just to the two Governments, but to each other. We are committed to facilitating dialogue to achieve this over the months ahead in whatever forum is required&mdash;full plenary sessions of the Assembly, smaller forums of designated members, or all-party discussions, including with the Prime Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/19">I want to re-emphasise that the strategy that the two Governments have agreed is designed for success, not failure. Our overwhelming desire is that local politicians take power back into their own hands, just as Scotland and Wales have done to great effect. It is time for Northern Ireland's politicians to show leadership and good faith&mdash;in themselves, in each other and in the people who elected them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-18a.21.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="21"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/debtext/60418-07.htm#60418-07_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.21.0/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for making this statement at the earliest opportunity after Parliament's return and also for his courtesy in letting me have early sight of its contents. I say at the start that I hope that this initiative by the Government succeeds. My party will support the Secretary of State in this initiative. However, I have several concerns and questions.No one in this House does anyone in Northern Ireland any favours by trying to wish away the serious difficulties that still exist. Like the Secretary of State, I want to see devolution working in Northern Ireland. The people of Northern Ireland should have the right to elect representatives to take decisions on their behalf and to hold those representatives to account for their stewardship. But the truth is that we will not get agreement on an Executive, and certainly not by <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>, unless we are able to overcome the deep mistrust that exists between the different communities and political parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/2">My party accepts that the republican movement has come a long way in the past year&mdash;would that it had done so much earlier&mdash;and the IRA's statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July 2005</phrase> and the act of decommissioning in September were highly significant developments. But does the Secretary of State agree with me that the responsibility now rests primarily with republicans to persuade democrats from both the Unionist and nationalist traditions that their renunciation of violence and their declared commitment as republicans to democratic politics are both permanent and irreversible? Does the Secretary of State accept that it would be wrong to have Sinn Fein Ministers in the Government of Northern Ireland while the IRA continues to be involved in criminal activity, or before Sinn Fein is prepared to give its unequivocal backing to the police and the courts in Northern Ireland? Does he further accept that those moves need to come before an Executive are formed, and not at some unspecified point in the future when powers over policing and justice can be devolved?</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/3">In that context, I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to comment briefly on the fact that two very serious crimes have taken place in the last fortnight. In both cases, there has been much speculation about the involvement of members of the provisional republican movement. Clearly, if such involvement were to be proven, the task of building confidence and restoring devolution would be a hard one&mdash;I suspect that it would be impossible&mdash;in the time frame that the Government now envisage. Will the Secretary of State tell the House, so far as he is able to without compromising ongoing police investigations, what information he has received?</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/4">First, does he believe allegations that the murder of Denis Donaldson was carried out by the provisional IRA? The Prime Minister has declared very confidently that people who wanted to wreck the peace process carried out that crime. That confidence suggests that Ministers possess reliable information about the matter. At the time of the Northern bank robbery, both the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda swiftly concluded that the IRA was to blame, and said so publicly. Have the two police forces yet come to any similarly firm conclusion about who was responsible for the murder?</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/5">Secondly, the Secretary of State will know that on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase> the Garda arrested three men in Westmeath, after a lorry carrying vodka worth &euro;300,000 was hijacked. Have the Irish authorities told him whether Dublin press reports are true and that the alleged criminals were known provisional activists? It has been claimed that one of them was released under the early-release provisions of the Belfast agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/6">In the wake of that incident, the Irish Justice Minister commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/7" class="indent">&quot;As long as the IRA continues to exist and the IRA constitution continues to be treasonable and subversive then problems will continue to remain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/8">Does the Secretary of State agree with Mr. McDowell's assessment?</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/9">The joint statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> listed education among the issues that the new Assembly should discuss as part of its preparation for government. Will the Secretary of State therefore agree to put off his proposed education reforms, at least until the Assembly has considered them and its views are known?</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/10">Regarding the internal governance of Northern Ireland, will the Secretary of State confirm that it remains entirely a matter for the UK Government accountable to this Parliament? We on the Conservative Benches appreciate the efforts and commitment of successive Irish Governments, and of the Taoiseach personally, to a lasting settlement. I believe that political, economic and cultural relationships between the UK and the Republic of Ireland should be at least as close as those between any two modern European democracies that share a common land border. However, will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that it is a fundamental principle of the Belfast agreement and the entire political process that the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the UK is accepted by all sides&mdash;albeit unwillingly in some cases&mdash;unless and until the people of Northern Ireland freely consent to change? Does he therefore agree that any form of joint authority would be in breach of that principle of consent?</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/11">On the emergency legislation that the right hon. Gentleman has announced, my colleagues and I will want to look at the detail as soon as it is available. However, once we have done so, we hope to be able to support the Government and to help to bring the Bill into law as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/12">I hope that the right hon. Gentleman can give me some reassurance about a particular anxiety of mine&mdash;that the Bill might include powers for Ministers to amend Acts of Parliament by order. Will the Bill contain such powers? If the answer is yes, will he promise that it will impose very strict limits on both the extent and duration of those powers?</p>

	<p pid="a.23.0/1">First, I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his good wishes, and for putting it on the record that, in general terms, the Opposition will support the initiative. I agree that it is in no one's interest to attempt to wish away what he described as the serious difficulties afflicting this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/2">There is deep mistrust, and I agree that responsibility does indeed lie with republicans to ensure that everyone&mdash;not just their supporters, but their opponents&mdash;is persuaded that they are genuinely committed to peaceful and democratic means; that they have, as the Independent Monitoring Commission has reported, rejected their past commitment to terrorism; and that they are committed to rejecting criminality, about which I will say more in answer to the hon. Gentleman's specific questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/3">The hon. Gentleman asked for further information on the murder of Denis Donaldson and on the vodka heist. He asked for further information on whether they were carried out by the IRA. I accept that he himself made a distinction between those events and the Northern Bank robbery, which the Chief Constable was quick to say was the responsibility of the IRA. No firm conclusions have been yet drawn by the police on either matter, and there is certainly no evidence that I have seen, or that the police have provided to me, or any intelligence, that either very serious incident, not least the barbaric murder of Denis Donaldson, was sanctioned, approved or in any way organised with, as it were, prior thought by the leadership of the provisional IRA.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/4">Let me quote for the House's benefit a statement issued by the IRA on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-13">13 April</phrase>&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I think it important to put this on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The IRA has no responsibility for the tiny number of former republicans who have embraced criminal activity. They do so for self-gain. We repudiate this activity and denounce those involved. The IRA remains committed to the peace process . . . The leadership . . . believes that it is possible to achieve the republican goal of a united Ireland through the alternative route of purely peaceful and democratic means.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/6">I may add that the president of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, has made clear his total condemnation of the murder and of criminality that may be carried out in the name of republicans.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/7">On education reform, I am happy to provide assurances that I believe it would be a suitable matter for discussion in the Assembly if the Assembly chose to discuss it and if there were all-party agreement to do so. Undoubtedly, if all-party policy positions were agreed by the Assembly, the Education Minister&mdash;the Under-Secretary of State for Nor<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" name="Angela Smith">thern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith)</phrase>&mdash;and I would want to take careful note of them. We intend to bring forward an order next month to set the overall architecture, but there will be considerable scope once the Assembly has got going to determine the exact new admission arrangements, the nature of the pupil profile, curriculum detail and so forth. Those would be appropriate issues for the Assembly to discuss, but no one, I think, is in any doubt about&mdash;I have heard no one defend it to me&mdash;the continued existence of a method of deciding a child's future on the basis of two one-hour tests, after which their future opportunities are either closed or opened up. There is agreement, however, that there is genuine debate on the issue and there will be an opportunity to influence the future over exactly how the new regime will operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/8">On the supremacy, as it were, of the United Kingdom Government in the governance of Northern Ireland, I am happy to agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. There is absolutely no question of joint authority or joint governance. There is plenty of scope, however, and the hon. Gentleman implied that he agreed with this, for practical co-operation, as provided for through the architecture of the Good Friday agreement, which was endorsed by the people of Northern Ireland, for cross-border co-operation in a number of areas&mdash;for example, on energy, the economy, child offending, and getting rid of unfair mobile phone roaming charges so that there is a single, all-Ireland rate. On those sorts of issues, and on many more, there is tremendous scope for future co-operation, much of which, indeed, is already taking place. But there is no question of joint authority. There is no question of that at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/9">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's general support on the emergency legislation and will be happy to take him through the detail when we have an opportunity to do so. I am being very cautious about Orders in Council; I know there is sensitivity to them in Parliament, both in this place and the House of Lords. However, I want some flexibility to make progress. I had hoped to include in the Bill provision by Order in Council, should we be in a position to reach a final agreement, and also to amend the strands 1 to 3 arrangements, which everybody understands will be necessary in terms of the original architecture; for example, the Democratic Unionist party has made its position clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/10">I had hoped to include an Order-in-Council provision in the Bill, but it seems that there is opposition to that, so we shall have to look at emergency legislation later in the year, should there be the conditions for the necessary all-party agreement and the restoration of the institutions that we desire. I shall obviously consult the hon. Gentleman on all the detail as we go through the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.0/1">I welcome your return to health and work, Mr. Speaker, although I am not sure that we are the most therapeutic company this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/2">I thank the Secretary of State for his statement and for his advance courtesies in connection with it. I welcome his indication that he has decided not to seek Order-in-Council powers in the Bill to adjust the working of the institutions. He will understand that it is not just because some of us were celebrating the 1916 rising this weekend that we would not be happy to see the Secretary of State take such powers in relation to institutions that were mandated uniquely by all the people of Ireland in our generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/3">In relation to other aspects of the statement, the Secretary of State indicated that there would be discussions with the parties next week about how the Assembly might function, including standing orders. The key question in those discussions will be who is to decide and when. We are told that the measure will give the Assembly a new working status and that it will not be just a shadow Assembly, so will there be a similar new working status for the north-south arrangements in that period, beyond care and maintenance?</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/4">In relation to a number of decisions, including water charges and the review public administration, the Secretary of State indicated that Ministers would take account of views provided on a cross-community basis. Will he colour in the difference between taking account of views and abiding by them?</p>

	<p pid="a.25.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his opening points.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">On the hon. Gentleman's question about changes to strands 1 to 3 of the Good Friday agreement, despite his opposition to my taking powers through Order in Council, the reason I was planning to do so is that I am concerned about running up against the deadline and making the changes in time. There will be a brief spill-over period after we come back in October before Parliament prorogues and then an equally brief time after Queen's Speech&mdash;I do not yet know the date, but Members can imagine the timetable&mdash;before we reach <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>. I was concerned about having enough scope to take through emergency legislation, but if that is what we have to do, we shall have to try.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that we shall have to make changes in the strands to get all the parties together. There is no point in keeping our heads in the sand. The DUP has a mandate and has made it absolutely clear that it requires changes, and I acknowledge that. The Government stand ready to make those changes once we can achieve agreement on them, and that will require legislation. As I said, I would have preferred to have done that a little more easily through an Order in Council, on which I would have consulted widely and sought agreement, but obviously separate primary legislation will be necessary. Let us hope that, given the timetable, we can make things dovetail.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4">On standing orders, the Secretary of State&mdash;in other words myself&mdash;will have responsibility for drawing them up, as happened last time. We want to consult all the parties about them in detail, especially the Northern Ireland parties that will be in pole position, to try to reach agreement. The Assembly can of course amend the standing orders, as it can confirm or reject my nomination of Eileen Bell as the Speaker; the question of any deputies to be appointed will also be provided for in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/5">I do not envisage any new status for north-south co-operation during this period, but we will, of course, continue to do what we have been doing energetically for the past year and indeed before to gain everyone's support for co-operation on the economy and a range of other matters. We will discuss the possible shape of additional north-south co-operation, but we do not want to get into the business of pre-empting that. We want the Assembly and the institutions restored, and we want north-south co-operation to proceed on basis that it has successfully done so recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/6">Obviously, an order will be introduced fairly soon on water charges, and I will want to take into account everything that the Assembly might want to say about that, particularly views that command cross-community support in the Assembly and that address the public expenditure consequences of adopting a different approach. Of course, if the Assembly voted unanimously to reject water charges, I would have to take account of that, but I would want to know where we would find the &pound;200 million or so of extra public expenditure generated by those water charges and where we would get the finance to invest in Northern Ireland's decaying sewerage and water system. Finding those answers would be the responsibility of anyone who addresses the issue in the Assembly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-18a.28.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1400" speakername="Peter Robinson" colnum="28"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/debtext/60418-09.htm#60418-09_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.28.4/1">May I join others in saying that my colleagues and I are delighted to see you back in your place, Mr. Speaker? We are particularly pleased that you look so well.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.4/2">I echo the shadow Secretary of State's comments about paragraph 10 of the Prime Minister's statement&mdash;the threat applied to Unionists should the date of <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> not be met. That threat was crass and foolish, and is contrary to any concept of the principle of consent. I hope that the Secretary of State will make it very clear that there will be no constitutional change as a result of the Provisional IRA not meeting the deadline that is set for <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.4/3">Will the Secretary of State also find some time to take <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" name="Mark Durkan">his hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> to one side and explain to him the principle of the mandate? We are living in a parliamentary democracy and, in a parliamentary democracy, the electorate can change the mandate from one election to the next. The electorate have freely, at the ballot box, made it very clear in the Unionist community that they oppose the Belfast agreement. My colleagues and I have suggested the changes required to achieve a satisfactory agreement that can win the support of the Unionist community. There is a deficiency in the Prime Minister's statement, as it does not provide a road map to show how that can come about, and the timetable does not take account of the necessary steps to bring it about.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.4/4">There is another deficiency in the timetable. The Prime Minister seems to have opted for the notion that the Unionist community can be timetabled into an Executive. The issue will be determined not by the clock but according to whether various conditions have been met and whether paramilitary and criminal activity has ended. That is the critical factor for my party. We want to move into devolution, and we want an Executive in Northern Ireland, but the principle of our mandate indicates that we can only share power with those who are committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.4/5">Will the Secretary of State say very clearly at the Dispatch Box that he does not expect anybody to share power in government with those who continue paramilitary and criminal activity? I remind him that the Prime Minister's statement was sandwiched between two events&mdash;the killing of Denis Donaldson, in which members of the provisional IRA were involved, and the vodka heist in the Republic, in which members of the provisional IRA were involved. The Unionist community wants to be certain that the provisional IRA did not organise and sanction those events.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-18a.45.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1477" speakername="James Paice" colnum="45"  time="017:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/debtext/60418-14.htm#60418-14_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.45.2/1">As the Minister said, this Bill has already been given the technical scrutiny that we expect of the other place. That is to be welcomed, as is the Bill in general. It is not a matter of great partisanship, as legislation in respect of common land commands wide support in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/2">The attitude of hon. Members to the matter of commons and greens will be influenced by their experiences. Traditionally, my own county of Cambridgeshire has relatively small commons, which are generally attached to local communities and usually cover an area of no more than 50 acres. Some of them have been covered by their own Acts of Parliament for many hundreds of years, but the Minister was right to point out that, conversely, commons elsewhere in England and Wales might cover many thousands of acres, with various different owners of the rights to grazing, pannage, turbary or estover.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/3">The Minister was also right to say that about 3 per cent. of the land in England, and 8 per cent. of the land in Wales, is common land, covering a little over 500,000 hectares. However, 80 per cent. of land is privately owned, with almost half coming under the sites of special scientific interest designation. The Opposition entirely agree with the Government's desire further to enhance and protect our common land.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/4">The Bill will have far-reaching effects. It is largely about remedying the deficiencies of the Commons Registration Act 1965, which was introduced by a previous Labour Government. However, given that the very first Act in respect of common land was passed in 1235, I doubt that this Bill will be the last word on the matter&mdash;especially as the Government, I regret to say, are ducking some of the most serious weaknesses arising from the 1965 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/5">We support the improvement of environmental conditions of common land and agree with encouraging sustainable management practice through the introduction of regulatory bodies, but the Government are addressing the problem of over-grazing on common land a bit late. It was the introduction of the single payment scheme last year that reduced farmers' incentives to increase their herd and flock sizes, and I hope that commons associations, Natural England, the Countryside Council for Wales and others do not have the problem of trying to deal with under-grazing, to which the Minister referred, as well as the over-grazing that has been a problem in the past. In principle, we agree that greater collective action is a welcome move towards achieving improved environmental and agricultural management. The Minister touched on the fact that the success of the Dartmoor commoners council is testimony to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/6">The first part of the Bill deals with the registration of common land and with town and village greens. According to the explanatory notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/7" class="indent">&quot;This replaces and improves the registration system under the 1965 Act, but using the same registers prepared under that Act.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/8">We are concerned that there are known to be many deficiencies in the existing registers, which the Bill does not provide an opportunity to remedy. They particularly relate to the number of registered rights, which the Bill does nothing to tackle. There are numerous examples: for example, grazing rights may have been claimed that were significantly in excess of those traditionally attached to the land through the old system of levancy and couchancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/9">It would be absurd not to understand the Government's reluctance to enter into what we all know to be a minefield, and I understand that there are also human rights concerns. However, I suggest that where there are obvious cases of deception, there cannot be any fair claim on human rights grounds. For example, I know of a common in my constituency where rights were claimed and registered by a person whose property had never previously had any such rights. If the Bill is to prove durable, it should enable people sensitively and sensibly to challenge previous rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/10">The Bill prohibits severance of the rights of common, with the exceptions applying to commons associations, Natural England and CCW. I wholly support the principle of ending severance, but I question the logic of severed land being handed to Natural England and the others. While the intention may be that they do not use the rights, thereby dealing with over-grazing, there is nevertheless nothing in the Bill to stop them using them, perhaps becoming grazers themselves, or possibly cutting peat, catching fish or harvesting bracken. That could mean all those bodies having more rights over common land than are currently held by established voluntary commons and statutory commons associations.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/11">I heard what the Minister said about the Dartmoor commoners council and the amendments that will be proposed. I have had discussions with the council over its concerns. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether the Bill will result in a fair situation for the Dartmoor commoners council. In particular, will it let the council continue to hold the rights of registration, creation and severance that it holds under the present legislation? Other commons associations also deliver benefits for people on lands that are well managed for agricultural, environmental and public benefits, and I hope that they, too, can be dealt with under the amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/12">There is also a question why Natural England and the other organisations should need the rights that come from severance. If associations are to be responsible for ensuring that commons are not over-grazed or in other ways exploited, it should surely be to those associations that the severed rights are granted. Alternatively, they could revert to the owner of the dominant tenement.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/13">Clause 13 deals with surrender and extinguishment and correctly ends the practice of common law extinguishing rights, but in doing so disposes of certain circumstances where extinguishment might be desirable. For example, rights in gross created by severance at some previous time in history that may have been abandoned, especially after passing through a few generations, would be an ideal way of reducing the total number of over-grazing rights. However, that opportunity would be lost under the Bill. It seems contradictory to use human rights as an excuse for not removing rights that were either fraudulently obtained or have been abandoned, while clause 15 of the same Bill would confiscate land from a private owner by allowing it to be registered as a green and, in effect, to become worthless. Where are the human rights in that example?</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">The Minister and the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase>, who has left the Chamber, said that the provisions largely repeat those in existing legislation, notably the 1965 Act, but there are serious concerns that for land claiming village green status they have become increasingly relaxed. Opponents to new developments can argue that land should be registered as a village green if they can prove that local inhabitants have indulged in so-called lawful sports and pastimes for at least 20 years. I have great regard for the Minister, but he may not have taken on board the seriousness with which that issue is viewed not only by his hon. Friend but in several parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/15">As long ago as <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">18 January</phrase>, on Third Reading in another place, my noble Friend Lady Byford referred to case studies where the 20-year use rule&mdash;for example, simply for walking dogs&mdash;had been employed by activists opposed to housing proposals to enforce the registration as a village green of land that few reasonable people would consider as such. Lord Bach responded:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/16" class="indent">&quot;I agree with everything that the noble Baroness has just said. Perhaps I may say to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that we will study the details of her remarks and that I shall write to her.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">18 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 677, c. 686.]</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/17">I understand that no response has yet been received by Lady Byford. Perhaps tonight the Minister will take the opportunity to elaborate on behalf of his noble Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/18">It seems that such housing developments are not isolated cases. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> is dealing with a similar case in his constituency where a small number of local individuals opposed to the development of a health village on reclamation land proved that they had used the land for lawful pastimes for 20 years, thus qualifying it to be registered as a town green. Fortunately, the court ruled against the application for registration and building work restarted, but there is concern that the Bill could allow the case to be reopened, which would further delay the building of that much-needed community facility. Will the Government consider how to address that issue? Can the Minister tell us whether the Department has made any assessment of the amount of land eligible under the 20-year rule?</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/19">In addition to that, the creation and registration of rights will apply only to those commons registered under the 1965 Act, through Natural England and the CCW. To gain such rights, commons associations set up outside that Act and voluntary commons associations will be required to register under the Bill, which will be a time-consuming and costly process. Will the Minister tell the House how many commons associations outside the Act there are, and will he assure us that the advantages of registering outweigh the monetary cost of registration and the administrative burden that will fall on those associations? Would not it be more suitable to allow existing voluntary commons associations to remain operating as they are, while becoming part of a larger statutory organisation? Such an umbrella structure could provide democratic discussion and ruling at local level, with a more central administrative control. Moreover, it would create a better national framework for sharing information and promoting good advice. Have the Government considered a point of contact in DEFRA or another part of the Government so that the various commons associations have a central database? I do not mean a literal database, but somebody with the knowledge to provide advice and co-ordination, and develop expertise within the Department and deliver it to all the commons associations. There seems to be general agreement that the 1965 Act has not been entirely successful. I wonder whether the Minister can tell the House exactly how many commons and green are still in dispute. Do we know what are the chief disputes?</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/20">On the Government's plans to establish electronic registers, I welcome the Minister's commitment to provide funding. I hope that another Department's funding is not cut accordingly, which is, of course, what usually happens on such occasions. Nevertheless, I am somewhat concerned about the establishment of an electronic register, given the Department's track record. We only have to go back a few years to the cattle tracing scheme that was introduced following the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease or the mapping exercise following the CROW Act&mdash;the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000&mdash;to find that problems surround such schemes. Of course, none of us needs reminding of the current debacle at the Rural Payments Agency. So I hope that the Minister can tell the House how much the proposed commons register will cost to establish and maintain. Will he assure us that the scheme will be more successful than the Department's previous computer projects?</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/21">In England, the commons registration authorities are largely county councils, with some district councils and unitary authorities. Do the Government know whether councils and authorities have adequate staff, with the necessary qualifications and experience; or will recruitment and training be required? That issue is one not just of funding, but of having competent staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/22">The objective of part 2 is to enable the appropriate national authority to establish commons associations, thus enabling commoners to work together to manage agricultural activities and vegetation on a voluntary basis. The Bill will allow commons associations to enter into agri-environmental schemes, which, of course, we welcome. However, it is essential that such associations truly represent those with interests in the common. I listened with interest to the exchanges on the matter that the Minister had with Members on both sides of the House. It is important that such organisations are formed not just of a small group of people who can create an association to exercise power over others, possibly to their detriment. I hope that the Minister can tell the House a little more about the composition of associations and particularly whether a minimum level of support will be needed to establish a commons association.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/23">Moreover, what will be the relationship between such commons associations and those who may have leased other rights from the landowner? The Minister made the perfectly proper point that most commons are privately owned. The owner may well have leased other rights, such as sporting rights, to third parties. What will be the relationship between the holders of such rights and a commons association? Obviously, the association's role may well impinge on the holder of sporting rights and, of course, vice versa.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/24">Part 3, which deals with protection of commons from unlawful works, is entirely welcome, as the Minister implied. Of course, such works can include building or the erection of fences on common land. Of course in many areas, such as my constituency, they can involve the incursion of unlawful Traveller encampments. So measures to protect common land from such works and to speed the process are, of course, welcome, but I am concerned about whether the minimum additional regulatory burden will be placed on the commoners who want to achieve that aim. The Minister said that the Government plan to introduce exemptions from the necessary consent process, but I should be grateful if the Minister gave us a little more information. In particular, what will happen if the owner of rights wishes to erect temporary fencing, perhaps to reintroduce grazing on a common or to keep stock out of an especially sensitive part of a common?</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/25">Open commons with roads going through them&mdash;I have examples in my constituency&mdash;were fine when there was a small amount of fairly slow-moving traffic, but there is a problem given the increasing amount of traffic nowadays. People can stand on some of our commons and watch cars and motor bikes going through at 50 mph plus&mdash;perhaps they should not travel at that speed, but they do&mdash;and many people will not risk either their stock or the likelihood of a legal case by allowing their stock to cross open roads. Fencing is becoming more and more important. I hope that the Government will consider either an exemption or some sort of fast-tracking of inconsequential works so that only the more significant proposals have to go through the full process.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/26">Finally, I am concerned that, yet again, in the Bill Ministers are taking immense powers to repeal other legislation&mdash;in this case, under clauses 36 and 44. In particular, the National Trust has raised the issue that its own Acts could be repealed or amended by virtue of a Minister giving commons associations powers that supersede those of the National Trust. I know that the Minister is aware of that important issue and I hope that he will reconsider it in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/27">As I have said, and as I am sure will come through in the debate, there is clearly broad support for the Bill. The Conservatives strongly support it, but there is scope for improvement. Like the Minister, I pay tribute to the immense work done in the other place, but there are still a few things to resolve and there is still some clarity to be achieved. My experience of the Minister who will take the Bill through Committee is that he is open to good suggestions and sensible ideas and I look forward to that consideration and to making improvements to some of the areas that I have touched on. I welcome the Bill. It is a sensible measure that brings commons legislation up to date and improves some of the shortcomings of the previous legislation. I regret that it does not improve all of them, but we will seek to amend it in Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.1/1">I certainly agree with that. I believe that the local environment is extremely important to local people and that the more we can localise decision making around relatively small pieces of land, the more issues can be identified and resolved. I very much look forward to town and parish councils having greater responsibilities and powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/2">I want to return to a matter on which I intervened on the Minister earlier&mdash;the cut-off date of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase> for unlawful works. I am delighted to be told that that does not apply to local authorities. However, I know from direct experience that large areas of land where the public have a right to roam freely under the CROW Act are fenced off. I seek assurances that the <phrase class="date" code="">28 June</phrase> cut-off date will not prevent action on that. It would be a travesty if the monumental piece of legislation that delivered the right to roam were to be frustrated.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/3">On making an application to a county court as regards obstruction, I am not entirely clear what powers the court will have. I presume that if the order is not complied with, there can be a reapplication for a breach. Under rights of way legislation, magistrates courts have the power to fine. Highways authorities now have the opportunity to come and remove obstructions. What are the powers of the county court if unlawful restrictions are not removed?</p>

	<p pid="a.61.1/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. No doubt his constituents will read about his remarks in their local paper with great interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/2">The Bill has proceeded through the other place, including its Committee stage there, to this House with a great deal of consensus. The Minister has been very willing to listen to all our remarks as he deals with this nightmarishly complex piece of legislation. It is sad, therefore, that having gone through all this, we are now faced with an outrageous programme motion. We know perfectly well that some amendments will need to be tabled in Committee. How on earth can the Committee deal with these complex matters by <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday 27 April</phrase>? That is an outrageous abuse of the programming system.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/3">Before the programming system was introduced, the Opposition had the weapon of delay to wring concessions from the Government. This Bill would have provided a wonderful opportunity to prolong debate to win a number of concessions. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" name="Simon Burns">my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase>, who is sitting on our Front Bench, was, in his day, a great master of speaking long and hard on certain issues in order to get concessions out of the Government. Given the provisions of the Bill, we could have spent at least an hour on turbary, a further hour on estovers and possibly even more on couchancy&mdash;although I am not sure whether my Norman French pronunciation is quite correct there. The Bill would have provided wonderful opportunities for delay, as well as for those who are interested in the arcane areas of common land law.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.0/1">I remind the House of my declaration of interests. I am a partner in a farming business that holds modest ownership rights, and slightly more substantial grazing rights, over common land. That means that I have some knowledge of which I speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/2">I am pleased that there has been such consensus across the House, notwithstanding <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the remarks made by the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. The debate is important because common land raises considerable concerns among many of our constituents who have historical rights that go back many generations. In the county of Shropshire, which I represent in part, there are more than 5,000 hectares of common land in 86 registered commons. The county council that monitors the commons anticipates that there is a substantially larger amount of unregistered land and is trying to pull together various interests. The Bill is designed to put right several of the deficiencies of the Commons Registration Act 1965.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/3">I am extremely relieved that the Minister has decided that the most appropriate registration body is the local authority, rather than his Department. I say that for several reasons, not least of which is the performance of the Rural Payments Agency, which his Department supervises, on the mapping and registration of agricultural land throughout the country. With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, because it has some relevance to the debate, I will cite a letter that I received from the agency shortly before the recess&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March</phrase>. The letter was about the form that I was invited to complete for my 2006 single farm payment. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Your application form has been pre-populated with the number of entitlements that were notified to you on your un-validated entitlements statement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/5">It led me to think that there might be some data included on the form, but it was not until I got to the eighth page of zero information that I reached part D, which was on common land grazing rights. I was pleased to see that there was notification on the form that I was entitled to graze 43.3 cattle and 720 sheep on common land. As it happens, I cannot reconcile those figures with any of mine, which shows that the entire form is gobbledegook. It is a great relief that Shropshire county council will be responsible in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/6">I have spoken to the registration officer, who has some concerns about taking on that onerous task, not least because of the resources that will be required to manage common land&mdash;in particular, the cost of installing digital mapping. I share his concerns about the potential for confusion and conflict between the Rural Payments Agency and the common land registrar in each local authority. I hope that they will be able to match up the two different systems. I urge the Minister to address in Committee how that will be done in practice, because few MPs and even fewer people outside the House have much confidence in the Government's management of IT projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/7">I was relieved that the Minister confirmed that funding would be made available to the registration authorities. I hope that it will be sufficient to cope with the extra burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/8">I wish to address three aspects of the Bill, which have been touched on already today. Concerns have been expressed about the definition of village greens and open spaces that is set out in clause 15. Several hon. Members have referred to the Trap Grounds case that is going through the other place&mdash;the decision is awaited&mdash;and I am pleased that the Bill will provide clarity for all those concerned to establish ownership of village greens. In common with other hon. Members who have spoken, I welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/9">However, some concerns arise from the Government's changing views on the matter and I take slight issue with the comment made by the hon. Member for Stroud about the potentially conflicting rights of those seeking to obstruct or gain access to land, as opposed to those who have ownership rights over the land. The issue has been addressed throughout the long period of debate over common lands and I hope that the Government will consider introducing in Committee similar protections for those who have ownership rights, as laid out in section 31 of the Highways Act 1980.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/10">There would be a precedent for such a move. In the discussions that took place during the public consultation in February 2000, Ministers recognised that such protection for landowners' interests would be appropriate. In particular, the &quot;Common Land Policy Statement 2002&quot;, issued by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, stated, in relation to future legislation:</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/11" class="indent">&quot;There would, however, be a similar provision to that under Section 31 of the Highways Act 1980 concerning rights of way, so that a land owner could give notice that it is not his or her intention that the land should become a permanent town or village green&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/12">That has been referred to in the other place in debates on the Bill over the past year. The concern is that by providing a mere notice in the relevant place, it could give rise to vexatious or frustrating action on the part of those who have ownership rights. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" name="Peter Atkinson">My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)</phrase> effectively countered that argument by making the point that it could also prevent any new land from being opened up for public access, for fear that over time it would be turned into a formal village green, with all the implications that that would have for the landowners.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/13">I have a particular, slightly unusual case in my constituency, which relates to land owned by a charitable trust set up by the Church. The land is known as Glebe land and it is in the village of Clun. It has been owned by the Church for centuries and people in the village have had full public access to it on a permissive basis for much of that time. However, it is now potentially subject to sale, and there is considerable scope for conflict between the public who use the land and the Church. Far be it from me to get in the middle of that battle, but the issue appears incapable of resolution other than through the result of the Trap Grounds case or if the Bill included a similar provision to section 31 of the Highways Act 1980, as I have just mentioned. I ask the Minister to consider that proposal in Committee. The Church has had many lands confiscated over many centuries, since Henry VIII started the process, and this is not the right time to deny its property rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/14">Clause 27 addresses the role of commons associations and in particular their establishments. I have concerns that the drafting of clause 27(4) means that the appropriate national authority will have to be satisfied that substantial support exists for the making of an order for a commons association. I have examples in my constituency of existing commons associations that have a management agreement with English Nature. I met the Stiperstones Commoners Association last week, which looks after an area of nearly 1,000 acres, 700 of which are registered and 300 are unregistered. It has a management agreement with English Nature, under which it is essentially told what to do. The association has very little negotiating right on behalf of its three commons rights holders, who are small farmers in their own right. My concern is that if the appropriate national authority determines that an organisation should be set up with a dominant state entity as a party to it, that entity may call the shots, which may not necessarily be right. How will the national authority determine &quot;substantial support&quot; when there is a limited pool of existing rights holders? Will it be opened up to everybody who lives in the area surrounding the common? People will want to retain access rights to travel across the common, but they may not wish to exercise grazing rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/15">Another example is the Long Mynd, a well known landmark in my constituency. I am told by English Nature that shortly after the 1965 Act, more than 26,000 people registered rights on that common, which comprises some 2,000 hectares. That was clearly a massive exaggeration of rights and I hope that the Bill will put that right.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/16">There is no easy answer to these issues. The examples are so diverse, even in an area as similar as within a few miles of Shropshire hills.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-18a.95.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1774" speakername="Martin Salter" colnum="95"  time="020:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/debtext/60418-27.htm#60418-27_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.95.4/1">My hon. Friend clearly wishes the debate to continue for longer. I am sure that any intervention from him will achieve precisely that objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.4/2">These are the issues that I want the Minister to bear in mind. First, what problems does the Competition Commission's inquiry into classified directory advertising seek to solve, given that directories such as the excellent <i>Yellow Pages</i> are free to consumers, and that advertising rates are falling faster than the current price cap demands? What is the problem? Secondly, has the Competition Commission not recognised that there is now something called Google? As the man said, the internet has changed everything. People no longer need to advertise exclusively in classified directories, as almost every aspect of human knowledge is available on the internet. Thirdly, why does the Competition Commission appear to want to legislate for yesterday, rather than addressing problems that will confront the marketplace tomorrow or in years to come?</p>
	<p pid="a.95.4/3">The market for classified directory advertising may not strike everyone as one of the most important subjects for public debate, but for some reason it has become a subject of almost obsessive interest to the competition authorities in the UK, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Office of Fair Trading, the Competition Commission and its predecessor, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission&mdash;although, interestingly, that obsessive interest does not appear to be shared by their counterparts elsewhere in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.4/4">I make it absolutely clear that I have no declarable interest in the subject. I have no registered position or shareholding in any company that is active in the sector. My interest relates primarily to the fact that the market leader in the sector, Yell Group plc, is based in Reading and the prolonged inquiry by the Competition Commission is taking up a considerable amount of the company's time when it could otherwise be getting on with running its business.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.4/5">The OFT first referred the UK classified directory advertising industry to the Competition Commission's predecessor, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, in March 1995&mdash;a long time before this Government took office. In November that year, the MMC submitted its report and recommendations on various new undertakings, notably price controls, to the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Mr. Ian Lang. In March 1996, the DTI accepted the MMC's proposed undertakings, while the OFT was charged with monitoring their effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.4/6">Between 2000 and 2001, the OFT undertook a further study into the market and recommended to the DTI that the 1996 undertakings should be modified somewhat, chiefly by further tightening the price controls on <i>Yellow Pages</i>. The DTI accepted the advice, but suggested that the OFT should review the relevant undertakings again in 2005, with a view to having any new measures in place by <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>. We are now well past <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.4/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-03">3 November 2004</phrase>, under the somewhat unlikely headline &quot;OFT to review classified directory advertising and opium derivatives&quot;, the OFT issued a press release announcing the further review. Disappointingly, the headline turned out to refer to two separate cases, rather than an unusual instance of market convergence. In April 2005, the OFT decided to refer the whole subject back to the Competition Commission for another full investigation. The commission initially indicated that it expected to complete its inquiry by summer 2006, but the timetable has slipped several times, and the commission now does not plan to publish its report until September 2006, and perhaps not until April 2007. Not only would that be well past the DTI's original target of having any new measures in place by <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>, but it would break all known records for the longest, or, perhaps, slowest, competition inquiry yet undertaken by either the Competition Commission, or the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.4/8">The cause of the drawn-out obsession of the UK competition authorities with classified directory advertising is something of a mystery. A search of the parliamentary online database normally brings up questions asked by hon. Members on almost any subject, but there is virtually nothing on this issue. A few trade associations and advertising groups have given evidence to the current inquiry, as one would expect, but small businesses, many of which are regular users of classified advertising, appear to be unconcerned. Not a single one was chosen to give evidence to the current inquiry, and nor has the Federation of Small Businesses submitted any views to the Competition Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1774" name="Martin Salter">my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)</phrase> on securing a debate that I see as very important. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the issues that he raised. I, too, am surprised that the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" name="Jim Knight">our hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase> was not able to stay to give us the benefit of the skills gained from his long experience of working for Dentons Directories, but I understand that he had a previous commitment. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> for his intervention because I know that the issue is important to his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West raised the issue because, as he said, Yell's headquarters is in his constituency and is an important provider of jobs&mdash;almost 900, I think he said. He paid tribute to the work of the Communication Workers Union, Connect and Yell itself in raising the issue with him as the constituency Member. Clearly, there are many concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">I recently received a letter from my hon. Friend and am pleased that he has already had a response from the Competition Commission. I, too, shall send him a written response shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/4">My hon. Friend raised a number of issues, but he knows that I cannot intervene directly in many matters because of the rules of the competition framework that we have established. Where I can, I shall respond to his points. I also give him a commitment that, if he is not satisfied with my response, I shall be happy to meet a delegation from his constituency if that is helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/5">The UK competition framework has established the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission as independent statutory bodies and they take decisions based purely on competition considerations, unaffected by any political agenda or intervening factors, allowing experts and independent competition bodies to take decisions on mergers and markets. With that independence comes responsibility. The Competition Commission has a statutory duty to consult widely on its interim findings and to ensure that its members reach the right decisions. Independent competition authorities are a key benefit introduced under the Enterprise Act 2002 regime and are a key factor in the recognition of the OFT and the Competition Commission as world class. I know that my hon. Friend has doubts about the competence of both bodies but, as the Minister with responsibility for competition affairs, I can assure him that the UK is a world-class leader. Members on both sides of the House recognise the benefits of the revised structure that we have set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/6">The Office of Fair Trading may make a reference to the Competition Commission when it has reasonable grounds for suspecting that one or more features of a market prevent, restrict or distort competition in the UK. The Department of Trade and Industry cannot overrule or influence a decision by the OFT to make a market investigation reference. As required by the Enterprise Act, the OFT consulted on its proposal to refer the classified directory advertising services market before making the reference to the Competition Commission. Its consultation revealed no substantive evidence to change its mind about making a reference.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/7">My hon. Friend referred to the timetable. The Competition Commission aims to offer best value for money, reaching the right decision in the shortest period of time while following fair and transparent procedures. It does not have a free mandate on setting or extending its timetables for market investigations. There is a statutory maximum period of two years with no possibility of extension. The commission's rules of procedure require it to have an administrative timetable for the major stages of a review. It aims to complete its investigations well within the two-year maximum period. In the case of the classified directory advertising services inquiry, the commission hopes to complete the investigation well within the two-year statutory deadline.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/8">There are two main reasons why the Competition Commission's timetable for market investigations under the provisions of the Enterprise Act is longer than its monopoly investigations under the Fair Trading Act 1973. The group of members presiding over an inquiry has to be more transparent in its thinking during the course of an inquiry and the Competition Commission is now responsible for the determination and negotiation of remedies if an adverse effect on competition finding is reached. Increased transparency involves publishing more documents and providing parties to our inquiries with the opportunity to influence the commission's thinking well before the release of the final report.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/9">The Competition Commission keeps its procedures under constant review. It will see if anything can be done to speed up the time frame while following statutory requirements. It has recently completed its first Enterprise Act market investigation&mdash;into store card credit services&mdash;so this is an opportune time to consider how it investigates markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/10">My hon. Friend mentioned the emerging thinking document. The group of members working on the CDAS inquiry published their emerging thinking document on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January 2006</phrase>. It provides parties with an opportunity to study the group's evolving thoughts and to submit evidence in support of or against them. By the time the group publishes its emerging thinking, it will already have consulted widely on the key competition issues. The thinking is preliminary and it is possible that new evidence will come to hand that will significantly influence the group's decision before the publication of provisional findings and, of course, the final report.</p>
