	<p pid="a.577.0/1">I welcome the information that the Home Secretary has given this morning, but may I remind him that on <phrase class="date" code="">5 October</phrase> last year, I wrote to him about a constituent, James Bishop, who was killed by a foreign national who was removed from the country without standing a full trial? On <phrase class="date" code="">28 October</phrase>, from the Dispatch Box, I was given assurances that if there were lessons to be learned about that removal, they would be learned. Does he not agree that at the root of the problem is the co-ordination between three departments&mdash;the Prison Service, the IND and the Courts Service? I am glad that he is not resigning and is going to remain as Home Secretary, because the system has to be put right to ensure that people who kill people in this country stand trial before removal, and that those who have been convicted with a recommendation for deportation are removed and not allowed to remain.</p>

	<p pid="a.594.1/56" class="indent">(2) Proceedings on that Motion shall stand postponed until the conclusion of those proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.594.1/57" class="indent">17. If a day on which the Bill has been set down to be taken as an Order of the Day is one to which a Motion for the Adjournment of the House under <phrase class="standing-order" code="24">Standing Order No. 24</phrase> stands over from an earlier day, the bringing to a conclusion of any proceedings on the Bill which, in accordance with this Order, are to be brought to a conclusion on that day shall be postponed for a period equal to the duration of the proceedings on that Motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.594.1/58" class="indent">18. If the House is adjourned, or the sitting is suspended, before the conclusion of any proceedings to which this Order applies, no notice shall be required of a Motion made at the next sitting by a Minister of the Crown for varying or supplementing the provisions of this Order.</p>
	<p pid="a.594.1/59" class="indent">19. Proceedings to which this Order applies shall not be interrupted under any Standing Order relating to the sittings of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.594.1/60">The programme motion is based on discussions through the usual channels and reflects the urgent nature of the Bill. The House will already be aware that our plan is that the Assembly should be up and running by <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase>. For reasons that the Prime Minister set out in his joint statement with the Taoiseach at Armagh on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> and which I shall expand on later, we believe it is crucial that real momentum is now given to the pursuit of devolution in Northern Ireland. The <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase> date would give Assembly Members six weeks to elect a First Minister and Deputy First Minister and to make the necessary ministerial nominations before the beginning of July, when the Assembly traditionally begins its summer recess. It is for that reason that the Bill needs to be given swift passage through this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.594.1/61">Although the purposes the Bill serves are vital, it is a modest production. It contains six clauses, only two of which are substantive, and three schedules. Most of its provisions change the law only temporarily. The Assembly will operate in the new manner set out in the Bill by no later than <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>. After that, the arrangements in the present law will be revived&mdash;whether that is full devolution, as provided for in the Northern Ireland Act 1998, or the continued suspension of devolution under the Northern Ireland Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.594.1/62">I believe that the two days allotted under the programme motion is a substantial allowance of the time of the House for the discussion of such a Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.594.1/63" class="italic">Question agreed to.</p>

	<p pid="a.598.3/1">I have already done that but I am happy to accept the hon. Gentleman's invitation to emphasise and underline as much as necessary&mdash;in flashing neon lights, if he wishes and if that is not a mixed metaphor&mdash;that the deadline is for real. The salaries and allowances will stop at midnight on <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>. The Assembly will no longer sit, which it will be entitled to do after <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase>, and that will be that. I do not want that and, as I shall explain, there will be serious consequences if the parties do not act maturely and take their responsibilities to reflect the mandate and the job that they were elected to do. If they do not take that seriously, the consequences will be serious, but that will be their decision, not mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.3/2">The 10th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission was published today. I want to remind the House that the IMC has previously stated unequivocally that the IRA no longer represents a terrorist threat. That is clear, unambiguous and, in the context of all that has gone before, historic. That followed the IRA statement of July 2005 and the act of decommissioning later that year in September. Two of the demands, not only of Unionists, were that Sinn Fein should say that the war was over and that the IRA should decommission its arsenal of weapons. Both have now been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.3/3">The report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.598.3/4" class="indent">&quot;It remains our absolutely clear view that the PIRA leadership has committed itself to following a peaceful path. It is working to bring the whole organisation fully along with it and has expended considerable effort to refocus the movement in support of its objective. In the last three months this process has involved the further dismantling of PIRA as a military structure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.598.3/5">The IMC also states:</p>
	<p pid="a.598.3/6" class="indent">&quot;We are not aware of current terrorist, paramilitary or violent activity sanctioned by the leadership. We have no indications in the last three months of training, engineering activity, recent recruitment or targeting for the purposes of attack&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.602.4/1">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman disputes that, because I believe that the facts speak for themselves. Indeed, the IMC has repeatedly distinguished the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA as separate factions operating on their own, against the wishes of the leadership of the Provisional IRA and the leadership of Sinn Fein. Yes, PIRA and RIRA are dangerous outfits, and we will crack down on them. Indeed, we have been very successful in doing so, but there are no guarantees in this regard. Again, I say to him and his colleagues&mdash;I am sure that he will take this in good spirit&mdash;that there will come a time when DUP Members, having stood firm and having seen results flow from that, will have to acknowledge the massive changes that have occurred&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, I think that they will have to acknowledge that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-26a.605.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" speakername="Peter Hain" colnum="605"  time="013:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/debtext/60426-14.htm#60426-14_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.605.1/1">That is exactly my interpretation of what the IMC says. In relation to the statement that any information that the organisation receives is not outside the terms of the July statement, I can only conclude that it is the kind of political information that all political parties like to receive on our opponents, and that it is not for any other purpose. Again, we have seen a major change. About a year ago, it was reported that the IRA was still gathering intelligence, even though it had stopped targeting and had no apparent intent to commit any paramilitary actions. Now we know that the intelligence activity that may or may not be going on in terms of the receipt of information is, presumably, entirely political, and is certainly not directed towards supporting any violent, paramilitary or illegal action.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.1/2">The IMC report welcomes Gerry Adams's comments in which he supported the pursuit of criminal assets&mdash;this is important, given the questions that I was asked earlier&mdash;and said that anybody involved in criminality should face the full rigours of the law. That was very welcome indeed. Since the report was compiled, the IRA has reiterated that position in its Easter message. The IMC draws the distinction between what members or former members of an organisation may do as individuals and what has been authorised, sanctioned or approved by the organisation itself, a distinction acknowledged by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1400" name="Peter Robinson">the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> in his very interesting speech to the British-Irish inter-parliamentary body in Killarney on Tuesday.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.1/3">In the context of believing what people do as well as what they say, that distinction is crucial. We should all take encouragement from what is now clearly the case according to the IMC; namely that the IRA has delivered, and is continuing to deliver, on its promise to end all violence and criminality, so that republicans are committed to democratic and peaceful methods. Of course there are individual criminals out there, some claiming republican or loyalist affiliation; but as the recent activity of the Garda, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Assets Recovery Agency has shown, they will be ruthlessly pursued, whoever they are. In short, there has been and continues to be momentous progress to report.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.1/4">Trust is a two-way process. Where there has been deep division and where fears and suspicion were well-founded, trust is not going to emerge freshly minted. It must be developed and built on and the only way in which to do that is through dialogue.If parties are serious about testing the bona fides of others, they should do it as we do in this House, face to face. If parties are serious about devolution, they should engage with one another. If parties make a point of their mandate as leaders of their community, they should respect the mandate of others and show real leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.1/5">Frankly, it is hard for an outsider to understand why members of the DUP will talk to Sinn Fein in television studios and sit with Sinn Fein members as local councillors, but will not talk to Sinn Fein privately or as Members of the Legislative Assembly. It is equally hard to see why Sinn Fein is able to meet the Chief Constable in Downing street, while the Sinn Fein chairman of a council will not talk to a district commander at a civic function. What Northern Ireland needs is mature politics. Between May 15 and <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>, we will see whether the people of Northern Ireland will get the leadership that they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.1/6">Let me now deal with the Bill. The framework is simple; it brings back the Members of the Assembly to meet in order to prepare for the restoration of devolved government, which means selecting an Executive. If they achieve that by <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> we shall proceed immediately to devolution, with Assembly elections in May 2008. If they do not, we shall have to proceed by other means, and the Assembly election scheduled for May 2007 will be postponed indefinitely.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.1/7">The Assembly would meet on <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase> in a new mode. It would have no legislative powers, there would be no Executive and hence the direct rule arrangements would continue. The Bill provides for me to refer to the Assembly first the selection of a First Minister and Deputy First Minister, then the running of the d'Hondt process to fill the other ministerial posts in the Executive. I can also refer other matters to the Assembly as I think fit.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.1/8">The arrangements are similar to those that applied when the Assembly was first elected in 1998. I have power to make directions about procedure, including the appointment of a presiding officer and the provision of Standing Orders. That is important, because the Assembly in its early days must not be distracted from its main tasks by long-drawn-out discussions on preliminary issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.1/9">As I have said, I intend to appoint Mrs Eileen Bell as presiding officer. She is highly respected among the parties, and I am sure that she will fill her post with distinction. In the operation of the Assembly, I hope that there can be the greatest possible consensus between us and the parties, and in that event I shall be only too happy to leave the Assembly to sort out internal issues for itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.607.0/1">I am sorry; I am always reluctant to disagree with the hon. Lady, but I do not regret it at all. A body consisting of 108 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly will meet, and I do not know what we could call it other than an Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/2">I am encouraged by early discussions with the parties to believe that there is a serious intention to make the Assembly work. Today we are making available an illustrative set of initial Standing Orders, on which we shall work further before <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase>. They can readily be supplemented at a later stage if need be, and if parties or individual Members have any comments, we shall be glad to take them on board. I am ready to refer to the Assembly a range of matters that will feature among the key concerns of a new devolved Administration. As I have said, we would take account of the Assembly's views on such matters, especially if they had cross-community support. They might include education reform, local government reform, water charges or rates rises. They might also include modifications to the institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/3">Northern Ireland's business community has presented the Prime Minister and me with an interesting policy agenda for economic reform. We have suggested that it would be a suitable matter for business leaders to present to the Assembly soon after <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase>. Obviously, if the Assembly were then to work on and agree a serious and costed economic policy reform programme, the Government would be obliged to consider it seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/4">We have been pressed to say that we would automatically give effect to views expressed by the Assembly. We as a Government are accountable in this place for the good government of Northern Ireland pending the restoration of devolution, and it would be wrong for us to have our hands tied completely. We cannot be accountable both to this Parliament and to an Assembly that is not even fully restored, and where there is little incentive to make the tough decisions that are needed. It is obvious, however, that a cross-community view from the Assembly would be very influential with us. The sooner devolution is restored, the sooner the Assembly will have complete authority over such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/5">I have been pressed to say why we are proceeding on matters such as education and local council reform when the Assembly could and should determine those matters. My answer is that our measures are absolutely necessary in the public interest and as I am far from certain that some of their most vociferous opponents are actually willing to restore the Assembly, why should I let them have their cake and eat it by delaying the reforms? Either they want to determine these policies, or they do not. If they do, let them get on with it and restore the institutions as soon after <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase> as possible. The longer they delay, the more irreversible these reforms will be, and the more I will have to decide the detail rather than leaving it to Assembly Members. It is their choice, not mine.</p>

	<p pid="a.608.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right, and I am grateful for the opportunity that he has given me to spell out the position even more clearly than I have already. If restoration is achieved very quickly after <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase>, as I hope it will be, the order abolishing the 11-plus will not have gone through Parliament. A restored Assembly will then have the opportunity to decide what it wants to do about education policy. I know that the hon. Gentleman disagrees with me, but I happen to think that the policy is right, and is in the interests not just of those who do well at the top of the education ladder but of those who do terribly at the bottom. In any event, I think that that is an appropriate decision for a restored Assembly to make. However, because I believe that abolition is in the public interest in Northern Ireland, I will not delay in the hope that the Assembly may be restored at some point; next year, the following year or whenever people get around to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.608.1/2">My message is absolutely clear. Some may think it blunt, but it is clear. If people want to make decisions for themselves, let them get on with making those decisions for themselves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-26a.641.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="641"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/debtext/60426-23.htm#60426-23_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.641.2/1">I am pleased to speak, if only briefly, in this debate. I wish to take the opportunity to make a few comments, but I shall begin by welcoming many of the speeches that have preceded me, not least <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1375" name="Ian Paisley">the speech by the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)</phrase>. All the speeches so far have been characterised by courage and leadership. I represent a constituency with no historical affinity or great links with Northern Ireland&mdash;although I have spoken regularly on Northern Ireland matters&mdash;but the contributions have filled me with great optimism. While a long journey remains to be made, I and other colleagues are greatly encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.641.2/2">There are enormous reasons in Northern Ireland politics for the long history of distrust on all sides and they are measured in the incidents of violence and the atrocities that have been perpetrated, which we all condemn. Even recently, there are reasons to extend that distrust further, such as the recent history of bank raids and the failure to sign up properly to the changes to policing and the criminal justice system. Even in the welcome report by the IMC today, we see paragraphs on the dissident republican groups and loyalist paramilitarism. Despite that, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> mentioned, we are today considering a leap of faith. However, that leap will not be taken completely in the dark: it is based on evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.641.2/3">We can begin with the IRA statement on <phrase class="date" code="">28 July</phrase>, in which it clearly signalled the end of an armed campaign. The history of Northern Ireland suggests that we should view that with distrust, but it is a significant issue on its own. The IMC report noted, despite reservations in certain areas, a sea change in Northern Ireland politics and the willingness of groups to lay down the gun and subscribe to the democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="a.641.2/4">Indeed, the greater peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland is illustrated by the story of Belfast itself. My wife now regularly travels to Belfast for her &quot;away day&quot; with fellow wives, but only 10 or 15 years ago that would have been almost inconceivable. Belfast is now one of the destinations to which people aspire to travel to spend time in, not least because of the welcome received and the friendliness of the people there.</p>
	<p pid="a.641.2/5">The Bill is a question of faith, and that also applies to the Government. Ministers have the strong belief, which I share, that if they pass the ball firmly across to the politicians of Northern Ireland, they will run with it and deliver. I am encouraged by this debate and I believe that the ball will not be fumbled or dropped. There is every hope that in the ensuing months we will see not simply an Executive, but&mdash;despite the worries about a talking shop&mdash;a fully functioning democratic institution with a mandate, so that Assembly Members can deliver their promises and make their judgments, instead of that being done by the MP for Ogmore and others like me. That is what I hope for today.</p>
	<p pid="a.641.2/6">There will always be thousands of reasons to hesitate about making progress in Northern Ireland. The only reason for making progress is that that is what will benefit the wider population there. Politicians&mdash;whether they belong to the Assembly or the Opposition&mdash;know that what happens to them is less important than delivering peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. The Bill is an essential step in that endeavour.</p>
	<p pid="a.641.2/7">I hope that members of the DUP, the UUP, the SDLP and other parties will use the proceedings of today and tomorrow to take matters forward. History will not say that they sold out or that they were backsliders; they will be remembered as statesmen and stateswomen with courage and vision in difficult times. These difficult questions are not for political journeymen, and the right hon. Member for North Antrim was correct to say that we must look beyond the horizon. I have every hope that we can move forward today.</p>
	<p pid="a.641.2/8">It would be unfair of me to finish my brief remarks if I did not pay tribute to those who have brought us to this point. Former Secretaries of State, both Labour and Conservative, have made important contributions, and members of the UUP, the DUP, the SDLP and other parties have taken incrementally courageous and painful decisions to get us to where we are today. I look forward to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" name="Paul Murphy">the day when my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)</phrase> can celebrate a very good birthday, when his present will be that the political institutions in Northern Ireland are in place and running effectively, led by Northern Ireland politicians.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-26a.645.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="645"  time="016:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/debtext/60426-24.htm#60426-24_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.645.0/1">Like other Members, I welcome the tantalising glimpse of restored power in Northern Ireland, possibly by <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.645.0/2">As Democratic Unionist Members are limiting their speeches to 10 minutes, I shall try to do the same, in a spirit of collaboration and co-operation. I want to focus on some of the benefits of devolution and what it could mean for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.645.0/3">The Government have introduced devolution in Scotland, Wales and London. I was one of the 25 members of the original London assembly elected in 2000 and am one of only 34 assembly members to date. We are the smallest city government in Europe, a contrast with the Northern Ireland Assembly of 108 Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.645.0/4">Local government was restored to London in 2000. I am on record as having many differences, at different times, with the incumbent Mayor of London; no doubt I and others will have differences with future Mayors, but I defend the institution, as I defend the principle of devolving power to the most appropriate level.</p>
	<p pid="a.645.0/5">I want to highlight some of the benefits that we have seen in London, because the people of Northern Ireland could see similar benefits if the Assembly sets up an Executive and power is truly devolved. The main change has been in transport where there has been a real transformation. There has been a huge increase in bus services and a reduction in car travel, which could not have happened when such issues were run solely from Westminster. It was the power and will of a London Mayor who could make decisions for the whole city that made the difference. There is a whole-London approach and a strong political voice, with political power devolved to a wider city region.</p>
	<p pid="a.645.0/6">One of the crucial decisions in which was London involved could not have been made without the devolution of power: the delivery of the London Olympics. There is an important parallel for Northern Ireland. Theoretically, such decisions could have been made through local government, but we could not have had the Olympics because no London borough would voluntarily have voted for a council tax increase of &pound;20 a year for their residents. Whether or not we agree with the Mayor's decision, he was in a position to take it.</p>
	<p pid="a.645.0/7">The parallel with Northern Ireland is perhaps the review of local administration and the current debate about the future of local government there. As it stands today, many small district councils and numerous public bodies run health, education and other public services. If regional government, the Assembly and the Executive are restored, the people of Northern Ireland will be able to take decisions that will deliver for the whole of Northern Ireland rather than for the individual districts or individual service areas. London has a population of 7.5 million, Northern Ireland about 1.5 million; but I firmly believe that both have the right to be released from the grip of Westminster control.</p>
	<p pid="a.645.0/8">It is rather peculiar for me, a London Member of Parliament, to be in my place today taking decisions on Northern Ireland issues in a Chamber that is lamentably empty of the Members who will pass through the Lobbies if we divide tonight or on other occasions when we debate Northern Ireland legislation. It feels wrong that the people of Northern Ireland who elect their own representatives here, albeit only a handful in the House as a whole, do not have links to a directly elected Assembly in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.645.0/9">Members have already debated the issue of whether it is right for the Secretary of State to suspend decisions on Northern Ireland between <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">The hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> made his point eloquently. As he rightly said, we often find ourselves in agreement in the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. I am not making a party political point, but I disagree with him on this matter. The Government cannot stand still in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. For example, if we suspended decisions on the review of public administration as he suggests, and if, in the worst case scenario, the attempt to set up the Executive failed, we would then be left with the variety of small district councils, which might be unable to take on some of the requisite responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.666.0/1">I have listened with great interest to the debate and know that all my colleagues have made valid points. I have never had the privilege or the opportunity&mdash;whatever word one wishes to use&mdash;of sitting in the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="a.666.0/2">I listened to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase>, who used the word &quot;tantalising&quot;. Well, when it comes to a three-course meal or a large steak&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, I have many of them and I would probably refer to them as tantalising, but I have to say that the prospect of going into the Assembly on <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase> is not tantalising for me. It is not tantalising because I will probably be sitting across the room from an individual who gave the authority for four of my family to be assassinated. It may well be hard for hon. Members who have not experienced such circumstances to understand, but it will be very difficult for me. My party has taken the decision to go in on <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase> and I will join it because I believe that it has a lot to offer the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.666.0/3">We all know about the other Unionist party and its leadership, which led the Unionist population in the wrong direction. I am living proof that the Unionist population does not suffer fools gladly, which is why I took the seat in Upper Bann. We often hear the old clich&eacute; from Sinn Fein-IRA that they have a mandate, and we also hear them saying that the Democratic Unionist party is not serious about anything. They say that we are not serious about trying to get an Assembly up and running and, to use the words of Gerry Adams or Martin McGuinness, that the DUP does not want a Fenian about the place. Those are their words, not mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.666.0/4">I have sat in meetings&mdash;in fact, at Leeds Castle&mdash;when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1375" name="Ian Paisley">my right hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)</phrase> told the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, &quot;I am not asking for anything for myself that I am not asking for my Roman Catholic neighbour.&quot; That is a fact; my party is about representing all the people in our constituencies. So the nonsense that Sinn Fein come out with is just a myth.</p>
	<p pid="a.666.0/5">I refer to family tragedy and many of my colleagues could relate to family tragedies and those involving others connected to their families, but let us remember that we must consult the victims and convince them that it is time to move on. That will be very difficult. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1666" name="Jeffrey M Donaldson">My hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson)</phrase> and I are the chair and vice-chair of our party's victims organisation. We talk to victims on a weekly and monthly basis and we hear the stories that come from those people&mdash;the tragedies and the heartbreak&mdash;and it will be very hard for them to move on. But as a constructive party that will show leadership, it is our job to talk to those people and to convince them that it is time to move on. That will be difficult, but I believe that those people must be helped through that painful time.</p>
	<p pid="a.666.0/6">Another of my concerns is that we talk about Sinn Fein-IRA coming on to different bodies and structures in government. For example, if Sinn Fein-IRA decided that they would go on to the Policing Board today, in reality, what information could the Chief Constable release in a Policing Board meeting that would not be passed on, possibly to some of their colleagues?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-26a.674.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" colnum="674"  time="018:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/debtext/60426-32.htm#60426-32_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.674.3/1">Let us see what happens. I believe that progress is being made and will continue to be made, and that the IMC will back that up.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/2">The Government will not tolerate criminality and paramilitary activity. On the republican side, in March we undertook operations resulting in 100,000 litres of fuel being seized, with the Criminal Assets Bureau freezing &pound;1 million in cash and cheques found during that search. This week alone, the Assets Recovery Agency secured &pound;140,000 from alleged fuel smuggling, as was mentioned by the hon. Members for East Londonderry, for South Antrim and for Lagan Valley. On the loyalist side, in December the Assets Recovery Agency froze &pound;400,000 from alleged loyalist paramilitaries, and assets of &pound;200,000 were frozen after the murder of the alleged loyalist brigadier, Jim Gray. The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is currently examining how we deal with such issues. Criminality and paramilitary activity will not be tolerated, and the Government will work towards that end, but I believe that the conditions that Members are seeking will be achieved in due course through movements by the Provisional IRA.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/3">We have to face reality and look to the significant challenges that will ensue. The Bill provides the framework whereby we can facilitate the dialogue for the future. As the hon. Member for Foyle said, individuals have worked together to do things that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. They did not abandon their beliefs in a united Ireland or in an Ireland that has relationships, through Northern Ireland, with the British Government as part of the United Kingdom, but they worked together on issues to do with the economics and day-to-day life of their communities. More than anything else, I want that to happen now.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/4">Through the Bill, we have set up the Assembly. I know that the hon. Member for North Down has concerns about that, but I say to her and to others that we want it to be able to discuss real issues as well as to elect a First Minister and Deputy First Minister and an Executive, and as soon as possible, I hope, optimistic as I am, to form a Government and return to the full Assembly that the hon. Lady so desires. In the meantime, we have given it the opportunity to discuss and express views on education, the review of public administration, and water charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/5">There has been a serious debate about how the Government will take account of those views in this Chamber. We will listen to what is said and consider the issues that are put to us, but we still have a duty as a Government to govern Northern Ireland in the best interests of its population. Whatever the Assembly that is set up in a fortnight's time may be, it will not be an Executive Assembly until it elects an Executive. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my fellow Ministers have a duty to this House to govern Northern Ireland responsibly, and it would be constitutionally wrong for us to say that we will automatically defer to another body while doing so. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch observed, we have a job to do in Northern Ireland until such time as the Assembly forms an Executive to do that job.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/6">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State clearly set out the cost of maintaining the Assembly that has been unable to function. I pay tribute to the Members of the Assembly for the work that they do at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/7">I receive delegations on housing, culture, sport and the range of issues for which I am responsible from Members of the Legislative Assembly who are now doing a constituency job. They write letters to me, visit, press us on a range of subjects and publicly comment on issues. They are doing a job but not the job that we are doing today&mdash;holding the Executive to account in a Chamber and legislating. I hope and pray that they will do that in due course in the Assembly. However, in the event of that not happening, we have to consider the costs of the Assembly and the way in which we hold elections to a future Assembly. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has set the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> for progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/8">The deadline is not a threat&mdash;it is simply an embodiment of a political reality. We cannot go on as we have done. We cannot finance a non-functioning Assembly indefinitely or go through the motions of an election next May to an Assembly that does not meet, legislate or hold the Executive to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/9">The process creates the potential for an Assembly to meet on <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase> and elect an Executive, but, if it cannot do that, to discuss some of the issues and reflect the opinions of the 108 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly to my right hon. Friend and I. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/10">Some hon. Members rightly asked about Orders in Council. I have said to the hon. Members for Aylesbury, for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson), for Montgomeryshire and others that we do not find that procedure especially satisfactory. There are difficulties with it and my right hon. Friend has written to hon. Members to ask for their views on how we can improve the process. However, we have to govern. We have to make decisions and determine how we make progress in future. We have to run Departments. When my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, the Taoiseach and I met business people in Armagh about some of issues on which we govern, they welcomed aspects of what we did. They welcomed some of the changes that we are making in, for example, the review of public administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/11">We will have to listen and we will take representations. There will be an opportunity for the Assembly to present its opinions. However, we are accountable to the House for billions of pounds of public money that my right hon. Friend and I are spending on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland in the absence of the Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/12">I hope that the Bill is about success, not failure. We believe that it is the best vehicle for success that can be constructed at the moment. We need the Assembly to be back in place and we must examine how we can make it work for the future. The challenge to all hon. Members is how we do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.3/13">The hon. Member for North Down mentioned the delay in holding the election. We will discuss that when we consider the amendments tomorrow. We believe that the delay is necessary for the simple reason that, if we get the Assembly operational by October or November, it will work for only a few months before the rigours of an election.</p>

	<p pid="a.676.1/1">I cannot because of lack of time. We have delayed the election for one year, not to meddle with democracy, as has been alleged, but to give the Assembly the opportunity to bed in, if it is formed, and to be stable and satisfactory for going into an election in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.676.1/2">The Government are trying to get the Assembly back up and running. We are setting the framework for it to work. However, the prime movers must be the political parties that represent the people of Northern Ireland. We must move forward on the basis of an accommodation between people in Northern Ireland represented by their political leaders in the Assembly. If the House approves the Bill, the message to the people of Northern Ireland is that we have confidence in them and believe that they can run the affairs of their Province. We will support them in doing that, hand them billions of pounds of Government money to expend on their priorities and give an opportunity locally for them to determine their priorities, so that people who represent constituencies in Neath and north Wales do not choose them on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.676.1/3">There is an opportunity for the Assembly to be reformed and to make progress. I hope that, on <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase>, the Assembly will elect an Executive and commence that process. We look forward to considering amendments tomorrow. In the meantime, for the reason that democracy is exercised best when exercised locally by locally accountable people, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.676.1/4" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.676.1/5" class="italic">Bill accordingly read a Second time, and committed to a Committee of the whole House, pursuant to Order [this day].</p>
	<p pid="a.676.1/6" class="italic">Committee tomorrow.</p>
