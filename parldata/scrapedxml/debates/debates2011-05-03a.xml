	<p pid="a.434.0/1">Since the election nearly a year ago, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and his ministerial team have been to more than 30 Commonwealth countries, of which I have visited seven. I assure my hon.

	<p pid="a.434.1/1">The Minister will know that the Commonwealth Secretariat, which works for more than a third of the world&#8217;s population, is run on a shoestring, yet we give billions to the European Union.

	<p pid="a.434.2/1">The Commonwealth does a first-class job, and it is exemplary in providing excellent value for money from its Secretariat here in London. I am delighted that the multilateral aid review by the Department for International Development concluded that the Commonwealth has a unique place in the international system and can play an even more significant role in development.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.3/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if the Commonwealth is to be reinvigorated and live up to its ideals, it needs to take a tougher line against member countries such as Sri Lanka, which committed war crimes against its Tamil civilian population according to the recent UN report? Should the Commonwealth not call for an independent international investigation into those war crimes, and suspend Sri Lanka from the Commonwealth unless it co-operates with such an investigation?</p>

	<p pid="a.435.0/1">The post-conflict stabilisation and peace-building effort in Libya will be an international effort, co-ordinated by the United Nations in support of the Libyan people. The UK has undertaken early, cross-Whitehall planning, supported by the stabilisation unit, focusing on how we can support the international effort. Staff have been deployed to the region to provide stabilisation expertise on Libya and Arab partnership programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.1/1">We must learn the lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan, where in my experience we sometimes contributed what we were able to deliver rather than what was needed. What conversations is the Secretary of State having with Cabinet colleagues to ensure that should Britain make a contribution to post-conflict reconstruction in Libya, it is as effective as possible?</p>

	<p pid="a.435.2/1">We are certainly having those conversations, and the hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that there are lessons to be learned from previous situations, including Iraq. The National Security Council is already working well on the matter, and of course my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development plays a very strong role on the subject. We are working with the UN already, and the UN is making good progress with stabilisation planning, but of course it is constrained in what it can physically do on the ground by the absence of peace and a political settlement in Libya. However, the planning is taking place and the UK is playing an important supporting role.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.3/1">Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the best first step towards the reconstruction of the country would be peace and a ceasefire? Will he therefore assure the House that all his efforts are pointed in that direction rather than just at regime change?</p>

	<p pid="a.435.4/1">Our efforts are devoted to implementing UN resolution 1973, which begins by calling for a ceasefire and an end to violence. Of course, that means a genuine ceasefire in which the regime not only really does cease fire but pulls back its forces from the areas where it is attacking the civilian population. It is in the search for that ceasefire and the protection of the civilian population that we are doing what we are doing in Libya.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.6/1">As I said, the UN is leading on the matter, and it will spearhead the reconstruction effort.

Of course, under the treaties, that competence is given explicitly to member states rather than to European institutions, but it is quite right that the EEAS should, in line with the treaties, support the work of EU member states, especially by signposting EU nationals who are unrepresented to embassies or high commissions of another member state where they can obtain representation.</p>

	<p pid="a.436.8/1">The UK continues to take a leading role in international efforts to protect civilians in Libya. The case for action remains compelling. Gaddafi&#8217;s regime persists in attacking its own people and wilfully killing its own civilian population. We have taken diplomatic action, including co-chairing the Libya contact group, and have played a key role in military action by NATO and provided more than &#163;13 million of humanitarian aid to the Libyan people.</p>

The number of sorties continues to mount, with hundreds over the weekend, and the UK continues to play a very strong role, including through strike sorties.

	<p pid="a.437.6/1">No, and there is no indication that that is leading to such a thing. In fact, I held discussions with the secretary-general of the Arab League, Mr Amr Moussa, in Cairo yesterday. Indeed, the restrictions in the resolution were the product of discussions between him and me on the day that the resolution was passed at the UN. He is supportive of how the resolution is being interpreted, and the Arab League continues to support our efforts. Arab nations will be strongly represented at the contact group meeting in Rome on Thursday, which I will attend. I hope I can reassure my right hon. and learned Friend on those points.</p>

	<p pid="a.438.0/1">I do not think that it would be right to expand on what I have already said about targeting. Whether individuals are targeted depends, of course, on how they behave, and whether they are part of command and control centres, and on where they are at the time. I do not think it right to provide a running commentary on targeting, and nor is it militarily sensible to do so, and I therefore do not want to expand on my earlier answers.</p>

We published very clearly a note on the legal advice at the time of the <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-21">21 March</phrase> debate.

	<p pid="a.440.7/1">Yes, indeed. The events of the weekend were an opportunity for the world community to come together and condemn those who had united Christian, Jew and Muslim against their murdering misery over the years.

This case only goes to illustrate, however, the need for both sides to return to negotiations based on parameters, because the spiral of violence&#8212;particularly what we have seen recently on both sides&#8212;is just leading to more misery before a settlement can be concluded.</p>

	<p pid="a.441.3/1">There is real concern about the continuing lack of progress towards peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.

	<p pid="a.441.4/1">It is difficult to see the impact at this stage, because not all the details are available. It must always have been the case that at some stage there must be Palestinian unity, because there cannot be a sensible two-state solution unless all parts of what is deemed to be Palestine are involved. Therefore, the fact that Fatah and Hamas have come to some agreement is something that might provide a step forward. However, it is crucial that that should lead to progress and to both Palestinian wings continuing to reject violence, continuing with the peace process and recognising the state of Israel. As yet, Hamas has not made any move in that direction. We hope that the reconciliation will eventually lead to progress towards a democratic Palestinian state that will indeed reject violence and wish to live in peace and security with its neighbour, but we must judge it by its actions.</p>

	<p pid="a.444.4/1">It would be surprising if there were not differing voices and internal tensions on these subjects. Clearly, many issues are moving in the middle east, with the changed situation in Egypt and pressure on the Syrian Government. Hamas has been encouraged by the new Government in Egypt to enter into the political reconciliation with Fatah, as discussed earlier. I believe that it might also feel less secure in its position in Syria. These are forces now at work on Hamas, and it is important in the light of the changes in the middle east that, as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon.

	<p pid="a.448.1/1">The House is aware that the Prime Minister will shortly give a statement on the death of Osama bin Laden, but I hope the Foreign Secretary will agree that the success of the Arab spring could yet be an even more significant blow to al-Qaeda. Given that, will he update us on the work being done to stop the repression of demonstrators in Syria? In particular, when will the European Union act, and will the Foreign Secretary give an undertaking to work to ensure that Syria does not take Libya&#8217;s vacated place on the UN Human Rights Council?</p>

	<p pid="a.448.2/1">I fully agree with the right hon. Gentleman. Indeed, this is a moment for people across the middle east to reflect that in so many countries it has been possible to bring about peaceful and democratic change&#8212;that may yet happen in more countries&#8212;and that the violent philosophy of al-Qaeda that only violence and death can bring about change is bankrupt and should increasingly be vanquished across the middle east. That does, indeed, bring us to Syria. The UK is at the forefront of pressing for action by the European Union. At the end of last week, we secured agreement on an arms embargo and the revocation of the association agreement that had been put in place with Syria. We are now working with our European partners on targeted sanctions such as asset freezes and travel bans&#8212;I will be discussing those further with the French Foreign Minister this evening&#8212;and we are also highly active at the United Nations Security Council on this issue, although the right hon. Gentleman will understand that Syria is a difficult issue at the UN Security Council and that some of the members, including permanent members, require a good deal of convincing that the United Nations should be taking any action.</p>

	<p pid="a.449.1/1">Nothing disproportionate has happened or will happen to the BBC World Service. The reduction in its spending between 2007 and 2014, the period for which the Foreign Office is under spending restraint, will be exactly the same as the proportionate reduction in the rest of the Foreign Office family and a good deal less than that for the British Council. It is important that we save money across the public sector&#8212;we have had to do so given the behaviour of the previous Government&#8212;but the World Service has a secure future, as does the Arabic service. Transferring the BBC World Service into the licence fee funding arrangement means that it has a secure future for the long term.</p>

In one month it will be forced to reduce its daily output of live TV news from 15 hours to seven and of live radio from 12 hours to seven, and it will also lose 44 of its Arabic staff.

	<p pid="a.449.5/1">The answer really is the same as the one I gave a few moments ago: we have to operate within all the spending constraints involved in repairing the budgetary catastrophe left to us after last year&#8217;s general election. Unfortunately, that has consequences for the World Service too, but the Arabic service, along with so many other services of the World Service, will not just be</p>

Last Wednesday evening I called the Syrian Foreign Minister and communicated directly to him the views of the United Kingdom about the unacceptable violence against protestors. I urged the Syrian authorities to go down the route of reform rather than repression, but, sadly, they are increasingly taking the route of repression. The hon.

In Bahrain, there is still hope of dialogue and the situation is therefore different from some of the others in the middle east. Serious efforts at dialogue have been made by some of those who are now in authority, so we call again on them&#8212;on the ruling family and ruling group in Bahrain and on opposition groups&#8212;to enter into such a dialogue, which is the only viable way to a future for Bahrain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.453.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40665" speakername="David Cameron" speakeroffice="The Prime Minister"  colnum="453"  time="015:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0001.htm#1105036000510">
	<p pid="a.453.1/1">The death of Osama bin Laden will have important consequences for the security of our people at home and abroad and for our foreign policy, including our partnership with Pakistan, our military action in Afghanistan and the wider fight against terrorism across the world. Last night, I chaired a meeting of Cobra to begin to address some of these issues, the National Security Council has met this morning and I wanted to come to the House this afternoon to take the first opportunity to address these consequences directly and to answer hon. Members&#8217; questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/2">At 3 am yesterday I received a call from President Obama. He informed me that US special forces had successfully mounted a targeted operation against a compound in Abbottabad, in Pakistan. Osama bin Laden had been killed along with four others&#8212;bin Laden&#8217;s son, two others linked to him and a female member of his family entourage. There was a ferocious firefight and a US helicopter had to be destroyed but there was no loss of American life. I am sure the whole House will join me in congratulating President Obama and in praising the courage and skill of the American special forces who carried out this operation. It is a strike at the heart of international terrorism and a great achievement for America and for all who have joined in the long struggle to defeat al-Qaeda.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/3">We should remember today in particular the brave British servicemen and women who have given their lives in the fight against terrorism across the world, and we should pay tribute especially to those British forces who played their part over the past decade in the hunt for bin Laden. He was the man who was responsible for 9/11, which was not only an horrific killing of Americans, but remains to this day the largest loss of British life in any terrorist attack. He was a man who inspired further atrocities, including those in Bali, Madrid, Istanbul and, of course, here in London on 7/7. He was, let us remember, a man who posed as a leader of Muslims, but was actually a mass murderer of Muslims all over the world. Indeed, he killed more Muslims than people of any other faith.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/4">Nothing will bring back the loved ones who have been lost, and of course there is no punishment at our disposal that can remotely fit the many appalling crimes for which bin Laden was responsible, but I hope that at least for the victims&#8217; families there is now some sense of justice being served, as a long dark chapter in their lives is finally closed. As the head of a family group for United Airlines flight 93, put it, we are</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/5">&#8220;raised, obviously, never to hope for someone&#8217;s death&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/6">but we are</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/7">&#8220;willing to make an exception in this case...He was evil personified, and our world is a better place without him.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/8">Britain was with America from the first day of the struggle to defeat al-Qaeda. Our resolve today should be as strong as it was then. There can be no impunity and no safe refuge for those who kill in the name of this poisonous ideology.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/9">Our first focus should be our own security. Although bin Laden is gone, the threat of al-Qaeda remains. Clearly there is a risk that al-Qaeda and its affiliates in</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/10">places such as Yemen and the Maghreb will want to demonstrate that they are able to operate effectively, and of course there is always the risk of a radicalised individual acting alone&#8212;a so-called lone-wolf attack. So we must be more vigilant than ever, and we must maintain that vigilance for some time to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/11">The terrorist threat level in the UK is already at severe, which is as high as it can go without intelligence of a specific threat. We will keep that threat level under review, working closely with the intelligence agencies and the police. In terms of people travelling overseas, we have updated our advice and encourage British nationals to monitor the media carefully for local reactions, to remain vigilant, to exercise caution in public places and to avoid demonstrations. We have ordered our embassies across the world to review their security.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/12">Let me turn next to Pakistan. The fact that bin Laden was living in a large house in a populated area suggests that he must have had an extensive support network in Pakistan. We do not currently know the extent of that network, so it is right that we ask searching questions about it, and we will. But let us start with what we do know. Pakistan has suffered more from terrorism than any other country in the world. As both President Zardari and Prime Minister Gilani said to me when I spoke to them yesterday, as many as 30,000 innocent civilians have been killed in Pakistan, and more Pakistani soldiers and security forces have died fighting extremism than international forces killed in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/13">Osama bin Laden was an enemy of Pakistan. He had declared war against the Pakistani people and he had ordered attacks against them. President Obama said in his statement that</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/14">&#8220;counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/15">Continued co-operation will be just as important in the days ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/16">I believe it is in Britain&#8217;s national interest to recognise that with Pakistan we share the same struggle against terrorism. That is why we will continue to work with our Pakistani counterparts on intelligence gathering, tracing plots and taking action to stop them. It is why we will continue to honour our aid promises, including our support for education as a critical way of helping the next generation of Pakistanis to turn their back on extremism. Above all, it is why we were one of the founder members of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan, because I believe it is by working with the democrats in that country that we can make sure the whole country shares the same determination to fight terror and terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/17">I also spoke yesterday to President Karzai in Afghanistan. We both agreed that the death of bin Laden provides a new opportunity for Afghanistan and Pakistan to work together in order to achieve stability on both sides of the border. Our strategy towards Afghanistan is straightforward and has not changed. We want an Afghanistan capable of looking after its own security without the help of foreign forces. We should take this opportunity to send a clear message to the Taliban: now is the time to separate themselves from al-Qaeda and participate in a peaceful political process.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/18">The myth of bin Laden was that of a freedom fighter, living in austerity and risking his life for the cause as he moved around in the hills and mountainous caverns of the tribal areas. The reality of Bin Laden was very</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/19">different: a man who encouraged others to make the ultimate sacrifice while he himself hid in the comfort of a large, expensive villa in Pakistan, experiencing none of the hardship he expected his supporters to endure.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/20">Finally, let me briefly update the House on Libya. In recent weeks we have stepped up our air campaign to protect the civilian population. Every element of Gaddafi&#8217;s war machine has been degraded. Over the last few days alone, NATO aircraft have struck 35 targets, including tanks and armoured personnel carriers, as well as bunkers and ammunition storage facilities. We have also made strikes against his command and control centres, which direct his operations against civilians. Over the weekend, there were reports that in one of those strikes Colonel Gaddafi&#8217;s son, Saif al-Arab Gaddafi, was killed. Let me be clear that all the targets chosen were clearly within the boundaries set by UN resolutions 1970 and 1973. These resolutions permit all necessary measures to protect civilian life, including attacks on command and control bases.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/21">This weekend also saw attacks on the British and Italian embassies. We utterly deplore this. The Gaddafi regime is in clear breach of the Vienna convention to protect diplomatic missions, and we will hold it fully to account. We have already expelled the Libyan ambassador from London. The British embassy was looted as well as destroyed and the world war two memorial was desecrated. The UN has felt obliged to pull its people out for fear of attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/22">Gaddafi made much of his call for a ceasefire, but at the very moment he claimed he wanted to talk, he had in fact been laying mines in Misrata harbour to stop humanitarian aid getting in. That is the regime&#8212;that is the man&#8212;we are dealing with. We will continue to enforce the UN resolutions until such time as they are fully in place, and that means continuing to turn up the pressure&#8212;sanctions pressure, diplomatic pressure and military pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/23">Bin Laden and Gaddafi were said to have hated each other, but there was a common thread running between them: they both feared the idea that democracy and civil rights could take hold in the Arab world. While we should continue to degrade, dismantle and defeat the terrorist networks, a big part of the long-term answer is the success of democracy in the middle east and, of course, the conclusion of the Arab-Israeli peace process. For 20 years, bin Laden claimed that the future of the Muslim world would be his, but Libya has shown, as Egypt and Tunisia did before it, that people are rejecting everything bin Laden stood for. Instead of replacing dictatorship with his extremist totalitarianism, they are choosing democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/24">Ten years on from the terrible tragedy of 9/11, with the end of bin Laden and the democratic awakening across the Arab world, we must seize this unique opportunity to deliver a decisive break with the forces of al-Qaeda and its poisonous ideology, which has caused so much suffering to so many across so many years. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement and join him in strongly endorsing the sentiments expressed yesterday by President Obama. The Opposition wholeheartedly</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/2">support the action taken by the United States to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. We are grateful to President Obama for taking the decision and to the US special forces who carried it out.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/3">At this time we remember the harrowing scenes of death and destruction of 9/11, and we remember, too, all the other atrocities carried out by al-Qaeda before 9/11 and since, including in Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Bali, Istanbul, Madrid, Amman and, of course, the 7/7 bombings here in London. The world is a better and safer place without bin Laden commanding or inciting acts of terror. We should never fall for the idea that he somehow stood for a particular community or faith. In each case the objective was the same: to kill and maim as many innocent men, women and children as possible, of all faiths and all backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/4">Our response now must be to seek to use this moment, not to claim premature victory in the fight against terrorists, but to heal the divisions he sought to create. We should do that by rooting out the perpetrators of terror, by reaching out to all those willing to accept the path of peace and, at the same time, by ensuring continued vigilance here at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/5">All parts of the House will welcome the co-operative and calm response of the Pakistani Government over the past 48 hours, but there remains a great deal of uncertainty about who was aware of bin Laden&#8217;s presence and location in Pakistan, especially given his proximity to Pakistani military bases. Pakistan&#8217;s leaders continue to take a brave stance against terrorism, but when the Prime Minister talked to President Zardari and Prime Minister Gilani, what discussions did he have about ensuring that the security apparatus in Pakistan fully supports their anti-terrorist efforts?</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/6">The developments of this weekend remind us why we took military action in Afghanistan, which under the Taliban gave shelter to bin Laden and to al-Qaeda, but those developments should also, as the Prime Minister said, reinforce the need for a lasting political settlement in Afghanistan as the only long-term guarantee of peace and security. Does the Prime Minister agree that we need greater urgency in the search for a political solution and to engage with those parts of the Taliban that are ready to renounce violence? Does he think that there are ways in which we can sharpen the choice facing the Taliban, including by deepening the political process in Afghanistan?</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/7">On Yemen and al-Qaeda&#8217;s remaining strongholds, we must do everything to combat terrorism and to increase pressure on their supporters, and we must also support movements that make it less likely that terrorism will take root, for is it not clear that the most effective long-term answer to al-Qaeda&#8217;s ideology of hatred is being provided by the peoples of north Africa and the middle east? During the Arab spring they have not been turning to an ideology of hate; they are demanding the right to control their own destinies with democratic reform and economic progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/8">In that context, will the Prime Minister update the House on progress that has been made in consolidating the democratic gains in Egypt and Tunisia? What is being done not only to ensure that those Arab leaders who have promised reform stick to their commitments, but to force those still resorting to violence and repression, as in Syria, to stop doing so?</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/9">On Libya, it is clear that we cannot abandon the Libyan people to Colonel Gaddafi&#8217;s revenge, but will the Prime Minister also take this opportunity to reassure the House that, in all our words as well as actions, it will be clear that all the steps we take are in the terms of UN Security Council resolution 1973? Does he further agree that doing so is right in principle and essential to maintaining regional support for action to enforce the will of the Security Council?</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/10">On Israel-Palestine, does the Prime Minister agree that the reaction of Hamas, calling the killing of bin Laden an example of American oppression, is deeply regrettable? Does he agree that we should continue to make efforts to restart the middle east peace process? What discussions has he had with President Obama and the other leaders on that important area?</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/11">Finally, I support the Prime Minister&#8217;s call for UK citizens to show increased vigilance at this time. Al-Qaeda has suffered a serious blow, but it remains a threat. Can I also take this opportunity to offer my thanks and the thanks of the Opposition to the police and security services, which work tirelessly in public and behind the scenes to keep us safe, as well as to British forces throughout the world?</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/12">Above all, let me say this: 9/11 was one of the most horrific events of our generation, and for the victims and their families, including in this country, nothing can remove the pain that they feel, but the death of Osama bin Laden sends out a clear message that, in the face of terrorist acts, the world will not rest until justice is done.</p>

	<p pid="a.457.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his statement and for the way he has made it. He is absolutely right to praise the police and security services, particularly those in the security services who never get public recognition for the work that they do to keep people in our country safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to talk as strongly as he has about 9/11 and the memories people have of it. I am sure that everyone in the House remembers exactly where they were and what they were doing on that day, and how they felt, and he is right that we should use this moment to try to heal many of the divisions in our world.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/3">On the specific questions, the right hon. Gentleman asks about Pakistan and the question, which I think will come up a lot, about who knew what and what we will do to find out who knew what. What matters most of all, as I said, is to back the democratic leaders of Pakistan, to work with them and those involved in security and military matters and to try to hold discussions with them together, which is what I did on my last visit to Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/4">On Afghanistan, the right hon. Gentleman asks how we can increase the urgency of a political settlement. That is absolutely the right thing to do, and again part of the answer lies in Pakistan and the discussions we can have with them to encourage all those involved to give up violence, to accept the basic tenets of the Afghan constitution and, critically, to renounce any link with al-Qaeda.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman asks what more can be done to deepen the democratic process in Egypt and Tunisia. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/6">was in Egypt yesterday. One of the key ways of doing this is through the European Union, and Britain, along with others, is pushing very hard for a total update of Europe&#8217;s relations with its neighbourhood to make them more attractive and something that has proper conditions attached to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/7">On Syria, the right hon. Gentleman asked what more can be done to step up the pressure. I agree that what is happening in Syria is unacceptable. We are leading a process in Europe of setting about applying proper pressure&#8212;an arms embargo and taking the association agreement off the table&#8212;and we are looking at further steps, including travel bans and asset freezes, and other things we can do to show that what is happening in Syria is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/8">On Libya, the right hon. Gentleman asks whether we will stick to UN resolution 1973. Yes, we will. What I would say, though, is that this does not mean just sticking with the existing set of things we are doing. All the time, we should be asking what more we can do to raise the diplomatic, military and sanctions pressure; and within all necessary measures to protect civilian life, I believe that there are many more things we can do and should do to keep the pressure up.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/9">The right hon. Gentleman is right that Hamas&#8217;s reaction is very regrettable. I do believe, though, that the middle east peace process is, if you like, the third leg of the strategy to fundamentally defeat al-Qaeda. The first leg is the attack on the terrorist network&#8212;the blow so successfully dealt yesterday&#8212;and the second leg is democracy and progress in the middle east, in north Africa and in Muslim countries, but the third leg is a middle east peace process that works. I am seeing Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow evening, and we will do everything we can in our power to encourage both sides to recognise the historic times that we are living in and the historic chance there is to forge a deal that will last.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.0/1">The Prime Minister has rightly paid tribute to the United States special forces who carried out yesterday&#8217;s remarkable operation.

	<p pid="a.458.1/1">My right hon. Friend is entirely right. Clearly, this was a painstaking operation&#8212;if you like, a painstaking piece of detective work&#8212;that went on for many, many months. I can tell from speaking to President Obama that this was not some chance opportunity that came up but a piece of very careful work put in place over months and an operation clearly carried out with great professionalism and skill.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.2/1">The Prime Minister rightly talks about three strands of a strategy to deal with the continuing problem of al-Qaeda. May I suggest that there is an additional strand, to pick up his point about the pernicious ideology of al-Qaeda, which in many ways remains the most enduring threat posed by al-Qaeda, notwithstanding the demise of its leader? Although there is no silver bullet, so far as here at home is concerned we need to continue programmes to deal with underachievement by some&#8212;not all&#8212;Asian heritage groups in schools and underemployment of them at work in order to reduce the opportunities for their minds to be taken over by this ideology.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.0/1">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman, although I would say that there are two additional strands. One is dealing with problems of poverty, inequality and underachievement, which absolutely must be done, but separate to that is the whole bin Laden/al-Qaeda/extremist Islamist thread of painting Muslims and Muslim communities as somehow being in perpetual victimhood and saying that they can never successfully co-exist in western democratic societies. It is absolutely key that we target that ideology and challenge it, because in the end it is only by challenging the ideology that we will win this battle.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.1/1">While understanding the satisfaction, and even elation, of those who lost family members in the inferno of 9/11, does my right hon. Friend agree that the sober reality is that some things are unchanged by the death of Osama bin Laden? The threat remains, jihadism must be confronted, and adequate resources, effective international co-operation and good intelligence remain essential.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.2/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is right. There is still a severe terrorist threat&#8212;there is still an al-Qaeda threat&#8212;and we should not overestimate what has happened, but clearly the end of bin Laden, who was the leader and inspiration of this movement, is a massive setback for al-Qaeda and for its terrorist affiliates, and I think it is worth putting that on the record. Clearly, we now have to go further and deal with the remaining senior leadership of al-Qaeda who are in the tribal lands in Pakistan. We then have to address the affiliates in places like the Arabian peninsula and in the Maghreb. But as my right hon. and learned Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40090" name="Jack Straw">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.459.3/1">I endorse everything that has been said this afternoon. In the light of the agreed short-term risk, does the Prime Minister agree that the resources of the security and policing services in Britain should be focused entirely on this issue? In the light of the words of the Deputy Prime Minister this morning that the proposed changes to the police service are not set in stone, will the Prime Minister consider a pause in the Government&#8217;s changes to the police service so that it can concentrate on what really matters to the British people?</p>

	<p pid="a.459.4/1">The right hon. Gentleman is obviously going a bit wider in his questioning. To me, it does not seem right to say that all the police&#8217;s attention should be on this issue; we have a serious situation in Northern Ireland as well. At all times, we are balancing the risks. On the police reforms, I say to Opposition Members that we have seen a successful model in London with the Mayor, which the previous Government put in place.

Of course there are frustrations, and questions will be asked about who knew what in Pakistan and about how this man could have lived in such a large house in such a comfortable-looking community so close to military installations. I am absolutely clear that the British interest is in working with the democratic politicians of Pakistan to deal with the shared issues of combating extremism; ensuring that we are dealing with a safe, rather than a dangerous, nuclear power; and, as my hon. Friend says, reaching a settlement in Afghanistan so that we can bring Britain&#8217;s brave troops home.</p>

In tackling the wider ideology of al-Qaeda, does the Prime Minister think that there are actions that we need to take abroad, as well as those that we need to take at home? The reconciliation track in Afghanistan is enormously important, and surely this operation gives us the opportunity to step up that activity.

	<p pid="a.460.2/1">I absolutely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that this is an opportunity, particularly in Afghanistan. Having discussed this matter with President Obama on many occasions, it is clear that there are two tracks that we should be pursuing. There is the military track, where we are building up the Afghan army and police, and having success against the insurgency in Afghanistan, where our troops are performing magnificently. At the same time, there is a political track, where we are saying to the Taliban that it is time for them to give up violence, break the link with al-Qaeda and enter a political process. Both tracks can continue simultaneously, but the death of bin Laden and the work with Pakistan present a greater opportunity for the second track to yield success.</p>

The fact is that 1.4 million people of Pakistani origin live in Britain and travel between here and Pakistan.

Clearly, work on counter-terrorism is vital to Britain&#8217;s national interest, but we are prepared to do a huge amount with Pakistan to help with matters such as the education of children. There are 17 million children in Pakistan not at school today. If we want to keep them away from extremism and, indeed, if we want to deal with problems of migration as well, it makes sense for us to continue our aid programme.</p>

However, as well as that low-level reintegration, we need higher-level reconciliation, where we say to the Taliban, &#8220;If you accept the tenets of the constitution, give up violence and cut your links with al-Qaeda, there is a political path open to you,&#8221; because ultimately, insurgencies tend to end through a combination of force of arms and a simultaneous political process.</p>

I would think that that will be helped by the fact that bin Laden is no more, as the futility of maintaining the link with al-Qaeda is seen. If the Taliban sever that link, there is every prospect of a political settlement, which prospect can clearly lead to British forces coming home. I do not think we should imagine that the timetable will be different, but we should work hard to take every opportunity brought about by the end of bin Laden.</p>

I have no doubt that that is President Zardari&#8217;s view. As my hon.

The Taliban are not currently willing to break the link with al-Qaeda, but that is a key step that needs to be taken in making sure that they can enter some sort of political dialogue and settlement in Afghanistan. It is not acceptable to ask Afghan democrats, and President Karzai and others, to have conversations with people who, even at the end of those conversations, are still going to be committed to violence and overthrowing all of the Afghan constitution, and who are going to be linked to a group of terrorists&#8212;al-Qaeda&#8212;which has done so much damage not just to Pakistan, but to Afghanistan itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.474.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek your ruling and advice on whether the Minister for Housing and Local Government has breached purdah rules. Part 6 of the most recent Cabinet Office rules state that Government announcements should not be made in an election period, yet two days before elections the media and the Department for Communities and Local Government website confirm that he has made an announcement on self-build housing today. Is it not more appropriate for such announcements to be made on the Floor of the House outside the purdah period? Should not the Minister be required to come to the House to apologise or to explain, or perhaps to do both?</p>

	<p pid="a.474.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady both for her point of order and for advance notice of it. I have not been told of any intention on the part of any Minister, including the Minister to whom she referred, to make a statement. She has put her views on the record and can find other ways of pursuing this. I note in particular what she said about the code of conduct, and my response is that the question of purdah, and of statements not being made during a period of purdah, does not apply to or flow from any rule of the House. That is to say that there may be a ministerial procedure on this matter&#8212;the hon. Lady is welcome to pursue her line of questioning in relation to that&#8212;but there has, in short, been no breach of order. Her point will, however, have been heard, including by the Leader of the House.</p>

I can only stress what I have said to the right hon. Lady, which is that Bradley Manning&#8217;s lawyers are aware of the UK Government&#8217;s position and they are also aware of how to change it. That is the situation. I can help the right hon. Lady further only in private, rather than on the Floor of the House. I hope that is all right.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to increase the powers available to local authorities in relation to unauthorised development of green belt and greenfield land; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/3">This Bill is about fairness. Laws apply to everyone across society in equal measure and the Bill reinforces the powers of local authorities so that they may take action against people who pay no regard to planning rules. It applies to developers who build a house beyond agreed specifications, the farmer who lives in a barn for a few years and then reveals it and claims it is his home, and to Travellers who attempt to circumvent planning rules. There is a need to tighten planning legislation to remedy the frustrations of my constituents about certain types of planning abuse, and the problem has been compounded in Beckenham by Ireland, which has expelled quite a number of Travellers through some of its draconian laws.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/4">I fully support the Localism Bill and I want to reinforce some of its intentions. Everyone in the House thinks green belt land is precious and we have a duty to protect it for future generations. We all accept that unchecked urbanisation will lead to a steady eradication of both our forests and our green fields, and I am sure that we would all like to improve the speed and effectiveness with which local authorities can act when planning laws are flouted.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/5">The local authority for my constituency is Bromley council, where I have spent some time with Bob McQuillan, the chief planning officer. I asked him what we could do and he suggested that anything that expedited responses to planning violations would be a great help. After all, only 150 yards from Parliament we see real difficulties in planning enforcement. The struggle by the authorities to move protestors has been a running saga for 10 years, and they were still there for the royal wedding on Friday. Surely we can do better than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/6">Clearly, many problems relate to green belt infringements by members of the travelling community, and that is sometimes a particular problem in the Beckenham constituency. Of course the vast majority of people obey the law, but a small minority of Travellers and other itinerants often pay scant regard to it. That creates a perception that almost all who travel the roads behave illegally.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/7">Our community relations between the settled population and the travelling community are often fractious, and that tension is only heightened when people see Travellers arrive illegally on green belt land. The settled community, after all, must jump through all the hoops of the planning process to obtain planning permission, even just for an extension. The same rule should apply to everyone in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/8">In my constituency there are several problem areas: for example, the entrance to St John&#8217;s church in Wickham court and the former All Saints school on Layhams road. Travellers have stopped there too often&#8212;three times in the past year. This is private land owned by the Roman Catholic and Church of England Southwark</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/9">dioceses, and although the council and the police try their best, responsibility falls on the landowners to take action.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/10">This problem is a continual one for many Members of the House, and particularly in my constituency for Councillors Anne Manning, Graham Arthur and Neil Reddin. Other places in my constituency have suffered too, such as Hayes lane, at the entrance to Norman park, and Pickhurst green. Norman park and Pickhurst green are council owned. Measures to restrict entrance have now been put in place and might deter illegal trespassing&#8212;a height barrier has been erected at Norman park and a gate at Pickhurst green. The problem is that local people have to deal with illegal sites. They have to foot the bill to remove the litter and rubbish and they have to pay for barriers, height restrictions or gates. Perhaps most importantly, there is a psychological impact when people wake up to discover Travellers parked right on their doorstep.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/11">The previous Government were criticised by many local authorities for their circular 01/06, which compelled local authorities to build, sometimes on green belt land, and to engage in compulsory purchasing. The circular seemed to favour Travellers over the local settled community, and its contents have been used time and again at hearings to prevent enforcement. I am very pleased to hear that the Government are revoking circular 01/06 as part of the new planning guidance proposed by the Communities and Local Government Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/12">What sort of changes to the law on the unauthorised development of green belt and greenfield land would I like to see enacted? Let me give two examples that I hope to see in the Localism Bill. First, I would like the options available to those who offend to be reduced. They should be able either to appeal against an enforcement notice or to apply for retrospective planning permission, but they should not be able to do both. Secondly, there should also be a time limit, of perhaps 28 days, in which appeal decisions should be made. These problems are not easy to address, but the law should be on the side of those who obey it. In short, I should like to see powers for dealing with planning violations strengthened and speeded up. I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

That was news to me, perhaps because I was in government and did not think about tabling such amendments, but the rules of order are as they are, so the amendment does not propose&#8212;because we cannot&#8212;an increase in the rate of the bank levy. Instead, it calls for a review of the rate and the general approach to bank taxation adopted by the Treasury. It seeks to look into the rationale behind the rate that the Treasury has chosen for the bank levy and why a number of other choices were made.</p>

	<p pid="a.478.9/1">Indeed. Were it possible under the rules of order for the Opposition to table an amendment to increase the bank levy rate, we probably would have done so. However, we were unable to do so because of</p>
	<p pid="a.478.9/2">the slightly arcane rules of order. We need to examine the rationale behind the rate chosen by the Minister and understand why the Government moved from a threshold approach to triggering the bank levy, to a tax-free allowance of a certain amount before which banks would pay against the chargeable liabilities of the bank levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.9/3">We also need to understand whether the bank levy is, as my hon. Friend suggests, an adequate step when considered in the context of the wider economy and public finances. Ultimately, we need to understand whether the Treasury is being straight with the public and honest about the taxes that the banks will pay over the years ahead. We have debated the Government&#8217;s approach to the banking sector before, and we look forward to the final report of the Vickers commission on the state of competition and regulation of the banks so that never again can these institutions take such extreme risks and gambles that land on the lap of the taxpayer when the going gets tough, as they did before the credit crunch.</p>

	<p pid="a.479.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely prescient intervention, because the Chancellor, under pressure from the Opposition, had to cave in to a concession on corporation tax in the March Budget. The Government announced the bank levy last June, so we knew that they would be introducing this tax, yet the corporation tax cuts will clearly benefit the banks significantly. The Treasury claims that in the March Budget it offset the benefit that the banks will apparently get as a result of the reduction in corporation tax rates, but we will have to wait to see whether the slight increase in the bank levy&#8212;around &#163;100 million&#8212;introduced in the Budget will be sufficient to offset the full corporation tax cuts that the banks will enjoy over the lifetime of this Parliament. I recall that the written answer to a question I tabled on the predicted benefits to the banks of the corporation tax reductions suggested that that would be about &#163;100 million in year one, &#163;200 million in year two, &#163;300 million in year three, and so on, but that largely reflects the reductions in corporation tax rates. That is something of a moot point, because we contend that the design of the bank levy is insufficient. Today&#8217;s debate should provide an opportunity to seek proper redress for the crisis and ensure that we put the banks on a fair tax basis, but that is not what the Government are seeking with this pathetically small bank levy proposal.</p>

	<p pid="a.480.0/1">It is indeed, and that is the crux of the argument that we will make to try to encourage hon. Members to support our amendment. The overall situation is that taxation levels on the banks are reducing, not increasing. The previous Administration introduced a bank bonus tax, which yielded more than &#163;3 billion in revenue. The bank levy needs to be put in place alongside a bank bonus tax, which would be a fairer approach to take. However, the Government are refusing to continue the bank bonus tax, and I would like to hear their rationale for not doing so.</p>

We ought to be introducing fair and just taxation on the obscenely high bonuses that are still being paid. Even though it is supposedly claimed in Project Merlin that the bonus pot has come down by 8%, we can see that the bonuses are absolutely enormous. Today&#8217;s debate is clearly about priorities. The Government are not on the side of families, teachers, nurses, working people or pensioners. Clause 72 shows that they are on the side of the highest-earning bankers who receive each year in bonuses sums that ordinary people dream of winning on the lottery once in a lifetime.</p>

Indeed, I understand that the Bank of England has suggested in its financial stability reports that an implied subsidy of about &#163;100 billion each year offers a safety net for the profitability of the banks. Without that taxpayer guarantee, banks&#8217; borrowing costs would be higher, they would not be able to make such great profits and, therefore, their remuneration and bonuses could not be so high. So, many bonuses and excessive profits are being made on the back of the taxpayer, but does that encourage the Treasury to take action? It certainly does not.</p>

	<p pid="a.481.1/1">Absolutely, and, as we have heard time and again, Government Members clearly do not understand the causes of the deficit, so they are not the right people to solve it.

	<p pid="a.481.1/2">The bonus pools and pots continue to be significant, however, and some bankers receive obscene, life-changing sums of money, so we do not really need to worry too much about poor banking executives; we should worry about those who depend on vital services but will now go without as a result of Ministers&#8217; choices.</p>

I attacked the former Chancellor on the bonus levy, because I felt that his estimate of &#163;500 million was pathetic and did not go far enough, but may I now admit guilt? It actually raised seven times that amount, &#163;3.5 billion, so it was probably one of most successful tax regimes that the previous Government introduced.

	<p pid="a.481.3/1">My hon. Friend&#8217;s arguments become increasingly attractive, and he makes an important point. The bank bonus tax, which the previous Labour Government introduced, appeared at first to be modest,</p>
	<p pid="a.481.3/2">but in fact the yield was very significant indeed. Did the banks collapse as a result of the bonus levy? No. Did they all flee abroad to relocate somewhere else, as threatened? Absolutely not. So, too, with the continuing scale of the bonus pot, which has hardly changed at all, it is absolutely right that we look to reinstitute the levy this year, along with a decent bank levy, as we are discussing today.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.3/3">Hon. Members will know that the concept of a bank levy was first developed at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh in 2009, and then championed by my right hon. Friend the former Prime Minister and taken forward by the International Monetary Fund in its report, which aimed to encourage less risky funding to enhance financial stability. Two broad conclusions were reached at the Pittsburgh summit. There was a call for a financial activities tax, or financial transactions tax, which we need to debate another time when we consider some of the extra levies that might be put on to activities. The Chancellor of the Exchequer himself still professes to be in favour of a financial activities tax, although he has done absolutely nothing to advocate it in ECOFIN or in other financial meetings around the world, so we will see whether anything comes of his repeated promises to pursue it.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.3/4">The second prong of the IMF&#8217;s report was a financial stability contribution, otherwise known as a bank levy, to be charged on equities and liabilities rather than assets or profits because of the need to disincentivise dangerous potential charges such as those that landed on the taxpayer during the credit crunch. The bank levy is a sensible idea in theory, and we broadly support it. However, the yield suggested in the Bill&#8212;only &#163;2.6 billion&#8212;is not just small but pathetic by international standards when compared with the rate being pursued in other countries. It is perplexing that Ministers settled on that figure, and there has never been any evidential basis published for why they did so. Will the Minister clarify why the Chancellor chose the figure of &#163;2.6 billion, as that seems to be the pole around which all aspects of the bank levy revolve? If there is any sense in which the revenue might go beyond that envelope, the Treasury tweaks and turns down the dials on the other aspects of the levy to squeeze it back into that &#163;2.6 billion of revenue&#8212;the predetermined level that it put out to consultation last summer, never explaining why it was set. Compared with the substantial amounts of taxpayers&#8217; money put up in the bail-out of the banks&#8212;&#163;76 billion of shares purchased in the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, &#163;250 billion of guarantees, another &#163;280 billion of other insurances, and a further &#163;100 billion of annual implied subsidy, according to the Bank of England&#8212;a &#163;2.6 billion bank levy is very puny.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.3/5">It is interesting to look at the Treasury document that lists the respondents to the bank levy consultation. There were 44 respondents, all of which are major financial institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.482.1/1">I will respond to the Minister when I have heard his comments. If he wants me to respond again, I am more than happy to have Government time dedicated to the general principles of bank taxation.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/2">The responses showed that the Treasury&#8217;s original design for the bank levy had a threshold that triggered payment of the levy for any organisations, institutions or banks with more than &#163;20 billion of equity and liabilities. Ministers realised that that would yield &#163;3.9 billion&#8212;nearly &#163;1.5 billion more than the Treasury had expected&#8212;which, by the way, that would be more than enough to reverse all their police funding cuts, for example. What did the Chancellor do when he realised that the Treasury&#8217;s own design for the bank levy could yield &#163;3.9 billion? Did Ministers think that this might be something they should go ahead with? Absolutely not&#8212;they gave in, capitulated, and converted the threshold into a tax-free allowance of &#163;20 billion. Hon. Members will know that the Liberal Democrats have long made great play of the increase in personal allowances, which is pretty much the only thing they are getting out of the coalition as they cling on to it, and there might be a few hundred pounds in that here and there. How about having a tax free allowance of &#163;20 billion? That is what they have decided to give the banks. The banks now do not need to pay on their liabilities below that amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/3">As I said, Ministers could have stuck to their guns and used their original design. In the response to the consultation, the Government gave their rationale for backing off that threshold and going for a tax free allowance:</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/4">&#8220;Respondents&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/5">remember, that is the 44 large banks&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/6">&#8220;were generally of the view that the threshold would create potent incentives for banks around the margin to structure their business in certain ways, or disincentives to grow, in order to avoid crossing the threshold&#8230; The Government accepts this argument&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/7">That is a preposterous statement from the Treasury. The argument that the puny level at which the bank levy is being set&#8212;less than one tenth of 1% on the banks&#8217; liabilities&#8212;is so punitive and high that it will stop banks from growing and prospering is ludicrous.</p>

	<p pid="a.483.1/1">Indeed; the machine rolls on. We will have to look at the detailed papers on Project Merlin when they emerge. The Chancellor supposedly persuaded the banking sector to change its ways. Of course, things have fallen apart at the seams since then. As I will say in a moment, some of the bonuses are still, frankly, obscene.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/2">If we accept the Government&#8217;s ludicrous argument that they were worried about the cliff-edge marginal rate of the levy at &#163;20 billion of chargeable liabilities, why did they not keep that trigger but have a smaller allowance, perhaps of &#163;10 billion or smaller? But no; they caved in straight away with the &#163;20 billion allowance and lost a phenomenal opportunity to redress the balance of the tax burden in this country. The Americans, who have not yet triggered their bank levy, have named their version a financial crisis responsibility fee. That says more accurately on the tin what it does. They have done so because it is incumbent on the institutions that caused the crisis and the consequential fiscal deficit to do their duty and pay back what they owe the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.1/1">I wonder whether <i>Hansard</i> is able to record irony in my hon. Friend&#8217;s comments. Sometimes I wonder whether we need a new annotation in our proceedings, because I do not honestly think that he is showing sympathy. I think he is suggesting that even when there is an apparent reduction in bonuses, the sums of money involved are the sort for which our constituents would buy a lottery ticket in the hope of winning. If they won that amount it would change their lives tremendously, yet those life-changing sums of money are not even salaries but bonuses on top of salaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/2">I wish to talk about the rate at which the Government have chosen to set the bank levy, because it is a low rate by international standards. It is less than a third of the level that has been set in France, for example. Ministers will know that the rate varies in a number of jurisdictions, but I think that it is 0.25% in France. The levels involved are still quite small, but in Hungary it is 0.53%, in the USA it is 0.15%&#8212;although, as I said, it has not been enacted at this point&#8212;in Portugal it is 0.1%, and so on. It is to be only 0.078% here in the UK for short-term liabilities, and 0.039% for long-term liabilities, which is very small by international standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.486.3/1">Even the Swedish advocate a bank levy, and we must acknowledge that the alternative financial changes are being made in a number of jurisdictions across the world. Obviously, the more jurisdictions in which such measures are pursued, the better, because that will remove the argument on regulatory arbitrage.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.3/2">However, it is worth looking at the pathology and history of the bank levy, and at how the Chancellor has tweaked the rate. The Government pull back from a higher rate when they think it is too much, but sometimes the Chancellor gets into hot water and feels the need to change that approach. On the fateful morning of <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-08">8 February</phrase>, at 7.30, the Chancellor went on the &#8220;Today&#8221; programme and announced a mini-Budget. It just so happened, by pure coincidence, that that was on the day of Treasury questions, when he was struggling with the banks in the negotiations on the damp squib that was Project Merlin. While we are on Project Merlin, we should not let go the opportunity to note that borrowing is increasingly expensive for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that according to the most recent data, there is less and not more availability.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.3/3">The Chancellor changed the rate again in the March Budget, when, as I said, the Government were forced into a U-turn in the face of criticism of the reductions in corporation tax. That would have been a massive cash-back bonanza for the banks&#8212;it could still turn out that way, but we must wait for the final figures. At no point during the design of the bank levy have the Government said why they are capping revenues at just &#163;2.6 billion. What is their fixation with that yield?</p>

	<p pid="a.486.4/1">Before my hon.

	<p pid="a.486.5/1">Absolutely. I cannot figure out why the Government refused to go beyond that &#163;2.5 billion or &#163;2.6 billion. That is a strange way to design a tax. Normally, a Government would think about whether the rate set was fair and just, and about the requirement for revenue yield, and they might even analyse the effect of the levy in a regulatory impact assessment or whatever. However, at no point have the Government said why they are reluctant to go beyond that &#163;2.6 billion. Perhaps there has been a deal behind the scenes between the Chancellor and the banks, but if there has been such a deal, it is probably the only one that he has been able to reach.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.5/2">I have some specific questions for the Minister on the bank levy and I would be grateful if he could respond. The Minister conceded in the consultation response that derivative liabilities can be netted off against identifiable assets held with the same counter-party, along the lines, as I understand it, of the Basel II regulatory principles. Although bilateral netting between two parties might be straightforward, is the Minister confident that HMRC will be able to keep track of the obviously complex multilateral settlements, where thousands of varying derivatives products are apparently offset by supposedly thousands of other liquid assets? Can he explain what extra resources he plans to dedicate to ensure that derivatives netting does not become a licence to hide liabilities? We will be reliant on the reporting of those liability levels in the accounts of the banks themselves, but surely there will need to be some challenge, some capability within HMRC. I would be grateful, therefore, if he could explain what capability HMRC will have for understanding the netting of derivatives. I would also be grateful if he could answer the concern expressed by some that derivatives netting might create a perverse incentive for banks to shift their liabilities into more complex and perhaps more dangerous areas of business. What plans does he have to review and analyse the behavioural impact of the decision to pursue derivatives netting?</p>
	<p pid="a.486.5/3">What work has been done to amend the double taxation treaties with other bank levy jurisdictions, where legal challenges could easily occur if anomalies are not resolved, which might disrupt the smooth operation of the levy in the UK? Many different levies are popping up in different jurisdictions all over the world, and it is important that the operation of the levy here is not disrupted. The UK levy is clearly calculated by reference to all chargeable equities and liabilities for UK entities, subsidiaries and branches, but some commentators claim that it is unclear what happens in respect of levies in other countries. Can the Minister therefore update the Committee on the international discussions to which the Treasury has presumably been party?</p>
	<p pid="a.486.5/4">On the specific nature of some of the certain chargeable equities listed and described in the Bill, we understand that there is clearly a rationale in their design in respect of short and long-term liabilities. However, would the Minister care to explain the difference between his definition of short-term liability and long-term liability and where the line is being drawn?</p>

	<p pid="a.487.0/1">I think that my hon.

	<p pid="a.487.1/1">The Minister needs to answer that question. Hon. Members might care to turn to page 297 of the Bill. The steps might at first appear quite straightforward, but then we get to this odd provision in paragraph 7, with its proportions X, Y and Z of various different amounts and so on. I understand that that provision is triggered because the Treasury has to recoup retrospectively some of the money taken, since the Chancellor tweaked</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/2">the levels of tax on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-08">8 February</phrase> and again in March. It therefore becomes incredibly complex and difficult to hold to account. The design of the bank levy has not been made easy by the Chancellor&#8217;s decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.1/1">As I said, the reason for the complexity is that all the variables in the design of the bank levy have to be amended because the Treasury wants to squash around that figure of &#163;2.5 billion or &#163;2.6 billion of revenue. In other words, the whole of the bank levy is being driven by that particular sum, which is a very odd way of designing a tax.</p>

Whether there are two rates or 10, however, all the rates in the bank levy are far too generous and far too low.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.7/1">In a moment, but I need to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/2">I understand that there is a difference between short-term and long-term liabilities. However, what will be the impact on businesses in the real economy if short-term liabilities are less attractive to major banks? For example, if a small firm has a bank deposit of over &#163;100,000&#8212;to protect its cash flow or whatever&#8212;that happens to be above the level of the deposit guarantee scheme, what is to stop the banks from raising their bank charges on SME deposit accounts to try to divest themselves of</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/3">such short-term liabilities? That is an important point, because there will be consequences from the design of the bank levy. I would like the Minister to explain to the Committee why short-term liabilities and long-term liabilities have been divided in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/4">Can the Minister explain the position on the reported legal challenge under European Union law, which I understand many in the banking community are watching carefully? The Hungarian Government have introduced a levy on their energy and telecoms sectors. I understand that a case has been taken&#8212;or is due to be taken&#8212;to the European Court to claim that a levy on a specific sector of the economy is somehow unfair or not possible. To what extent is the Minister confident that the case will not have a bearing on the implementation of a banking levy here in the UK?</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/5">I would also be grateful if the Minister could answer the question about complexity and opacity in the bank levy accounting systems. As I understand it, overseas banks can sometimes not use IFRS&#8212;international financial reporting standards. If those banks do not use them, they will need to re-compute their chargeable equity and liabilities with reference to the UK&#8217;s GAAP&#8212;generally accepted accounting principles&#8212;or IFRS, in other words, by preparing a notional consolidation under those systems, including for branches. Is that anticipated to create a problem? What do the Government foresee as a solution to that level? Obviously we have banks that cross jurisdictions and use a series of different accounting platforms, so I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify some of the comments that have been made about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/6">However, it is the Government&#8217;s general approach to banks and banking taxation that concerns many hon. Members&#8212;a general approach that, as we know, is quite woeful. Hon. Members have already raised their concerns about some of the bonuses that we have seen and the breathtaking behaviour that the banks have engaged in, even though they were at the root cause of the credit crunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/7">That makes the Government&#8217;s tax giveaway to the banks even more staggering. The post-Budget reaction last June, when the bank levy was announced, was indeed positive from the bankers themselves. They enjoyed the Government&#8217;s decisions on the bank levy. One commentator said:</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/8">&#8220;We&#8217;d expect most domestically-orientated banks&#8230;to be better off after four years than they were pre-Budget&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/9">and a City insider said that</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/10">&#8220;some banks will have a feeling of glee at the way this has worked out&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/11">Clearly, we need to advocate a bank bonus tax to raise &#163;3.5 billion, as it did before. That deserves to be repeated this year. Even if it were to raise just &#163;2 billion, that would make a massive difference to our society and our economy. For example, we have calculated that such an amount could be used to establish a youth jobs fund&#8212;using a similar model to the future jobs fund, which this Government have abolished&#8212;creating 90,000 new youth jobs at a time when youth unemployment is close to 1 million, with one in five young people on the dole.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/12">That money could also help to construct 25,000 new homes for low-cost home ownership and affordable social renting. That would create tens of thousands of</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/13">jobs in the construction industry and new apprenticeships alongside them. The money could also provide &#163;200 million of funding for the regional growth fund, the Government&#8217;s rather lamentable replacement for the regional development agency funding. That could help to provide for regional projects and promote growth. The Government&#8217;s changes represent a two-thirds cut on the previous funding, and the first wave of &#163;450 million in grants was several times oversubscribed with bids. We therefore need to revisit the regional growth fund, and a repeat of the bank bonus tax could support that.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/14">The bonuses being paid are still vast; they remain at eye-watering levels. Despite the smoke and mirrors of Project Merlin, in which Ministers broke their promises to take action despite the warm words in the coalition agreement, the bonuses remain high. Let us just remind ourselves of what the coalition agreement promised. The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats said:</p>

	<p pid="a.488.7/16">That is on page 9 of the agreement, right up front among the promises that the coalition made.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.7/17">The Government could not even bring themselves to promote the basic transparency that we expect when it comes to bonuses and remuneration. The most that they could extract voluntarily from the banks in Project Merlin was an agreement to report anonymously on the total remuneration of the five highest paid senior executives of the bank, excluding board members. That is a weak and shameful compromise. The Government are not even forcing the banks to disclose all bonuses above &#163;1 million, even though Labour&#8217;s legislation allows them to do so. That provision is already on the statute book.</p>

	<p pid="a.490.0/1">Will my hon. Friend return briefly to the alternative uses to which that &#163;2 billion could be put&#8212;the very low figure that the re-imposition of our levy would yield? As a result of the abolition of the Advantage West Midlands regional development agency, the funding for the west midlands has been cut by nearly 70%, and the outlook for my constituents in Coventry is very poor indeed. The additional funds could be used for investment in the proposed NUCKLE&#8212;the Nuneaton, Coventry, Kenilworth, and Leamington&#8212;railway line, and a host of other important development projects that have been put on hold or simply thrown out as a result of that 70% cut. In the west midlands, and in Coventry in particular, unemployment levels are rising disproportionately compared with the rest of the country, and the level of output is dropping disproportionately in a key area that is vital to the eventual resurgence of manufacturing that we want to see. That money could be put to great use in the regional development fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.490.1/1">My hon. Friend is entirely correct. As I have said before, this shows the failure of the Government to understand the paradox of austerity. When they take away some of that vital investment that would support jobs and growth, they are fuelling unemployment and raising welfare bills, which will cost the country more in the long run. That is why we are seeing borrowing levels rising rather than falling, and why, in the last six months</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/2">of the economic experience in this country, we have seen economic growth flatlining. The House of Commons Library tells me that that will cost the Exchequer an extra &#163;6 billion that will need to be added to borrowing. So this is the fallacy that the Government pursue&#8212;that simply cutting all elements of public investment is the way out of the deficit. They just do not understand how the economy works.</p>

	<p pid="a.491.0/1">Following up that point, this applies to investment not just in manufacturing, but in services, too. Yorkshire Forward had decided to make two investments: one of &#163;5 million to help enable the National Railway museum to redisplay its collection; and a &#163;1 million grant towards the cost of restoring York Minster&#8217;s great east window. Why did it do this? Because it realised that the additional tourism generated would create many jobs, particularly for people without high skill levels, in the York economy. When I raised this matter with the Minister, I was encouraged to get the National Railway museum to apply for the regional growth fund, which, with help from his Department, it did&#8212;yet it has received not a penny.</p>

	<p pid="a.491.3/1">Thank you, Ms Primarolo. Notwithstanding your strictures, that was an incredibly important intervention from my hon. Friend, who is correct, particularly in his assessment of the attractions of York as a destination for tourism, which was of course helped by the investment that the previous Administration put into some of those key elements within his constituency. I do not want to be diverted, however, as time is short and we need to focus on the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.3/2">The amendment relates to the level of the bank levy in the context of bank taxation and the bonus culture. As I said, the Government could not even bring themselves to have transparency on what the bonuses were, let alone take action against them. However, we know some things about the realities of bank bonuses today, and the figures are truly astonishing. From the limited disclosure that we have seen, we know that in 2010, John Varley, the former chief executive of Barclays, received a &#163;2.2 million bonus; Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, received only &#163;5.2 million in bonuses; Stephen Hester, the chief executive of RBS&#8212;wholly owned by the taxpayer, by the way&#8212;got &#163;2 million in bonuses; and Eric Daniels, the chief executive of Lloyds, largely owned by the taxpayer, got &#163;1.45 million in bonuses. Let us not forget Bob Diamond, the chief executive of Barclays since January this year, who received &#163;6.5 million in bonuses in 2010. He was head of Barclays investment banking before that and perhaps his bonus relates to that. Poor old Bob Diamond, however, loses out in the bonus bonanza when compared with the top</p>
	<p pid="a.491.3/3">two managers at Barclays: Tom Kalaris received a cool &#163;10.9 million in salary and bonuses in 2010 and its other top manager received a tidy &#163;10.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.3/4">Ms Primarolo, can you guess the name of that other top manager at Barclays? His name is Rich Ricci&#8212;and I kid you not! It would be the stuff of a Dickensian novel if it did not sound so far fetched, but it is indeed true. Between them, the top five earners at Barclays&#8212;including Mr Rich Ricci, but excluding executive directors&#8212;received more than &#163;38 million in salary and bonuses in 2010 alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.492.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend how mind-boggling the amounts are that these individuals receive. It makes one wonder what they do with the money. Was he shocked, as I was, to learn that more than 50% of donations to the Conservative party last year came from the City, including large donations from individuals such as Jeremy Isaacs, the former head of Lehman Brothers Europe, who donated &#163;190,000?</p>

	<p pid="a.492.1/1">&#8220;But surely that is a complete coincidence&#8221;, he said ironically! I do not know whether my hon. Friend was making the point that this is payback time, but the level of these bonuses is incredible.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/2">Let me finish my point about Barclays. I was saying that &#163;38 million in bonuses and salaries went to just the top five earners. That is enough money to pay the wages of more than 1,000 qualified nurses in our NHS. That gives some meaning to the scale&#8212;enough money to pay for 1,000 qualified nurses.</p>

	<p pid="a.492.2/1">Does not the refusal to be transparent about bonuses lead to the conclusion that hidden behind the chief executives on whom we have the facts are a series of individuals whose bonuses dwarf those that my hon. Friend has listed?</p>

	<p pid="a.492.3/1">Absolutely; but, quite apart from the obscenity of the scale of some of those bonuses, there is a hard-headed economic rationale for more transparency. If shareholders cannot see what senior executives in the banking sector are being paid, that indicates a dysfunction in the corporate governance of the banks, and if the bonus pots of certain executives are being swelled by their behaviour&#8212;by the choices that they make and the risks that they are taking&#8212;perhaps those were some of the antecedents of the credit crunch. We need transparency to prevent us from repeating the problems that occurred in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.493.0/1">That is one of the issues to which we shall have to return, perhaps in the Public Bill Committee. The banks are a social necessity&#8212;a utility, as it were&#8212;in our society, and whatever we think of their behaviour, it is necessary for them to exist to provide the credit that is required to keep the engine of the economy moving. We do not need a dysfunctional banking system; we need a functioning banking system that faces much more towards its customers. We need to stand up for the taxpayer interest, but also for the consumer interest, which must include businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/2">The bonus and remuneration projections are not diminishing, as the Government like to suggest. The Centre for Economics and Business Research recently released an estimate that, whereas bonus payouts in the City for 2010-11 were 8% lower than those for 2009-10&#8212;down from &#8220;only&#8221; &#163;7.3 billion to &#163;6.7 billion&#8212;they are forecast to rise from that level to &#163;7.2 billion in 2011-12. The apparent fall in bonuses is largely offset by a 7% increase in the salaries of senior bank executives. So bonuses fall by 8%, and salaries rise by 7%. Obviously that pay rise outstrips pay rises in virtually every other sector of the economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.493.6/4" class="italic">The Sunday Times</p>

	<p pid="a.494.3/2">The bank levy is a weak response to the debts that banks owe the taxpayer. The Government say that they want a big society, but they are happy to see public investment shrink and rewards for banks grow, built on the backs of taxpayers. It is a big society if you are a banker, but a very small society if you are not.

When it started, I think I was the only MP who said, &#8220;Do not give all this money to the banks.&#8221; I felt it was wrong to buy shares in the banks and to support the bondholders. I thought we had a duty to the depositors and individuals who were tied up with the banks, but not to those who had financed and run the banks in those conditions. Unfortunately, the decision was made to embark on a massive subsidisation and share-buying programme, which the previous Government did. So we are where we are, and I think that we all agree that what we wish to do now is get the maximum value we can out of the banks that are subsidised or in state ownership, because that would make the public feel better about it. Surely, now is the time when those state-owned and state-subsidised banks should make their fuller contribution to the recovery, after their role in the recent crash.</p>

	<p pid="a.495.1/1">How many times will I have to deal with this idiotic canard that Labour dreamt up? The report was very clear: it said the then Government were not regulating cash and capital strongly enough, and it was a cash and capital problem that the banks had that led to the crisis. If the then Government had taken our advice, the banks would have been made to have more cash and capital at a much earlier stage of the cycle, so we would not have gone into the period of banking weakness during the credit crunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/2">We also said that the mortgage regulation introduced by the then Labour Government was not fit for purpose, was useless and might as well be scrapped. Our case was proved extremely well, because it was the mortgage banks that crashed&#8212;the very banks that were the object of the extra regulation. The extra regulation was clearly regulating the wrong things. We were not against regulation: we said mortgage banks and other banks should be regulated, but it was vital to understand what the problem was. It was very clear in &#8217;06 and &#8217;07 that the problem was an excess of lending of poor quality. It was also very clear that the answer was more cash and capital, and that was what we recommended. It is a great pity that the then Government did not follow our advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.496.2/1">Yes, I think we could, which is why I made that recommendation well before the credit crunch occurred. In &#8217;06 and &#8217;07, it was obvious to me and to some other commentators that things were getting out of control&#8212;indeed, it was quite common for Opposition parties in this House to say they thought there was too much credit about. I went a bit further and said that could be remedied by changing the way we regulated the banks. It was quite wrong to allow a bank to extend more credit when it only had a 4% tier 1 capital ratio. I remember that when I was a financial regulator, we lived in an era when banks needed twice or three times that amount of capital to be acceptable to the regulator. There was a clear diminution in standards at a crucial time, which fuelled the credit binge.</p>

	<p pid="a.496.3/1">I know that the right hon. Gentleman sometimes speaks at odds with his party, and he talked earlier about historical references. Was it not his party&#8217;s Government under Margaret Thatcher who deregulated the mortgage market, and is it not the case that up until the recent banking crisis hit, his party&#8217;s Front Benchers were talking about lighter regulation of the banking sector, not more regulation?</p>

	<p pid="a.496.4/1">The Front-Bench team and I were at one on this issue: we were saying that was needed were better regulation and less regulation. The Government were regulating too many things badly. As I have just explained, they were regulating mortgage banks in a way that allowed all, or at least several, of them to be crippled and caused a great many problems. The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong about Baroness Thatcher: much stricter controls over cash and capital were imposed throughout her period in office, and, of course, no major bank went down during that period. The same cannot be said of 2007-10, when the requirements were much laxer, as I highlighted in the report, and when we ended up with banks going down.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.4/2">We are not here to debate past regulation, however; we are here to debate taxation. My purpose in sketching the history of this tragic situation is to express solidarity with all those who agree with the public mood, which is that we want to get a bigger return out of the banks, whatever we may think of the reasons why they are in</p>
	<p pid="a.496.4/3">their present position, but it is also to remind the House of a very important and salient fact, which is that two of the biggest banks are wholly or partially in state ownership or control. We are therefore talking about taxing ourselves in no small measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.4/4">The issue before Ministers is a little more complicated than the Labour spokesman has suggested, because there are two ways in which we can get cash out of the banks: one is to tax them now on their stream of revenue, or their assets and liabilities in the case of the bank levy tax; the other is to move more quickly to sell off those assets back into private sector ownership and, I hope, proper private sector risk taking. If we are to get the maximum receipt, we do not want to be taking too much money out of the banks in the short term by way of taxation, because for every &#163;1 of tax we take out of them, we lose &#163;5, &#163;10 or &#163;15, depending on the multiple we sell them on when we come to sell them.</p>

	<p pid="a.497.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is making a very coherent presentation, but does he not agree that if we do not want to be taking money out of the banks by taxing them, equally we do not want to see that money going out of the banks by way of bonuses paid to their high-end staff?</p>

	<p pid="a.497.1/1">I hasten to correct the hon. Gentleman: of course I think we have to tax banks. We have to tax ourselves, and we need to tax the other banks in the system, as well as the state-owned ones, but we must also consider the balance of effects and the impact on shareholder value. I entirely agree with those who say that if a bank is state subsidised or largely state owned and is therefore in receipt of state money, it is surprising that it should be paying very large bonuses. It is even more surprising if the bank is loss-making, because although an individual employee in that bank may be able to say, &#8220;I personally made a profit to offset some of the losses,&#8221; the senior people in the bank are corporately responsible for the overall results. It is at the very least surprising if a loss-making bank is making rather big pay-outs, because that is taxpayers&#8217; money and taxpayers&#8217; wealth being paid out to those individuals, which, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, is not then available to sell as a stream of profits when the shares are returned to the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.497.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman seems to be saying that it is important that the taxpayer gets the maximum value when the publicly owned portions of banks are put back on the market and floated, and I agree. Does he agree with me that it is therefore important that the mechanism at that time should not provide incentives for would-be shareholders such as shares being valued below their real market rate in order to encourage popular capitalism, but that the shares should be sold in such a way as to maximise the return to the taxpayer?</p>

	<p pid="a.497.3/1">No, I do not necessarily agree with that, because I think that another way of returning value to the taxpayers who have supported the bank is to make those sorts of offer.

	<p pid="a.498.0/1">My point is that if we maximise the return to the taxpayer, everybody in the country&#8212;rich and poor&#8212;gets a share of the benefit. If we put some of the value into creating lower-priced shares to boost popular capitalism, we spend our public money on only a small percentage of the population. Surely that is less fair than maximising the return and spreading the benefits across all taxpayers.</p>

	<p pid="a.498.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that there are those two sides to the argument, but this is probably not the time or place to argue that through. We may have an opportunity to argue through how the bank shares are sold and the balance in the sale process when we get nearer to that point. The issue before us now is a taxation one. We are discussing the taxation of bonuses and the bank levy&#8212;the subject of the clause&#8212;and I agree with those who say that if we take too much out in bonuses in a state-owned bank, that detracts from the value that is available to sell.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.1/2">Of course, the bank levy is not the means by which we can have any impact on bonuses. Interestingly, it was the previous Government who nationalised or bought shares in banks and signed off on all the original agreements for the top directors and executives. I believe that they included generous bonus terms at the time because, they said, they had to in order to have the talent needed. The criticism being made of the coalition Government now is that they took over those inherited contracts and lived with them, rather than broke them and disrupted the management of the banks, which I regard as a lesser charge than the one against the former Government of setting up all those contracts in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.1/3">This should not be a party political issue. I regret some of the contracts that were incorporated at the time of the purchase of shares, but I regretted the whole purchase of shares because I thought it neither a particularly good deal for the taxpayer, nor a necessary deal to sort out the banking problem. I would rather have sorted that out more rapidly at the time, with managed administration or something else, than adopt this expensive way of putting all that money in. We are now trying to maximise the returns because we are where we are.</p>

	<p pid="a.498.2/1">My right hon. Friend has partly answered the point I was going to make, but I wonder whether he could help me. What did the Labour party do to control the bonuses paid to loss-making banks when it was in government?</p>

	<p pid="a.498.3/1">Labour Members would say that they could speak for themselves and that they imposed a bonus tax. However, as the hon. Lady is suggesting, they did allow very generous bonus conditions into the contracts for their state-owned or partly state-owned banks. Perhaps some would have come to a tougher judgment at that time, had they been in a position of power to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.3/2">The point I wish to make in this debate is simple. I hope that when Ministers are deciding the right level of the levy, they will weigh very carefully the important fact that we are, in part, taxing ourselves. I hope that within a few years, if not within a matter of months, as I would prefer, we will return those assets and get the money back that the taxpayers deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.499.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is making a coherent case, but is he not worried that Government&#8217;s strategy is not as coherent as his argument? If we look at table C.3 in the Red Book, we see that no forecast is made of the value of the asset sales. Do we not need to see a forecast if we are to make precisely the judgment that he is asking us to make?</p>

	<p pid="a.499.1/1">I, too, would find forecasts helpful, but I understand the uncertainties surrounding what bank shares might be worth in one or two years&#8217; time. There may even still be considerable uncertainties about how much profit the banks will deliver. It would be much easier to get value for taxpayers if these banks deliver reasonable profits.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/2">The second point I wish to make is that the other disadvantage of a bank levy tax is that it is a tax on exactly the kind of activities that we really want banks to perform at the moment to fuel the recovery: it is a tax on lending money to businesses and individuals. The loans that we probably most want, if we are to get the recovery going more quickly, will be the riskier ones, yet they are exactly the kind of assets that the banks will own that will score more heavily for the levy.</p>

Might it not be worth considering a third way of dealing with the banks, particularly re-mutualisation of some of them? Might that be a way of getting banks that are more focused on their stakeholders, particularly the people to whom we might want them to lend, than on paying bonuses to people all the time?</p>

	<p pid="a.499.3/1">I am always very happy to see ownership extended in ways that include that type of mutual, although the history of the mutual banking movement in the past 20 years provides no evidence that such banks were particularly good at reading the cycle or dealing with the capital problems&#8212;indeed, many of those institutions went to the markets and decided to exploit market opportunities because they had a capital problem that they thought they could solve by that route. It may be that we could go back to more traditional mutually owned banks with much more constrained balance sheets and activities, and that might be part of getting back to a more healthy banking sector. That is something that the market should decide.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.3/2">I am firmly of the view that we need more competition and choice in the marketplace. One of the big errors was allowing banks that were too big. As a competition hawk, I was publicly very strongly against the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds; it was a great tragedy for Lloyds and for the country that that merger went through. We should have dealt with HBOS in other ways, which would have been less expensive. I was also a critic of the Royal Bank of Scotland takeover of ABN AMRO. Although the competition issues that raised were not as clear as the competition issues raised in the case of the Lloyds takeover of HBOS, I would have liked to have seen a tougher line taken. I hope that this period of change and reflection on banking, including how we tax it, can lead to a much more competitive structure. One</p>
	<p pid="a.499.3/3">of the ways of doing that would be to sell off some of the assets currently owned through Lloyds and through RBS in ways that created more banking challenge in the market.</p>

	<p pid="a.500.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman wants to ensure that we get the maximum return possible when we bring the banks back into the market, and the whole House would agree with that. He referred to the need not to reduce by too much our prospects for doing that by reducing through an excessive tax charge the multiple applied to earnings in realising the sale value, but his point about therefore moderating any tax that might be imposed is specious and certainly does not allow him to invest the seriousness that he wants, given that the multiple used is nearly always a profit-before-tax multiple&#8212;certainly, it will always be adjusted for that if exceptional items are involved. For that reason, some people, with whom I would not agree, even opt for an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation&#8212;EBITDA&#8212;calculation for these purposes. The fact is that the quality of the earnings is more important here than any considerations about tax levels at any one point in time.</p>

	<p pid="a.500.1/1">I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman about that. It is true that in the venture capital world EBITDA multiples are more common, although people would not give the same value or the same multiple to a highly taxed business as they would to a more lowly taxed business; but in the open share market in the major stock exchanges, it is more normal to look at price earnings multiples based on earnings net of taxation. There is no doubt that if more tax is taken out of a business, it is less valuable to its private owners&#8212;of course that must be true. The private owners are trying to buy a stream of profit or revenue and if some of that is taken in tax, the business will be less valuable.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.1/2">I had just moved on to my final point, which is about the impact everything we are discussing has on economic recovery. I urge the Minister to bear in mind that the kind of tax proposed, if carried too far, can be damaging. It impedes banks making the sorts of loan and building up the sort of asset base that we want them to at a time of recovery. In addition, any given jurisdiction going too far could become a trigger for the bank&#8217;s moving some or more of its activities offshore or changing its arrangements in a way that it thinks would allow it to get around some or all of the tax impost. I would prefer that this tax had not been invented&#8212;there are better ways of taxing banks&#8212;but if we are to have such a tax, let us ensure that we have thought about two very important consequences of setting it too high: it might damage our own share values and it might damage lending for the recovery.</p>

	<p pid="a.500.2/1">The general public are outraged at the levels of bankers&#8217; bonuses, which remain very high indeed. The Government were forced, as we are all aware, into multi-billion pound bank bail-outs during the financial crisis. Quite simply, people cannot understand why bankers and people employed in the financial institutions have been given billions and billions of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money at a time of great austerity.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/2">To pay massive bonuses in the midst of a financial crisis is a national disgrace, as it is to pay massive bonuses at a time when public sector services are being</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/3">destroyed and young people face an unprecedented attack via tuition fees, the abolition of the education maintenance allowance and changes in Sure Start. Last year, Barclays boss Bob Diamond and his two replacements at the head of the investment bank were paid an obscene amount of money: &#163;28 million. The trio also received shares worth &#163;40 million for past performance. That must have been some performance!</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/4">I have just done some calculations. The people who are now receiving redundancy notices in the public services&#8212;many council workers, nurses, doctors, police officers and the rest&#8212;would be lucky to have a bonus of &#163;50 a week. That is &#163;2,500 a year, &#163;25,000 over 10 years and &#163;125,000 over 100 years. So to make &#163;1 million, they would have to live until they were 400. To make the &#163;28 million that the Barclays heads were given, they would have to live to 11,200. That is highly unlikely&#8212;I am merely accentuating the point&#8212;but those figures are an absolute disgrace.</p>

Friend&#8217;s flow, but is he aware that I was informed by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority the other day that I could not raise any of my staff&#8217;s salaries, even though they have been the same for a year, because they are public servants? If I wanted to give them any reward for exceptional service, the maximum I was allowed to give was a &#163;15 token each year for a meal. Where can anyone get a meal for &#163;15 around here?

	<p pid="a.501.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that question, which is a great way of introducing IPSA into the debate on the Finance Bill. I think we would have agreement on that point across the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/2">Let me get back to the discussion. Barclays bosses were compared to Somali pirates by one of their own shareholders, amid anger over their obscene bonuses. Shareholders lined up to vent their fury at the annual meeting, complaining that their dividends had plummeted while senior executives continued to enjoy huge pay packets. Another shareholder accused the executives of rank historical folly, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/3">&#8220;In these times of austerity the seemingly excessive payments to senior bank staff seems to show the lack of wisdom reminiscent of Marie Antoinette saying let them eat cake.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/4">HSBC has tried to seize the high ground by announcing a reduction in maximum bonuses for top bosses, but chief executives could still receive a package of more than &#163;12.5 million this year. This mammoth pay deal comprises a salary of &#163;1.25 million plus up to &#163;7.5 million in long-term bonus shares and a possible &#163;3.75 million annual bonus. Some reduction. That is why the bankers must pay their share, and why the Labour party are seeking this amendment to ensure that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/5">This recession was not made in Britain; it is a global recession. Let me set the scene for a minute or so. In the decade before the financial crisis, Labour cut Britain&#8217;s national debt and Britain&#8217;s deficit. Both were lower than the amounts we inherited from the Tories. Before the financial crash we had a lower national debt than America, France, Germany or Japan. The crisis was caused by the financial institutions&#8212;by these banks. Governments and central banks were also, of course, at</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/6">fault, including in Britain, where we did not see it coming and should have been tougher in regulating the banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/7">The cry from those on the Conservative Benches, and from the City, for lighter regulation of the banks should have been totally ignored&#8212;and, yes, Labour should have been tougher on the banks. When the City and the Tories called for lighter regulation, we should have ignored them and been tougher still. Our priority, however, was to prevent recession turning into depression and to keep people in jobs. We always said that once the economy was growing strongly, tough decisions would be needed to get the deficit down again. The plan, as we all know, was to half the deficit in four years, including through a continuation of Labour&#8217;s bank bonus tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/8">The crisis was not the result of our spending on essential front-line services such as the NHS, schools, police, local authorities or any other public service.</p>

	<p pid="a.502.0/1">Does my hon. Friend share my disappointment at the sparse attendance on the Liberal Democrat Benches? Before the election, the Liberal Democrats lectured us on bank bonuses and what we were doing about the banks&#8212;and now, in places such as Northumberland, they are devastating public services through the cuts that they say are needed because of the financial mess that the banks got us in to.</p>

	<p pid="a.502.1/1">That is a very good point about Northumberland. In my constituency in particular, 60% of women and more than 40%&#8212;nearly 50%&#8212; of men are employed in the public services. Many are being subjected to enforced redundancies by the Liberal Democrat-led Northumberland county council. We hope that will change in 2013, but let us wait and see what happens on Thursday, as that will give us a good idea of what will happen in the coming months and years.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.1/2">We must realise that the recession was caused by the financial institutions and, yes, by the banks. We are certainly not alone in Britain as a nation in deficit. The financial crisis affected every major economy, resulting in national deficits worldwide. It is the different way in which those nations agreed to tackle their deficits that is the issue. We are saying that we need financing from the banks and the continuation of Labour&#8217;s bank tax to ensure that we have the money to allow the programmes we had planned to go forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.1/3">The Government are cutting too far and too fast and they are hitting the most vulnerable, as well as jobs and families. It is necessary to prioritise an economic plan that focuses on increased growth and increased employment opportunities, which would place Britain in a better position to emerge much more rapidly from the current economic situation, which has been flatlining, at best. Part of such a plan would involve repeating Labour&#8217;s bank bonus and investing in growth and jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.1/4">The economy remains extremely fragile. The Office for Budget Responsibility has revised down its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2011 from 2.6% a year ago to just 1.7%. Last week&#8217;s growth figures were hardly a triumph for the economy. Growth flatlined over the last quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011&#8212;it was down 0.5% in the former before going back up 0.5% in the latter&#8212;an effect that the Office for National Statistics has largely attributed to poor weather in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.1/5">The figures are less than inspiring, and I have to say that members of the Labour party are not in any way, shape or form deficit deniers; it is pure poppycock even to suggest that. We accept that we have to get the deficit down, but spending cuts need to be fair and just. They should not be hitting the easiest targets&#8212;the most vulnerable people such as the disabled, those on benefits and those on the minimum wage&#8212;but should be hitting everybody proportionately. That is something we have been shouting from the rooftops to everyone and anyone who cared to listen.</p>

	<p pid="a.503.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. Does he agree that it is very odd that the rate of the bank levy is being cut in the second year and that the revenues from the levy, which start at &#163;630 million, will fall to only &#163;100 million by the end of the Parliament?</p>

	<p pid="a.503.1/1">That is strange, but it is probably what we should expect. It does not surprise me one jot that the tax on banks will reduce in the years to come rather than increasing in line with profit or productivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/2">Most Members will be lucky enough to have a credit card, and many of them will have maxed it out and might still have a maxed-out card. That is a new term I have learned since coming to Parliament&#8212;&#8220;maxed-out credit card&#8221;. Incidentally, returning to IPSA, my IPSA card has definitely been maxed out: it has been stopped, as there is only &#163;1 left on it, but that is another issue. On a serious note, many hon. Members will have maxed out their credit card and will not be looking to pay it off in the next year or so. Instead, they will be planning how and when it best suits their pockets to pay it off, when they are able to do so. Paying it off immediately would mean having to go without even the most basic of necessities. That is life: it is about having effective financial means.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/3">The world economy revolves around borrowing and debt. People the length and breadth of the nation live off debt, and the issue is how that debt is managed and repaid. That kind of debt is like a mortgage: people have to pay it off, but it becomes like a family deficit that is paid off over 25 years. If people were told they had to pay their mortgage off in two years they could not do it, because they could not survive. That is exactly the approach that the Government are taking with the deficit. This is about having a fair process; it is about financial management. We are definitely not all in this together, but the Labour party&#8217;s bonus tax would have helped to implement a number of social programmes that would have benefited many of those who feel they are being disproportionately affected by the cuts.</p>

The <i>Journal</i> has reported that only 13 houses in the north-east were bought for more than &#163;1 million last year.

	<p pid="a.503.3/1">I think that is ironic, and I assure my hon. Friend that not many houses in my constituency are valued in the region of &#163;1 million. That is not only ironic; it is pretty sad and desperate when I think of the</p>
	<p pid="a.503.3/2">number of people in my constituency and elsewhere in the north-east who are looking for social housing and who cannot even get on to the housing ladder as a result of the austerity measures that are being put in place. That is why Labour says that although it is hurting, the signs are that it is not working.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.3/3">The amendment calls on the Government to review the overall taxation burden on the banks. They have declined to renew Labour&#8217;s bank bonus tax, which raised &#163;3.5 billion last year, and have instead proceeded with a bank levy that will raise about &#163;2.5 billion. Labour is calling on the Government not to give a tax cut to the banks, but to use the money that would be raised from repeating the levy to invest in jobs and growth. The Bill&#8217;s provisions for the bank levy equate simply to a tax cut for the banks, because it is estimated that it will bring in &#163;2.5 billion a year, which is less than the &#163;3.5 billion that Labour&#8217;s bonus tax brought in last year according to the OBR.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.3/4">Furthermore, the Government are giving banks a corporation tax cut of more than &#163;100 million in 2011-12 and the value of that tax cut will rise considerably by the end of the Parliament. It is essential to repeat the bank bonus tax, to increase the bank levy and to invest in jobs, growth and housing. Labour believes that in addition to continuing with the bank levy the Government should repeat the bank bonus tax and raise at least &#163;2 billion more, so that the banks do not get a tax cut this year. Frankly, I am opposed to the banks getting a tax cut in any year.</p>

	<p pid="a.506.1/1">I agree 100% with my hon. Friend&#8217;s suggestion, but as I have just suffered the wrath of the Chair, I shall not try to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.1/2">The OBR&#8217;s November 2010 forecast showed that the bonus tax brought in revenues of &#163;3.5 billion in 2010-11. We cannot know how much a repeat of the tax would yield in 2011-12, but a cautious assumption by any measure would be about &#163;2 billion. The Labour party&#8217;s view is that that estimated sum would go a long way to supporting many projects, such as, first, establishing a youth jobs fund and creating up to 100,000 new youth jobs at a time when youth unemployment is almost 1 million, its highest since records began in 1992-93. That is one thing we could do with the bank tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.1/3">Secondly, we could build 25,000 new homes for low cost home ownership and affordable social rent. This could create tens of thousands of jobs and help create 1,500 construction apprenticeships. It is important to ensure that young people can get on to the property ladder. Thirdly, an additional &#163;200 million could be provided as funding for the regional growth fund bids. Getting more people in work and paying taxes is the best way to bring the deficit down. The Tory-led Government are cutting too deep and too fast, and now the economy has stalled and unemployment is higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.1/4">There is a better way. Instead of giving the banks a tax cut this year, next year or the year after, the Government should repeat Labour&#8217;s bank bonus tax and use the money raised to invest in creating more than 100,000 jobs for young people and in construction, and to build 25,000 affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.1/5">The cuts are going too deep and too fast. There is an alternative. If we were still in government we would be halving the deficit steadily over four years, in line with the pledges made by major economies at the G20 last year, not trying to cut it further and faster than any other major economy in the world. Yes, tough choices are required. The deficit cannot be brought down if the economy is not growing strongly and hundreds of thousands of people are being thrown out of work. That is a simple, basic message.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.1/6">In conclusion, I repeat that the most important factor in getting the deficit down is what happens to jobs and growth in the economy. That is why last year, as the economy started growing again and unemployment was falling, the deficit came in more than &#163;20 billion lower than expected. That changed as the economy stopped growing at the end of last year and unemployment is higher. Stop the tax cuts to the banks, invest in the future of our young people, invest in this nation, invest in jobs and growth and adopt the Labour example of the bonus tax on banks.</p>

Economic growth is a difficult business. That is the business that we should be in, and we should make sure that bankers play their part in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.1/2">So bankers were not always about bonuses, and conversations about banks were not always about bonuses. Sadly, since the credit crunch and the global financial crisis, more attention has been focused on how great the anomaly is. We have heard the telephone-number salaries quoted and compared with the situation of people in our constituencies who are doing their best to bring their families up to be aspirational and to move forward in their lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.507.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. She draws attention to the fact that people see banks closing and services becoming less available and more remote at the same time as large bonuses are being given out, with no apparent transparency and no clear criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.3/2">The Bill delivers a tax benefit for banks&#8212;a bonus for banks, rather than for UK plc&#8212;in the form of the &#163;2.5 billion bank levy, which should be compared with the &#163;3.5 billion bank bonus last year, and with &#163;100 million being given back through cuts in corporation tax. At a time when the banks should be putting more in to atone for the situation we are in and to help the engine of the economy, the Government are allowing them to take more out.

	<p pid="a.507.5/1">My hon.

This is a no-mandate Government. A year ago there was clearly</p>
	<p pid="a.507.5/2">no mandate for what they are doing. They are taking their approach to bankers&#8217; bonuses even though there is a clear mandate from the population&#8212;one of the few that exists&#8212;for cracking on, getting on top of bankers&#8217; bonuses and ensuring that they play their part in reinvigorating the British economy. Where there is a mandate, the Government fail to act and give a dividend to bankers instead of a tax. There is no mandate for the things the Government are doing, such as the NHS reorganisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.508.0/1">My hon. Friend seems to have skated over the point that the majority of the banks are actually state owned, or have a majority state shareholding.

	<p pid="a.510.1/2">I support the amendment, because it seeks to address the challenges of any new legislation and answer the question of how we as a Parliament ensure that the legislation that we pass is effective at doing what we want it to do. The amendment would meet the challenge of asking whether bankers pay their fair share of the cost of dealing with the global financial crisis, just as we as taxpayers have paid more than our fair share, some might say, in trying to support them. That goes to the heart of today&#8217;s debate about clause 72 and what the Bill will do for the financial future of this country, so I support the amendment because it highlights the need to address the adequacy of the bank levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/3">I also pose a wider question about how the clause will work to ensure that all those who have benefited and, indeed, continue to benefit from the financial crisis that this country has endured pay their fair share in helping the economy out of recession and back into growth, not least because I am deeply concerned, as many Members know, about this Government&#8217;s policy of reducing the national debt by increasing private household debt, and about what that might mean for many of our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/4">I spoke at length on Second Reading last week about the impact of that policy on families throughout the country, and I do not propose to repeat the measures that I put forward, but, on the adequacy of the bank levy, the clause makes an omission that I hope the amendment will address. High-cost lenders are benefiting disproportionately from the impact of the Budget on our people, and from the fact that mainstream lenders are not lending due to banks paying out more in bonuses than they do to the people of this country, who need that money. Indeed, perhaps the omission calls for a</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/5">new clause to deal with that issue and, therefore, to make sure that that money benefits our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/6">The industry has certainly benefited greatly from this Government and from the events of the last year alone. Of the &#163;216 billion of unsecured lending in this country, &#163;8.5 billion comes from that market, which has increased by &#163;1 billion in the past year, and &#163;8.5 billion is the same amount of money that it would cost to repair all the schools in England&#8212;a cause dear to many Opposition Members. It is also the entire budget of the Department for International Development; we are talking about a substantial amount. The market is growing not least because of the lack of regulation&#8212;the lack of Government action to deal with the high-cost credit industry&#8212;and the amendment could deal with that omission.</p>

	<p pid="a.511.2/1">Thank you, Mr Gray. I appreciate very much the passion with which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40329" name="Mike Gapes">the Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes)</phrase> expresses his concern about BSF, which is a sentiment that I share, but I take the Chair&#8217;s point, and the bank levy is exactly what I want to speak to. I am concerned, because it offers an opportunity to deal with the challenges to our economy, and therefore the Bill should be amended by amendment 9.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/2">I return to the case that I am trying to make about the high-cost credit market in the UK and its impact. It is precisely because the market has not been subject to any regulation, which could be introduced under the amendment, that we have seen a massive explosion in payday lending&#8212;a quadrupling of the industry in the past 18 months alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/3">Dollar Financial, which Members may know better as The Money Shop, has already stated that the lack of regulation here brought it to the UK. The company had one store in the country in 1992, 273 by 2009, and it has announced plans for a further 800 this year alone as a result of that lack of regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/4">The question of adequacy, which the amendment raises, includes how those companies act&#8212;certainly, that is how I interpret it&#8212;and the opportunity that the levy and its review could provide for dealing with the impact of their actions on consumers in the UK. By using the review, we could ask whether the levy might be applied in such a way as to deter consumer detriment.</p>

Does she also consider it important that the bank levy be used beneficially to promote and to develop credit unions, which provide a decent system, help people when they are desperate, do not charge them excessive interest and are democratically run? They seem to me to be a beneficial service all round which should be encouraged.</p>

	<p pid="a.512.1/1">My hon. Friend hits the nail on the head, because proposed paragraph (b) of amendment 9 talks about wider reform of our banking system. Many Opposition Members have called for action on access to affordable credit, but this is not just about credit unions; it is about the schemes that housing associations have put forward. In that context, I register my disgust at the fact that a housing association was recently taken to the Advertising Standards Authority by The Money Shop for daring to point out to their tenants the cost of borrowing from such companies&#8212;and was, indeed, censured.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.1/2">The question of how we deal with banking reform, so that everybody can access affordable credit and there is not a new dividing line in our communities between those who can get on in life and families who are scarred with debt for generations, is a key concern for me, and many Opposition Members are concerned about what the Bill and the amendments can do to promote such measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.512.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point about the importance of this Bill putting first the needs of this country and, therefore, about the importance that others attach to it. I hope that we can seek support from members in all parts of the House for the need to act on the high-cost credit market. There has certainly been support among Government Back Benchers; noticeably, however, Government Front Benchers have so far reacted with negativity to that support. I hope that they will change their minds, given the possibilities that we have through the Bill, the amendment and, indeed, the regulatory measures being considered to make progress on an issue that concerns many Members. Our concerns are about a number of products&#8212;I want to put on record what we are talking about&#8212;and the lack of action on such products in contrast to dealing with the bank levy and whether it is applied appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.3/2">First, there are payday loans. Many people will be familiar with the concept of a short-term loan, and given that almost half of households cannot make their pay cheques last to the end of the month, it is no surprise that almost one third of households are now considering such products. Interest rates on such loans include one from a company called Oakam, of about 443%; and many people will be familiar with Wonga, whose rates are more at the 4,000% level. We are also</p>
	<p pid="a.512.3/3">talking about the home credit industry and companies such as Provident. Many people will be familiar with Provident going from door to door in their communities lending money to people at interest rates of, say, 272%. That means that if someone borrows just &#163;300 from the company&#8212;perhaps to buy a new sofa or TV, or to fix a washing machine or a boiler that has gone wrong over the winter&#8212;that will cost them &#163;546.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.3/4">Were we to use this amendment and the opportunity of the bank levy to deal with some of these problems and with the actions of some of these companies, we would be encouraging the Government to look at the concept of adequacy and consider some of the issues in that market. First, there is the lack of competition in providing credit to those who are denied mainstream credit. That is embodied by the fact that there is no innovation in these products; they are very similar. There is therefore a great contrast with people who are able to borrow from mainstream creditors. Many people will be familiar with mainstream banks offering preferential rates and loyalty schemes to customers who they want to hold on to because they know that they have alternative sources of credit. We could apply the bank levy to the question of adequacy and ask whether these companies are acting in a way that is detrimental to consumers and whether the lack of competition is detrimental to consumers and to our economy. Many people have expressed concern that our banking industry is already overloaded, which requires more competition. I would argue that there needs to be more competition in lending to people who cannot access mainstream credit, and this is one way in which we could achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.3/5">A quarter of the customers who use high-cost-credit companies cannot borrow from other lenders. As a consequence, they do not build up the evidence of being good borrowers that would allow them to use mainstream sources of credit. These companies do not share information on their customers, making it incredibly difficult for customers to prove that they could use more mainstream sources of credit. The question of adequacy could also be applied to companies&#8217; use of rollovers and stepping up of loans, which means that borrowers are stuck with using them. In particular, because they often lend only small amounts of money to begin with&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.513.1/1">I apologise to the Chair if I am not being clear, but I see this in the context of paragraph (b) of the amendment on the wider regulation of the banking system, and the importance of trying to use the opportunity that the bank levy presents to effect a positive impact on the way in which money is lent to those on low incomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.513.2/1">My hon. Friend has campaigned on this issue for a considerable period. Is it not true that the bank levy could be used as a lever to prise these other reforms out of the overall system?</p>

	<p pid="a.513.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. This is born out of my frustration at the fact that the Government have so far refused even to contemplate</p>
	<p pid="a.513.3/2">taking action. I hope that this time round the Treasury team will seriously consider how the bank levy could be used to effect such action. The concept of adequacy in the amendment offers us an opportunity to ask whether the bank levy is being levied in a way that deals with high-cost credit and its impact. This debate has been about the appropriate level of the levy and its impact on banks, and I would argue that it could be extended to an appropriate levy on high-cost credit industries. We could then look at the way in which such companies pass on their costs to consumers who are particularly struggling in the economic conditions that we face. As Debt on our Doorstep points out, the fixed costs of lending in the home credit industry represent about 15% of revenues, yet the cost of borrowing from such companies is &#163;82 in collection charges for every &#163;100 lent. It is therefore no surprise that their profits have gone up by 40% in the past year as the lack of regulation in the industry allows them to run riot in our local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.513.3/3">There is broad agreement on the need to act on the impact of these companies, and the clause could be amended and applied in such a way as to enable that to happen. Citizens Advice has argued that the Government should not use the need for regulation of the financial sector as a cover for failing to act in these markets, as has the Centre for Responsible Credit&#8212;and as have many Ministers. I urge Ministers to talk to colleagues who, prior to 2010, advocated caps on the cost of interest rates. The Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs was very supportive at that time, but he seems to have changed his mind. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I agree entirely with the suggestion that perhaps that is yet another broken promise. We are talking about the 5 million to 7 million people in our communities who are affected by not being able to access mainstream credit and who are forced to use such companies. The bank levy gives us the opportunity to send a strong message to those companies that the way in which they act is deleterious to our communities and to our economy as more people are stuck in debt.</p>

	<p pid="a.514.1/1">The hon. Gentleman appears to be arguing that the money that would be raised by the bank levy should be given to the high-cost credit industry. Far be it from me to suggest that he wants to support those kinds of businesses. I know that some Liberal Democrat Members have been very supportive of these companies&#8212;mistakenly, because if they were to talk to the local communities affected by them, they would realise how damaging they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/2">Let me be very clear: I am arguing for the ability of the Government to review the bank levy and for a review to consider whether it could be applied in such a way as to discourage lending that is detrimental to consumers. I have firmly in my sights the high-cost</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/3">credit industry and the detriment that it causes to our local communities. I hope that Ministers will accept the amendment and explore whether the bank levy could be used to act as a positive behavioural challenge on these companies, because that would benefit many people in our country. I do not want to see investment in the high-cost credit industry, and I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40108" name="David Ward">the hon. Member for Bradford East (Mr Ward)</phrase> did not mean to suggest that, but I do want to see action on it, and I know that I am not alone in this House in hoping for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/4">If the Government will not accept the amendment, I will table more amendments and keep pressing this issue, and I hope that other Members will join me in support. The Minister is shaking his head. I hope that he has spoken to the many Members on his own Benches who do not shake their heads and walk on by as people are preyed on by these companies. I spent yesterday with 900 members of London Citizens Black Clergy Caucus, who will be seeking urgent meetings with the Ministers responsible. Ministers may think they can ignore me or ignore Labour Members, but I hope that they will not ignore the millions of people who are struggling to pay their bills and make ends meet, and for whom these companies are increasingly the only option. Regulation has worked effectively in other countries, and it could be achieved through this Bill. I hope that the Minister will look at the case seriously and not dismiss it out of hand as he appears to be doing.</p>

	<p pid="a.515.0/1">It seems to me that when it comes to bonuses, the clue is in the word. If one looks at the etymology, the word &#8220;bonus&#8221; comes from the Latin: it means &#8220;good&#8221;. In fact, it should be &#8220;bonum&#8221;, as with &#8220;maximum&#8221;, &#8220;minimum&#8221; and &#8220;premium&#8221;, so that we had &#8220;bonum&#8221; and &#8220;bona&#8221;, but let us leave that aside. The bonus culture in the banks is supposed to be for something good&#8212;for good performance&#8212;and yet, certainly within the banks that are largely owned by the public, these bonuses are being given almost uniformly for bad performances: they are &#8220;malum&#8221;, not &#8220;bonum&#8221;. It is really quite ridiculous that these bonuses should be paid and that the Government should be proposing to levy such a low rate against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> gave us a bit of the history of how the recession had come about and the context in which these bonuses were being paid. Interestingly, however, his history stopped in 2006 or 2007, when he published a paper about the regulatory regime and the need for tighter regulation. To find out the true history of this, one has to go back to a time before 2006 and 2007, and beyond this country, to look at the sub-prime market in the United States in 2000. At that time, the proportion of mortgages in the United States that were lent to sub-prime borrowers was just 5%. Between 2000 and 2005, that increased to 47%. That meant that by 2005, 45% of mortgages in the US were in arrears by two months, or more than 60 days. That is the origin of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/3">Much has been said by Government Members to try to set the recession in context. For months, they have said that it was because of the Labour Government&#8217;s disastrous economic management. Of course, the context for it is in the United States, where what happened with</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/4">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two major mortgage-lending institutions, was the beginning of the collapse of what had been a virtuous circle, and what became a vicious one. Those institutions could not lend because they were not getting revenues in, which was because people with mortgages were more than two months in arrears. That meant that there was a drying up of credit in the system in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/5">One of my hon. Friends&#8212;I cannot remember who&#8212;mentioned the role played by the rating agencies. The way in which the situation impacted more widely on the economy, first in the United States and subsequently elsewhere, was through the securitisation of mortgages into bundles to create revenue streams for companies and, indeed, for financial institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.516.0/1">My hon. Friend is making a perfectly good point about the historical context of the global downturn. Is it not the case that the bubble burst because financial institutions across the globe were not certain about the packages that they had bought, because of the unpicking of those packages, and because of the percentages of those packages that were made up of bad debt?</p>

	<p pid="a.516.1/1">My hon. Friend is right, but perhaps he has missed a further element of that toxic mix. That is not the role of the rating agencies, although they played their part in bundling up sub-prime mortgages. In order to securitise them into revenue streams for companies, they had looked at the historical rate of default in the sub-prime sector in 2000, when only 5% of the market was being sold to sub-prime borrowers, not in 2005, when the figure was 47%. The effect was that many companies had security streams that were not very secure. The piece of the toxic mix that we need to introduce is the way in which hedge funds brought to bear their financial might.</p>

	<p pid="a.516.7/1">I am very happy to do so, Mr Gray. We are talking about a bank levy, and amendment 9 refers to</p>
	<p pid="a.516.7/2">&#8220;the Government&#8217;s analysis behind the rate and threshold chosen for the bank levy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.7/3">It seems to me that if one is to perform an analysis of the rate and threshold chosen, one has to understand how these things came about and the historical context. More importantly, one has to understand the regulatory context and what went wrong in the regulatory system. Much of the debate has been about that regulatory structure. I am seeking to address subsection (2)(a) proposed in the amendment. That is exactly the import of my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.7/4">As the hedge funds brought their pressure to bear, they identified the problem of the companies&#8217; overvaluation in the market. They saw that the structure of the bundled streams of security were not providing the security to the companies that the market believed they were providing. The hedge funds then short sold on those companies. That was an important regulatory failure. There was no uptake rule and no clear limit on the arbitrage window that was allowed for trading on such shares, so the short selling allowed the hedge funds to beat down the value of those financial institutions in such a way that there was a precipitation of the collapse of the credit that could flow through the financial institutions, which infected all the other companies in the stock exchange. That is how the situation became a global crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.7/5">In addressing the analysis that the amendment asks the Government to engage in, I urge them to take seriously the regulatory failings at that time. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> The Financial Secretary says from a sedentary position that those were the mistakes of the previous Government. What I am pointing out to him is that they were not simply mistakes made by the previous Government, but mistakes that were made on a global scale. The financial crisis started in the sub-prime market in the US, and that infected the global markets. The reason that it took hold in the UK, to the detriment of this country, was that we had placed an over-reliance on the financial markets and the financial sector as opposed to manufacturing and industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.518.0/1">I am of course always happy to abide by your ruling, Mr Gray, so I will move on to focus on the adequacy of the bank levy in the context of other reforms to the wider banking system. It is clear that those other reforms are necessary. We can debate the history at length, and we may take different lessons from that history about the type of regulatory reform that we wish to see, but I want to focus on the adequacy of the levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.518.0/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> sought to contrast the payments that bankers would be receiving this year&#8212;the million pound-plus bonuses&#8212;with the situation of ordinary working families in this country, many of whom are seeing their own financial position severely worsened or are losing their jobs or benefits. He expanded on the modest emoluments that those people would receive this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.518.0/3">However, the force of our argument is not just the contrast between the difficult situation of those people and the greed at the other end of the scale. It comes from the fact that there is a direct causal relationship between the two&#8212;the bankers are the ones who have caused the misery that our constituents will be enduring. More than that, the funds from the bank levy&#8212;the funds that are being paid in bonuses, from which we would seek to extract more for the Exchequer&#8212;could be better spent in tackling the problem in the other dimension. Instead of considering the matter from the point of view of its inequity, we should consider it in the context of achieving a resolution to the deficit crisis. That resolution can come through growth and through the spending of these resources in ways such as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase> explained clearly. We want the Government to accept the amendment, so that we can consider the adequacy of the bank levy in the context of other reforms to the banking system. We want a policy that is for growth in the economy, not simply one that is for taxes.</p>

	<p pid="a.518.1/1">Is it not also the case that the taxpayer has given the banking system an unlimited guarantee, and that according to the Bank of England, we are subsidising the banks to the tune of about &#163;100 billion a year? Yet even with all that support, they still demand that they should be able to pay massive bonuses.</p>

	<p pid="a.518.2/1">Indeed. The support that the country has given the banks is perfectly right, in my view. I disagree with the right hon. Member for Wokingham on the matter.

There we see the consequences of policies that had their origin in &#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as society.&#8221; Only if someone does not pay regard to society can they adopt such a hard-line position, because it ignores the consequences of failure and the effect on ordinary human beings&#8212;not just savers but, as he said, investors.

	<p pid="a.519.0/1">Is it not also the case that the banking system is getting the best of both worlds? Over the past few years it has received very substantial support for the taxpayer, but at the same time as paying itself ever-increasing bonuses it is refusing to invest in local companies and valid business propositions in all our constituencies, thus hampering economic growth across the country. Is it not right that the bank levy is introduced for a second year and beyond through the reviews suggested in the amendment, so that we can get that growth back into the economy?</p>

	<p pid="a.519.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point in contrasting the lending policies of the banks with the bonuses that they seek to pay, particularly to their higher-end staff. The Government have to be much clearer in the regulatory demands that they impose on the banks, because they are speaking with forked tongue. On one hand, they are insisting that there is tighter regulation and that there is a regime to ensure that there are adequate reserves and far more stringency in the banks&#8217; investment policies. On the other hand, they are on the side of business, urging the banks to lend more money. It is not possible for them to have it both ways, and we must not fall into that trap either. Either the Government have to say, &#8220;We want tighter regulation, and to hell with small business&#8221;, or they have to say, &#8220;No, we want small businesses to thrive, because we want growth in the economy&#8221;, in which case the regulatory regime for banks has to allow for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.1/2">That does not affect my hon. Friend&#8217;s point, because he is absolutely right to contrast the bonus structure with the banks&#8217; lending policy. The bankers expect the situation to be all good for them, but it is not so good when they are dishing out the money at the other end.</p>

	<p pid="a.519.2/1">My hon. Friend is exactly right. Is not the real problem that we are actually getting neither of the things that he mentions? We are getting neither effective regulation of the banks nor money flowing into small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

	<p pid="a.519.3/1">That is the sad fact of our situation. I am sure that all of us, as constituency MPs, have business people coming to us saying that they cannot get credit. Indeed, many successful businesses that have had no change in their circumstances are suddenly being told by their banks that their credit facilities are no longer there. The banks are unilaterally changing the terms of those facilities, and the Government must do</p>
	<p pid="a.519.3/2">something about that. They cannot on one hand let the banks off with a &#163;20 billion tax allowance for bonuses and, on the other hand, say that they do not have to ensure that they are lending to small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.3/3">The difference between Opposition and Government Members goes right to the heart of whether we believe that the most important thing to do is to get growth back into the economy, get money flowing into small businesses and pay people a decent wage rather than make them redundant&#8212;that means that their spending on goods and services does not contract, and they spend money on brown goods and white goods and generate wealth and jobs in the economy, so that we grow our way through the problems&#8212;or whether we believe that we have simply to cut, cut, cut the public sector and pay, pay, pay the bankers&#8217; bonuses.</p>

	<p pid="a.520.0/1">I would welcome the amendment because I think it is time to stand back and review the future role of levies. The amendment seeks to prise out the Government&#8217;s analysis regarding the rate and the threshold of the levy, but it also gives us the opportunity to debate the overall adequacy of a levy and its role in the economic situation that we face.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/2">I echo <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> in saying that the world has moved on and the role of bank levies is different now. The first early-day motion on this matter, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> and I eight years ago, in advance of the crisis, related specifically to the profligacy of the banks in their distribution of bonuses. We gained the support of 40 Members of the House. At that stage, the role of the proposed levy was fairly clear cut and straightforward: it was to act as a disincentive to the payment of such obscene bonuses, as others have described them.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/3">Then, economic crisis hit us. The first sign was Northern Rock. I remember being in the Chamber when we exposed the role of Granite in Northern Rock and the tax fiddles, avoidance and evasion&#8212;whatever we want to call it&#8212;that were taking place. We called for the Government to use public ownership to nationalise and stabilise the banking system, but we added to that a call for the maintenance of a levy system, because we wanted to prevent a recurrence of the bankers&#8217; bonuses during a period of recession caused by their profligacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/4">As the right hon. Member for Wokingham said, the world has moved on, and we now have a bizarre situation. Yes, a levy on privately owned banks that are making profits and paying large bonuses is relevant, but introducing a levy on publicly owned banks is bizarre&#8212;it is a circular form of taxation&#8212;which is why the review proposed in the amendment is important. Surely if we own banks, we should end such bonuses by diktat and force reasonable lending using our management control. I hope that the review will examine the adequacy of future bank levy arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/5">I compliment a number of my hon. Friends who have spoken in this debate, none more passionately than my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40630" name="Ian Lavery">the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery)</phrase>, who reflected the climate of anger in which this debate takes place. There is anger about how individuals have been treated by the banks, but also anger about the impact of the banks on the overall economy. The impact has also been felt by families in the loss of jobs and cuts in services. If we are to have a review of the bank levy, I</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/6">would welcome a commitment to absolute openness and transparency about the nature of the banks&#8217; current operations. Many people are bewildered by the banks&#8217; lack of adherence to the exhortations of successive Governments on the role that they should play, particularly in lending and long-term investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/7">I welcome the proposed production of a report, but I would prefer it to be published earlier. The amendment proposes a deadline of &#8220;before <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-31">31 December 2011</phrase>&#8221;, but I would want the report no later than the autumn, because I believe we need a tighter analysis and review regime for the banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/8">I am no longer sure that the Government know what the levy is meant to achieve; they are certainly not clear on the appropriate rate, or even to whom and what the levy should apply. The previous Chancellor&#8217;s levy was clearly a bonus tax: it was an attempt to influence the behaviour of the banks and to end the remuneration system that encouraged reckless behaviour and the taking of excessive risk. The objective was also to raise income, although that was not the stated primary aim. Bizarrely&#8212;this is why I admitted an error earlier&#8212;the levy failed to influence behaviour, because the bonuses continued, but at the same time, it was extremely successful at raising income. In fact, it was seven times more successful than was originally predicted. As I said, the original prediction was that it would to reap &#163;500 million, but &#163;3.5 billion was gained.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/9">The review is important because when the current Chancellor was asked what the role of the proposed levy is, he replied that it was a lump-sum tax, or simply an aimed-for sum. However, that sum has changed as the rate has metamorphosed over the past year. On at least six occasions, there have been changes in the rate calculated, and therefore in the estimated amount to be gained. Why is the levy set at the level the Government propose? They have given us no clear understanding of that tonight. All we know, from various media reports, is that the bankers have laughed all the way to their banks. The tax take has been described as &#8220;relatively insignificant&#8221;. A number of commentators, some of whom appeared before the Treasury Committee, described the levy as generous, and others have described it as an easy ride for the banks. If the levy were set purely to generate a lump-sum tax take, why at that level? Why not double, triple or quadruple that level? I fail to see what analysis of the estimate has been made. In fact, so far, the Government have published no independent analysis that would allow the House to understand the rationale for the estimated take.</p>

	<p pid="a.521.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, but I will come to that point later. The way in which the banks have continued their profligate distribution of bonuses looks like them cocking a snook at the Government and the level at which the levy has been set.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/2">When the Chancellor appeared before the Treasury Committee, he advanced two arguments on how the levy was constructed. First, he argued that the levy was</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/3">based on the price of the insurance that the Government and the taxpayer now implicitly offer for the wholesale funding of the banks; the levy is therefore a tax on the wholesale funding of banks&#8217; operations. However, a calculation of the appropriate insurance for that scale of banking insurance, which could surely be done, would show that that sum is significantly more than the current bank levy proposal would raise.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/4">The Chancellor&#8217;s second argument was that the levy was in the interests of equity: the banking sector, as well as the rest of us, should make a contribution to resolving the economic crisis. However, the amount that the bankers are being asked to provide to help to tackle the crisis that they created is piffling in comparison with the damage caused to our wider society, and minute in comparison with the burden that is being carried by others in terms of job losses and services cuts. Whole communities now face significant suffering and deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/5">The Chancellor himself admitted that the targeted revenue sum was &#8220;relatively small&#8221; because, he argued, it balanced fairness with competitiveness, yet no study has been published and no evidence has been produced on the impact on banking competitiveness of varying the levy. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase>, I want to know what independent assessments have been made of the balance between fairness and competitiveness and how the calculation was arrived at. I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" name="Andrew Love">the Member for Edmonton (Mr Love)</phrase>, who said that the measure throws the Government&#8217;s commitment to tax simplicity out the window. The taxation system on this issue is now more complex than any other point of taxation in the tax book, so I endorse the questions about how HMRC, with its current staffing cuts, can cope with the implementation of the levy. I would also welcome the Government publishing the consultation on the assessment of the amount of tax take from the proposed levy, because it looks like consultation was either non-existent or fairly minimal.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/6">The amendment would require the report to consider</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/7">&#8220;the adequacy of the bank levy in the context of other reforms&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/8">Our understanding is that the levy was set to assist the implementation of the Merlin agreement and to ensure that the banks had a lending strategy to help get the economy moving and out of recession. As others have said, the levy must be set so as to ensure a continued influence on banks&#8217; behaviour in relation to remuneration and bonuses. While promoting the bank levy, the Prime Minister and Chancellor exhorted bankers to show restraint. Is the levy set at the right level to ensure that the other reforms linked to it are completed and adhered to?</p>

	<p pid="a.522.0/1">The evidence of our eyes and ears of the relationship in recent months between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the bankers is that there has been one word from the Chancellor and another word from the Prime Minister, and the banks have continued to do exactly what they want.</p>

	<p pid="a.522.1/1">That is exactly my point. It might be that the levy is being set in relation to other banking reforms, particularly those on bonuses and remuneration, but not only have we seen the complete disregard of the Chancellor and Prime Minister&#8217;s exhortations, with bonuses continuing at a very high level, but we have seen, as</p>
	<p pid="a.522.1/2">another Member said, a diversion into other forms of remuneration and salary increases. That is almost an abuse of the system as set out in the Government&#8217;s proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.522.1/3">If the debate is about the adequacy of the levy, and in view of the fact that in spite of the Government having set down a marker in the proposals, bonuses have continued and remuneration has increased, can the Government not support the amendment? If the review reported at least by December&#8212;I would prefer the autumn&#8212;we could consider increasing the levy to ensure adherence to the wider banking reform proposals the Government want implemented. It is clear from the evidence produced today that the banks need a continuing threat&#8212;a sword of Damocles&#8212;hanging over their heads, if we are to get any change in the bonuses and remuneration that are so offensive to all our constituents suffering in the recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.522.1/4">It might be that the levy was set so that the Merlin agreement could become fully operable and lending might start in earnest again. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East noted, however, so far all the indications are that the revival of lending has not taken place. The Government&#8217;s proposals therefore warrant a review at the earliest stage, because even now, while they are still being implemented, they are not working. The evidence for that is all around us. It is clear now&#8212;this is why the review is so important&#8212;that the levy has become almost irrelevant to the real issues of capitalisation and regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.523.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend about the review&#8217;s importance. On the one side, bankers are telling us that they are lending money and that money is available to lend; on the other side, we have small business organisations unified in saying not only that money is not available, but that the terms on which it would be made available are so onerous as to make it impossible for them to take out a loan. The review could resolve who is right and who is wrong.</p>

	<p pid="a.523.1/1">The review would certainly test the adequacy of the levy as an instrument for influencing banks&#8217; behaviour, which I believe is its purpose. However, the problem is not just the lack of lending; it is the continuing profiteering in the mainstream banking system&#8212;let alone the shadow banking system that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40629" name="Stella Creasy">the Member for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy)</phrase> has been so assiduous in exposing. In the main Budget debate, I highlighted some of the interest charges being made. A report by Moneyfacts last August showed that the profit margins enjoyed by the banks on fixed-rate deals are the highest since 1988, and that the average interest rate on personal loans was 12.6%, which at 12.1% over the base rate is an all-time high. So far, the threat of the levy has done absolutely nothing to change banks&#8217; behaviour in any aspect, whether remuneration, bonuses or lending. We are in danger of allowing the banks not merely to return to business as normal, but to get even worse. Even those in public ownership out of public control. I find that extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/2">The review must take place in the context of other attempts, such as the Basel discussions, to restrain or control banks&#8217; behaviour. Basel II seems to let the banks off the hook on a range of issues, from remuneration</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/3">to capital ratios. The levy is meant to come in the context of the reforms the Government are engaging in nationally and internationally, but the</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/4" class="italic">Financial Times</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/5">reported today that discussions about global standards on bank lending risks are not moving towards an agreement, so now we are not even moving forward in capital ratio discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/6">We need to consider the levy in the context of the banks&#8217; role overall and the anger in our wider communities. Many believe&#8212;rightly&#8212;that the banks played the key role in creating the recession, and now, if we are not careful, by not lending or engaging in economic growth, they will play a role if not in tipping the economy into a double-dip recession, at least in leaving the economy to scrape along the bottom of economic activity. I have referred before to the words of Graham Turner, from the Left Economics Advisory Panel. He works in the City and is an expert on what happened in Japan. We face the prospect of a long, low-level, depressed, deflationary spiral if we do not use the levy to stimulate the banks into playing a responsible role within our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/7">We will come out of recession only through an astute mix of fiscal and monetary policy. In the 1930s&#8212;this is the whole point about Keynes&#8212;it was about not just deficit funding and quantitative easing, but more importantly banking reform. Banking reform is one element of the strategy that any Government must adopt to take us out of recession, and the banking levy is one of the few tools and weapons at our disposal that can force through banking reform. So far, the threat of the banking levy has failed to engage even those banks that are in public ownership in a proper discussion about banking reform and the role that they will have to play in tackling the recession and encouraging economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/8">I urge the Government and all parties to accept the amendment. All it does is seek a review, so that we can come back to this place&#8212;the amendment says in December; I would welcome doing it earlier&#8212;having reviewed the banking levy&#8217;s effectiveness. I do not understand why that is difficult for the Government to accept. At that stage, if we find that the banks are continuing to ignore the Government&#8217;s exhortations and to ignore the levy as a means of encouraging them to engage in constructive activity in our economy, we can adjust the policy. We can then use it as a proper lever to encourage new banking practices, increase transparency and accountability in the banking sector and get the regulation for which everybody across all parties is now clamouring, but which in the past has been ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/9">I support the amendment because it could be the start of a valuable process of engaging realistically with banking regulation in this country. I also support it because if the banking levy proves to be ineffective and we do not review it and make it effective, if the bonuses are let rip again next Christmas but lending is not happening and the bankers and the banks are not playing their full role in tackling our recession, the anger among our constituents will be immense, especially if they are on the dole or are facing cuts, or if their communities are facing severe deprivation. That anger will also fall upon our heads for failing to act by simply having a review to ensure that we have the right mechanism to tackle the banks and the recession.</p>

	<p pid="a.525.2/1">It does, and my hon. Friend makes a good point. The rhetoric from Conservative central office, now joined by the Liberal Democrats, is that we are in this economic mess because of the recklessness of the Labour Government, somehow forgetting both the international economic climate and the effects of the irresponsible lending by banks, on which the levy will now be imposed. My hon. Friend is quite right: I know that her constituency is facing a tough time at the moment, and not just in the public sector. A number of private sector companies are closing in Darlington as a direct result of the fiscal straitjacket that this coalition Government have put on the north-east region.

	<p pid="a.526.0/1">That is exactly what the electorate will be doing: calling the bluff of this Government and asking whether they will live up to the promises that they made. Indeed, it is interesting that when I mentioned the Prime Minister&#8217;s &#8220;day of reckoning&#8221;, someone on the Government Benches said that it would be a bank holiday. If I was a banker, that is exactly what I would think this weak banking levy and these weak banking regulations were delivering.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.0/2">The Deputy Prime Minister even joined in on the act, saying on Radio Sheffield that he wanted to</p>
	<p pid="a.526.0/3">&#8220;wring the neck of these wretched people&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.0/4">I am not sure whether he was referring to the Conservatives or the bankers&#8212;or, after Thursday, some of his Cabinet colleagues, when the AV referendum delivers a no vote, which is how I recommend everyone should vote on Thursday. Despite all the overblown rhetoric, we have seen no action to follow it through. As was said earlier, many of our constituents cannot understand why, if we were going to tax the bankers through this levy&#8212;and thereby control their reckless behaviour, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington said&#8212;they seem to have completely ignored it.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.0/5">We need to consider that when thinking about the appearance of the head of Barclays before the Treasury Committee, when he said,</p>

	<p pid="a.526.0/11">Well, lending money to those businesses would be a start. Another starting point for doing that might also be Barclay&#8217;s five top bankers. They have just received bonuses of &#163;110 million, which does not&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.527.1/1">I had only a small walk-on part in the previous Government. However, when asked whether we can justify some of the bonuses that were paid, I would say no, we cannot. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/2">When our constituents vote this Thursday, they should be aware of the lack of Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members present for this debate today. I note, however, that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40125" name="Stephen Williams">the hon. Member for Bristol West (Stephen Williams)</phrase>, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on finance, has referred to the Barclays bankers&#8217; pay deal as &#8220;obscene&#8221;. As part of the coalition, the Liberal Democrats need to speak out loudly to ensure that something is done about the bonuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/3">The levy is supposed to curb behaviour, but I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40332" name="Ben Gummer">the hon. Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer)</phrase> that the greatest scandal is the bankers&#8217; bonuses being paid by banks controlled mainly by the Government. For example, the Royal Bank of Scotland is 87% owned by ourselves as taxpayers, yet more than 100 of its bankers were paid a bonus of more than &#163;1 million last year, totalling more than &#163;1 billion. We are talking about the bank levy raising more than &#163;2 billion a year, but the banks are paying out &#163;1 billion in bonuses. That raises the question of whether the levy is high enough. If it is not going to change the behaviour of the banks it clearly is not high enough, and we should look in greater detail at the idea of raising the levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/4">We have heard a lot of rhetoric on the regulation of the banks, but we have seen very little action. The bankers&#8217; bonus tax raised &#163;3.5 billion for the taxpayer, but the levy that we are now discussing will raise only just over &#163;2 billion a year. The new levy will add about &#163;800 million to that. The banks have got off pretty lightly. In addition, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East said earlier, they will gain about &#163;100 million from the reduction in corporation tax from 28% to 24%.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/5">The danger that was threatened by the banking sector to Labour when we were in power, and is still threatened today, is that if we do not allow these large bonuses to be paid, or if we charge the banks too high a levy, they will move offshore or elsewhere. The example of Sweden has been mentioned as the only example of that, however. I have looked into whether the lack of such bankers&#8217; bonuses elsewhere affects where people live. An interesting survey has been carried out by eFinancialCareers, which looked at 2,511 bankers, 654 of whom were in the UK. It showed that bonuses rose by about 5% in this country, whereas in the United States they decreased by the same amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/6">Another issue of concern to many of us is the fact that banks will increasingly come up with ways of paying bonuses other than in cash. We have already seen arrangements whereby 40% to 60% of bonuses can be paid through share options at a future date. It was pointed out earlier that some of those individuals could defer accepting their bonuses for several years, possibly until tax rates have gone down, or in order to use other mechanisms to avoid payment of tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/7">If we are to follow through on the rhetoric, we need to ensure that the proposed levy is justifiable, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East said earlier. But what is wrong with the amendment? It is simply asking for something quite reasonable&#8212;that the Chancellor</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/8">&#8220;review the bank levy and publish a report&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/9">on that levy. Such an analysis would also examine the thresholds involved. I would also be interested to hear from the Minister why the first &#163;20 billion is exempt. Why was the figure of &#163;20 billion chosen? That measure will take out quite a number of small institutions. It has been argued that it was set at that level to discourage larger banks, but it will also benefit those banks, which will avoid paying anything on the first &#163;20 billion.</p>

Evidence to date suggests that the &#163;3.5 billion that the bonus tax took out of the banking sector has not damaged the banking system in any way, shape or form.

	<p pid="a.529.5/1">My hon. Friend brings me on to a new relevant area, because he shows how the banking and financial sector are able to influence the debate. The previous Labour Government as well as this Government might have been somewhat in awe of the threats made by the banking sector&#8212;for example, to move offshore, with a consequent effect on jobs, if too much regulation</p>
	<p pid="a.529.5/2">is imposed. It might just be coincidental, but since <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40665" name="David Cameron">the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr Cameron)</phrase> became Leader of the Opposition, donations to the Conservative party have increased, and about 50% of them come from the City and the financial sector, including some donations of &#163;500,000 from four or five key individuals, including from Finsbury and Pelham PR, whose job it is to persuade politicians and other decision makers of the importance of, and the need for, the banking sector. As I say, it could be completely coincidental that the Tory party gets large amounts of money from this sector, but one could draw the conclusion that this is one of the reasons this Government have taken such a light-touch approach to regulation of the banking and finance sector.</p>

I remember going to the IMF in spring 2009 and what it described as &#8220;the Brown plan&#8221; was, it said, the only thing that stood between a global financial meltdown and getting the world economy back on a level footing. Does my hon. Friend share my concern and dismay at the Prime Minister saying that he would not support the former Prime Minister if he decided to run for the job of managing director of the World Bank? Surely the best way to test the Prime Minister&#8217;s thesis about whether the former Prime Minister&#8217;s leadership was good or not is to allow him to run and see whether other countries support his candidature.</p>

	<p pid="a.530.1/1">I would not want to stray too far down that avenue, but it does say something about the pettiness and smallness of our present Prime Minister, whereas the previous incumbent is not only respected in financial circles but has proven ability to do the job. Pettiness is one aspect of this Government but another part of their mantra is that they must sound tough. They won an election by sounding tough, but they have not followed it through when it comes to banking regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/2">The right hon. Member for Wokingham spoke about banking regulation. He is no longer in his place, but he used a wonderful phrase about his being in favour not of less regulation, but of &#8220;better and less regulation&#8221;. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40630" name="Ian Lavery">the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery)</phrase> touched on whether the previous Government should have regulated the banking sector more. In hindsight, I think yes, they should. I think we all accept that; it is not an admission of failure to concede that. We also need to remember who else at the time was arguing, along with the right hon. Member for Wokingham, for less regulation and less red tape in all areas, including banking. The answer is, the Conservative Front-Bench team&#8212;those same Conservative Front Benchers who were arguing for the same spending levels that we had right up to 2007, although that seems to have been forgotten about in the revisionist history that has developed since they gained power with the Liberal Democrats last May.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/3">The Government&#8217;s bank levy is estimated to bring in &#163;2.5 billion a year&#8212;less than Labour&#8217;s bank bonus measures, which according to the Office for Budget Responsibility brought in &#163;3.5 billion. We should not</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/4">forget that the cut in corporation tax in 2011-12 will give the banks &#163;100 million in tax relief, but that at the same time local government is being asked to make cuts. My own county council, for example, is going to lose 40% of its budget&#8212;&#163;125 million&#8212;over the next four years as a result of the unnecessary austerity measure proposed by this coalition Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.533.2/1">I am, but that is part of the scrutiny process, and so is this. If the hon. Gentleman is so interested in the banking levy and the effects of the Bill on his constituents, why does he not speak? At one point he was alone on the Liberal Democrat Benches. The Government Benches have been fairly deserted this evening: the poop deck of the <i>Mary Celeste </i>may have had more life in it. Members who support the proposal in the Bill should at least turn up to argue in favour of it. No doubt we will be receiving &#8220;Focus&#8221; leaflets from the Liberal Democrats&#8212;although after Thursday they may be called something different&#8212;describing how tough they have been in regulating the banking system, but it is clear that they have not.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.2/2">The hon. Gentleman has until late tonight, and tomorrow, in which to contribute to the debate so that he can reproduce his contribution in his &#8220;Focus&#8221; leaflets ad nauseam, which I know the Liberal Democrats love doing. People will be able to learn about how he stood up for them against the bankers rather than just listening to the hollow words and rhetoric of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister in the run-up to the general election. The beauty about being in government is that politicians can actually do things. I know it has come as a big shock to many Liberal Democrats that they are in a position of responsibility whereby they can actually affect the lives of ordinary people. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Yes, responsibility without influence, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" name="Ian Mearns">the Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase> says from a sedentary position. As the Liberal Democrats are in government, they can follow through and make sure that the Bill deals with the people who were responsible for getting us into this mess three years ago. They also have an opportunity to tackle the excessive profits. I do not know what the average salary is in Bradford, but I am sure that &#163;1 million is a lot of money to the people there. I know that in 1914, prior to the first world war, Bradford won the competition for being the place where the most Silver Ghosts were sold, because it was a rich mill town back then; I learned that from the predecessor of the hon. Member for Bradford East when I was working for him in a by-election many years ago. I doubt whether many Rolls-Royces are sold in Bradford nowadays, however, and the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituents can only dream of some of the bonuses he is supporting this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="a.533.4/1">Yes. I do not particularly like giving opportunities to Liberal Democrats, but it would give them an opportunity to show that they have the teeth that the Liberal Democrat Cabinet Ministers claim they have got in this coalition, because they would be able to say to the Conservative part of the coalition that they want change&#8212;that they want, for example, to increase</p>
	<p pid="a.533.4/2">the levy or to make sure that the huge bonuses being paid are taxed in a different way, or to bring in regulation. Let us be honest about this, however: most Liberal Democrat Ministers have not got sharp teeth&#8212;unless they have been to the dentist in the last few weeks. In the next few days we will see the beginning of the demise of the Liberal Democrats, and, as it were, the extraction of their teeth. It will certainly be interesting to see how sharp their teeth are after Thursday.</p>

	<p pid="a.534.9/1">That was too subtle for me.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.9/2">The important point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East when he talked about what we would do with this money. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington said, if the levy is seen as a tax, it is a pretty meagre tax on the banks, as it raises a small amount of money. However, the question is still about what we then do with the money. We could put it into rebuilding the economy by investing in housing and the regional economy, as has been said. The Government have allocated &#163;1.4 billion over the next three years to projects, which is two thirds less than the &#163;1.4 billion that the previous Labour Government invested in regional development agencies per year. In regions such as mine, the north-east, companies and</p>
	<p pid="a.534.9/3">individuals have to bid for that money. A banking levy could come in very useful for the investment that is being put forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.9/4">The problem with the Conservatives&#8212;the Liberal Democrats have gone along with this&#8212;is that they have this notion of &#8220;Public sector bad, private sector good.&#8221; What they have failed to realise in regions such as the north-east is that large-scale public expenditure cuts have a huge knock-on effect on the private sector. The unemployment level is already 10.2% in the north-east, whereas it was as low as 4% under the previous Labour Government. Durham university has done a study suggesting that if 45,000 to 50,000 public sector jobs in the north-east are cut, 20,000 jobs will actually go from the private sector. Regions such as mine had no responsibility for the mess, but those responsible for it could pay for some of that reinvestment and that could be done through the banking levy.</p>

	<p pid="a.535.0/1">The point that my hon. Friend is making about the north-east economy is appropriate. Clearly the job cuts in the public sector have not yet hit the employment market, yet the statistics for last month showed that although there had been a national decrease in unemployment of 17,000, it had increased by 11,000 in the north-east, which has a population of only 2.5 million. That is happening even before the job cuts hit the market, so the situation up there is very serious indeed.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.535.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="535"  time="020:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0003.htm#11050344000121">
	<p pid="a.535.1/1">It is very serious. What my hon. Friend describes will have an effect on the private sector and on what has already been seen in the banks. The Government have set great store by making sure that banks lend to small businesses. That was one of the things talked about at the general election by both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, but we have seen little evidence of it actually happening. As I said, it will be painful for many small businesses, particularly those in the north-east, when they see the amount of bonuses being paid to bankers and find that when they ask those same banks for investment they are told that either it is not available or that the terms on which it is available involve such horrendous rates of return. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40630" name="Ian Lavery">the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery)</phrase> has said, the same may also be true of personal finance, whereby certain individuals who would in the past have got access to credit will no longer be able to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.535.2/1">It is not just that banks are still not providing finance for small and medium-sized businesses. Under the Labour Government, we had support through the regional development agencies&#8212;Yorkshire Forward in Yorkshire&#8212;to help businesses with the Government loan guarantee schemes, and in my constituency that secured a very important investment for a packaging factory. The RDAs are now being done away with and so there is not that support from the Government to get the banks lending.</p>

	<p pid="a.535.3/1">That is right. My hon. Friend might have examples from his constituency&#8212;I certainly did&#8212;of the RDA underwriting small business loans for small companies when the banks, particularly Barclays and</p>
	<p pid="a.535.3/2">others, suddenly withdrew the finance. One company came to me that wanted a &#163;1 million overdraft for six months to get some investment and the RDA helpfully underwrote that to allow the investment to go forward and create in the region of 25 new jobs. That is the important point about the relationship between the banking system and the regions.</p>

	<p pid="a.536.0/1">Before my hon. Friend leaves this point, I would hate for the Government not to realise the impact that their refusal to have this levy or even a review of it is having not only in the north-east and the north but in the west midlands&#8212;the area from where the Government are apparently looking for the big revival in the private sector and manufacturing to come. Advantage West Midlands, the RDA, has had its funds cut by no less than 70% and schemes that were going to have the go-ahead, triggered either by a guarantee or seedcorn funding, will simply be stopped. The resurgence in manufacturing and of the economy as a whole will certainly not come from the west midlands, where the level of activity is below the national average and where the level of unemployment is above it.</p>

	<p pid="a.536.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. That small seedcorn funding made all the difference for small companies as they established themselves and grew. The problem we have in the north-east&#8212;I am not sure whether things are the same in my hon. Friend&#8217;s region&#8212;is the lack of confidence in the regional economy for the reasons mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead. The uncertainty about what will happen in the next few months as the public sector job cuts work their way through the economy means that there is no appetite to invest in small businesses. A few weeks ago, I was talking to someone from a small building company who relied as part of his turnover on school building contracts with the local council, which had suddenly been stopped, so the money is not available and people will have to be laid off. We have not yet seen the effects of such decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/2">If we add to that the fact that banks are not lending and are going to carry on in their own way, those involved with small businesses end up wondering why decent hard-working people like them who, in many cases, have built up businesses over many years are suddenly through no fault of their own having either to lay people off or to fold the businesses completely. These are family businesses which have been going for many years, andpeople see individuals getting bonuses that involve amounts of money of which they can only dream and which are equivalent to the turnover for their companies over two or three years, never mind one year.</p>

	<p pid="a.536.2/1">My hon. Friend has teased out a very important element of the amendment. In Northern Ireland, the public sector accounts for approximately 74% of all economic activity and for perfectly sound and understandable reasons the private sector has not been able to generate economic activity. I implore my hon. Friend, following on from his points, to take on board the reality of the situation: a reduction in expenditure could have a disastrous effect, especially in Northern Ireland.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.537.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="537"  time="020:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0003.htm#11050344000127">
	<p pid="a.537.0/1">I agree. I spoke in the last Budget debate about the effects of the public expenditure cuts on the north-east and our dependence on public sector jobs is very similar to, if not as high as, Northern Ireland&#8217;s. This is another example of the nonsense that is being put about that suggests that if those jobs and that money are taken out of the economy we can somehow replace them overnight with private sector jobs. Those jobs are not just there; they are linked directly to public expenditure. If we also have a situation in which banks are not lending and companies are fearful of borrowing because they fear what the economy will bring in future, one can understand how we can get into a downward spiral. As I have said before, I fear that we could have a recovery that bobs along the bottom, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington has described. We could end up with a two-speed Britain with a boom in the south-east economy&#8212;possibly again drunk on the excesses of the financial markets&#8212;while regions in the north-east, Northern Ireland and elsewhere struggle and do not get a look in when it comes to the growth that is expected on the back of the huge numbers of jobs that the Government say will be created.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/2">The bank levy is a missed opportunity and I do not think the amendment is at all radical. It is quite modest to ask for a review of the situation; the Government will have to review the levy sooner or later anyway. Political expediency will lead them to do so when it starts to dawn on people that, despite the rhetoric of the election, the Government are not being tough on bankers at all but are letting them off&#8212;and many people will ask why. I believe that in the past five years, since the Prime Minister became its leader, the Conservative party has accepted about 50% of its donations from the financial sector; that prompts questions about why it is not taking a tougher and more robust stance against the financial sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/3">Let me conclude with a few questions that I think the Minister needs to answer. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East raised the issue of the tax-free allowance of &#163;20 billion. The explanatory notes on clause 72 and schedule 19 state:</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/4">&#8220;Paragraph 6 sets out the steps to be followed in order to ascertain the amount of the bank levy. The steps show how the allowance of &#163;20 billion is to be applied and how the bank levy charge is calculated for long and short chargeable periods. Part 6 of the Schedule provides details of how to identify the entity responsible for payment of the bank levy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/5">I have asked why the figure is &#163;20 billion and not &#163;5 billion, &#163;10 billion or &#163;50 billion? <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Hon. Members say &#8220;Higher!&#8221; but we have not heard any explanation why &#163;20 billion was the figure arrived at. If we are not only to maximise the amount of money we get from the banking levy but be able to justify to our constituents how fair the measures are, we must be able to explain how that figure was arrived at.</p>

	<p pid="a.537.1/1">Does my hon. Friend know why the Government set &#163;2.5 billion as the absolute limit for the amount they wanted to raise from banks and made everything fit with that? Does it not all come down to the fact that the Government have struck an awful deal with the banks? They have limited so much and got Merlin in return&#8212;and perhaps some other things to which my hon. Friend has referred but which I shall not go into now. They have tied themselves in knots, complications and contortions to deliver this deal</p>
	<p pid="a.537.1/2">and the banks have simply walked away from Merlin saying, &#8220;Thank you, very much.&#8221; Is not that the problem?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.538.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="538"  time="020:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0003.htm#11050344000129">
	<p pid="a.538.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a clear point. I do not know which wag in the Treasury came up with the nickname Merlin for this project. Having dealt with the Treasury and Treasury Ministers I have never thought of them as having a sense of humour, but whoever came up with that name clearly had one. Again, my hon. Friend makes a good point. There is no explanation for the figure of &#163;20 billion other than the yield that it is intended to produce. The Minister needs to provide the evidential basis for the &#163;2.6 billion yield. If we levy, for example, &#163;2.7 billion, &#163;2.8 billion or &#163;2.93 billion, at what point do the Barclays bankers pack their bags and move to Zurich? Would the entire system of bankers' bonuses fall apart if the figure were more than &#163;2.6 billion?</p>
	<p pid="a.538.0/2">I have raised the issue already, and I accept that international finance is a global business and can move, but in terms of bonuses, bankers are clearly not bothered about the &#163;2.6 billion figure. May we see the evidential basis on which the figure was arrived at? What would be the effect if it were a little higher or lower than &#163;2.6 billion? It is important that we know that.</p>

	<p pid="a.538.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. The Government would be helpful to us if they clarified the figure that they think would be the tipping point. Would it be &#163;3 billion, &#163;4 billion or &#163;5 billion? We want the banks to be profitable and to lend money to our constituents, but at what point would they move overseas? The Government have so far failed to tell us.</p>

	<p pid="a.538.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. That is the acid test. The Government must explain why they set the figure. I am happy to listen to the evidence&#8212;even the evidence that the hon. Member for Bradford East could come up with. I do not think we are anywhere near the tipping point at which the entire banking system crashes, especially as Barclays and others are paying large bonuses. If we had a review and analysis, we could see how the figure was arrived at. Unfortunately, we are in the dark about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.538.2/2">A further point is the progress that the Chancellor has made on tax activities. If we are to remain competitive internationally, is there an international tipping point across Europe in respect of bank levies and caps on bonuses?</p>
	<p pid="a.538.2/3">The hon. Member for Bradford East seems to be dreaming if he thinks he will ever find himself in the Front-Bench team of the Liberal party or the coalition, but it is nice to see him sitting on the Government Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="a.538.2/4">Is work being done internationally to look at what other countries are doing? We need to study that in detail to see whether &#163;3.5 billion would be too much. We need to achieve agreement across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.538.2/5">The subject of Project Merlin has been raised. What leverage does the Treasury have over lending to SMEs? To what extent will the cost of the levy be passed on to customers of the commercial or private sector&#8212;in other words, to all of us who use banks? Will it become more difficult for SMEs to borrow money if bank charges are passed on? To explain Project Merlin, much</p>
	<p pid="a.538.2/6">more needs to be put forward. A review would enable us to look in detail not just at the bank levy, because we must remember that the amendment also relates to other areas of banking tax. That would also lead to the public having a lot more confidence in politicians actually following through on their rhetoric about being tough on bankers.</p>
	<p pid="a.538.2/7">In conclusion, this is a missed opportunity. If we followed through on the rhetoric and showed that we were not only fair but tough on the banks, we would be able to stand in front of our constituents and say that we had stood up on their behalf to those responsible for the crisis that hit this country, which our constituents are all paying for today through the austerity affecting them, and that the mess we got into as a result of the crisis a few years ago will not be repeated. If they do not do that, the Government will have to review and change, because otherwise the electorate will do it for them. The Government will not be able to stand up and say that somehow they have been tough, that they have followed through on the rhetoric and, more importantly, that they have made sure that such a crisis will never happen again.</p>

	<p pid="a.539.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>, whose eye for forensic detail and lucidity in these matters is second to none. He could not be described as brief, and on this occasion I intend to be a bit briefer. The amendment seeks a review of this proposal because, at its heart, this is about equity and fairness. You, Dr McCrea, understand better than anyone what fairness and equity mean.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/2">There has been much talk about small business men. A small business man came to see me a month ago about the lack of finance from Barclays bank. It is true to say that even though we all have stories of small businesses that are unable to get loans, many constituents come and ask Members specifically not to contact their banks, because they are scared, frankly, that they will be cut loose and that the intervention of a Member of Parliament could make things worse. The fact that across the Chamber no party is suggesting that we have got back to a situation in which there is access to loans indicates that industry and small businesses in this country are in a very serious way.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/3">That brings me to the other deceit, or conceit, that lies at the heart of what has been suggested. Much has been made of the manufacturing sector. Yes, it is hugely important, but it employs 4 million people or thereabouts, whereas 23 million are employed by the service sector, which is a depressed sector. That is perhaps why, alongside the public sector cuts we are now seeing, unemployment in Tottenham is the highest in London. The levy, set at the right amount and consistently reviewed, could have done something to ameliorate that.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/4">It is about fairness and equity, and it is also about what the Government&#8217;s story on growth really is. Some of what we are hearing on how they see the levy and the box into which they want to put it, with the constraints of &#163;2.5 billion only, can only mitigate the growth that we want to see in our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/5">The single mums who came to see me a few weeks ago because the after-school activity club is being cut for their young children and they are wondering how they are going to get back from work by half-past 3 to pick them up need to feel that bankers, too, are making a contribution. The elderly suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s in one of my local residential homes, against a backdrop of three being closed because the local authority is being squeezed, need to feel and want to believe, because of the age they have reached and the contribution they have made to this country, having paid into the system, that the banking sector is also making a contribution that is fair. The many public sector workers who received their payslip for the last time just a few days ago also want to believe that bankers are making their contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/6">They cannot understand why, despite the fact that growth in our economy is so sluggish, at barely 2% over the most recent period, City workers are taking home an increase of 7% on average. Why have 231 workers at Barclays bank managed to receive bonuses of &#163;554 million between them? How is that possible, when the dividend for those who have shares in that bank was just over &#163;600 million? That is a bonus culture that has not been checked, that has not been sorted out, and that feels brutally unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/7">When I was canvassing in Slough at the most recent general election, a 90-year-old said to me, &#8220;Love, you know what it is? The poorer you are, the more you give in this country.&#8221; That is how it feels at this point, when we have to come back to a subject on which really we ought to agree. We know that the banking sector led to this depressed economy, so why should it be let off the hook at this time?</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/8">When my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham asked, &#8220;Where did we get this &#163;20 billion from?&#8221;, I asked the Minister to begin his contribution with the answer. Where did that &#163;20 billion allowance come from? It is a staggering amount of money to slot in at the last minute so that the figure drops beneath the &#163;3.9 billion mark which the industry itself originally predicted. Where did that money come from, and how did we secure the millions in tax relief for that sector? We owe a bigger contribution from the banking sector to the young people of this country, one in five of whom is currently unemployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/9">This Government have led us to a situation in which the new arrangements for funding higher education are between the student solely and the university. They have taken the state entirely out of the picture, cutting teaching funding by 80% and abandoning arts and the humanities and any contribution to them. Effectively, with a proper banking levy they could have said that the state could stay involved. Industry, the other sector that benefits, could have made a contribution, too, but the banking sector is certainly somewhere where we could have started. The Government, however, turned their face against that, saying, &#8220;No, we&#8217;ll land the debt on our young people and let the very people who have led to their unemployment off the hook.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/10">I want to understand why the Minister has made that decision, and how we will get back to growth, given that young people are to be dealt with in that way.</p>

	<p pid="a.540.0/1">My right hon. Friend asks why. Is it not clear why? This is a Government of millionaires and toffs, and they are in the pocket of the banksters. That is what it is all about.</p>

	<p pid="a.541.0/1">My hon. Friend is exactly right.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/2">The Government&#8217;s rhetoric prior to the general election about what they would do with the bankers, and about recklessness and bankers paying their dues, led some to believe that at least we could agree that bankers were responsible for the situation and that they should make a contribution&#8212;and a serious one at that, which we should constantly keep under review for obvious and clear reasons. As my hon. Friend the shadow Minister said, the amendment is incredibly tame: it simply asks for a review and says to the Minister, &#8220;Can you look at this again?&#8221; It seems reasonable to ask him to do so, given that the state of our economy could change between now and Christmas, but he has said no even to that. As other Members have suggested, that can only be because of the slightly peculiar relationship between the Conservatives and the many friends in the sector who bankrolled them. That is unfair, and it is not right, and the public know it. I suspect that on Thursday we will see that they have sensed this injustice in the balance of how we should deal with the difficulties that we face.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/3">It is not the first time that we have had a debate in this House about how we deal with an economically depressed situation. There are those who believe that we should invest&#8212;in fact, reinvest. That is a Keynesian approach to growth from the same party that did not back away after the second world war, when this country was in rubble, but invested in the NHS. Then there is the party that says we should cut, and the cuts fall hardest on the poorest while those who can afford to make a bigger contribution get let off. Yes, there is a balanced argument as to why one would support a reduction in corporation tax: in order to see growth in the economy. However, when people set that tax reduction against this levy, which is minuscule relative to the huge sector that has brought us to this point, and then against the &#163;20 billion tax relief that has come out of nowhere, of course they get suspicious. I hope that the Minister will explain why this proposal is fair to a young person who is one of the one in five who are unemployed, to someone who is experiencing their local authority cutting services that they desperately rely on, or to a public sector worker who has just received their last payslip because they have lost their job. Will he also explain how it gets us back to growth? If he is to let off this sector of all sectors, how are we to develop that growth strategy and generate the funds for the investment that we need to stimulate recovery?</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/4">The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that we must move from retribution to recovery. That is an interesting play on words. What most Labour Members want is not retribution but reciprocity&#8212;a bit of give and take, and something that is fair and honourable. I have to say to the Minister that this proposal is deeply dishonourable, unfair and wrong, and he should come to the Dispatch Box and explain why the simplest of reviews is not possible on this occasion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.541.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="541"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0003.htm#1105047000063">
	<p pid="a.541.1/1">I congratulate my next-door neighbour and right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40615" name="David Lammy">the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)</phrase> on a very competent speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/2">It will not come as a surprise to those in the Chamber that I support the amendment. I support it primarily because there is so much public interest in and concern</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/3">about bankers&#8217; bonuses and the contribution being made by bankers when we are all supposed to be pulling our weight. I also support it for the reason given by the shadow Minister: a peculiarity of our system is that we cannot amend upwards any proposal in the Finance Bill, and the amendment offers an alternative way to look critically at the levy by proposing a review, which is not unreasonable. By December, we should have some idea of how it is working.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/4">The most important feature of the amendment, as discussed earlier, is that is asks for a report to be published that can be debated by this House. Because of the importance of the issues involved, that is critical. The report will include an account of how the rate and the threshold were decided. As we have watched the measure&#8217;s development over the past few months, we have started to have a sneaking suspicion that Ministers decided what amount of tax should be paid by the banks and then worked back to what the threshold and the rate should be. I will come back to that point later.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/5">Much has been said by Opposition Members about the measure&#8217;s adequacy. It is right to say that it will not raise as much as the bank bonus tax did and it is felt widely, within the House and outside, that the levy does not reflect the contribution that bankers ought to make. That relates to new subsection (2)(c) in the amendment. I will come back to bankers&#8217; bonuses, because they have an important implication for the contribution that bankers should make.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/6">In what the Government propose, we are being asked to agree to a levy on UK banks and building societies and on the UK operations of foreign banks. It is estimated that it will affect between 30 and 40 institutions, covering all the largest financial services institutions in the City of London and throughout the country. That proposal seems reasonable, but it is important that it is reviewed to see whether it is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/7">The tax will be levied on what the Chancellor termed the wholesale funding of banks, which is the liabilities and equity minus a number of items that are considered safe, such as tier 1 capital and insured retail deposits. I think that we are being asked to agree that that will incentivise the use of prudent balance sheets, rather than risky balance sheets. Of course, the wholesale funding that the Chancellor talked about was a major cause of the difficulties in the credit crunch. We all remember the collateralised debt obligations and the exotic funding regimes, although I do not think that any of the major institutions are into any of that now. The proposal, which mirrors the proposal that was discussed internationally, is intended to incentivise our banks to hold safer liabilities than they held before.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/8">Many Opposition Members have commented on the threshold of the tax, which has been set at &#163;20 billion. I hope that the Minister will respond to the concern that that figure is far too high. The rate has been a moveable feast, and there have been many different rates and proposals. As was mentioned earlier, the Chancellor got up one morning&#8212;it just happened to be the day of Treasury questions&#8212;and announced another change. Changes have also been announced presumably because of corporation tax, and there has been concern that the rate may have been raised as a result of the failures of Project Merlin, which I will talk about later. We have had many different threshold rates, and I ask the Minister to clarify how we reached all those rates, where we are</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/9">now and how much money the levy will raise. It is suggested that it will raise between &#163;2.5 billion and &#163;2.8 billion, which, as other Opposition Members have said, seems a very low figure in the present situation. I hope that he will respond to that concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/10">What is the levy meant to achieve? Supposedly, it deals with a number of matters. First, numerous speakers have mentioned the implicit public subsidy that we provide to banks. The Bank of England has done some work and suggests that there is a &#163;100 billion subsidy; others have suggested lower figures, but there is consensus that the figure is very substantial. If the bank levy will raise only one twentieth or one fortieth of that sum, that puts the matter in context.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/11">To pick up on a point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> made, the bank subsidies make life for new entrants to the marketplace&#8212;they are called challenger banks&#8212;very much more difficult, as they do not have any of those subsidies, reflecting the idea of banks being too important to fail. That notion should be the crux of our discussion about the financial services sector, because it raises the question of moral hazard: will banks that are too important to fail take riskier decisions, as happened in the lead-up to the credit crunch? I would like the Minister to explain how those issues relate to the levy. We understand that it will provide only part of the contribution that has to be made, but what contribution will that be?</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/12">I mentioned banks being incentivised to hold less risky liabilities. The reason for that is clear: if things go wrong, it is not just the financial services sector that is affected. Unlike other industries, in which problems affect other companies in the same industry, if the financial services sector hits difficulties, the whole economy is hit, as we found out to our great cost in 2007. It is critical that we reduce the possibility of that contagion happening in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/13">We must deal with a number of issues peculiar to our financial services sector. Many believe that too much is concentrated in four or five very large banks and that as a result there is not sufficient competition. I will not go into the details of the Banking Commission&#8217;s report or the most recent Treasury Committee report, but those who have read them will know that both have strongly suggested that consumers do not have a great deal of choice in our banking system, that the banks are too concentrated and that it is very difficult for new banking companies to come into being. There is not sufficient competition and, by common consent, the cost is that banks make excessive profits. The levy should tax those profits. I would like the Minister to say whether he believes it will do that sufficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/14">To return to a point that I made a few moments ago, in the light of the subsidy given to the banks&#8212;&#163;50 billion is one suggestion, &#163;60 billion is another and the Bank of England says it is &#163;100 billion&#8212;a levy of &#163;2.5 billion, which is between a twentieth and a fortieth of that subsidy, does not seem to address the problem that we face. Why does the Minister believe that the measure answers the concern about the financial services sector?</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/15">I could be more generous and suggest that the Government are moving in the right direction. After all, all the changes in the rate of the banking levy have been increases&#8212;from 0.07%, to 0.075%, and for longer held</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/16">assets, from 0.04% to 0.05%. I think I got those right, but I would be unsurprised if someone stood up and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re wrong. It&#8217;s changed,&#8221; or if I woke up tomorrow to find that the Chancellor had re-announced the rate. Those changes have raised the take from the levy by &#163;200 million or &#163;300 billion, so that &#163;2.5 billion will be raised in the first year. However, as I said at the start of my speech, given how the &#163;20 billion threshold was constructed and the rate changes, we cannot escape the conclusion that the Government have set the overall amount that they wish to take and then gone back to work out the threshold and the rate. I should like the Minister to explain why that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/17">Of course, critically, at &#163;2.5 billion or &#163;2.8 billion, the levy does not raise as much as the bank bonus tax, so the suggestion&#8212;I put it no stronger than that&#8212;is that the banks are getting off lightly. The corporation tax reduction&#8212;corporation tax seems to have been constructed because the banks do not invest a great deal but have high turnover&#8212;and other changes could have been ideally designed for the banks. There is therefore a suspicion that banks are doing really rather well out of this year&#8217;s Budget. If that is not so, I should like the Minister to tell us why not.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/18">There are many good reasons why the Minister should have been more draconian in introducing the levy. After all, as has been said by many hon. Members, when the coalition parties were in opposition, they told us that negotiations between the Government and the banking industry on proposals such as Project Merlin would produce certain results; on bonuses, however, the Government got absolutely nowhere. Statements were made about constructive negotiations, so it was embarrassing to find bankers telling us that there was no change.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/19">Of course, still more critically, we were told that small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy&#8212;that mainly small businesses in the private sector would make a reality of the Government&#8217;s so-called strategy of getting the private sector to take up the slack created in the public sector. If they are to achieve that, they need to grow.</p>

	<p pid="a.544.0/1">May I draw my hon. Friend back to the use of the bank bonus tax to promote growth? We heard last week that the construction industry was struggling to come out of the recession. Of course, applying the bonus tax and giving it to the construction to, for example, build affordable homes, which are very much needed in my constituency and many others, would have helped to stimulate the economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.544.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. Clearly, the sector of the economy that has lost out the most is construction. If the Government intend to contribute only the homes bonus and changes to the planning regulations to the construction industry&#8212;they are creating uncertainty up and down the country&#8212;I foresee a bleak future for the construction sector in the next two to three years. I urge the Government to consider that carefully. They say they have a growth strategy but they do not, and we are now suggesting one. It would repay them to listen to what people are saying and to address the inadequacies of their response, particularly in the construction sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.1/2">I was speaking about lending to SMEs. The failure of Project Merlin is risible, and it is a sad reflection that all the Government could get from the banking industry was a gross figure of an additional &#163;10 billion of lending. If, as someone said earlier, figures are to be released to show how things are developing and to ensure transparency, I suspect they will show that the banks are not coming up to par. However, I hope I am wrong, so I ask the Minister to reassure me on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.1/3">The cut in corporation tax is another reason why the Government should have been firmer in how they introduced the bank bonus tax. I understand that the cut is worth &#163;100 million a year. If there are now to be two reductions in corporation tax&#8212;the Budget includes a further 1% reduction&#8212;the cut will be worth &#163;200 million, which seems to me a good reason why the Government should have been tougher. They are giving back in corporation tax, so they should have been tougher on the bank bonus tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.1/4">There is confusion in the Government about what they are suggesting the financial services sector ought to do. On the one hand, we are asking banks to lend more, and on the other, we are asking them to hold more capital and, into the bargain, to pay more tax, as the right hon. Member for Wokingham said. That is not a coherent policy. Banks have to lend to keep the economy going, but they also need to increase their capital. One of the major advantages of the bank bonus tax was that it incentivised the retention of profits, which would have helped to build up banks&#8217; capital base.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.1/5">The real failure of tonight&#8217;s proposal, however, is that it does not live up to the Chancellor&#8217;s own expressed reason for its introduction. When pressed on the matter, he said that equity was the reason. He had to prove to the public that he was looking to get from the banks their contribution to the austerity measures that had to be introduced as a result of the banking sector&#8217;s failures. In my view and that of other Opposition Members, however, he clearly has not done that. Although we look forward to him agreeing to the review that will tell us whether he has done it, perhaps the Ministers could gives us some reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.1/6">That brings me to the bank bonus tax. I would like to refer to an earlier intervention. If, as is likely, we pass the bank levy in its present form, despite the amendment, we simply will not raise enough money to do all the things the economy needs if it is not to bump along the bottom, as someone characterised it earlier. If we are not to bump along the bottom for the next few years, we need to do something. I commend the work done on the bank bonus tax and how it would have been used. That was a tax of 50% only on bonuses over &#163;25,000, so it did not tax the smaller end of the bank bonus market. The particular merit of the bank bonus tax was that the bank paid, not the employee.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.1/7">I mentioned earlier that the bank bonus tax raised &#163;3.5 billion. Why did we introduce it? First, it should be noted that it had widespread support among the public, who felt that we were directly addressing bonuses and the bonus culture. Taxpayers kept saying, &#8220;Why have you guaranteed the banking sector and not any other part of the economy?&#8221; We in this House know why that was, but they needed a justification for it. One justification for that implicit guarantee was that we wanted to rescue</p>
	<p pid="a.544.1/8">the economy. We did not give that guarantee so that we could enrich bankers a year later. That was not the idea. We were doing everything we could to reflect public concern, as well as ensuring that the system was stable and that bankers paid their fair whack.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.1/9">However, the bonus tax was described by the bankers&#8212;these are direct quotations&#8212;as &#8220;populist&#8221;, &#8220;political&#8221; and, believe it or not, &#8220;penal&#8221;. There were also threats to leave the country. We have been looking out for additional electoral registrations in Zurich, Paris and New York, and although there is a flow backwards and forwards, to and from those countries, the reality is that the bankers did not leave. They did not leave because the banking industry recognised that we made the correct and appropriate response, which I would commend to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.1/10">Finally&#8212;this comes back to the earlier intervention&#8212;let us look at what the Government have brought forward in what they call their growth zones. Enterprise zones? I mean, come on! As for the idea that they are an appropriate growth strategy, we need only look back at the experience of previous enterprise zones to know that creating jobs under such a regime is prohibitively expensive. The national insurance holiday is another centrepiece of what the Government said they wanted to do. However, although they will not release any concrete figures, it was already clear from an article in the <i>Financial Times </i>in January that, far from 400,000 businesses being helped over the four or five years of the policy, at that time only 1,500 had been helped.</p>

	<p pid="a.546.0/1">My hon. Friend mentions the national insurance holiday for new businesses, but it discriminates against London and Londoners. Some of the poorest people in the poorest communities in the poorest boroughs in this country are in London, as are some of the areas with the highest unemployment, yet the national insurance holiday does not cover London, which he, as a London Member, knows as well as I do.</p>

	<p pid="a.546.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He is correct. When that legislation was passed, we argued that many parts of London had suffered tremendously from the credit crunch and were as deserving as&#8212;if not more deserving than&#8212;other parts of the country. However, that argument was not listened to. Perhaps the policy would be a little more successful if the Government had included London, along with all the other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.1/2">The policy has clearly not been a success. The Government&#8217;s growth strategy is not producing growth. I would therefore like to suggest an alternative growth strategy, the merit of which is that it was beginning to bear fruit at the time of the general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.1/3">I will pick out just a few areas at which the Government need to look carefully, while searching their conscience and trying to construct a positive growth strategy and address these concerns. First, youth unemployment is just about topping 1 million. One in five of our young people aged 16 to 24 are unemployed, and a focus on getting young people back into work, as we were trying to do before the general election, would pay dividends. We shall lose a whole generation if we do not address the youth unemployment problem, and that should be a priority for the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.547.0/1">The whole House will agree with my hon. Friend that youth unemployment is the single biggest threat on the unemployment front at the moment, at 20% and rising. Was not the cancellation of the future jobs fund a short-sighted, perverse reaction by the Government that could well result in a repeat of what happened in the 1980s&#8212;a whole generation being lost to the working population because of the rise in youth unemployment?</p>

	<p pid="a.547.1/1">Yes, the future jobs fund was the very vehicle to provide a job, training or relevant work experience so that our kids did not have to sit on the sidelines without a future, getting demoralised and not being in a position to take up the job opportunities that will be available when the economy turns round. It is a dereliction of duty on the part of the Government not to address that issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.547.2/1">My hon. Friend is giving a cogent and coherent analysis of the amendment before us.

	<p pid="a.547.3/1">Absolutely. The merit of the amendment is that it would give Parliament, and particularly the Government, the opportunity to review the operation of the levy, as well as providing the banking sector with other opportunities to make a contribution to sorting out some of the deep-seated economic problems in our country. I hope that the Liberal Democrat part of the coalition will be sympathetic to our arguments and speak up where it matters, to try to get the Government to recognise that there is an alternative that would be good for the economy and good for our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.3/2">A second issue is house construction. In my local authority area we have the fourth worst housing stress in the country. Things are difficult, and they are going to get significantly worse. I mentioned earlier the Government&#8217;s incoherent construction policy, with its homes bonus that is not a bonus, and its planning system that is so riddled with inconsistency and lack of certainty that major construction is now off the agenda. It is a system that allows local considerations to dominate and outweigh much-needed construction in different parts of the country. I can see only a bleak future for public and private housing construction&#8212;but our proposal provides one small, modest way in which the Government could improve the situation.</p>

Obviously, that is a difficult business to be in with the construction sector in its present state.</p>

	<p pid="a.548.1/1">I bow to your advice, Mr Hoyle. I will conclude my remarks about the lack of a growth strategy by saying that as an optimist, I believe that it is never too late. I hope the Government will think carefully and recognise that the growth strategy they produced on paper simply does not respond to the real needs of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.548.1/2">I finish where I started, by commending the amendment to the Government. It poses no threat to them; it simply seeks to review the bank levy system that they are introducing. They will know, because they have spent a great deal of time on this, just how important the public think the role of the banks in getting our economy sorted out is. After all, it is widely perceived that the banks were the main cause of the problem in the first place, so people are looking to them to help our economy in a meaningful way. For the reasons that I have stated, the amendment will address some of those issues and provide an opportunity to examine how the levy is working in December. I hope that it will provide us with an opportunity to straighten out and ensure that the levy really addresses the needs of our country.</p>

	<p pid="a.548.2/1">Amendment 9 seeks to require a report into the effectiveness of the new bank levy, which is introduced in clause 72. I will come to the components of the amendment shortly, but I think it would help hon. Members if I first explained the role and features of the levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/2">The levy is a new tax that will ensure that the banks fairly contribute to the Exchequer, while encouraging them to move to less risky forms of funding. This levy forms part of the Government&#8217;s far-reaching plans for banking reform. We have already announced an overhaul of financial regulation, marking a break from the light-touch regime championed by the shadow Chancellor when he was the City Minister. We have created an Independent Commission on Banking, which published its interim report last month and is due to publish its final report in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/3">When Labour Members were in government, they refused to debate the structure of the banking sector. They were afraid of banking reform and they were afraid to understand and tackle the lessons from the financial crisis. This debate would have been better if one of them had had the courage to accept the failures of the previous Government on the regulation of the banking sector. Not one of them did so. I think this whole debate is a cover for their bluster. When we proposed in March last year to introduce a bank levy, on a unilateral basis if necessary, Labour Members were against it. The then Chancellor was against it and the present leader of the Labour party, who wrote the Labour manifesto, was against it, too. What we have</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/4">heard today is a whole load of bluster, rhetoric and empty words about how we must tax the banking sector properly when Labour Members lacked the courage to champion these moves when they were in government. We have taken the lead on the issue, when they would have hung back and waited for international consensus and agreement. We have taken the lead, as I say, and France and Germany have joined us in announcing levies. Others have since followed, including Hungary, Austria and Portugal.</p>

	<p pid="a.549.4/1">Subsection (2)(a) of the amendment requires a report on</p>
	<p pid="a.549.4/2">&#8220;the Government&#8217;s analysis behind the rate and threshold chosen for the bank levy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.4/3">It might help Opposition Members if I explained how we designed the levy, and why we set the rate and threshold as we did. The levy is intended to ensure that the banking sector makes a fair and substantial contribution, reflecting the risks that it poses to the financial system and the wider economy. It is intended to encourage banks to move away from risky funding models, and complements the wider regulatory agenda to improve standards and enhance financial stability. During the crisis, it became clear that some banks had become over-reliant on short-term funding for long-term lending. When financial markets seized up, those banks were exposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.4/4">I must emphasise that the levy is based on the liabilities of a bank, not on its assets. It is based on the bank&#8217;s deposits, its share capital and loans made to it, not on loans made by it. It applies to the global balance sheets of UK banks, building societies and banking and building society groups, and to the UK operations of banks from other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.4/5">In determining the scope of the levy, we concluded that foreign banks operating in the UK also posed potential risks to the UK financial system and the wider economy, whether they operated as branches or as subsidiaries. It therefore follows that they should contribute on the same basis, and branches and subsidiaries of foreign banking groups are included to ensure that they</p>
	<p pid="a.549.4/6">cannot avoid the levy by group restructuring. That will ensure the provision of a level playing field for all banks operating in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.4/7">The levy will be paid by between 30 and 40 building societies and banking groups, and we have made it clear that we expect it to yield about &#163;2.5 billion of revenues each year in its steady state. That appropriate contribution balances fairness with competitiveness, and the rates of the levy were chosen to allow it. We initially announced that a reduced rate would apply for 2011, recognising the uncertain market conditions prevailing at the time, but we no longer consider that to be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.4/8">In December the Bank of England noted that the near-term outlook and resilience of the UK banking sector had improved. Markets also now have greater certainty about the timing and direction of regulatory change, with the Basel III regulatory reforms being introduced in 2013 and transition periods being extended to 2015. We therefore decided that from <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March</phrase> this year, the full rate of the levy should be introduced for 2011. The levy will now yield &#163;2.5 billion in that year. The steady state target yield was set out last year, when we also announced our intention to make significant cuts in the main rate of corporation tax.</p>

	<p pid="a.550.1/1">I am going to continue my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.1/2">We were clear at that time, as we are now, that the bank levy yield far outweighs the benefits that banks receive from the corporation tax change. Other sectors will benefit from the reduction in corporation tax, but the banks will not benefit because of the levy. In the March Budget, the Chancellor went further in helping our economy to grow, and announced an additional 1p reduction in the main rate of corporation tax. At the same time, to offset the benefits to banks from that further cut and maintain the same incentives for them to move to less risky funding, we announced that the rate of the levy would increase from <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase>, to 0.078%.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.1/3">The threshold has prompted some discussion. The initial announcement on the bank levy last year proposed that it would include a threshold of &#163;20 billion. However, as part of the subsequent consultation exercise, we explicitly sought views on whether it would be preferable to make it an allowance rather than an all-or-nothing threshold. A threshold would provide a cliff edge that banks would avoid by restructuring. Respondents to the consultation made that clear to us, and even suggested that banks, or indeed building societies, might avoid growing their UK operations to avoid the threshold and to avoid paying the levy. We accepted that argument, and have therefore decided that there should be an allowance on the first &#163;20 billion of liabilities liable for the levy. That means that smaller banks, building societies and foreign banks with a small UK presence&#8212;that is, those whose liabilities are less than the &#163;20 billion allowance&#8212;will not pay the levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.1/4">The allowance will ensure that the levy is proportionate to the risks inherent in banking businesses of different sizes. It balances the probability that the failure of a bank could pose a systemic risk against the relative burden imposed in order to gather additional revenue at the margin. While size is not the sole factor in determining risk to the system, it is an important one. Increasing the</p>
	<p pid="a.550.1/5">allowance would risk excluding banks or building societies that are highly likely to pose a systemic risk if they fail. Similarly, setting the allowance at a lower level&#8212;which Opposition Members seem very keen on doing&#8212;would risk imposing an unnecessarily high burden on institutions that do not pose a systemic risk to the UK economy in the way that larger banking institutions do. These details, along with many others, have already been made public, and I am sure that the Opposition Members who tabled the amendment are aware of the steps the Government have taken to explain the basis of the decisions. All tax measures now have a tax information and impact note, which sets out clear information relating to the measure and its impact, and which has provided a significant amount of analysis on the levy so far. It is clear that there is no need for a report to provide an analysis of the rates and threshold of the bank levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.1/6">Let me turn to the second element of the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.551.5/1">I think that is the best suggestion the right hon. Gentleman has so far made in this debate. I shall send a copy of my speech to all hon. Members who are interested in it, so they can then go home.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.5/2">The levy is a permanent tax, and is part of our wider package of far-reaching reforms. It is designed to be consistent with global regulatory practices, drawing on proposals from the International Monetary Fund and reflecting emerging proposals from the Basel committee. Excessive risk taking in the financial sector was a significant contributory factor in the recent financial crisis. As I said earlier, the levy is intended to encourage banks to move away from riskier funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.5/3">The levy should not be seen in isolation from other reforms to the banking system. Domestic, European and international banking reforms will change the landscape of banking. For example, Basel III will lead to higher capital levels, and its liquidity reforms will change the funding profiles of banks. There is a vigorous debate within the EU and the G20 about whether the holders of bank debt should be required to contribute to the recovery or resolution of banks, for example through</p>
	<p pid="a.551.5/4">the conversion of debt to equity. As I said earlier, we have established an independent commission on banking to consider structural and related non-structural reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.5/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" name="Andrew Love">The hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr Love)</phrase> raised issues to do with the implicit guarantee, to make sure the right reforms are in place so banks are not dependent on the guarantee from the taxpayer. We have tackled that issue, whereas when his party was in government, it failed to do so. I wish he would give us some credit for the action we have taken to reform the regulation of the banking system during the year in which this Government have been in office.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.5/6">The final element of the report calls for information on the total tax revenues expected from banks in each year to 2016-17. We have been clear that we expect the levy to raise about &#163;2.5 billion each year. We have also taken other steps to ensure that banks pay their fair share. The previous Government introduced the code of practice on taxation for banks, but they utterly failed to get banks to sign up to it. They talk tough now, but they failed when in government; only four of our leading 15 banks actually signed up to that code of practice when they were in office. By the end of November, however, all the top banks had signed up to the code, and by March 2011 some 200 banks had adopted it. We therefore need take no lessons from the Labour party about getting the banks to sign up to codes.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.5/7">We are very clear that banks should make a contribution reflecting the risks they pose to the UK financial system and wider economy. While amendment 9 calls for a report, this Government are delivering action. We have already set out the reason for the rates chosen and the decision to set an allowance at &#163;20 billion. We have been clear on how the bank levy fits with and complements our wider reform package and we have been clear that we expect revenues from banks to grow as the economy recovers. We have also secured agreement from the top banks on the tax revenues they expect to pay over the spending review period. We are raising more in this levy than the previous Government raised through their one-off bank payroll tax. Labour Members refused to introduce a bank levy when they were in government. We backed it where they have failed to act and I ask hon. Members to support the clause.</p>

	<p pid="a.552.3/1">Thank you, Mr Hoyle. The Chief Whip really needs to take a breath and perhaps calm down for a moment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I did not quite put it in the way that the Prime Minister might.</p>
	<p pid="a.552.3/2">The Financial Secretary to the Treasury usually does act honourably by trying to respond to the debate, and probably he secretly would have done so today. Our debate was wide ranging and we covered a number of specific points on the detailed design of the bank levy, with which he entirely refused to engage. He refused to</p>
	<p pid="a.552.3/3">give way in this Committee stage of the Finance Bill, which shows the Government&#8217;s thinly veiled contempt for the parliamentary process. No debate, no scrutiny and no contributions came from those on the Government Benches, other than the speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase>. They have accepted absolutely no challenge and no scrutiny. They have put their heads down and ploughed on&#8212;the Lansley strategy of policy making in action.</p>
	<p pid="a.552.3/4">The Financial Secretary gave no explanation of why the Government set the banking levy at this puny &#163;2.6 billion or why they have given a very generous tax-free allowance of &#163;20 billion to the banks. Their original design, as set out in June, could have netted &#163;3.9 billion, but when the banks complained the figure went back down to &#163;2.6 billion. He says that we should not criticise the levy for being set at such a low rate because the French levy will raise less, but of course it will because the French banking sector is smaller. The fact is that our banking levy is being set at a third of the rate that the French are pursuing. He did not answer any questions on the netting of derivatives, the double taxation treaties or what would happen in terms of accounting practice. He certainly did not address the outrage in the country, never mind in the House, about the continuing appalling abuse of bonuses in the banking system. That is an obscene ongoing process and although bonuses might reduce slightly in one year, that is offset by the increase in the salaries that those bankers are enjoying. He did not even address the new loophole he is introducing in the Bill so that those enjoying deferred bonuses will now be able to pay the tax rates in future years, thus perhaps avoiding the 50% income tax rate when eventually the Government scale back from that.</p>

	<p pid="a.553.1/1">Astonishingly, the Financial Secretary, having had his coat tugged by the Government Chief Whip, did not even address many of these points at all. As I say, the right hon. Member for Wokingham made his points about the role of the state-owned banks, how they ought to behave and how perhaps they would change their behaviour in a different market position.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40630" name="Ian Lavery">the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery)</phrase> made an important point about the comparison between those who enjoy exceptionally high bonuses and ordinary working people who, I think he said, might take 125,000 years on average to earn the bonuses that some bankers earn in one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase> said that the Government have no mandate for their approach, and that is absolutely true.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.1/4">My hon. Friends the Members for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy), for Brent North (Barry Gardiner) and for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) also made important points about the feeble nature of the design of this element of bank taxation.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" name="Andrew Love">the Member for Edmonton (Mr Love)</phrase> made, I think, the most important point of all: our amendment is no threat to the Government. We are simply asking for a review and a report on the levels of bank taxation and the banking levy. The Government are introducing a tax cut for the banks and the bank levy proposal is weak and fails to ensure that banks pay their fair share. This is a simple amendment that is surely unobjectionable and I think we should seek the Committee&#8217;s view.</p>

	<p pid="a.557.3/1">The backdrop to today&#8217;s debate is an economy that is flat-lining, as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury admitted last week. Since the Chancellor&#8217;s spending review, we have had no economic growth, and it is ordinary people who are hardest hit by that stagnation, with 2.5 million people out of work, including nearly 1 million young people&#8212;one in five 16 to 24-year-olds. An increasing number of people have been jobless for more than a year&#8212;nearly 850,000 and rising. This year, as the Government&#8217;s cuts start to bite, hundreds of</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/2">thousands more people could lose their jobs. I believe that that is what the Minister of State at the Cabinet Office called an</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/3">&#8220;immediate national crisis in the form of less growth and jobs than we need.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/4">Apparently, it is what the Chancellor describes as &#8220;good news&#8221; and a sign that the economy is on the right track. Families are feeling the effects of the crisis in their pockets. Prices are still rising by more than 5% on the retail prices index, while earnings are growing at just 2% a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/5">Rising fuel prices are a big part of this squeeze. According to the Office for National Statistics, fuel prices are currently one of the most significant contributors to consumer price inflation. According to this week&#8217;s figures from the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the average UK pump price is now &#163;1.36 for a litre of petrol and &#163;1.42 for a litre of diesel. I am sure that many Members will be aware that at their local petrol pumps prices are even higher. That means that petrol is more than 3p a litre more expensive than it was last month, or 15p more than this time last year, and that diesel is 3p more expensive than last month, or nearly 20p more than last year. Unfortunately, the 1p saving we got from the Chancellor&#8217;s cut in fuel duty lasted barely a week before price rises at the pumps wiped it out.</p>

	<p pid="a.558.0/1">My hon. Friend rightly draws attention to fuel prices. Does she not find it extraordinary that the coalition Government are proposing to subsidise fuel prices in some of their friends&#8217; constituencies, thereby increasing by default the duty on those in many of the urban constituencies that we represent?</p>

	<p pid="a.558.1/1">My right hon. Friend is quite right that the Government are looking for a derogation in some rural areas, but only a very limited number. When the House last discussed the proposal, considerable representations were made by Government Members who argued that if there was to be a derogation, other areas should also benefit from it and that it was unfair that just a few remote islands should see the benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.558.2/1">The argument that a derogation in remote and rural areas is somehow an increase elsewhere is an interesting one. Should we take it from that that the hon. Lady is opposed to the road equivalent tariff being implemented in the Western Isles as well?</p>

	<p pid="a.558.3/1">The point that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40632" name="John Spellar">the Member for Warley (Mr Spellar)</phrase> was making was that if taxes are to be cut for some people somewhere, but the same amount of revenue has to be raised, that means that someone else is subsidising it. That is a fairly simple point to take on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.558.3/2">As I was saying, it is not just rising fuel prices that are hitting people. Rises in fuel prices feed through to higher food prices and higher energy prices for household bills. Despite a recent up-tick, the OECD estimates that food prices in the first quarter of this year were nearly 6% higher than they were last year, and energy prices more than 9% higher. As real incomes fall, spending on basic items, such as food<i>&#8212;</i> <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.559.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> for that, because it certainly seemed quite noisy from where I was standing.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.2/2">As I was saying, as real incomes fall, spending on basic items such as food, energy and fuel make up an increasing proportion of the average family&#8217;s weekly spend, as the Office for National Statistics acknowledged in March when it changed the make-up of its retail prices index basket. That means that families are increasingly vulnerable when prices rise quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.2/3">The Opposition accept that no Government can control the price of oil, which the global markets set, and that the situation in the middle east is affecting people in countries throughout the world, to which the UK is of course no exception, but the Government have control over fuel taxation, and that has a significant effect on pump prices. When so many people are out of work and real wages are falling, the Chancellor has a responsibility to do all he can to help business and to promote economic growth and jobs; and when ordinary working people are struggling to make ends meet, he has a responsibility to do everything possible to help them get on.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.2/4">That is why we tabled amendment 7. It is important that Parliament has the opportunity to scrutinise the Government&#8217;s policies on fuel taxation and their total effect on fuel prices at the pump, because the Chancellor&#8217;s cut in fuel duty, as set out in clause 19, is not all that it seems. In January the Government decided to increase VAT on fuel from 17.5% to 20%, even though the Prime Minister told voters just before the election that he had &#8220;no plans&#8221; to increase VAT. Without that VAT rise, petrol would be almost 3p cheaper now, swamping the 1p cut that the Bill brings in.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.2/5">The Federation of Small Businesses said that the UK&#8217;s small and medium-sized enterprises would be &#8220;severely affected&#8221; by that hike in fuel tax. A survey of its members in January pointed to the increase as the single biggest threat to their business&#8212;something that will resonate with Government Members, who I am sure have been lobbied by the FSB on that point. Some 89% of businesses that responded thought that the Government&#8217;s measures would add &#163;2,000 to their costs over six months. A spokesperson for the FSB said in response to the January rise in fuel tax:</p>
	<p pid="a.559.2/6">&#8220;The Government have said it is putting its faith in the private sector to put the economy on a firm footing, yet 36% said they will have to reduce investment in new products and services and 78% said their profitability will be reduced&#8212;hardly conducive to growth.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.559.2/7">Many small business people in my constituency are struggling to stay afloat, particularly in the face of cash-flow difficulties. The VAT increase at the beginning</p>
	<p pid="a.559.2/8">of this year was expected to put severe strain on their cash flow, so the Chancellor&#8217;s 1p reduction in fuel duty has to be seen in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.2/9">Some people will be able to cut down on their use of fuel or even stop using petrol all together. Some people are switching to cycling or to public transport, and for those who are able to do so that is a good thing. As an MP for Bristol, which saw investment from the previous Labour Government so that it could become the UK&#8217;s first cycling city, I welcome people taking up cycling.</p>

	<p pid="a.560.0/1">The argument that my hon. Friend puts forward is very interesting, but does she agree that the situation is difficult for rural constituencies such as mine, where bus subsides are being cut because of the Government&#8217;s cuts to Durham county council and some communities will not have any access to any public transport whatever?</p>

	<p pid="a.560.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an absolutely valid point, which I was just about to turn to. Some people will say that the rise in fuel prices is an incentive for people to use public transport such as buses, but they can only do so if they are in an area that is well served by public transport. Bus subsides are being cut, and increasingly some areas&#8212;particularly remote rural areas&#8212;are being completely left without a bus service, meaning that people simply have no choice but to use their car. They include not just people who are poorly served by public transport, but those who run businesses and have to visit customers and suppliers and transport goods throughout the country. They include those who have to run around in the morning dropping children off at different schools or at nursery and then get to work on time, and many other people besides. At a time when fuel prices are rising, adding to them with extra tax is hammering people at the worst possible time. These are often families who are already running a very tight budget, and even a few extra pounds a week on their bills makes a real difference to their ability to get by.</p>

	<p pid="a.560.2/1">Has my hon. Friend noticed the projections for the increase in household debt under this Government? The Office for Budget Responsibility is projecting that it will increase by more than &#163;500 billion this year and over the next five years, and it is also saying that the reason for this is not only inflation but the comprehensive spending review and the Budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.560.4/1">Before the election, the Economic Secretary said in this House during a debate on fuel duty:</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/2">&#8220;What people want from the Government today is a helping hand to get them out of their financial troubles. Instead, what they see from the Government is no help at all. Far from providing a hand to pull them out of their troubles, the Government are pushing them further down into them.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-07-16.359"><i>Official Report</i>, 16 July 2008; Vol. 479, c. 359</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/3">How astonishing, then, to find that that is exactly what she and her Government are doing. They may have made a show of helping people up with a small fuel duty cut, but that is after they have given them a much bigger push down with their VAT rise on fuel. Before the Chancellor gave his Budget statement, Labour Members called for him to look again at the fuel duty escalator, which I think the Economic Secretary is muttering about from a sedentary position. In previous Budgets, we cancelled or postponed fuel duty rises when pump prices were rising quickly. In the 2010 Budget, the then Labour Chancellor phased in the increase for that year in three stages to ease pressure on business and household incomes. In the 2008 Budget, the previous Government postponed the increase in fuel duty for six months, again to support the economy and help businesses and families. We therefore welcome the fact that the Chancellor has done so again in this Finance Bill. However, when that cut is put in context, we see that families and businesses are facing more pressure than before as a result of the Government&#8217;s policies on fuel tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/4">This is not the only policy in the Bill that is not all that it seems when it is put in context. The Government have made much of their increase in the personal allowance for income tax. The Chancellor said:</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/5">&#8220;The increase in the personal tax allowance already announced will vastly exceed anything lost through employee NICs uprating&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-03-23.954"><i>Official Report</i>, 23 March 2011; Vol. 525, c. 954</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/6">However, he failed to mention that the rise in the allowance is swamped by his VAT rise, which will take &#163;450 a year, on average, from the pockets of families with children. Families earning as little as &#163;31,000 could lose their child tax credits as the Government take &#163;400 million out of the system, while the Government&#8217;s Welfare Reform Bill creates uncertainty for families over whether they will keep their child care support and free school meals. In a couple of years, a family with two children with a single earner earning just &#163;44,000 could find that the Government have taken &#163;1,750 a year away from them in child benefit. It is no wonder that the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the Chancellor was</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/7">&#8220;giving with one hand&#8230;and taking away with lots and lots of other hands.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/8">Nor is it surprising that the economist Roger Bootle said today that household incomes were &#8220;all but certain&#8221; to fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/9">All this comes at a time when Government cuts mean front-line cuts in services that people rely on&#8212;schools, the NHS, social care, even the police&#8212;and workers in those vital public sector jobs are facing redundancies. The Government may say that some factors are outside their control. When we were in government, oil prices rose substantially, as we are seeing now, but we left government with a proportional tax take on fuel lower than when we came into government&#8212;down from 75% to less than 65% on petrol and down from 74% to 64% on diesel. It is no coincidence that under the last Conservative Government fuel taxation shot up from 66% of the price of petrol in 1992 to 75% in 1997, and from 66% to 74% for diesel.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/10">The Minister of State for International Development made the front pages in March, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/11">&#8220;if this does go wrong&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/12">referring to the Budget,</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/13">&#8220;&#163;1.30 at the pump could look like a luxury, $200 a barrel is on the cards&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/14">He can hardly have expected that remark to put a stop to speculation in the oil markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/15">Rather than helping people through the tough times, the Government seem to want to make things worse. There was an alternative for the Government. Before the Budget, we called on the Chancellor to scrap the hike in VAT on fuel. That would have been of genuine help to families and businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.562.0/1">Is my hon. Friend, like me, extremely surprised at the lack of ambition from the Government parties when it comes to seeking a derogation for the rise in VAT on fuel? Given that President Sarkozy managed to get a derogation on VAT for French restaurants, does she not think that the British Government should do the same for fuel?</p>

	<p pid="a.562.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point, which I will come on to in a moment. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Ministers are peddling the line that it would take six years to achieve such a derogation from the EU. I ask them, have they even tried? I suspect that the answer is no. It is a fairly defeatist attitude to say that we will not even ask because we know what the answer will be. That is not fighting for Britain&#8217;s corner in the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.562.1/2">As I was saying, there was an alternative for the Government. We called on the Chancellor to scrap the hike in VAT on fuel, which would have been of genuine help to families and businesses. It could have been paid for from the &#163;800 million more than expected that was raised from the bank levy. Unlike the stabiliser proposed by the Conservatives in the run-up to the general election, that would not have been &#8220;unbelievably complicated and unpredictable&#8221;, to use the words of the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.562.1/3">The stabiliser is based on the idea that taxation will vary according to fluctuations in petrol prices, so that</p>
	<p pid="a.562.1/4">&#8220;when fuel prices go up, fuel duty would fall. And when fuel prices go down, fuel duty would rise&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.562.1/5">to use a direct quotation from the Conservative party consultation document on the issue. The stabiliser was a flagship policy for the Conservatives in the general election campaign. The present Prime Minister made an issue of it when he visited a Coca-Cola plant in Morley just a week before polling day, where he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.562.1/6">&#8220;it would give you certainty as you go about your lives, knowing what your salary is, knowing what your mortgage is, we&#8217;d be helping with the cost of living by trying to give you a flatter and more constant rate for filling up your car&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.562.1/7">When the Conservative party got into government, it soon realised that that was an empty promise, made glibly without doing the homework required, as we have seen with so many of its policies in its year in government. In the Budget, the Chancellor resorted to a different so-called stabiliser by increasing the supplementary charge on North sea oil. We will discuss that issue later tonight when we come on to the next group of amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.562.1/8">It is true, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> mentioned, that asking for a special rate of VAT would require our asking for a</p>
	<p pid="a.562.1/9">derogation from the European Commission. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that the Government could not afford to &#8220;sacrifice income willy-nilly&#8221;. However, he was willing to go to the EU to ask for a derogation for remote islands, although not for the rest of Scotland or the UK. Even members of the Conservative party agree that the solution should apply to the rest of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.563.1/3">&#8220;The pressures that affect the islands of Scotland and the Scilly Isles affect our constituents too.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.563.1/4">He went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.563.1/5">&#8220;if any solution is applied to one part of the United Kingdom, it must be applied to other parts of it as well.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-03-16.352"><i>Official Report</i>, 16 March 2011; Vol. 525, c. 352</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.563.1/6">Incidentally, we have heard reports that the Chief Secretary&#8217;s derogation on that issue may be approved by this summer, after he applied only on Budget day. That is rather quicker than the six to seven years that the Government have claimed would be needed for a broader derogation on VAT for fuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.563.1/7">The French Government were willing to go to the EU to ask for special dispensation for French restaurants, and several member states have asked for other derogations in the past. Derogations have been granted for goods as diverse as fertilisers, pesticides and works of art, and for services from amusement parks and hotels to cleaning and cable television. In 1994, the British Government secured a derogation for domestic fuel, and in the past derogations have been granted to some member states for reduced VAT on goods such as heating oil.</p>

	<p pid="a.564.1/1">The hon. Lady invents a mythical obstacle to achieving a derogation, without even having tried. Many of her Back Benchers who are constantly urging Ministers to stand up to the European Commission will be very disappointed that they are using the Commission as an excuse. They could have avoided this situation by not introducing the rise in VAT on fuel earlier this year. They should have considered the consequences before entering into such a policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.1/2">The UK has not applied for as many derogations as other member states. We have only one reduced rate, which is used largely for energy and energy-saving materials and a number of health products, as well as the zero rate. France, Italy and Poland have each secured three different reduced rates of VAT, in addition to a zero rate, so there is clearly scope for the UK to ask for a little more.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.1/3">While Labour was in government, we never applied for a special rate of VAT on fuel, but the reason for that is simple: we never raised VAT on fuel in the first place. This is a problem that the Government have created, so rather than simply telling the Committee that a derogation would be illegal, perhaps the Economic Secretary can once and for all tell us whether the Government have made any serious attempt to start negotiations with the European Commission on the matter, or whether they are simply capitulating to the Commission without putting up a fight.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.1/4">We have tabled the amendment so that the Government&#8217;s fuel duty cut will be shown for what it really is&#8212;a 1p cut that is wiped out by the 3p a litre increase resulting from their VAT rise on fuel. It comes at a time when petrol prices are already rising rapidly and reaching record highs, when families are already squeezed and when the economy is struggling to grow. It comes after the Government refused to take the alternative approach that we put forward, which would have been a genuine help to families. The amendment means that the Government will have to face up to the fact that they have made the wrong choice at the wrong time and are harming, not helping, working people.</p>

	<p pid="a.564.2/1">I rise to speak in favour of the amendment, which states clearly that the Chancellor should publish</p>
	<p pid="a.564.2/2">&#8220;an assessment of the impact of taxation on fuel prices.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.564.2/3">It is a short but, I think, highly important amendment, not least because fuel prices are a key part of our economy and have an impact on inflation. I want to say a few words about why taxation on fuel has a bearing on inflation and why that is at the heart of some of the economic problems that we face today, not just from a dry, technical point of view but from the perspective of families in Wirral, Merseyside and elsewhere who are struggling at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.2/4">This country has previously dealt with severely high inflation, but for many years we have had relatively low and stable inflation. That is also true across the globe. The nature of the fuel industry means that fuel prices have a specific impact on inflation, but I would point</p>
	<p pid="a.564.2/5">out that inflation in the UK is slightly higher than in the rest of the EU. That should be a warning signal to us. I am not particularly hawkish on inflation and on saying that fuel prices could drive problems in our economy. We need to recognise not the danger of returning to the days of terribly high inflation, but the danger of inflation of nearly 5% when wages are being held down, which limits people&#8217;s quality of life. People see food and fuel price increases when they go to the shops or fill up their cars&#8212;as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40122" name="Kerry McCarthy">the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> correctly said, food prices are partly driven by fuel prices&#8212;yet their wages are held down, so at the same time, they face higher prices in the shops and less in their pay packets every month.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.2/6">That means a falling quality of life for the average person in this country&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Some in the House clearly think that that is a laughing matter, and I will let my constituents know that they do&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I am very awake to the fact that my constituents are incredibly concerned about their quality of life and what this measure means. They understand that our economy has faced tough times, but they are not beating a path to my surgery to demand exaggerated pay settlements because of fuel and food prices. They are very realistic. However, as politicians, we must ask ourselves whether it is fair to expect people constantly to deal with higher prices in the shops and on petrol station forecourts when the Government are asking for their wages to be held down. That is an issue of fairness, by which I mean that it is not morally right to ask people to accept falling standards of living because of an economic situation that is no fault of theirs.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.2/7">It would have been bad enough for the VAT increase to have occurred when wages are being held down just because of the period of economic cycle. My constituents would have seen their quality of life fall, but one of the biggest worries and fears that I hear of in my surgery every week is the impact of the Government&#8217;s other policies on people&#8217;s quality of life. My hon. Friend mentioned some of the impacts from this April. Cuts to the amount that parents can claim for child care will have an impact&#8212;they could be worth up to &#163;1,560. That is not small fry. When it comes to making ends meet every week, the Government must think about the long-term plan for ensuring that, by and large, living standards for the average citizen in the country do not fall.</p>

	<p pid="a.566.6/1">Thank you, Mr Hoyle. It would be testing your patience not to stick to the amendment, as I shall endeavour to do for the rest of my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.6/2">All Members will realise that the average family, the average couple and the average pensioner are facing a more and more difficult situation as the money coming in has to be stretched even further, and with prices going up in the shops. That is people&#8217;s experience. The impact of taxation on fuel prices and its role in driving up inflation and driving down living standards requires investigation and careful thought. This is not just my view or that of just some economist: when I looked into the possible causes of rising inflation in the UK, the first person I thought might have the answer was the Governor of the Bank of England, who, in his letter to the Chancellor about why the Bank had not met the inflation target, cited the VAT rise as one of the inflationary pressures facing the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.6/3">As I said, I am not some inflation hawk who holds to a 1980s antediluvian economic philosophy that inflation is necessarily bad. Some countries have had relatively high inflation as well as growth. However, the important thing about taxation and fuel prices, and their role in inflation, is that it is possible to build in inflationary expectations in the long term through some of these measures. I wonder whether the Government have really thought about what they are doing in not combating some of the issues related to rising prices that we have seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.6/4">There is also an obvious link with people&#8217;s worry about the lack of investment at this time. There is no doubt that investment means jobs today and productivity tomorrow, and therefore a more effective economy that enables people to have a better standard of living at less cost. That has to be the aim. At the moment, the Government are balancing the books using VAT and</p>
	<p pid="a.566.6/5">extremely flat taxes that do not pay regard to people&#8217;s income. They are asking people in my constituency on relatively modest incomes to pay the same higher prices at the fuel pumps as people in the Chancellor&#8217;s constituency down the road in Tatton, who by and large&#8212;not universally&#8212;are a bit wealthier. That is not fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.6/6">We have to consider carefully whether the increased taxation on fuel resulting from the VAT rise is having a negative impact on the economy in a wide-ranging sense. It is not only about whether fuel prices are up&#8212;obviously that could be the result of several things&#8212;but, most especially, about what that is doing to inflationary expectations. We need to consider whether it is having a damaging impact on the broader economy, and whether it is a disincentive to growth and productivity improvements in the UK. We also need to consider what it is doing to the living standards of people such as those whom I represent in Wirral and Merseyside who have seen living standards fall severely in the past two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.567.4/1">My hon. Friend makes an important, if a little lengthy point. People will not be fooled, because they will see fuel prices going up and ask themselves what the Government have done to help. People are connecting the impact on prices across the board with what happens when they fill up the tank. When they go to the shop, they see higher prices all around them and they wonder where they are coming from. There is one clear answer: No. 11 Downing street. The Chancellor has decided that people will have to pay more in the shops. Let us not imagine that he has said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry everyone. These are tough times&#8212;we&#8217;re going to ask you to put your hands in your pockets until we can lower VAT again.&#8221; Rather, this is a permanent rise that will build in higher prices for the long term. Given the downward pressure on wages, the really worrying thing is that the rise is building in not only a reduction in quality of life, but inequality, which is very worrying and will hurt for many years to come.</p>

Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase> and my hon.

	<p pid="a.567.5/2">The amendment calls for the Chancellor to publish an assessment of the impact of taxation on fuel prices within three months of the Bill being passed. I will concentrate on the differential impact of fuel duty policy in the English regions. I say &#8220;regions&#8221; with some trepidation, because I know that the very concept, or even uttering the word, causes phobic shudders in some quarters on the Government Benches, but an analysis of road freight statistics by the North East chamber of commerce has demonstrated the extra burden that fuel taxation places on businesses in regions such as the north-east. Each tonne of freight brought in or out of the north-east of England delivers approximately &#163;4.16 in fuel taxes to the Exchequer; although that figure probably changes daily, it is 18% higher than the average for English regions, which is only &#163;3.52, and 74% higher than the figure for London. That analysis shows that more careful consideration should be given to fuel duty rates&#8217; economic impact in regions and to differential rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.5/3">Road freight statistics show the extra distance travelled by goods transported into or out of the north-east compared with other parts of England. Every tonne of freight transported by road into or out of the north-east travels an average of 119 miles, compared with an average of 111 miles for businesses across the whole of England. Only businesses in the south-west of England transport freight further by road, with each tonne of goods going into or out of the south-west travelling an average of 192 km, which is ever so slightly more than the average of 119 miles for the north-east. Duty on diesel is currently at about 58p a litre.</p>

	<p pid="a.568.1/1">That is exactly what I am suggesting such a report could achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.1/2">The VAT chargeable on the duty element of the fuel price brings the total impact of fuel duty to about 69p a litre&#8212;that figure is a few days old, so it might be more or less than that now, depending on the daily price rate. Using a typical fuel consumption rate for road haulage of 8.5 miles per gallon, that means that each kilometre travelled provides 22p to the Exchequer; given an average load of 10 tonnes, each tonne of freight transported into or out of the north-east region delivers &#163;4.30 to the Exchequer in fuel taxes, compared with an average for goods moved between English regions of only &#163;3.52. We are already starting to see the impact on an economically deprived region in terms of businesses developing there and on its prospects for employment, given its peripherality to the bulk of the English economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.1/3">Many hauliers in the North East chamber of commerce membership have no choice but to pass a proportion of those costs on to their customers, the vast majority of whom tend to be based in the north-east region. The chamber of commerce has argued that decisions on fuel duty need to take greater account of the impact on businesses in each part of the UK, and that a more considered approach is needed than that of the automatic increases that have been fixed into Government policy for the upcoming period. The figures I have quoted</p>
	<p pid="a.568.1/4">exclude those for goods transported within regions, as the impact of fuel duty would be the same in each region for that type of journey.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.1/5">If the amendment were accepted, I would ask that a detailed analysis be included of the introduction of a measure that would help to stabilise fuel duty. In fact, that is exactly what the Federation of Small Businesses has been calling for. We have had debates in the past about some sort of fuel duty stabiliser, and it remains to be seen whether that would be a workable option, but surely when carrying out such an analysis, the Government could look at measures that would stabilise fuel duty and the cost of fuel.</p>

	<p pid="a.569.3/1">What happened over a number of years&#8212;I am afraid that our Government were not immune from this&#8212;was that, rather than planning roads to encourage economic growth and development, we planned them to accommodate congestion. That was not always the best thing to do from an economic perspective. Down that road lies ruin, if you will pardon the pun.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/2">The Federation of Small Businesses has asked for a fuel stabiliser. I am not saying that I necessarily agree with the federation, but stability in fuel prices is important. The Chief Secretary said of a fuel stabiliser:</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/3">&#8220;It&#8217;s a complicated idea and it&#8217;s difficult to see&#8230; how we achieve it, but it&#8217;s something that we are looking at very carefully to see if we can reduce the burden of fuel duty&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/4">I wonder whether the concept could not be more straightforward. When oil prices increased, the stabiliser&#8212;or a stabilising impact effect&#8212;would allow the Government to reduce duty to a lower limit; when oil prices fell, the Government would be able to raise duty to a higher limit.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/5">Critics cite the difficulty of knowing whether the fluctuations in the price of oil are temporary or likely to persist beyond the near term, saying that it would be difficult for a fuel duty stabiliser to set fuel duties effectively. To counter the volatility in the price of oil, a fuel duty stabiliser or a stabilising measure would need to be based on an official forecast of the future price of oil, and then adjusted regularly according to the actual oil prices. It will be difficult, given the volatility in how the international oil markets are working at the moment,</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/6">but we need to try to find some measure to help our small and medium-sized enterprises through this difficult process at this difficult time; otherwise, we are in real danger of seeing fuel become a major blockage to economic growth, not only in particular regions, but across the whole nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/7">Would this be bad for the public finances? The Chief Secretary said that we cannot &#8220;sacrifice income willy-nilly&#8221;. Critics argue that a stabiliser or a stabilising effect would be too expensive to implement during a time of austerity, but that criticism fails to take into account the wider implications of high fuel prices on the UK economy. If set correctly, the measure could be fiscally neutral for the public finances and help to provide much-needed economic stability for the UK economy. My main point in asking for some sort of analysis in a review is that the measure is needed so much more in the regions of England, particularly regions such as the north-east, but the south-west as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.570.0/1">The amendment states that the Chancellor should</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/2">&#8220;publish, within 3 months&#8230; an assessment of the impact of taxation on fuel prices.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/3">I will address my remarks to the scope of such an assessment. It is important not to focus solely on the narrow issues surrounding VAT, although they are important, or on the global increase in fuel prices, which is one of the factors causing the revolutions in north Africa and elsewhere in the world as people suffer from rising food prices as a result of rising fuel prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/4">There is something very specific about how we in this country choose to tax fuel. Compared with other European Union countries, we choose to have very high taxes on fuel. One consequence is the problems from which our road hauliers have suffered in comparison with some of their competitors in European countries that have road pricing.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/5">It is interesting to note that in the 2010 general election, the Liberal Democrats proposed to move towards</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/6">&#8220;a rural fuel discount scheme which would allow a reduced rate of fuel duty to be paid in remote rural areas, as is allowed under EU law&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/7">as well as to prepare for a system of road pricing to be introduced &#8220;in a second parliament&#8221;. That was the Liberal Democrat position. The Conservatives, of course, had a completely different view, promising for a &#8220;fair fuel stabiliser&#8221;, presumably designed to help people in the rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/8">I represent an urban area. My constituents suffer high fuel prices in London and, unlike some people in rural areas, they do not have the advantage of having to pay only 11.14p duty on a litre of so-called red diesel, instead of 57.95p duty on a litre of low-sulphur diesel. We know that there is abuse of the red diesel system by certain people who, when driving on main roads, use diesel that should be used only for off-road activities. That opportunity is not open to my constituents. People living in Ilford and elsewhere in Greater London do not have access to red diesel that they can abuse in order to avoid paying tax. However, people who are represented by the Liberal Democrats, who are in favour of giving priority to remote rural areas but not to those who us who live in urban areas, or by Conservative Members who are happy not to enforce adequately the provisions against abuse of the red diesel system, are not concerned</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/9">about that. I want the review to examine the abuse of the red diesel system. I believe that a lot of money that should be going to the Exchequer is not doing so and that there is discrimination against people who live in urban areas and have no access to red diesel for their motoring purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.571.0/1">I take my hon. Friend&#8217;s point about the abuse of red diesel, but may I disabuse him of the fact that it is not available in urban areas? When I was chair of trading standards in Newcastle, the abuse of red diesel in urban areas was just as prevalent as it was in some rural areas. The fact is that certain criminal elements in London can gain access to red diesel fairly easily.</p>

	<p pid="a.571.1/1">Obviously I am not as accomplished as my hon. Friend at making contact with the criminal elements in London. However, he has raised a serious matter: there are criminal elements who exploit differentials in duty. We have seen that in Northern Ireland, when terrorist organisations financed their activities by smuggling fuel across the border from the south to the north and vice versa, and we have seen it in other contexts.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.1/2">If we are to have a policy on fuel taxation, we need to ensure that if we introduce measures that discriminate in favour of certain people in remote rural communities, we do not also create loopholes that will be used in a discriminatory way to undermine the sense of justice and fairness that our people want us to exercise. If we have high levels of fuel taxation in this country, which we do, and if that causes problems for our road haulage industry and discrimination between rural and urban areas, when the review is conducted&#8212;I hope that the Government will support the amendment, because it is vital that we look at these issues in&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.571.6/1">I entirely agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.6/2">I believe that one of the difficulties in our economy, which affects our haulage industry, arises from our tax levels compared with levels in other European Union countries. We all know that if we drive across to France</p>
	<p pid="a.571.6/3">and fill a tank with diesel, or &#8220;gas oil&#8221; as they call it, it is possible to pay&#8212;depending on where we are&#8212;40%, 50% or 60% of the amount that we would pay in the United Kingdom. The haulage industry based on the other side of the channel therefore has a competitive advantage. The great lorries with Polish and other countries&#8217; number plates that we see bringing goods into this country have a competitive advantage over those of our own haulage industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.6/4">We need to look at these matters. I have to say that I think the Liberal Democrats were right. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Yes, occasionally they are right, and I think they were right when they said we need to look at road pricing. Unfortunately, the only person who has done anything serious about road pricing is, of course, the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, who introduced the congestion charge, which the Conservatives have now accepted even though they opposed it when it was first introduced.</p>

	<p pid="a.572.3/1">Thank you, Mr Hoyle. I will, as always, take your sagacious advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.572.3/2">We need to look at the consequences of the way in which our economy is integrated globally, and the knock-on consequences of our competitive position in European markets. We need a review of fuel taxation, taking account of the position of the haulage industry and the discrepancies and disparities between different parts of the UK&#8212;I accept what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" name="Ian Mearns">the Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase> said about the north-east region. There are difficulties and we need to look at this issue in the round. It is eminently sensible to have a comprehensive review of fuel taxation policy, as called for in the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.572.3/3">Everybody agrees that the current arrangement is not working well. There is a huge amount of public disquiet&#8212;all of us receive e-mails and letters on the subject, and the Federation of Small Businesses and others write to us. People are concerned about high fuel prices. There are things we can control, such as not increasing VAT on fuel, and there are things we cannot control, such as the impact of global events, but as long as we have an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels and oil, we will always be vulnerable to such things. The debate embraces wider issues than are dealt with in the terms of the amendment. I will not talk about those issues now Mr Hoyle, but it is important that we address them in a comprehensive review of fuel taxation policy. I therefore support the amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.572.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="572"  time="023:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0004.htm#11050440000093">
	<p pid="a.572.4/1">First, I want to compare the records on fuel taxation of the most recent Labour Government and the previous Conservative Government. My view is that the Labour Government were a great deal kinder to the motorist, and the following figures are provided by the current Government. Figures from the Department</p>
	<p pid="a.572.4/2">of Energy and Climate Change show that in 1990, when the Conservatives were in power, 59% of the price paid at the pump by the motorist and road haulier for unleaded petrol was taken by the Government in fuel taxation, and that it rose to 75% during the following seven years of Conservative rule; the Government therefore took more and more and more in taxation. When Labour was in power, however, the proportion of the price of unleaded petrol taken in fuel taxation fell to 65%. The figures for diesel are almost the same. Under the Conservatives, the tax take rose from 57% to 74%, whereas Labour brought it down to 64%.</p>
	<p pid="a.572.4/3">I would like the Economic Secretary to the Treasury to answer one question in her response, on the following subject. Since the general election, Government policy&#8212;not just Conservative policy, but Conservative and Liberal Democrat policy&#8212;has been to increase the tax on fuel by about 3p a litre through the increase in VAT and to give back roughly a third of that, 1p a litre, through the reduction in duty. That policy will slightly help road hauliers, because the duty element will reduce. The VAT element increases, but hauliers are able to recover the VAT, or at least pass it on in the VAT they charge their customers. So the effect of the Government&#8217;s policy will be to clobber the private motorist to the tune of 2p a litre, because they will have to pay the VAT increase out of their own pockets, while providing slight relief to businesses, particularly hauliers. I say &#8220;slight&#8221; because the price of fuel has increased as a result of a number of factors, including the increase in the cost of oil and the fall in the value of the pound on the international exchanges. So motorists and hauliers have been clobbered by the market and by the Government, but hauliers are being hit slightly less hard than the private motorist because they are able to recover the VAT increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.572.4/4">My question to the Economic Secretary is as follows: is it a deliberate act of Government policy to make life slightly easier for businesses but to clobber the private citizen, or is it just an accident that that has happened? This is one of the things that ought to be studied in the review that the Opposition amendment proposes. We should examine the relative merits of taxing fuel for vehicles through VAT as opposed to through fuel duty, and who the gainers and losers are.</p>
	<p pid="a.572.4/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40662" name="Alison McGovern">the Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern)</phrase> made a very powerful speech about the impact that the increase in VAT on fuel has had on family budgets, and the impact that inflation generally, and fuel inflation in particular, is having on families who are having their earnings squeezed. My Front-Bench colleagues&#8217; amendment proposes that the review ought to consider that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.572.4/6">I would like such a review also to consider one other issue, because I do not believe that the Government have yet done so&#8212;although I would be delighted to be corrected if they have carried out the sort of analysis that I propose. The review should also examine the impact that taxation has on the demand for fuel. The previous Conservative Government, one and a half decades ago, introduced a fuel price escalator. I understand that their reason for doing so was environmental: they wanted to increase the price of fuel to depress the demand for it, and so reduce carbon emissions. That was the policy intention, and it is one of the reasons why Conservative policies cost taxpayers and consumers so much. I mentioned that the fuel tax take rose from</p>
	<p pid="a.572.4/7">59% to 75% in their last seven years in office. I wonder whether the Minister can tell me whether that sharp increase in fuel taxation under the previous Conservative Government actually did depress the demand for fuel, because that is an important consideration. If we change the marginal rate of fuel taxation, economics suggest that there should be some elasticity in demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.572.4/8">The Government say that they want to be the greenest ever, so they ought to consider the carbon emission consequences of changes to fuel duty and VAT on fuel. I hope that Treasury Ministers have taken advice on that from both the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Transport. They ought to have done, if they really are&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Does the Financial Secretary to the Treasury want to intervene? No, he is back in his seat. The Government ought to take advice before they make such proposals, so that they can assess the environmental impact of a fiscal measure. I am waiting to hear from a Minister, but it sounds as though that has not happened. It ought to if the Government are serious about the environmental consequences of their fiscal policy.</p>

One would expect the fall in economic activity that we have seen as a result of the Budget&#8212;the Office for Budget Responsibility has revised down its forecast for growth as a result of the Government&#8217;s fiscal measures so far&#8212;to lead to a decline in carbon emissions from both road transport and other sources. I am not clear from what the hon. Lady has read out whether the reduction in carbon emissions will be a result of the fiscal measure or of a reduction in demand because of a contraction of the economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.575.0/1">If I interpreted the note correctly, it was a projection of what might happen as a result of the fiscal measures. It did not answer the question posed by my hon. Friend, which concerned an analysis of the results of the differing policies on carbon reduction hitherto. Does he agree that it is vital that we use green taxation only as a means of changing behaviour, and never solely as a revenue-raising measure? That is the question that he posed about past policy, and the Economic Secretary did not answer it.</p>

	<p pid="a.575.1/1">One would assume that a Government estimate has been made on the basis of some evidence. My hon. Friend shrugs his shoulders, but he was in government for a time and I certainly give a Government the benefit of the doubt. I believe that their civil servants would make the best estimate they could based on the evidence they had. Past responses to fiscal changes in the taxation of fuel would of course be a good indicator. Either the Minister can tell me that that is the basis on which the estimate has been made or she is not certain. If she is not certain she should be honest and say so, because we will then need the further analysis proposed in the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.575.3/1">The premise that my hon. Friend puts forward is absolutely right. The fact that more and more people are using low-emission vehicles will obviously have an impact. However, the purpose of the review proposed in the amendment is to consider what effects the fiscal changes will have. If the price of fuel is raised, some people will consume the same amount of fuel anyway because they are in business and they do not want to contract their business, but generally speaking it has a marginal effect. Private motorists will reduce the number of discretionary journeys they make by trying to take their cars to the shops less frequently and perhaps abandoning some leisure trips, and businesses will look for ways of economising as prices rise. I have heard the Minister&#8217;s comments and I am grateful to her for drawing my attention to the estimate that the Government have made, but it is a fairly bald statement and it does not answer my question about whether the measure is driven by the Government&#8217;s environmental concerns or their revenue-raising concerns, and we need a clear answer on that.</p>

The Minister is waving her piece of paper again, and I promise I will read it properly, but what she read out to me did not answer my questions. It is an input&#8212;an estimate of one figure&#8212;but as we have heard, further study of the environmental and social impacts, the impact on family budget impacts and the overall economic impact is needed. I hope that as a result of that analysis the Government will produce better, more coherent cross-government proposals for the taxation of fuel in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.576.4/1">I support the amendment, which asks for a review. In the previous debate, we asked for a review of the implications of the bank levy. Similarly, the amendment calls for an assessment of the impact of taxation on fuel prices. It would be disingenuous to suggest that all Governments have perfect relationships when it comes to dealing with fuel duty. Clearly, the previous Government had problems with the cost of fuel and difficulties over taxation, but my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> exploded one of the myths about the tax-take from fuel duty. Under the Conservative Government from 1990 to 1997 the tax-take on unleaded petrol rose by 16%, and under the Labour Government between 1997 and 2010 the tax-take fell from 75% to 65%.</p>
	<p pid="a.576.4/2">The Government delayed the planned fuel duty rise, as Labour Governments did previously, as oil prices rose. Was that the right decision? Yes. At a time when many hard working families are affected not only by higher inflation and increased taxation, but by wages being driven down and in some cases by family members</p>
	<p pid="a.576.4/3">facing unemployment, the Chancellor&#8217;s VAT increase puts about &#163;1.30 on the cost of filling up a 50 litre tank of petrol.</p>

	<p pid="a.577.1/1">I am becoming concerned. The hon. Lady&#8217;s blood pressure does not seem stable tonight. She seems to be turning red and getting rather excited in tonight&#8217;s debate, which I am not sure is good for her health. Why did she argue for and push through an increase in VAT when she and her Prime Minister stood on a manifesto saying that they would not put VAT up? That is not being honest with the British people. What she has to explain to hard-working families in my constituency, North Durham, and in Putney is why she reneged on that promise.</p>
	<p pid="a.577.1/2">There has been much talk in recent weeks about trust in politicians, and a lot of nonsense talked by the yes to AV campaign about whether MPs are hard working and trustworthy. When the Prime Minister and the hon. Lady say clearly that they will not increase VAT, and then that is the first thing she does, I understand why my constituents and hers are rather cynical about certain promises.</p>
	<p pid="a.577.1/3">In the Budget the Chancellor used the gimmick of cutting the price of petrol by 1p. We will shortly debate how he will pay for it. It has had disastrous consequences for the economies of parts of Scotland and the north-east England. He also increased VAT by 3p. He took it off with one hand and put in on with the other. Paying for that will have consequences for oil exploration in the North sea not only in the next year or so, but for a generation.</p>

	<p pid="a.577.3/1">That is a very good suggestion. That is one of the issues that could be included in the review. Do the Government honestly think that they can con my constituents and others and that a 1p reduction in petrol duty will really be a vote clincher for them? Late last Friday I was in the excellent Sainsbury&#8217;s in Pity Me in Durham, and I noted that customers who spent &#163;70 on their groceries could get 5p a litre off their fuel. It is a deal offered by other supermarkets&#8212;I do not want to favour Sainsbury&#8217;s. Are those on the Treasury Bench really convinced that constituents will be conned by the 1p reduction, when the cost is being increased by 3p, and if they can get 5p a litre off when they spend more on extra groceries?</p>

I think that there is a case for part of the review looking at why fuel is priced differently across the country. I hasten to add that at the weekend, when I was in Worksop in Bassetlaw visiting my father, I went to a Sainsbury&#8217;s&#8212;it happened to be the supermarket there&#8212;and</p>
	<p pid="a.577.3/3">noticed that diesel was &#163;1.38, although down here in London and in parts of Durham it is &#163;1.42. Clearly the constituents of my hon.

I was saying that if we are to have variations in fuel prices, which we already have, and if the Government are to introduce a derogation and cheap fuel for certain island constituencies, clearly buying off the Liberal Democrats, the effects on the economy need to be assessed. I would also argue that if that is to happen for some of those rural communities, it must also happen for parts of County Durham where having access to a car is not a luxury, but a necessity for getting into work along the A1 corridor to Newcastle and other places. The fact that the Government are also reducing the public subsidy that local government can give to bus companies means that in the next few months parts of my constituency will have no bus services whatsoever on some days of the week.</p>

	<p pid="a.578.2/1">The hon. Gentleman mentions the price of fuel. In Northern Ireland this week the price of diesel was &#163;1.44.9 per litre, which is probably one of the highest in the United Kingdom. If there is to be regional help for the islands of Scotland, there must also be help in Northern Ireland for rural communities. Although he might have some concerns about that, would he not agree that it is only fair that that should happen?</p>

	<p pid="a.578.3/1">It is, but the islands derogation has been brought in as a sop to the Liberal Democrats. They have to get something out of this coalition, after all, and a few pence off fuel may well help them at the ballot box, but I doubt it in the long term. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point that, if we are to assess the effect of the increase, regional variations will need to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.3/2">As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for York Central, the measure was clearly a political gimmick by the Chancellor, who thought that somehow he was the motorist&#8217;s friend, but a 1p decrease will have no effect on most households&#8217; budgets, when they are affected by other prices going up&#8212;some of which have been mentioned already&#8212;in terms of the cost of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.3/3">The other point that needs looking at, and which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" name="Ian Mearns">the Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase> made very eloquently, is the cost of fuel for hauliers. There is a disproportionate effect on the north-east, and if any review were to be undertaken that would be an important one, because that cost sends the price of goods up. The point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" name="Jim Shannon">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase> made about Northern Ireland could also be considered in any assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.3/4">The Government clearly do not want to go anywhere near the idea, however, because they realise that it will open a can of worms. I include not just this Government in that, but other Governments as well. It is time, however, that we took an overall look at how we tax fuel to ensure that we understand why fuel prices increase, the tax-take and how it impacts on the economies of certain areas and on individuals&#8217; economies&#8212;on individual families and their household expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.3/5">At a time when the Government are providing a tax giveaway to the banks of more than &#163;100 million by reducing corporation tax, many hard-working families who are struggling to fill up their family car will find it unacceptable and unbelievable that they are being asked to shoulder a bigger proportion of the tax-take than those bankers, and the Government need to take that point into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.3/6">The Government should support this amendment, which would allow us to address all the issues that have been raised in tonight&#8217;s debate, including the important points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for York Central, who takes a great interest in green issues. I just hope that we can somehow persuade the Government, if not tonight then in the future and, possibly, with some cross-party support, to change the way in which we tax fuel to ensure that regions such as mine are not disadvantaged by arbitrary taxation increases, which this Government have imposed by increasing VAT.</p>

	<p pid="a.579.0/1">Clause 19 cuts fuel duty by 1p per litre. In fact, it has already happened&#8212;at 6 pm on Budget day. That was the first step in removing the Labour party&#8217;s planned fuel duty escalator and, instead, putting in place a fair fuel stabiliser, which will ease the burden on motorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.0/2">The hon. Members for Gateshead (Ian Mearns) and for North Durham (Mr Jones) talked about the burden that the planned tax rises would have placed on their own region, and I can tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> that, in fact, under the previous Government fuel duty rose by 55%, so it is simply wrong to focus totally on the previous Conservative Government. His Government increased the burden on motorists substantially.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.0/3">The amendment calls for the Chancellor to publish an assessment of the impact of taxation on fuel prices within three months of the Act being passed, and it aims to determine the extent to which the cut in fuel duty has been passed on. By introducing such a measure, Opposition Members clearly intend to distract the public from their policy, which would have seen pump prices rise yet further as they introduced their planned escalator. In addition, the Opposition appear keen to suggest that the cut in fuel duty and the cancellation of their fuel duty escalator has not offset the effect of the VAT increase at the start of the year&#8212;a VAT increase that as a party they did not vote against.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.0/4">I will go on to set out the Government&#8217;s assessment of the impact of this measure, as Members have requested, and to address the points raised in the debate, but perhaps I should start by explaining to the Committee why the Government took the action they did in the Budget to support motorists at this time of record pump prices. It is true that motoring is an essential part of everyday life for many households and businesses, as</p>
	<p pid="a.579.0/5">mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40662" name="Alison McGovern">the hon. Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern)</phrase>. The Government also recognise that the rising price of petrol has become an increasingly significant part of day-to-day spending, and we know that high oil prices are causing real difficulties in ensuring that motoring remains affordable. It is important that when shocks such as the steep rise in the oil price occur a responsible Government are able to listen and respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.0/6">The previous Government would have introduced a fuel duty escalator, which involved seven fuel duty increases, three of which have been implemented, adding 3p to pump prices, and they had planned another above-inflation increase for the start of last month.</p>

I do not think that that will work with taxpayers, who remember exactly who was planning to bring in the fuel duty escalator had they remained in power.</p>
	<p pid="a.580.1/2">This Government listened to hard-pressed motorists and businesses. We declined to increase the escalator and to introduce the 1p per litre fuel duty increase, which would collectively have added 6p to pump prices compared with what they are now. Instead, we responded with a &#163;1.9 billion package to ease the burden on motorists at this time of record pump prices. We acted by cutting fuel duty by 1p per litre from 6 pm on Budget day. We cancelled the previous Government&#8217;s fuel duty escalator for the rest of the Parliament. We introduced a fair fuel stabiliser that will better share the burden of high oil prices between motorists and oil companies, and so fuel duty will increase by inflation only when oil prices are high.</p>

Actually, the average haulier will benefit by approximately &#163;1,700 in 2010-11 as a result of those measures compared with what they would otherwise have faced. I also draw his attention to the remaining part of the package for motorists, which includes freezing vehicle excise duty on HGVs, providing further help to hauliers. The package is even broader than that, because for motorists who are required to use their own vehicle for work, the approved mileage allowance payments rate, which had not been increased by the previous Government since 2002, was increased from 40p to 45p per mile for the first 10,000 miles. An average AMAPs user claiming for 2,500 miles a year will benefit by &#163;125 a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.582.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is obviously one of the Labour party&#8217;s structural deficit refuseniks. He simply refuses to accept that the deficit exists. I am sure that he would also refuse to accept that his party left unemployment 400,000 people higher by the end of its term in office. We understand the problems that our economy faces and the Budget was all about tackling them.</p>
	<p pid="a.582.0/2">I will turn to the substance of the amendment. For motorists to realise the benefits of the cut in fuel duty, retailers need to pass it on at the forecourt. If the cut in fuel duty had been fully passed on to average pump prices, including VAT, they would have been 1.2p per litre lower. The amendment seeks a published assessment of the degree to which the cut fed through to pump prices. As I said, we have already published a tax information and impact note that sets out our analysis of the impact of the cut. Following the Budget, the website petrolprices.com, which gives independent average daily prices and which the previous Government used to track prices, showed that average pump prices fell by approximately 0.8p per litre between 23 and <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-28">28 March</phrase>. It can be clearly seen that the reduction in fuel duty largely fed through to prices at the pump. Therefore, prices are lower due to our actions and motorists are benefiting from the cut in duty. Let us not forget that average pump prices are approximately 6p per litre lower as a result of the cut in duty and our scrapping of the previous Government&#8217;s planned escalator, which they would have gone ahead with.</p>

	<p pid="a.582.1/1">I am a little bit confused, because the Economic Secretary is talking about how wonderful the Government&#8217;s actions on fuel prices have been, but it seems to me that in the past 12 months, fuel has gone up by something like 25%. I do not see why the Government are saying how brilliant their actions have been when people are paying something like &#163;1.40 a litre instead of &#163;1.10 a litre. A penny off, 3p on, 40p on&#8212;it does not make sense to me.</p>

	<p pid="a.582.2/1">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase> said back in May 2009,</p>
	<p pid="a.582.2/2">&#8220;there are very few even socialist theorists who would suggest that commodity prices were somehow controllable&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-05-13.918"><i>Official Report</i>, 13 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 918</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.582.2/3">I do not think <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" name="Julie Hilling">the hon. Member for Bolton West (Julie Hilling)</phrase> can expect the Government to control commodity prices, but what we can do is take action to lessen the effects of swings in the oil price as they feed through to the pump. That is precisely what we are doing in clause 19 on fuel duty, and we will shortly debate the mechanism by which we can pay for that, which is the fair fuel stabiliser.</p>
	<p pid="a.582.2/4">Of course, the Labour party has suggested that we should create a separate VAT rate for petrol. As has been pointed out even by Labour Members, that would have provided no help for hauliers, and I remind the Committee of why the Chancellor rejected the proposal. It would take six years, and it would not even be able to come into effect then, because the current EU VAT</p>
	<p pid="a.582.2/5">directive means that it is illegal. I do not think motorists should have to wait for six years, and the Government are not going to wait six years. We listened, and we responded as of 6 pm on Budget day.</p>
	<p pid="a.582.2/6">Finally, I shall address the issue of VAT. I know that it is not strictly within the scope of the debate, Mr Hoyle, but it is important. The Opposition have been quick to point out that although the Government cut fuel duty by 1p in the Budget, pump prices have increased by about 3p following the VAT increase. They appear to be implying that motorists would be better off under their plans for an escalator and a VAT rate of 17.5%, although of course we know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase> was planning to increase VAT himself. I suspect that they wish to use the amendment to prove their point.</p>
	<p pid="a.582.2/7">It is simply not true that motorists would be better off under the previous Government&#8217;s tax plans, and let me be absolutely clear that even comparing the changes that we announced in the Budget with the previous Government&#8217;s fuel duty and 17.5% VAT plans, it is likely that on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April</phrase> pump prices were 3p a litre lower than they would have been. Even after the two increases in fuel duty next year, average pump prices could still be about 1p a litre lower than they would have been under the previous Government&#8217;s plans. Cutting fuel duty and scrapping their escalator more than offsets the impact of the VAT increase, and I should not need to explain to Opposition Members that an increase in VAT was needed to cut the deficit that they left behind. They did not even have the political courage to vote against that measure, which they were so upset about&#8212;absolutely shameless.</p>
	<p pid="a.582.2/8">In government, Labour Members ran our country&#8217;s public finances into the ground, and now, in opposition, they bring forward this feeble and unnecessary amendment. Dare they even push it to a vote? We will find out. I suspect that in the case of clause 19, it will be a case of another day, another abstention. The Government are providing motorists with a fair deal. Where the previous Government left tax rises, we have taken action, and I ask the House to reject the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.583.0/1">We have had an interesting debate over the past couple of hours. It is notable that although we have had some significant and thoughtful contributions from my hon. Friends, not a single member of the Conservative party, apart from the Minister, or a single Liberal Democrat has felt the need to speak up for their constituents and talk about rising fuel prices. I am sure their constituents have lobbied them about it, but their silence in the Chamber today speaks volumes.</p>
	<p pid="a.583.0/2">My hon. Friends the Members for Wirral South (Alison McGovern), for Gateshead (Ian Mearns), for Ilford South (Mike Gapes), for York Central (Hugh Bayley) and for North Durham (Mr Jones) have all highlighted the impact of the rise in fuel prices and of the Government&#8217;s decision&#8212;and it was the Government&#8217;s choice&#8212;to raise VAT from 17.5% to 20%. They described the impact on families&#8217; living standards, on businesses in their constituencies, on the haulage industry and across the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.583.0/3">The point is that the Minister&#8217;s view of the impact is short-sighted. She cited the impact of the measures in</p>
	<p pid="a.583.0/4">the Budget from <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-28">28 March</phrase>, which must be the smallest, most selective economic data ever cited in the Chamber. It would be interesting to know what happened after <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-28">28 March</phrase>, to which she did not refer. She also tried to lead us down the garden path by talking once more about the fuel duty escalator, but she knows full well that the Opposition called for the Government to reconsider that in the Budget and welcomed the fact that they did so.</p>
	<p pid="a.583.0/5">The debate is on the VAT increase, which the Government chose to introduce. We are asking simply that they publish an assessment, within three months of the Bill becoming law, of the impact of taxation on fuel prices. I do not think that that is too much to ask. I was surprised the hear the Minister say that we would not press the amendment to a Division, because I can inform you, Mr Hoyle, that we do indeed intend to do so. With that, I rest my case.</p>

	<p pid="a.588.0/1">The purpose of this group of amendments is to persuade the Government to engage with the oil and gas industry to ensure that no major new investment opportunities are lost. I will explain the purpose of the main amendments, and I very much hope that Ministers will respond in a constructive way, because these are intended to be constructive proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.588.0/2">The Government are on record as saying that they understand the need for stability in the fiscal regime, and the Chancellor has described this as a Budget for growth. It is worth saying, however, that in contrast to the cautious way in which the Government have applied new taxes to banks, which have squandered our resources to the extent that many of them had to be nationalised, it is quite harsh to apply a marginal rate of tax of 82% to our single biggest industry. It is an industry that invests in real infrastructure and real engineering, and it takes risks in regard to weather, geology, exchange rates and cost unpredictability, as well as taxation.</p>
	<p pid="a.588.0/3">I accept that the current spot price of Brent crude, at $125 a barrel, allows for unforeseen profits, at least for some fields. However, that does not apply to gas fields or to fields with large quantities of associated gas and, as Ministers will know, that is not the price that many operators actually realise, as they often contract their production at an average well below the spot peak.</p>
	<p pid="a.588.0/4">I say in passing that the link between the oil tax changes and the fair fuel stabiliser are tenuous. Many of the companies operating in the North sea have no retail division, and there is no direct connection between their returns and the pump price. Also, the Government are themselves the recipient of a windfall. According to the Library brief and, I think, the Red Book, North sea profits are running at between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;1.9 billion per annum over the next four years. That is additional revenue that was not anticipated in the pre-Budget statement in November. The Government have also received a VAT windfall on pump prices, averaging about 6p a litre. However, my point is not that there is no case for additional contributions from North sea operators and field shareholders. I do not take issue with the Government about that. My point is that this should be done after proper consultation and taking due account of the complex character of the mature North sea industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.588.0/5">I have monitored the industry for 40 years. Indeed, 40 years ago this September, I started work as research and information officer for the North East Scotland Development Authority. Towards the end of that year, 1971, BP announced the successful commercial test of a well, which turned out to be the discovery of the Forties field. However, it is interesting to note that, believing that it had reached the end of its useful life, BP sold the Forties field to Apache in 2003. Since its acquisition of the field, Apache has greatly enhanced recovery from Forties and sees long-term potential for its development. It is worth noting that Apache has been one of the most vigorous critics of the Government&#8217;s policies, and that it questions whether their investment will be fully committed or realised.</p>

	<p pid="a.589.0/1">I accept the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s points about the North sea, but will he acknowledge that it is not only the North sea that is affected by these measures? For example, gas is a major industry in the north-west of England, and only this week, we have heard of the decision to cease operations in Morecambe bay and the Irish sea. Does he agree that that would be catastrophic for the economy of the north-west of England?</p>

	<p pid="a.589.1/1">That is a very fair intervention. Perhaps I am using the term &#8220;North sea&#8221; in a slightly generic fashion. The term &#8220;UK continental shelf&#8221; is a bit long-winded, but that is what I really mean. Perhaps the House will take that as read for these purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.589.1/2">The hon. Gentleman is right: Centrica, the operator in Morecambe bay and other gas fields, has indeed indicated that it might not be able to resume production in the current regime and with the current prices. That makes the point, which I hope Ministers will acknowledge, that it is important for the industry and the Government to come together and negotiate, in order to ensure that we do not lose investment and production that might otherwise be lost altogether.</p>

	<p pid="a.589.2/1">One of the arguments put forward by the Treasury is that the 82% tax rate to which the right hon. Gentleman has referred applies only to mature fields. Does he agree, however, that those mature fields still need investment if they are to continue to produce oil?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.589.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" speakername="Malcolm Bruce" colnum="589"  time="024:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0004.htm#11050454000074">
	<p pid="a.589.3/1">That was precisely the point of my illustration about Apache and the Forties field. It wants to invest, and I believe it will continue to invest, but it is actively reviewing the extent to which it will invest in the light of these tax changes, which clearly make the investment less attractive.</p>

	<p pid="a.589.5/1">Before I do, I want to point out that today I received the Oil and Gas UK index of confidence in the industry, which is to be published tomorrow. It is not surprising to note the very sharp fall in confidence within the industry that the index reveals about the first quarter since the Budget. For example, exploration and production companies&#8217; confidence has fallen from an index level of 71 in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 46 in the first quarter of 2011. Even the confidence of supply chain companies has fallen, albeit less so, from 61 to 54,</p>
	<p pid="a.589.5/2">and when asked why the fall was less sharp, they said it was because their business was now much more international and they expected to pick up business elsewhere that they would otherwise have lost in the North sea. That gives a clear indication that the industry is facing a loss of confidence as a result of these changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.590.1/1">The fact that I am moving the amendment makes fairly clear what I think and what I am trying to do. What I am saying to the Government&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I accept that the Government have introduced a Budget that has made these changes. What I am trying to engage Ministers to do is to understand that the industry is complex and that Government decisions might lead it to a review of investment, which I am going to suggest could lose production, jobs and export opportunities. It is possible to retrieve the situation, however, if we have an active process of negotiation. Previous Governments have made the same mistake in the past and realised the need to engage with the industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.590.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a fair point about the lack of consultation and involvement with the industry in this heavy change that has been introduced on the hoof. The Economic Secretary, who is replying to the debate, having worked for three years as a senior executive in Centrica&#8212;a firm the right hon. Gentleman cited as having lost confidence&#8212;should have known better and realised the importance of consulting the industry beforehand.</p>

	<p pid="a.590.3/1">At this stage, I am not here to attribute responsibility for the decision. My concern is&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>With great respect, Members should acknowledge that, speaking as someone who represents a major North sea oil and gas constituency, I know my own industry and my own constituency, and I also know the need to engage the Government and persuade them that they can retrieve the situation to a degree by so doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.590.3/2">Let me refer to a table that will appear in the UK Oil and Gas publication tomorrow. It shows something of which Labour Members should be fully aware&#8212;the correlation with the past. Interestingly enough, in 2009, North sea oil prices peaked at $145, yet within 12 months they were down to $35. At that peak level of production, investment had fallen &#163;3 billion a year as a direct result of negative tax changes in 2006. The time lag, Ministers should be aware, is two to three years, after which investment falls away; it is then several years beyond that when we see job losses, lost investment and lost opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="a.590.4/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good case, but he will know that it is not just the immediate impact that is important. With these mature fields, we need to make sure that the infrastructure remains in place, particularly if we are serious about carbon capture and storage, for example, which relies on much of the infrastructure from depleted fields in order to work in the North sea.</p>

	<p pid="a.591.0/1">That is a perfectly valid and fair point, and it is clear that Ministers across all Departments understand it. What I am anxious for Ministers to appreciate is that the complexity of the industry in its mature phase, the number of different players and their variable requirements all require active negotiation. Across-the-board changes in taxes without that negotiation will lead to a loss of investment and lost projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.591.2/1">Let me make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.591.2/2">With an oil price of $125, people will often say, &#8220;Most projects in the North sea are viable.&#8221; Well, yes they are, but the industry has to compete for other projects around the world where the price is also $125 yet where the tax regime is more attractive and the risks lower. That must be taken into account in negotiation, because it is the basis on which investors in the mid-west of the United States, or in other parts of the world, will decide whether to back projects in the United Kingdom continental shelf or elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.591.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman has rightly drawn attention to the loss of confidence in the oil and gas sector that has resulted from the Government&#8217;s policies. How does he think that it can be restored? Trust is what has been lost, and no matter what negotiations may achieve, what will be hardest will be restoring that trust in the industry when it comes to future investments.</p>

	<p pid="a.591.4/2">The Government have made their case for this change and have defended it robustly on a number of occasions, but that is not the response that we need tonight. They have made their decision and I do not expect them to reverse it, because the Budget depends on it.

That is a Forties field that we would simply discard. It would be a huge loss, and it would be very significant in the context of the British economy. If that investment is lost&#8212;or, indeed, secured&#8212;future jobs, export opportunities, reduced imports and future tax revenues will be affected. They all hang on the restoration of that trust, and on the industry&#8217;s being persuaded to invest in the marginal projects that might be put at risk in the absence of negotiation.</p>

	<p pid="a.592.4/1">The right hon. Gentleman is making a very thoughtful speech. Does he agree that there is a geopolitical and a national security implication? With global demand for energy increasing by a third or more over the next two decades, at the very time when the United Kingdom is becoming more dependent on imports, is it not important from a national security point of view for us to look after and nurture the North sea, and for that to have an impact on our fiscal treatment of North sea gas and oil?</p>

	<p pid="a.592.5/1">It certainly is. The United Kingdom continental shelf has the potential to supply up to 70% of our requirements for quite a few years ahead. It is a more secure source, geographically and practically, than other parts of the world where the politics are uncertain. Given a high oil price, the Government, the industry and the economy can all benefit if we get the balance right, and can all lose if we get the balance wrong. It seems to me that negotiation is the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.5/2">Let me explain how the amendments address some of the industry&#8217;s specific concerns. On amendment 13, the Government stated in the Budget that they will reduce the supplementary charge back to 20% on a &#8220;staged and affordable basis&#8221;. That is a welcome approach, but it would be more welcome if the charge had also been raised on a staged and affordable basis, instead of having a sudden 22% step increase. The amendment therefore proposes a graduated levy, increasing by 1% for every $5 the oil price rises above the Government&#8217;s arbitrary set trigger price of $75, up to a maximum of</p>
	<p pid="a.592.5/3">32%. I stress that these amendments express the proposals of myself and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40645" name="Robert Smith">the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> as to how this could be done in a staged manner; they are not the amendments of the industry, although it is aware of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.5/4">Amendment 14 sets up the basis for calculating the reference price. The Government seek to choose the spot price, but as I have said, few producers actually receive anything close to that. Indeed, it is not clear what calculations of what price the Treasury has made in determining its revenue projections. The amendment therefore proposes that there should be an independent mechanism for calculating a reference price, based on what producers actually receive. That would give predictability to the process and ensure that the tax base would adjust more smoothly when prices are volatile. I do not expect the Government to accept this proposal, but I hope they will accept that it is a constructive contribution to how an escalator could work both up and down, and in ways that would give the industry a lot more predictability than the Budget proposals as they stand.</p>

	<p pid="a.593.0/1">I am very interested in what the right hon. Gentleman has to say, but would not what he is proposing have the opposite effect to what he has suggested, in that it will make things less predictable? The oil and gas price is already volatile, and to add in this extra unpredictability would make that 10 times worse.</p>

	<p pid="a.593.1/1">No. I have listened carefully to the case Ministers have made, and it is important to acknowledge that Ministers are looking at a very high spot price and saying, &#8220;This is in excess of what the industry planned for, and there is a case that it should make a contribution to the economy.&#8221; I do not find that a totally unacceptable proposition, but I am concerned about it being introduced in a sudden bite from 20% to 32% and with no consultation or warning. What I am proposing is not an ideal; this is, perhaps, not where I would start from, but given where we are, it would be greatly preferable if it were to change in easily managed stages up and down, as that would enable the industry to predict where it would be and what level of taxes it would face. The alternative, which would not be very acceptable to the Treasury to pursue, is that it would go up on the basis of the $75 reference price to 32%. Are the Government really going to be comfortable, if the price falls to $69.95, to take it all off? I suspect not, and the industry suspects not. Even if the escalator up is not very well received by the Government, it is important that they try to ensure that it comes down on a predictable basis, because I think many in the industry feel it might never come down.</p>

	<p pid="a.593.2/1">I take it the right hon. Gentleman is not unhappy that tax levels are sensitive to profit, and I think that is perfectly reasonable, but why does he think that Ministers fail to understand that investment decisions are sensitive to tax, and why does he think Ministers fail to understand, notwithstanding the spot price, that the cost of extraction varies depending on the depth of the water, where we are in the North sea and even the type of oil that is being brought up?</p>

	<p pid="a.594.0/1">I think, hope and believe that Ministers do understand it. That is one reason why I believe that if they do engage constructively with the industry we will get some progress and reforms that will enable the confidence to be restored and investment to be brought back.</p>
	<p pid="a.594.0/2">Amendment 15 acknowledges the fact that the gas price is well below the oil price and the Government&#8217;s own trigger price of $75; $55 to $60 seems to be the average sort of price. The industry should not be facing the charge at all. There are also a lot of fields that have associated gas&#8212;in some cases quite significant sums&#8212;so this amendment simply suggests that that should be taken into account. One way to do that would be to tax the gas produced and the oil produced separately, and another would be to aggregate the two and take the average price; either way would be fairer. As has been said, Centrica is indicating that the UK does not look like a good prospect for it; the company is clear that it wants to diversify its investments elsewhere in the world, and that would be to our detriment.</p>

	<p pid="a.594.5/1">I do not wish to delay the House, but I must ask the right hon. Gentleman: when did the Labour Government of 1997-98, when I had some responsibility for sounding out and consulting the industry, make any mistake such as has been made by this Government? We</p>
	<p pid="a.594.5/2">simply did not do so. We talked to the industry; I met John Browne and he explained the situation. Although we were prepared to do so, we did not even get into any formal consultation because he convinced us in the initial soundings that it would be the wrong move to make.</p>

	<p pid="a.595.0/1">The evidence suggests that sudden step changes to taxes have been made by successive Governments and they have had the same effect: a drop in investment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> No, it has happened under Labour too&#8212;the party was in power for 13 years. The figures produced by Oil &amp; Gas UK show that the last time this happened, capital investment dropped by &#163;3 billion per annum over the subsequent three years, and that is a huge sum. Although negotiating field by field is a long drawn out and time-consuming process, too complicated for some investors, who will go elsewhere, that is preferable to simply standing one&#8217;s ground and waiting for the worst to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.595.0/2">I hope that the Government will acknowledge that some projects are bound to be delayed or cancelled because the rates of return after the tax changes make them simply unviable. If the companies can negotiate to demonstrate to the Government the level at which such projects would become viable, which requires both parties to show hands, capital allowances or other mechanisms could be brought into play in ways that would benefit both the Government, because the investment, jobs and spin-off could be secured, and the companies, because they would be able to develop viable projects, which of course will subsequently pay taxes to the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.595.2/1">No, because I wish to make progress and reach the end of my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.595.2/2">The final amendments in the group would delay implementation. The only purpose of that&#8212;this relates to the intervention from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40186" name="Geoffrey Robinson">the hon. Member for Coventry North West (Mr Robinson)</phrase>&#8212;would be to use the time to negotiate and decide whether or not we could come up with a slightly more sophisticated mechanism to meet the needs of the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.595.2/3">The amendments, taken together or in part, set the framework for the sort of concerns that the industry has and how it would like to engage with the Government. The one comment that everybody I have spoken to in the industry has made to me in the past week or two is, &#8220;Whatever else you do, can you just persuade the Government that we need to talk to each other? If we do that, we have a fair chance of getting a settlement that will not prejudice too much investment.&#8221; Ministers will notice that the rhetoric has calmed down on the oil and gas industry&#8217;s side, because people there actually want to talk.</p>
	<p pid="a.595.2/4">I hope that the Government will acknowledge that this is a real concern for a substantial industry. I hope that they will also acknowledge that if it can be demonstrated that there has been negotiation, although it will not completely wipe out the shock of a sudden increase, it will, I think, show that the Government are</p>
	<p pid="a.595.2/5">serious in understanding that this is our biggest industry, that it has huge potential and that it still has a big future in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.595.2/6">It is important that the Government back up the Budget&#8217;s rhetoric by saying that we are open for business, we want to encourage investment and we understand that the tax regime is relevant. The Government will accept, after all, that we are keen to encourage other new industries to develop in the UK, such as those that provide renewable energy, and they need to know that whatever the price regime or tax regime to which they are being committed, it will have predictability and stability in the long term. I accept that the Government have made this decision, but I urge them to engage constructively with the industry. If they do, the whole country will benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.596.0/1">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>. He has made an eloquent case on behalf of his constituents, who are directly affected in more ways than most people by the Government&#8217;s proposal to increase the supplementary charge on North sea oil to 32%. I will speak in favour of amendment 10, which simply asks the Chancellor to produce, before the end of this September, an assessment of the impact of taxation of ring-fenced profits on business investment and growth, including an assessment of the long-term sustainability of oil and gas exploration in the North sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/2">The amendment should not be at all controversial, although we saw in the debate on the last group of amendments that the Government were not happy to be asked merely to produce an assessment of the impact of that policy. That is surprising because, after all, the Government say that they want more consultation and more transparency in their tax policy making. They say that they will&#8212;I am quoting their tax policy making document&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/3">&#8220;embed impact analysis in the policy development process&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/4">and</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/5">&#8220;integrate impact analysis into the consultation process.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/6">Those are both the kind of sentences that one has to read several times before one can work out quite what they are on about, but my understanding is that the Government are trying to say that they want more transparency and consultation. We have had to table amendment 10 because, in reality, none of that has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/7">The Government are right to consider increasing taxation on sectors of the economy that are enjoying windfall profits. We did the same when we were in government. There is an urgent need to deal with the fiscal deficit that is recognised on both sides of the House, and it is right that we should ask for more from those who are able to pay, but this change has been rushed through without consultation, as the right hon. Member for Gordon said, surprising the industry, and inevitably it has fallen down at the first scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/8">If the Economic Secretary had consulted the industry, they might have told her that the stability and predictability of the North sea tax regime is important for investment. Oilfields are long-term investments that require long-term certainty and stability to attract investors. The industry believes that the value of investments in UK oil and gas</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/9">has fallen by 24% as a result of the 2011 Budget. That will cause long-term damage to the industry&#8217;s trust in the Government for short-term political gain.</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/10">I agree with the Select Committee on the Treasury, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.596.0/11">&#8220;The decision to increase the supplementary oil and gas levy by 12% without warning, less than a year after the Government had undertaken to provide a &#8216;stable&#8217; tax regime in the sector, may weaken the Government&#8217;s credibility in seeking to establish a stable tax regime in this and other areas.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.597.0/1">My hon. Friend is making an excellent point. Given the concern I raised earlier about people in the north-west of England who work in the industry, particularly in relation to Centrica&#8217;s decision about Morecombe bay, does she find it all the more surprising that the Economic Secretary once worked for Centrica?</p>

	<p pid="a.597.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I wonder what the current sales and marketing finance manager for Centrica thinks of the actions of the holder of that post from 2002 to 2005, and what experience the Economic Secretary had during her three years working for the company that has caused her to turn against it in such a fashion.</p>
	<p pid="a.597.1/2">As I was saying, there is a real requirement, as the Treasury Committee has noted, for a stable tax regime in the sector. The Chartered Institute of Taxation has said that</p>
	<p pid="a.597.1/3">&#8220;the last minute and precipitate change in Oil tax rates for an industry that is particularly dependent on long-term planning seems wrong&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.597.1/4">Does the Minister agree?</p>
	<p pid="a.597.1/5">The threshold chosen by the Government may also be a problem for stability. The average oil price in 2008 was $100 a barrel, but in 2009 it was $60 a barrel and in 2010 it was $80 a barrel. If prices carry on fluctuating above and below the $75-a-barrel mark, as they have over the past three years, the uncertainty about the tax rate and whether companies will be caught by it could drive more investment away from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.597.1/6">Had the Economic Secretary consulted the industry before the Budget, it might have reminded her that the supplementary charge applies to gas as well as oil. Gas prices are on the rise, but at less than 60p a therm they are still significantly below the Government&#8217;s $75 a barrel trigger price on an equivalent basis. In the UK, gas prices are less closely correlated with oil prices than in other jurisdictions, where there are often still contractual links between the two. Whereas oil prices are set by the global market, gas prices are more localised. Graham Parker of the Office for Budget Responsibility told the Treasury Committee quite recently that gas prices were &#8220;quite variable&#8221; so even if the Government think they have chosen the right level for oil, they might have set the balance wrongly for the gas sector. That could be disastrous given that gas accounts for 46% of the North sea industry&#8217;s production.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.598.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40122" speakername="Kerry McCarthy" colnum="598"  time="024:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050459000136">
	<p pid="a.598.0/1">Certainly, when I met Oil &amp; Gas UK, it was very surprised and seemed to be of the view that the Treasury had forgotten that gas would be affected by the measures. The policy is very much back-of-a-fag-packet stuff. It seems that, in a knee-jerk reaction to the rise in public concern about petrol prices, the Government felt they had to act on that front, and so had to came up in haste with some sort of mechanism to raise revenue to fund the 1p cut in fuel duty. The effect on gas is an important issue, and the cost could end up being passed on to ordinary people in their gas bills, either because the increase itself is passed on to consumers or because UK gas production drops, meaning that we have to import more gas from abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/2">Had the Minister consulted the industry prior to announcing the measure in March, it might also have reminded her that when the previous Government increased North sea taxation, they introduced measures to promote investment alongside that change. When we introduced the supplementary charge In 2002, we also introduced a 100% first-year allowance for capital expenditure in the North sea. That not only provided a buffer for companies to transition to the new regime but encouraged investment in UK oil and gas fields. When, in 2005, we increased North sea taxation again, we allowed further flexibility on the capital allowance. To maintain the stability of the tax system, we also gave a commitment not to increase the tax again in that Parliament. I wonder whether the Minister can echo that commitment today.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/3">It was right to increase taxation on oil and gas at a time of windfall profits, and now is also such a time, but we were conscious of the need to create stability for the industry and to maintain investment for the future. If this Government had thought their changes through, they could have taken a similar approach, but instead the effects of their hasty and ill thought out decision are already being felt. We have heard the reports about disinvestment in the industry. Centrica, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> has mentioned, has hinted that it might decide not to reopen its Morecambe Bay field, which produced 6% of the UK&#8217;s annual gas requirement. I wonder what the Minister&#8217;s former colleagues have to say about that. Statoil has suspended $10 billion-worth of investment in the Mariner and Bressay oilfields, which together hold reserves of 640 million barrels of oil. Research from Aberdeen university has gone further, suggesting that over the next three decades the Government&#8217;s tax change could slash oil and gas investment in the UK by &#163;30 billion. Production could be reduced by up to a quarter, leaving the UK more reliant on imported oil and gas.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/4">This debate is not just about the profits of oil and gas producers. The oil and gas industry directly and indirectly supports 440,000 jobs in the UK. There are reports that at least 40,000 of those jobs are at risk because of the Government&#8217;s action, at a time when 2.5 million are unemployed, including an increasing number of people who have been out of work for longer than a year. The Government have a responsibility to act with extreme caution before putting those jobs at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.599.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. The jobs being lost are in areas where there is little other employment. As he says, people in the area he represents have been affected by the decline in other traditional industries under the last Conservative Government. Now they are being hit by a double whammy with their jobs in the oil and gas sector being put at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.599.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the best way to deal with the deficit is to grow the economy? The industry was growing and investing, but that growth and investment could be put at risk as a result of the measures.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.599.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40122" speakername="Kerry McCarthy" colnum="599"  time="024:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050459000140">
	<p pid="a.599.2/1">Precisely. We come back to that time and again with this Government. They are looking at the very short term for quick revenue gain or political gain, not taking a longer-term approach. The point should not have to be made that if the Government want to encourage growth in the private sector, which they are always talking about, they need to encourage investment and have the right economic climate for that investment to take place. If the tax regime is not stable, that is put in jeopardy.</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/2">I accept that it may not be possible for the Government to consult widely on every tax policy. There is a balance to be struck between robust scrutiny and consultation and the Government&#8217;s freedom to act when necessary in the national interest, and consultation may flag up to certain companies that they ought to engage in tax avoidance measures, but in this case, the Government not only ditched their brand new tax policy framework, but went back on specific assurances to the oil industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/3">The previous Government had formed a good working relationship with the industry, which may now be damaged. After a meeting in 2008 between the then Prime Minister and Chancellor and the oil and gas industry, the Government consulted with the industry to develop a package of new measures to revitalise investment in UK oil and gas reserves. Those were announced in the 2009 Budget and included the new field allowances and other incentives for companies to invest in the UK&#8217;s smaller and more difficult fields. Such close working together is vital to the stability of the tax system for North sea oil and gas. Unfortunately, it will become more difficult if the Government cannot restore trust with the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/4">Although it sounds hard to believe, as I said earlier, last year the Government created new golden rules for themselves to make tax policy more predictable, more stable, and more transparent. We can only conclude that the Government have ditched those rules altogether, just a year after taking office, because we cannot see how Treasury Ministers are</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/5">&#8220;committed to providing clarity and certainty on the future direction of tax policy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/6">The industry body for the UK oil and gas industry agrees with us, saying that the measure has damaged the industry&#8217;s confidence and trust in the tax regime. I</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/7">cannot see either how the Treasury still believes, as it said last year, without a hint of irony, that consultation is</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/8">&#8220;an integral feature of all policy making&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/9">which</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/10">&#8220;helps ensure that changes are well targeted and without unintended consequences, and that legislation is right first time.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/11">What happened to that statement of intent from the Government? Clause 7 is a perfect example of a policy for which there was no consultation. As a result, it is poorly targeted, has potentially serious unintended consequences for the industry, and is certainly not a policy that they got &#8220;right first time&#8221;, and all because the Government did not consult on their decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/12">The Government also called specifically for tax stability for the oil and gas industry. In the last Budget, their only message to industry was that they recognised the importance of a stable and fair UK oil and gas tax regime that provides certainty for business. In 2009, the then shadow Chancellor even told the industry in Aberdeen that he would fix the oil and gas tax regime for the lifetime of the remaining reserves in the North sea. After all those fine words, why have the Government ended up hitting the panic button on oil and gas? Were they scrambling for a quick response on fuel tax after their last idea failed to stand up to scrutiny?</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/13">Before the election, the Conservative party told voters that it would consult on a fair fuel stabiliser. It said that it would ensure that families, businesses and the whole British economy were less exposed to a volatile oil market. The Prime Minister was very clear about how that would work:</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/14">&#8220;Our plan is to say when the petrol price goes up the tax should come down. Sadly that means when the price goes down the tax would have to go up but at least it would give you certainty as you go about your lives.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/15">He said that it would</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/16">&#8220;help with the cost of living by trying to give you a flatter and more constant rate for filling up your car.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.599.2/17">The then shadow Chancellor was also very clear that that would be delivered in the Government&#8217;s first Budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.600.0/1">The Economic Secretary said in her winding-up speech on the last group of amendments that the result of the Government&#8217;s policy on fuel duty has led across the board to a 0.8p reduction in the price of fuel at the pumps. Is that really a price worth paying for the effect it will have on the oil and gas industry?</p>

	<p pid="a.600.1/1">The Economic Secretary said that it had led to a drop of 0.8p at the pumps between <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-28">28 March</phrase>, which seems very selective. It is clear now that petrol prices at the pumps have gone up and that the Government have gained very little from their approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.600.1/2">In the run-up to the general election, both the current Chancellor and the current Prime Minister were clear that they would deliver on a fuel duty stabiliser. Voters were led to believe that the Government could and would act on that. However, in March, as we approached the Government&#8217;s second Budget, the Opposition pointed out that the fair fuel stabiliser was still nowhere to be seen. Even with fuel prices rising above &#163;6 a gallon, due</p>
	<p pid="a.600.1/3">to the rising price of oil&#8212;the very situation that a stabiliser was meant to help with&#8212;the Government had still been unable or unwilling to act. That was because their original plans would never have worked.</p>
	<p pid="a.600.1/4">The Conservative party had believed that rising oil prices led to higher tax revenues for the Government, which could then be shared with motorists. It turned out that, just like the proposals we see in the Bill, they had been poorly thought through. They were told that they were wrong not only by Labour Members, but by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.600.1/5">&#8216;the claim that the Treasury receives a windfall gain when oil prices rise that it can &#8220;share&#8221; with motorists is incorrect.&#8217;</p>
	<p pid="a.600.1/6">They were told that they were wrong by the chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, who said it</p>
	<p pid="a.600.1/7">&#8220;would be likely to make the public finances less stable rather than more stable.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.600.1/8">They were even told that they were wrong by the current Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, who said before the election that the fair fuel stabiliser would be</p>
	<p pid="a.600.1/9">&#8220;unbelievably complicated and unpredictable.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.601.0/1">The hon. Lady is providing a critique of our policy, but her party has just decided not to oppose our fuel duty reduction, which, compared with what they proposed for the public finances, represents a difference of approximately 6p per litre. How does she propose to pay for the change in fuel duty that she has just not voted against?</p>

	<p pid="a.601.1/1">The Minister is trying to return to the topic we debated in the previous group, so perhaps she should have been a little quicker and thought up her intervention then. I am talking now about stability in fuel prices and the empty promises the Government made to the electorate in the run-up to the election that they would be able to do something to stabilise fuel prices at the petrol pumps.</p>
	<p pid="a.601.1/2">Representatives of the oil and gas industry tell us that as recently as February the Government were giving assurances that they wanted to keep the North sea tax regime stable, as they had said in their previous Budget, but between February and April they very swiftly changed their mind. Perhaps the Minister can tell us why? What caused the Government to have such an urgent rethink on the fair fuel stabiliser? Many of us suspect that the increased scrutiny that the Opposition brought to bear on the Government&#8217;s policy might have prompted them belatedly into action&#8212;action they would have realised much sooner was needed if they had only done their homework and listened to what people were trying to tell them.</p>
	<p pid="a.601.1/3">Inevitably, given the panicked way in which it was put together, the Government&#8217;s new version of the fair fuel stabiliser is equally as half-baked as the proposal put forward before the election. As a result, potentially tens of thousands of jobs, as well as billions of pounds worth of investment, are at risk, and the Government have broken their commitment to stable, consultative tax policy making.</p>

	<p pid="a.601.2/1">My hon. Friend is making a superb case about the short-termism of the Government&#8217;s approach, and is she not absolutely right to point out</p>
	<p pid="a.601.2/2">that, in a short-term fix on gas and oil, this discredited Government are going to risk jobs, industry and investment in this country?</p>

	<p pid="a.602.0/1">Again, that is a very good intervention by my hon. Friend. The industry needs stability and long-term investment, because we cannot dig an oil well or develop an oilfield overnight, yet the Government are creating uncertainty that will send investors off to other countries where the tax regime is more stable.</p>
	<p pid="a.602.0/2">The Government have also completely damaged the trust between themselves and the industry, and that is why we have tabled our amendment. We simply call on the Government to do what they said they would do before making major tax changes: carry out a proper assessment of the impact, so that we can scrutinise it and have transparency. The Government were right to look towards North sea oil and gas to ensure that the burden of taxation was fairly spread, but without stability tens of thousands of jobs could be at risk. For the Opposition, that is not a price worth paying for short-term political gain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.602.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" speakername="Stewart Hosie" colnum="602"  time="025:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050459000147">
	<p pid="a.602.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" name="Malcolm Bruce">The right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase> said in his opening remarks that the Government wanted the UK to be seen to be open for business. That is a very good objective, but the problem is that an 81% marginal rate of tax on anything, and the instability caused by a shock 60% increase, puts at risk their stated aim of promoting the UK in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/2">The right hon. Gentleman made the point about investment, and investment levels are unchanged generally, but there is now less focus on frontier developments than on investment in the mature North sea, and that is a huge concern. The 60% rise in the supplementary charge that was created, it is told, by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury&#8212;whom I see leaving the Chamber barely at the start of the debate&#8212;was the most damaging thing that the Government did in the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/3">The Government will take &#163;2 billion a year extra in tax from the sector, on top of the &#163;4 billion windfall that they got last year, to which the right hon. Member for Gordon referred, and on top of the windfall that they will get this year&#8212;2011-12&#8212;over the 2010 forecast. All that runs counter to the Chancellor&#8217;s stated objectives of tax stability, delivering a growth agenda and production here in lieu of imports.</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/4">Let us remember that when that bombshell was announced, leading industry members reportedly met in a state of disbelief about the Government&#8217;s plans. There were immediate reports about the threat to some 40,000 jobs. Statoil immediately announced the suspension of the Mariner and, possibly, Bressay investments, and it was argued that a slowdown in North sea activity would increase the UK&#8217;s reliance on imported oil and gas, with the consequence of an even higher balance of payments deficit and the corresponding impact of a suppression of GDP growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/5">On tax receipts, Alan Booth, the chief executive of EnCore Oil, rightly said:</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/6">&#8220;Undeveloped and undiscovered oil and gas pays no taxes,&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/7">and it got worse, of course, because Valiant immediately announced that it was not going to invest in its &#163;100 million project, saying that it was</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/8">&#8220;no longer viable because of the surprise Budget move.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/9">Chevron warned that there would be &#8220;unintended consequences&#8221;, and let us remember that Oil &amp; Gas UK was very clear when it said that the measure had</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/10">&#8220;shaken investor confidence to the core.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/11">The right hon. Member for Gordon said at one stage that Ministers had robustly defended their position. I do not believe that they have. When these fears and concerns were put to the Chancellor, a Treasury spokeswoman said:</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/12">&#8220;Mr Osborne did not expect investment to be damaged.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/13">That is not a robust defence of a position; it is intransigence and a failure to understand the consequences of the actions that the Government had undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/14">There are other consequences. Jim Hannon from Hannon Westwood, the drilling analysts, said that 30,000 people could lose their jobs if exploration activity dropped by merely 15%. The detailed work by Professor Alex Kemp&#8212;I will not go through it in detail but it is well worth everybody in the House reading it&#8212;has warned that up to 2 billion barrels of oil and the equivalent amount of gas could be left in the North sea, untaxed and unused. Derek Leith from Ernst and Young has warned of projects being delayed and cancelled, saying that the Statoil decision was</p>
	<p pid="a.602.1/15">&#8220;only the tip of the iceberg&#8230;There are a lot of companies that will not pursue projects but will not go public about it.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.603.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the point made by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40191" name="Malcolm Wicks">the Member for Croydon North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> about the national security implications of this? At a time when other mature oilfields around the world have investment going in to extract the last bits of oil, leaving large reserves of untapped oil in mature fields is not only financially incompetent but dangerous in terms of national security.</p>

	<p pid="a.603.1/1">In terms of energy security it is very foolish indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/2">This is about not only the increase in the supplementary charge but restricting access to decommissioning tax relief, and that could accelerate the decommissioning of essential infrastructure. Had these ludicrous plans been in place in the past, the Forties field might not have been passed on to provide a decade or more of additional oil. Had the infrastructure which will now be decommissioned more quickly been decommissioned at that speed in the past, the new entrants, the new technology, the sideways drilling and the ability not to take 30%, 40% or 50% of a well would not exist. Once the wells are capped and the infrastructure is gone, it is gone for good.</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/3">As well as energy security, there is the question of the future of carbon capture and storage. The last Government failed to make a decision quickly enough on the Peterhead CCS scheme, which was going to use the decommissioned Miller plumbing to pump the carbon dioxide into holes in the ground. If we restrict access to decommissioning relief, we risk being unable to use that plumbing and infrastructure not only for oil extraction but for other purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40122" name="Kerry McCarthy">The hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> referred to investments in the UK continental shelf falling by 24% overnight at the time of the decision. The</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/5">scale of the impact was also explained in the recent research by Professor Alex Kemp in which he revealed that the tax increase could reduce UK oil and gas investment by up to &#163;30 billion and production by up to a quarter over the next three decades. For last week&#8217;s Second Reading debate, we had additional information from Centrica that provided a detailed assessment of the problem in relation to gas. It said that the annual cost to the UK economy could be up to &#163;8 billion per annum by 2013, that the decision could influence investor sentiment in other sectors, and that up to &#163;100 billion of energy investments and associated jobs could be put at risk. That would be catastrophic if even a fraction of it came true. The UK needs sustained and sustainable above-trend growth, and we will not get it if we undermine the main investing industry in the UK. That would be incredibly stupid.</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/6">As I said on Second Reading, we should listen to Oil &amp; Gas UK, Statoil, Valiant, EnCore, Chevron, Hannon Westwood, Professor Kemp, Ernst and Young, and Centrica. Those warnings did not start the day after the Budget and then stop; they kept on coming. It is inconceivable that all those major players and analysts in the sector are wrong, and that the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary, uniquely, are right. That is almost impossible to believe. Of course the warnings have not stopped.</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/7">Members have mentioned Centrica and the Morecambe bay possibilities. Let us look at the short statement from Centrica:</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/8">&#8220;Following the increase in the Budget, UK oil and gas producing fields are subject to some of the highest levels of tax in the world&#8212;our South Morecambe field is now taxed at 81 per cent. At these higher tax rates, Morecambe&#8217;s profitability can be marginal.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/9">That is particularly true if gas falls below 60p a therm. The statement continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/10">&#8220;Accordingly, we may choose to buy gas for our customers in the wholesale markets in preference to restarting the field&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.603.1/11">It is extraordinary that we have decisions in a Budget that will lead to the importing of oil, possibly from insecure sources and at greater cost, and will also undermine investment and jobs here when it is not necessary to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.604.1/1">I could not agree more. This is not just about Scotland, but about the entire UK continental shelf and the 440,000 people who are employed throughout the UK, including in East Anglia, off the north-west coast and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.1/2">As I said&#8212;this is important&#8212;the warnings did not end a day or two after the Budget; they kept on coming. The most comprehensive analysis of the problem is in the 2011 international annual energy survey, which will be launched at the offshore technology conference in Houston, Texas this weekend.

	<p pid="a.604.1/5">If the international energy markets are warning of significant and immediate impacts, if there is a threat to tens of thousands of jobs, and if there is a threat to tens of billions of pounds of investment, the decision is clearly wrong.</p>

	<p pid="a.605.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that because the UK continental shelf is now a mature province, many of the decisions on investment in the province are no longer taken in Scotland or London, but in Houston, Calgary or elsewhere in the world, and that the international perception of the tax regime is therefore crucial when such decisions are being made?</p>

	<p pid="a.605.1/1">That is absolutely right. I said when I intervened on the right hon. Member for Gordon that of course taxation needs to be sensitive to profitability, but that Ministers also need to understand that investment decisions are sensitive to tax and other costs. Although the field is mature, some of it is unexplored. If the perception is that it is expensive and that there is tax instability&#8212;which has been said&#8212;we will lose the ability not only to continue work in some of the mature fields, but to explore as yet untapped reserves, albeit in a mature sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.1/2">As I have said, this is the most damaging measure in the Budget for economic growth. Although I respect the attempts to amend it and the tabling of amendments for the Government to discuss, we think that it is so damaging that we hope Mr Hoyle will be able to call on hon. Members from across the Committee to resist clause 7 very vigorously indeed.</p>

	<p pid="a.605.2/1">I remind the House of my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests as a shareholder in Shell, and of my wider interests in the oil and gas industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.2/2">The oil and gas in the North sea belongs to the nation, but unless we have a regime that attracts experts with the finance and knowledge we need, we will not benefit from it. One of the amendments before us would restrict the tax raid to a year, to ensure that the Government and industry can engage in constructive dialogue that will encourage investment. It is important to restore confidence in the tax regime. Following previous supplemental changes, Governments had to work very hard to restore confidence and bring back investment, with field allowances and other incentives. They engaged with the industry and provided assurances that once the tax change had been made at the beginning of a Parliament, it would not be revisited until the next election. There is scope for restoring confidence, but some hard work will have to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.2/3">The Government need to address some of the arguments that are being made, particularly the one advanced by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" name="Malcolm Bruce">the Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase> about what individual investors are getting for their investment. It has been put to me that people made a decision to invest last June, but now the price of</p>
	<p pid="a.605.2/4">oil is $125 a barrel. If they decided to invest and then hedged for this year at $88, they are not getting $125, because the hedge fund is getting the profit. I do not see a tax being brought in on hedge funds; instead, it is being imposed on the people on the ground doing the hard work, on the skilled labour and on the knowledge and risk-taking.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.2/5">When we talk about windfalls, we have to be slightly careful in the case of an industry with a fluctuating commodity price. When the price goes up it makes more profit and when the price goes down it makes less, but Governments tend not to say, &#8220;We&#8217;re a bit concerned that the price has fallen, so we&#8217;re going to cut the tax.&#8221; If there is a one-way ratchet, that causes uncertainty and concern in the minds of investors.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.2/6">Amendment 13 suggests that if there is a desire to have a profit-related tax that varies with the price of oil, there should be some predictability to it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40037" name="Anne Begg">The hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg)</phrase> said that it would cause complication, but that complication could be factored into new financial modelling. If there was a variable rate of profits tax, any company making an investment decision could factor that in and know where they stood in the fiscal regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.2/7">It has been put to us that other countries, such as Norway, have different fiscal regimes for investment. However, Norway has had a stable long-term fiscal regime with very little change, and it has also had the attraction of less mature, bigger finds with more upside for investors. It is important to understand the confidence element.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.2/8">The Energy and Climate Change Committee has seen evidence on the wider future of our electricity and gas network. This country wants to attract &#163;200 billion of investment in its energy infrastructure, but if investors are being asked to build a massive offshore wind farm that will bring in more profits if the price of carbon goes the way they are betting, they will look across and see what has happened to the oil industry. They will not want the Treasury to come along and say, &#8220;Electricity bills are rising, so we&#8217;re going to put a windfall tax on the offshore wind farm,&#8221; which would undermine that investment decision. There is a read-across from gas and oil to wider investment in energy and big infrastructure projects in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.2/9">This is not just a constituency matter for my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon and myself, who have many constituents who work in the industry, have jobs related to it or are economically affected by it. As has been said, it also affects East Anglia, Morecambe bay and other areas. The supply chain permeates the whole of the UK economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.606.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on standing up for his constituents; he is doing the right thing. Does he not find it remarkable that there are no Conservative Members in the Chamber from Morecambe bay or other areas that rely on the oil and gas industry, to speak up for that industry tonight?</p>

	<p pid="a.606.1/1">Those hon. Members may have chosen to speak in other ways; they can raise matters with Ministers directly or in correspondence. There are all sorts of ways of trying to influence Ministers. I am using probing amendments and this debate to try to do so. If I may say so, it is rather sad that the Committee</p>
	<p pid="a.606.1/2">has chosen to focus on such a major industry for the UK economy at 1.30 am, but&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.606.1/3" class="italic">[</p>
	<p pid="a.606.1/4" class="italic">Interruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.1/5" class="italic">]</p>
	<p pid="a.606.1/6">Well, the House collectively chose that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.1/7">I want to make two final points on the instability and uncertainty caused by such upheavals. Statoil is reviewing its investment. That does not mean that it will not go ahead at all or that some of the investment might be done differently, but in the reviewing time, Statoil&#8217;s supply chain will no longer have the ability to deliver. The supply chain does not have the cash flow to sit around waiting for Statoil&#8217;s review without affecting its employment, recruitment and subcontracting. The skills base that has built up has huge export potential and earns a lot of money for the country through exports to other oil and gas provinces, but the Government need to understand that that base needs a stable home environment to ensure that we anchor as much of those profits in the UK as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.1/8">Finally, I want to reinforce how crucial the mature fields are in unlocking future investment. Many of the investments being attracted today are much smaller than before, and they would not stand up if they did not tie back to one of the big platforms that still operate in the North sea. That is why I was somewhat concerned by some of the Treasury&#8217;s evidence to the Energy and Climate Change Committee. The Treasury said that petroleum revenue tax fields were now just cash-making fields, so they did not need any more investment&#8212;but the very age of those fields means that they do need investment. The Health and Safety Executive is very keen to keep a close eye on those fields: because of their age, the safety of their infrastructure is crucial. Moreover, investment could be vital in ensuring that that hub remains to unlock any smaller fields around the North sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.1/9">Another uncertainty is introduced by clause 7 because of its relationship with the clause on decommissioning. In the Public Bill Committee the Government must address that new uncertainty, which builds on the uncertainty caused by clause 7.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.1/10">I urge the Government to respond constructively and positively to the industry&#8217;s desire for an investment climate in which it can take all the risks on geology, weather, technology and the future of the commodity market, in the knowledge that a Government who see its long-term importance to the economy, and who therefore recognise the need to restore confidence in a stable fiscal regime, are behind it.</p>

	<p pid="a.607.0/1">It is a great pleasure to take part in this debate and to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40645" name="Robert Smith">the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase>, who made such a reasonable, well informed speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/2">One question that has remained unanswered tonight is why the Government chose such a complex route rather than a much simpler windfall tax. Everyone understands that when the Government are looking for sources of funds, they will look at particularly profitable industries. However, the structure they have chosen means that investment in and the future of the industry have been brought into question. A far simpler structure would have raised the money without risking future work in the North sea oil and gas sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/3">The Red Book is peculiarly unclear. The supplementary charge was raised from 20% to 32%, but the Red Book states:</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/4">&#8220;As part of the fair fuel stabiliser, if in future years the oil price falls below a set trigger price on a sustained basis, the Government commits to reduce the Supplementary Charge back towards 20 per cent on a staged and affordable basis while prices remain low.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/5">However, the meaning of a &#8220;sustained basis&#8221; for a fall in prices and of a &#8220;staged and affordable basis&#8221; is not set out in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/6">It is particularly important that Ministers explain why they chose an oil price of $75 per barrel. It would really help the Committee to know what the Government&#8217;s forecast is for oil prices. They say in the Red Book that oil prices are extremely volatile, which of course is true, but what model are they using for forecasting? Twenty eight years ago, I was a junior official in Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury, and I worked on something called the POP forecast. The POP forecast was not about lemonade, but the prospects for oil prices in the long term. This model looked at the back-stop price for oil&#8212;in other words, the cost of making oil from coal&#8212;and at the time we estimated it would be $60 per barrel. What underlying model do the Government use for forecasting oil prices now? Are they looking at the cost of getting oil from shale? Are they looking at the cost of getting good-quality oil from, for example, Orimulsion? What is their model for forecasting oil prices?</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/7">As is evident to everybody who has been in the Chamber for the past six months, the situation in the middle east and north Africa is particularly unstable, yet despite the current instability in the oil price the forecasts for revenue in the Red Book show a pretty constant level of revenue over the five-year period. Are the Government assuming that the level of oil prices will be constant over this five-year period? That seems to be an incredible assumption.</p>

	<p pid="a.608.0/1">It is excellent that my hon. Friend is bringing her Treasury expertise to this debate. She is adding greatly to the discussion. Does she agree that one of the motives for the Government&#8217;s tax raid on the oil and gas industry is that they view it as the goose that laid the golden egg?</p>

	<p pid="a.608.1/1">I defer to my hon. Friend&#8217;s knowledge of poultry-keeping. However, I agree that that is the problem that we face with the Government at the moment. Their approach simply is not serious; it is trivial.</p>

	<p pid="a.608.2/1">Does my hon. Friend not think it incredible that the Treasury officials whom she worked alongside for many years did not work out that there was a difference between oil and gas prices? Does she also not think it remarkable that the Minister, who is a former employee of Centrica and British Gas, did not highlight that problem either?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.608.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" speakername="Helen Goodman" colnum="608"  time="025:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050460000049">
	<p pid="a.608.3/1">That is absolutely right. It is extremely worrying for the gas industry that the tax is being linked to fluctuations in oil prices, yet gas prices might not only vary from oil prices, but possibly even be going in a different direction. This is an extraordinary approach</p>
	<p pid="a.608.3/2">to take to the taxation of one of our major industries. I hope to hear from Ministers about how they are forecasting oil prices over the period in the Red Book.</p>
	<p pid="a.608.3/3">Returning to the issue of complexity and why the Government chose such a complex structure, we have to ask ourselves whether they completely misunderstood the debates in the previous Parliament on stabilisers. The Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats proposed stabilisers on petrol taxation, but that seems to have been translated into the wholesale market. The situation now is not that stability is being provided for the consumer, which was the original objective of a stabiliser, but that the Government are able to hedge their tax revenues, which is a completely different proposition altogether. I hope that in responding to the debate the Minister will be able to explain what a sustainable oil price reduction means, because it is certainly not clear from what we have seen so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.608.3/4">The other thing that was said at the time of the Budget was that the detail would be agreed with the industry and motoring organisations. I hope that we will get a report from the Minister on what discussions and agreements have been achieved. The initial press reports of her meetings with the industry were very alarming indeed. It sounded as though the industry was furious with what had happened and that Ministers did not have a proper answer to its serious concerns. It would be nice to know whether the negotiations have developed, although it seems from what we have read even today in the newspapers and on the web that they have so far not been fruitful. It would also seem that the Government, in their headlong rush, are not taking account of the fact that further evidence has yet to be given to the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change. Indeed, that evidence is to be given only tomorrow, yet the Government are ploughing ahead, mindless of what the industry is telling them.</p>
	<p pid="a.608.3/5">It is particularly worrying that, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> has pointed out, Centrica is saying that it might not open up the Morecambe bay field after the annual shutdown to perform the usual maintenance functions this year. The Morecambe bay field has been in operation for, I suppose, some 40 years&#8212;I think it was the first gas field from which we got natural gas in this country. The Minister is too young to remember the huge investments made in the 1960s to move from town gas to natural gas. Huge investments were made in this country to secure those gas supplies, and yet at the stroke of a pen, this Government are putting them at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.608.3/6">When the Government say that they want to rebalance the economy, we have to ask whether they even know that means. I understood rebalancing the economy to mean having fewer resources in financial services and more resources in other sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.609.0/1">The argument made strongly by the Government is that the north-east economy should rebalance itself away from the public sector and towards the private sector. Does my hon. Friend share the alarm felt by the 380 firms that directly rely on the oil and gas industry in the region about the effect that the Government&#8217;s proposals will have on employment in those companies?</p>

	<p pid="a.609.1/1">Of course. I am extremely concerned, as my hon. Friend and neighbour is, about the impact that the proposals will have on the economy of the</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/2">north-east, and it will not be just a short-term impact, but a long-term impact. When we get investment in the oil and gas industry, we are getting investment in an industry at the cutting edge of technology. There have been many other positive spin-offs from the investments that the oil and gas sector has made.</p>

	<p pid="a.610.0/1">That is precisely the point. The jobs in a lot of the support industries for the gas and oil industry are high-skill, high-tech and pretty well-paid jobs. Once we lose those skills in areas such as the north-west and north-east of England, they are gone for good. We need to support those industries, as well as the wider oil and gas industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.610.1/1">That is absolutely right. The investment that the Labour Government tried to encourage in completely new energy industries such as the offshore wind industry used very similar skills. It is important to have a critical mass in these industries, and the achievement of that is now being put at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.610.1/2">It is not at all clear what the Government mean by rebalancing the economy. Our debate earlier this evening revealed a bizarre situation in which taxes on the financial sector are not tough enough, while taxes on the primary sector are over-strong. That is simply not going to take us down the route that we all want to go down.</p>

	<p pid="a.610.2/1">I do not know when the hon. Lady first came to the House, but she will recall that when the Labour Government first came to power, they imposed a windfall tax that punished the utility companies for their success. Now, this Government are trying to redress the balance, while recognising that oil prices are at an all-time high and that profits are being made simply through speculation. I am afraid that the hon.

	<p pid="a.611.1/1">I entirely accept your guidance, Mr Hoyle.</p>
	<p pid="a.611.1/2">There is obviously a supply chain for the oil and gas sector. Equally obviously, if we damage the financial viability of the oil and gas companies, there will be an impact further down the supply chain. It is worrying that the industry is predicting that 40,000 jobs will be lost. Those are 40,000 jobs that we can ill afford to lose at this time. This is absolutely typical of the measures being taken by the Government that, across the board, are not being thought through. This is another example of that. The statement by Statoil that it is going to put on hold a $10 billion investment is very worrying.</p>
	<p pid="a.611.1/3">We also need to pay attention to the fact that the North sea province is different. It is not only a mature province&#8212;we all understand what that means&#8212;but it is in a very competitive arena. The Government do not appear to understand what being in a competitive arena means, or that those companies have a choice about where they invest.</p>

	<p pid="a.611.2/1">At the current price of $120 a barrel, the average return on capital employed for a medium-sized field is roughly 40%. Do Labour Members think it right that oil companies should be making 40%?</p>

	<p pid="a.611.3/1">I do not have the precise figure at the back of my mind and I am not going to pluck out of the air a particular number, which would be to behave as foolishly as Ministers. It is obviously necessary to look at the returns across similar fields in other countries and to consult the industry on the implications. I am sure that that will not have satisfied the hon. Gentleman, but I am afraid that it is my view.</p>
	<p pid="a.611.3/2">What we are talking about here is a broken promise. We have had broken promises on taxes and broken promises on the North sea. A further question for Ministers is whether they can be confident that when they impose these taxes, they will not simply be passed back to consumers through higher petrol prices. It would be interesting to hear Ministers&#8217; analysis of that.</p>

	<p pid="a.611.4/1">The point about petrol prices has often been raised. The hon. Lady has mentioned both Centrica and Statoil. Does she believe that these are major petrol suppliers in the UK?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.611.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" speakername="Helen Goodman" colnum="611"  time="025:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050460000064">
	<p pid="a.611.5/1">No, Centrica is a gas company. Oil companies, even if they do not have petrol companies within them in the UK, are selling their oil and gas to people who are delivering in the retail market. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman understood that if something is being done with prices and taxes in one part of the market, it could have an impact on the prices charged in another part of the market. That was my point.</p>
	<p pid="a.611.5/2">Let me deal now with the drafting of the Bill. Will the Minister explain why the $75 a barrel limit is not specifically mentioned in clause 7? As already mentioned, if we are to make any sense of what is going on here, we</p>
	<p pid="a.611.5/3">will need to look at clauses 61 through to 64 and at schedule 15 alongside clause 7. I would like to pay tribute to Rob Marris, the former Member for Wolverhampton, South West who always enjoined us to read the explanatory notes. The explanatory notes on clause 61, which deals with decommissioning, are particularly interesting. Has the Treasury or Revenue done any analysis of the impact on the environment of the changes to the rate of decommissioning relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.611.5/4">The amendments in the group are also interesting. As I have said, the amendments tabled by Liberal Democrat Members are clearly aimed at improving stability, predictability and transparency. The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40122" name="Kerry McCarthy">the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> are designed to review and understand the situation better. The most interesting amendment before us, however, is amendment 11, tabled by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is designed to insert the following provision into clause 7:</p>
	<p pid="a.611.5/5">&#8220;But if the basis of apportionment in subsection (4)(b) would work unjustly or unreasonably in the company&#8217;s case, the company may elect for its profits to be apportioned on another basis that is just and reasonable and specified in the election.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.611.5/6">This is the most extraordinary amendment that I have seen in six years as a Member of Parliament. It seems that every company can say to Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, &#8220;The impact on another company might be ABC, but in our case it would be XYZ.&#8221; Every company will be allowed to negotiate not simply the interpretation of the tax code, but its own tax code.</p>

	<p pid="a.612.0/1">Obviously many other taxpayers would like to be able to negotiate their tax codes with the Inland Revenue, but I am sure that the opportunity will not be open to them. Where will this leave the amount of revenue that the Government will supposedly raise to pay for the reduction in petrol duty?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.612.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" speakername="Helen Goodman" colnum="612"  time="025:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050460000066">
	<p pid="a.612.1/1">My hon. Friend has hit the nail on the head. This opens a huge hole in front of the Minister&#8217;s revenue forecast. There is total uncertainty. Every company will be able to turn up and renegotiate its own tax regime, which is ludicrous. How far will this be taken? Will it be a general principle established in the tax code for the purposes of all corporation tax, or personal tax? I hope that the Minister has a very good explanation for what is going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.612.1/2">Let me return to the underlying worry that has been exposed in tonight&#8217;s debate&#8212;that the Government simply have not taken account of the importance of energy security. Everyone knows that the energy market is under a number of different pressures. On the one hand, we must have a market that is environmentally sensitive and reduces our carbon footprint; on the other hand, we must have prices that are affordable for people in this country and that tackle fuel poverty. We must also have security of supply in a world that is particularly uncertain at this time. Wars are taking place in north Africa and there is conflict in the middle east, and it is at this moment that the Government have chosen to impose taxes that are so insensitive that they put the North sea oil and gas regime at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.612.2/1">I want to speak in support of amendment 10, but first I want to say something about the speech of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>. I</p>
	<p pid="a.612.2/2">am pleased that he has returned to the Chamber, because I was very interested in what he had to say. Most of those who have spoken in the debate on these amendments have done so on the basis of a degree of experience, which was not the case in earlier debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.612.2/3">I wonder whether the case made by the right hon. Gentleman was made to the Government before the Budget. It appears from what was said by him and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> that the industry has been saying to the Government for some time, &#8220;If you are going to do this, please talk to us and please make sure that we get it right.&#8221; The industry does not want to end up with the circumstances described by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" name="Helen Goodman">the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase>, in which anyone could do whatever they wanted whenever they wanted.</p>
	<p pid="a.612.2/4">If that information was shared with the Chancellor before he made his statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March</phrase>, it would seem from what was said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> about why he had ignored the voices of experienced people such as the right hon. Member for Gordon and those in the industry that the only thing that matches the Chancellor&#8217;s arrogance is his ignorance. Clearly he has decided to say, &#8220;I know better. I will impose this on the industry and on this country.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.612.2/5">This is not just about places such as Aberdeen and the north-west, because a huge amount of work is going on across the whole of Tyneside and the north-east of England. Some of the most advanced technical work anywhere in this country is being done there in very small factory units by very skilled men and women who are doing a great job. Shipyards have reinvented themselves after the closure programme of the 1980s and are building exploratory rigs and doing work that is vital to maintaining the skills base and developing the new work that we want to do. That will be development for not only the oil industry, but the offshore wind industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.613.0/1">A large number of individuals, many of whom live in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend, worked in former shipyards and heavy engineering firms in the north-east and now travel to Scotland and other areas where the UK oil and gas industry is based. They have very good jobs and choose still to live in the north-east. Does he agree that they are an important part of the wages that go into the north-east economy?</p>

	<p pid="a.613.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. These people are rightly still among the most well-paid people in this country&#8212;why on earth should they not be, given the work they are involved in and the risks they take in their daily lives?</p>
	<p pid="a.613.1/2">I worked underneath the North sea bed as a coal miner, so I have some experience of working in the energy industry. I am not the person to feel sorry for multinational oil companies, but if the Government take crass decisions that will have a massive impact on not only the industry, but the people who are dependent on it right across the board, we should surely question that. I have no problem with saying to the oil companies that we want them to play their part in trying to help us to get this country back on an even keel. Clearly, when companies such as Shell and BP are making huge</p>
	<p pid="a.613.1/3">profits, that discussion should take place, but it should happen before decisions as serious as this are imposed on people.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.1/4">Some 450,000 people work in the industry. Our subsea industry is at the cutting edge and leading the world. People talk about what happened in the gulf of Mexico only a year ago, but the probability is that that will never happen in the North sea because of the experience we have gained over many decades of working up there. We lead the world and we should be proud of that, but this taxation surprise has made the industry question whether it should carry on being there, and clearly the oil industry can go to lots of other places in the world.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.614.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" speakername="Helen Goodman" colnum="614"  time="025:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050463000040">
	<p pid="a.614.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the expertise, research undertaken and skills gained on the UK continental shelf in the North sea enable British-based companies to explore successfully in the gulf of Mexico and the south China sea, and that from that exploration we also gain in income and investment from dividends overseas?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.614.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40095" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="614"  time="025:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050463000041">
	<p pid="a.614.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right about that. There is no doubt that as we move further forward and the exploration starts to take place west of the Shetland Islands, presenting new challenges, our people working in these industries will again lead the way. But that may not happen if companies are frightened away by a tax regime that is going to punish them. It will particularly punish them when it is a rabbit pulled out of a hat at the end of a Chancellor&#8217;s Budget, when it has not been discussed with the industry and when the industry has not been able to prepare, consider what it is doing and talk things through in a sensible and adult way in a genuine partnership to make these things work. As has been pointed out a number of times, Centrica has said this week that it is considering not reopening its gas fields off our north-west coast. That is a hugely important area of development and if Centrica decides not to reopen the fields they will just become sterile, like so many other of our energy reserves in this country over the past 30 years as a direct result of Government failures and inaction. It is clear that the Government have not thought this measure through, and the plea by the right hon. Member for Gordon is absolutely the right one, because they should think it through.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/2">What will happen to the tax revenue in the meantime? That point was raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>. Clearly, the decision made on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March</phrase> was that a certain amount of money would be raised by this attack on the North sea. If that money is not raised, either because of the discussions that go on or because the decision has changed, what will the Chancellor come back with? How will he fill the hole that will be left, at least temporarily, if we do not go ahead with the measure?</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/3">This decision has clearly been made for political gain. The Chancellor was on the back foot&#8212;he was on the run&#8212;because he had been knocked all over the place by the shadow Chancellor&#8217;s attacks about the impact that oil prices, petrol prices and, in particular, VAT on fuel were having on ordinary people and businesses in this country. As the Chancellor would not reverse the VAT on the petrol price at the pump, it was clear that he</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/4">would have to find another way to fill that hole, and he did it through the rise in the North sea oil tax. It was clearly a huge mistake, made to cover up another political mistake. The mistake was not just the act of putting up VAT, but that of introducing a measure that was not supported and was in neither Government party manifestos nor the coalition agreement. Again, the proposal was sprung on the British people as well as the industry. There was no consultation with the industry, and when one says to a body such as Oil &amp; Gas UK which represents a group of companies that the effective tax rate on their profits will be 81%, it is clear that they will go and look elsewhere in the world. If they can get a better return, that is where they will go. We should have been discussing that with the companies before they went.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/5">It is plain to see that this measure has been a huge mistake&#8212;but I would say that. The criticism does not just come from me, however. I understand that the Treasury Committee is going to hear from a group that has been asked to report to it on the impact of the change in tax on offshore drilling to 32% from 20%&#8212;I was going to say that it would do that tomorrow, but it is probably today by now. One body, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, was critical of the North sea policy because it could deter investment in the area. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/6">&#8220;We understand the policy rationale for this decision but imposing unexpected tax charges with immediate effect is likely to cause damage to the UK&#8217;s competitiveness.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/7">The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants adds its disproval, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/8">&#8220;The increase in the rate of tax on ring fenced profits&#8230;was unexpected, and is understood not to have been subject to any consultation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/9">It goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/10">&#8220;While the measure is clear, simple and targeted&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/11">clearly it is, as the Government just need to say to somebody that they will pay 20% today and 32% tomorrow&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/12">&#8220;it fails on the principles of stability and supporting growth&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/13">The Conservatives lecture us constantly in the House on the idea that they are all about developing growth, but ACCA clearly does not think so.</p>

	<p pid="a.615.0/1">Is that not exactly the difference between this measure and the example raised in an earlier intervention about the effect of the windfall tax on the privatised utilities? When Labour was in opposition before 1997, the party was in full discussions with the privatised utilities, which might not have been 100% happy with the proposal but were altogether certain that if the Labour party came to office, it would invest in our young people and get them back to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.615.1/1">My hon. Friend is correct. That debate went on in the Labour party for a long time long before that election. It was quite clear to the industry and to the people of this country that if they voted Labour on <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase>, we would impose a windfall tax. Discussions had been going on and the companies were able to absorb the idea and plan for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.615.1/2">As ACCA says further:</p>
	<p pid="a.615.1/3">&#8220;The sudden change in rate came as a shock to those involved in the North Sea oil industry&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.615.1/4">the change was not a shock in 1997, because companies had been able to prepare for it&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.615.1/5">&#8220;and has been widely condemned as reducing the competitiveness of the UK as a target for investment&#8221;.</p>

Members&#8217; views, we respect the Chair of the Treasury Committee as someone who has done a good job for the people of this country and for the House, and when he says such things, hon. Members should listen. He is not someone who should be ignored: he speaks not from arrogance or ignorance but from a lot of knowledge. His Committee has undertaken a rapid investigation of an issue that is of massive importance to the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.616.3/2">We have been here before with Tory Governments, who have a long history of making crass policy decisions on energy. In the 1930s, the Tories presided over a coal industry that was in internal decline and had massive problems, with more than 1,000 men a year being killed in the industry and with no investment whatever. Those men were using 19th-century technology&#8212;life was cheap and people were not allowed to live decent lives. The situation was pushed back after the war when the Labour Government came in and nationalised the coal industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.616.3/3">Then there was another repeat in the 1980s. My hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland has mentioned the POP forecast and the pricing of oil according to how much it costs to get oil from coal. In the 1980s, we led the world in getting oil from coal, but that industry was destroyed at the whim of the then Government, who did that for political reasons. I can see that you are getting annoyed, Mr Hoyle, which is not like you, so I shall move on rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="a.616.3/4">The truth is that Tory Governments, and not just in the past, have taken policy decisions that were to the detriment of the energy system in this country. That is being confirmed today, because this is not just about the oil industry. As has been discussed in debates on the solar power industry, Ministers have changed the rules halfway through a process. I have received a letter from a company in my constituency saying that it is involved in a number of projects in which clients want to build solar arrays that do not fulfil energy requirements. Funders and clients are now cautious because of the uncertainty caused by the policy change halfway through discussions. The industry had been told that it would be able to set targets at a certain level, but that level was later changed and the same thing is happening now. If the Government spring surprises on companies that are investing in energy policy, those companies will not know where they are and will look at other markets. As I have said before, I am not one to stick up for the oil companies, but I am one to stick up for this country and the workers of this country, and this part of the Bill, along with many others, is detrimental to the workers and the people of the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.617.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="617"  time="026:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050464000041">
	<p pid="a.617.0/1">Let me begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40645" name="Robert Smith">the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> on their amendment. They clearly care about the industry, know a lot about it and are arguing vociferously on behalf of their constituents. From the body language of the Economic Secretary and the Financial Secretary, it looks as though the right hon. Member for Gordon and the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine are two unwelcome relatives at a wedding who had been forgotten about but turned up and started to argue about how this was not part of the wedding deal of the coalition.</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/2">The amendments raise serious concerns about the effect of the Budget not just on the constituencies of the right hon. Member for Gordon and the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, but on many others throughout the UK. I would have expected Members on the Government Benches who have oil and gas interests in their constituency&#8212;Morecambe bay has been mentioned, as well as the gas fields off the coast of East Anglia&#8212;to speak in the debate, yet we have not had a single contribution from the Conservative Benches. That should be noted by constituents who rely on the oil and gas industry for their livelihood. I am sure that if the former Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale were still a Member of the House, she would have been vociferous in making representations on behalf of her constituents. I hope she is watching the debate, even at this late hour.</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/3">The decision announced in the Budget to increase the supplementary charge on North sea oil was taken at the last minute, without any consultation with the industry. It led to the ludicrous situation mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman, with the profits of some of the mature fields being taxed at 80%. We are constantly told by the Conservative part of the coalition how important private sector growth is to the future of the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/4">There is no better example than the oil and gas industry. It is an economic engine for the UK economy. In 2010 alone it invested some &#163;6 billion into the UK economy. It creates and supports more than 440,000</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/5">jobs, not just directly in the industry, but way down the supply chain and across the UK, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40095" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson)</phrase> noted. More importantly, it produced in 2010-11 some &#163;8.8 billion in corporation tax for the Treasury, and it is estimated that for 2011-12, with the increase in the oil price, that revenue take will be about &#163;13.4 billion. To treat such an important industry in the cavalier way that the Government have treated it is a disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/6">I feel for the right hon. Gentleman. He said that the Government were listening, but I am not sure they are. I ask him to look at the report of the Treasury Committee&#8217;s meeting of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-29">29 March</phrase>, where the Treasury said:</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/7">&#8220;The 81% rate applies only to those mature fields where there is no further exploitation taking place that pay petroleum revenue tax. It is quite a high rate but, equally, there is not an issue with further investment needed there, and the oil is coming out of the ground. That is a pure&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/8">profit.</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/9">Members asked whether that had been looked at in any detail. The Treasury went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/10">&#8220;the Treasury does a lot of work on all the tax levers on an ongoing basis.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/11">It is clear from talking to the industry that investment in those mature fields is needed. For example, Total E&amp;P UK says that production at mature fields will cease without further investment. The Alwyn area is a good example of why activity and investment need to continue. I accept that the industry requires a huge amount of start-up investment, but there is also an increasing need for investment over time. For example, Total has stated in its submission that investment is needed in the Alwyn field not only for ensuring that the field is secure and safe, but for living accommodation and other investments. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that such mature fields do not need continued investment, and to tax them at 81% or 82% is, frankly, ridiculous.</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/12">Another point, which has been mentioned by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40191" name="Malcolm Wicks">the Member for Croydon North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase>, is that as technology has improved we have been able to get more oil and gas out of what in the past would have seemed very mature fields. That is happening not just in the UK, but internationally. Through this short-term fix to try to sort out the issue of fuel prices, we will leave oil and gas in the ground. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon mentioned in relation to the coal industry, after stepping away from such resources we cannot simply go back years later and recover them. It needs to be extracted now, which leads to the point about security of supply for oil and gas.</p>

	<p pid="a.618.0/1">I must say that I am completely overcome by the power of my hon. Friend&#8217;s argument and wonder whether the right hon. Member for Gordon and his hon. Friends on the Liberal Democrat Benches really want to argue at this stage for a late codicil to the coalition agreement on the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.618.1/1">I have known my hon. Friend for more than 25 years, and I think that this is the first time he has ever been overcome by something I have said&#8212;it might be the first time he has ever listened to anything I have said. The idea of leaving oil and gas in the ground</p>
	<p pid="a.618.1/2">and not extracting it is absolutely ludicrous. It makes no sense whatsoever with regard to the investment that has already been made, and it makes no economic sense with regard to security of supply in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.619.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem is that the Government have no strategy? Just as they panicked when they realised that they had a fiscal hole to fill in the few days before the Budget, so they have now panicked with this ridiculous amendment 11.</p>

	<p pid="a.619.1/1">My hon. Friend has done the Committee a favour by drawing our attention to amendment 11, and that is something that we will all want to be argued for in the case of individual tax returns. The point of the matter is this: if the results are what has been suggested, how on earth will the Government be able to predict how much they will get from this tax?</p>

	<p pid="a.619.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is also not clear, when a company negotiates its own tax regime, whether it will be a secret tax regime, or one that everyone will know? If it is secret, does that not open up the possibility of even more unfairness?</p>

	<p pid="a.619.3/1">It does, and that leads us to the point about how we would arbitrate in disputes between different companies. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40037" name="Anne Begg">the Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg)</phrase> mentioned the fact that decisions on investment in oil and gas are not taken in this country, but in Houston, Calgary and other parts of the globe, so the North sea and exploration in this country is competing for investment from around the world. If companies have to jump through hoops to negotiate their individual tax liabilities before trying to put an appraisal together, I am sure that decision makers will go for the easier options so that they know what the return on investment will be, rather than the uncertainty that this has left us with.</p>

	<p pid="a.619.4/1">If it is necessary to bring in all sorts of complicated extra things to mitigate the effects of a tax and make it appear fairer, surely the original tax is fundamentally flawed and should never have been introduced in the first place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-03a.619.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="619"  time="026:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110503/debtext/110503-0005.htm#11050464000049">
	<p pid="a.619.5/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point, and her point about investment will increasingly be thought of when making such decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.619.5/2">That brings us to the question of what the decision-making process was when coming up with this tax. We have already had the ludicrous situation whereby even a Minister who practically used to work for a gas company did not recognise the difference between gas and oil prices. In my experience as a Minister dealing with Treasury officials, I always thought that they knew what they were talking about, so I am surprised that the Treasury allowed this measure to get through, because everyone knows the difference between the prices of the two.</p>
	<p pid="a.619.5/3">We have already seen the effects of that this week, with the possibility that Centrica might turn off investment in Morecambe bay, and I am sure that the Minister will be off the company&#8217;s Christmas card list next year</p>
	<p pid="a.619.5/4">unless she does something radical to change what has been proposed. That decision will not only mothball a gas field that would have provided this country with gas for years to come, but write it off.</p>
	<p pid="a.619.5/5">What will we do instead? We will import gas, which does not make sense economically or for energy security, especially when we look at where the large concentrations of gas are in the world&#8212;the former Soviet Union, parts of the middle east and, lo and behold, north Africa. Any idiot can work out that even Morecambe bay, and possibly Blackpool on a rowdy Saturday night, is more peaceful than north Africa or parts of the former Soviet Union, so it is important that we take seriously the comments of companies such as Centrica, which have invested over many years and not just in oil and gas fields but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon said, in new technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.619.5/6">It is a dirty industry, but it is also a leader in new technologies, such as robotics and drilling, and, owing to the difficulty of extracting oil and gas from parts of the North sea, we have been able to develop new techniques that are now used throughout the world. That is why many UK companies are leaders not only in this country, but throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.619.5/7">It has also become increasingly clear that the tax rate will have a real effect on the economy of north-east England. I accept that hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies feel passionately about the issue, but the measure will have a dramatic effect in the north-east, too. The Conservative part of the coalition tells us that we in the north-east should grow the private sector, but the oil and gas industry is a very vibrant part of the private sector. Indeed, my hon. Friend has already mentioned the sub-sea sector, which supports 10,000 jobs and 380 firms in the north-east.</p>

	<p pid="a.620.0/1">Like my hon. Friend, I feel passionately about those jobs in those cutting-edge industries. Is not the issue to protect jobs today and invest in future jobs in the north-east and the north-west, including in things such as apprenticeships?</p>

	<p pid="a.620.1/1">It is, and the north-east has been able to take advantage of the change in, for example, the River Tyne, which was heavily dependent on shipbuilding. Now we have facilities such as the Walker technology park, and the city council was far-sighted when it developed an offshore park for the North sea oil industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.620.7/1">There is indeed. There are also new technologies. For example, the development of mine ploughs for mining the North sea bed for the laying of oil pipes was generated from a company that spun out</p>
	<p pid="a.620.7/2">of Newcastle university. Places such as the Walker technology park sustain offshore supply jobs for the North sea, and two companies based there&#8212;Duco and Wellstream&#8212;produce 90% of the world&#8217;s capacity of sub-sea umbilical housing and cords. Those are well-paid jobs. Such companies chose to invest in the north-east of England not only because of the skills base but because of the access to the North sea, and they are now able to export from there across the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.620.7/3">George Rafferty, the chief executive of NOF Energy, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.620.7/4">&#8220;For the last six to nine months we have been talking about a renaissance in oil and gas especially from the North Sea and the benefit to our members in the North-East as a result of investment being put in. With this announcement by the Government, which was made without consultation with the industry, there is a serious risk those investment decisions will be reversed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.620.7/5">The industry body Oil &amp; Gas UK said that the tax would not be passed on to consumers after the Chancellor warned that the sector faced a &#8220;direct squeeze&#8221; from it. That is exactly the uncertainty that exists today. It does not affect only the jobs in the north-east region itself. We have a large travelling population of individuals who travel to work via the North sea; they go across to Morecambe bay to work in the gas fields, and to East Anglia and other parts of the UK. That shows that this is an industry that affects numerous parts of the UK economy as well as the north-east. We have to ensure that any decisions that are taken on taxation do not have a huge detrimental effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.620.7/6">It is necessary to know what is going to be done when making decisions about where future oil and gas investment will go. Unfortunately, some companies have already invested in oil or gas fields on the basis of what the tax regime was going to be pre-Budget, and they now face a completely different set of circumstances. For example, Total E&amp;P UK has established Laggan-Tormore&#8212;the west of Shetland gas development&#8212;and that investment of $4 billion is now at risk. Questions will be asked of the individuals who made the decision to invest there. What will be the future of that type of investment?</p>
	<p pid="a.620.7/7">This is clearly short-termism for reasons of political expediency to do with the Chancellor. In the previous debate, we even got an admission from the Minister that the downturn in the petrol price was 0.8%&#8212;and we all know what we can do with 0.8 of a penny in our household budgets! Is it really worth making that type of fix, which will jeopardise not only the investment that has gone in to date but will go in in future? This is a world-class industry of which we should be proud in the UK. It sustains many jobs. Over the years, it has been a leader not only in technology but in safety, which my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.620.7/8">I take no joy in what I am going to say now. I feel sorry for the right hon. Member for Gordon and the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, because I fear that they will feel the political consequences of this in the ballot box. I hope that with their expertise and continued lobbying, they can change the Government&#8217;s mind. A short-term decision based on the petrol price will have a huge economic impact on the UK, on the industry as a whole, and on the economy of the north-east. I urge the Government to think again. I do not know whether they will take silly decisions like this in the future, but please can they do a U-turn for the sake of the investment and jobs that they will put in jeopardy if they continue with this ludicrous policy?</p>

	<p pid="a.622.0/2">I appreciate the constructive amendments tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends. They have put a lot more thought into finding a way through the challenges than the Opposition, and I appreciate the points that they raised. I reassure them that we are working closely with the industry. We have met with its representatives on a number of occasions: I have met with them, as has the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and officials recently went to Centrica&#8217;s office to look through its calculations on field allowances and profitability. We are discussing with Oil &amp; Gas UK and individual companies precisely the issues that have been raised in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.622.0/3">The broad rationale for the increase is that the Government are abolishing the fuel duty escalator and replacing it with the fair fuel stabiliser. Clause 7 forms the second part of the stabiliser, which ensures that when oil prices are high, as they are now, and oil and gas production is more profitable, the companies that benefit more from that are asked to pay more. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40095" name="David Anderson">The hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson)</phrase> fairly acknowledged that, and we are seeking to ensure that we do it in the right way, as he said we should.</p>

	<p pid="a.622.2/1">Realistically, it is not always possible to discuss rate changes with the industries concerned. It is not done as a matter of course, but the point about working with the industry to ensure that we understand the impact on more marginal investments is valid, and that is precisely what we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.622.2/2">The clause increases the rate of the supplementary charge, which is a tax on the profits of oil and gas production, from 20% to 32% from <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-24">24 March</phrase> this year. It is fair to point out that oil prices have increased from $77 a barrel at the time of the June 2010 Budget to about $125 a barrel today.</p>

	<p pid="a.622.4/1">The point is that we faced an increase in oil prices that had fed through pretty directly to pump prices. The increase in the cost of fuel was not just impacting on motorists, but having a huge impact on hauliers, on the cost of living and on businesses. We had to decide what was the right thing to do. I think that the right and fair thing to do was to share the burden by taking some of the additional profits that oil companies were making&#8212;profits at a level that far exceeded the projections of the companies when they made those investments. I will come on to answer the</p>
	<p pid="a.622.4/2">question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" name="Helen Goodman">the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase> about projected future investment. I will give a telling statistic that makes my point very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.622.4/3">We expect pre-tax profits from oil and gas production in the UK to be &#163;24 billion in the current tax year, which is a 50% increase in just two years, primarily as a result of the increased oil price. Oil companies can afford to pay a bit more, but hard-pressed motorists, hauliers and businesses deserve to pay less.</p>

	<p pid="a.623.3/1">Let me make a bit more progress, because Members have raised some real concerns and I want to ensure that I respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.623.3/2">The Government recognise that we need to act as a good custodian of the UK&#8217;s natural mineral wealth; at the same time, we need to manage a tax regime that tailors the level of tax to the level of profits available from the UK continental shelf. The UK&#8217;s oil and gas reserves are a finite resource that belongs to the nation. Current oil production was not sanctioned on the basis of the high prices from which the industry benefits today. Those unexpectedly high prices and profits have arisen due to geopolitical events in the middle east and north Africa, as we have heard, and the Government must ensure that they secure a fair return for the UK taxpayer, particularly given the impact that oil prices are having on the broader economy outside the oil and gas exploration industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.623.4/1">But the tax rate was 50% before. Although clause 19 has been agreed to, it ought to have been paid for by the windfall that the Government got because of last year&#8217;s rise in the barrel price and by the windfall over and above the 2010 forecast that the Government are going to get this year. The problem is that what the Government have done with this tax grab, this 60% hike in the supplementary charge, is likely to damage investment and jobs and weaken economic recovery. It is not necessary to pay for clause 19&#8212;the money was already banked.</p>

	<p pid="a.624.0/1">I only wish that the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s assertion was correct. The previous Parliament debated this very issue, and I think it was responsible of the new Government to get the independent Office for Budget Responsibility to examine it, given that there had been conflicting assessments from different industry watchers and think-tanks. The OBR was very clear that although we received some extra revenue from the North sea as a result of higher prices, the impact of higher oil prices is far more wide-ranging. We can see that from the debate that we have had over a number of weeks, which continues tonight, about the impact of oil prices as they feed through to high pump prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/2">I remind the hon. Gentleman of his own words about how to pay for the stabiliser back in 2009. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/3">&#8220;That amount could come from the VAT windfall or the North sea windfall, because it would be directly related to the price of oil.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-05-13.908"><i>Official Report</i>, 13 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 908</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/4">I know that he was talking about the direct revenues that he has just mentioned, but I think he was also making the broader point that a more general windfall accrues to the North sea industry when oil prices are high. I will talk briefly about some of the steps that we want to take to ensure that we mitigate the risks involved in the more marginal investments, so that we manage the concerns that have been raised, particularly by Liberal Democrat Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/5">Amendment 10, which was proposed by the Labour party and spoken to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40122" name="Kerry McCarthy">the hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase>, would require the Chancellor to</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/6">&#8220;produce, before <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-30">30 September 2011</phrase>, an assessment of the impact of taxation of ring fence profits on business investment and growth including an assessment of the long-term sustainability of oil and gas exploration in the North sea&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/7">As I have said, I want to reassure hon. Members that we are engaged closely with the industry. In fact, we explicitly mention in the Budget document that we want to work with the industry on field allowances, particularly those on marginal gas fields. Since coming to power, we have engaged closely with the industry, as my hon. Friends are aware. We have introduced a change to the ultra-high-pressure, high-temperature field allowance to ensure that the fiscal regime was appropriate to those prevailing circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/8">The Government are keen to continue working with the industry. I have personally met Statoil and Centrica and spoken directly with them about their individual concerns. As I am sure the right hon. Member for Gordon is aware, Wood Mackenzie explicitly pointed to the Mariner and Bressay oil fields as two of the few fields where there would be an uneconomical impact, but for a variety of reasons, a number of technical challenges associated with those fields already made them a challenging investment. Nevertheless, we are working directly with Statoil to look at whether field allowances can be developed to help to unlock that investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/9">The Government published our assessment of the impact of the measure in a tax information and impact note at the time of the Budget. Although we do not expect the measure to have a significant impact on investment or production in the forecast period, as I have said, we are working closely with the industry. First, we want to look at field allowances to see how we can unlock those more marginal fields, and secondly, we</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/10">want to look at the longer-term issues that the industry is keen to address, including, for example, achieving more certainty on decommissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/11">Of course, the Government expect that the average post-tax profits per barrel will be higher over the next five years than it was over the past five years because of the higher oil price. In its analysis of the Budget, industry analyst Wood Mackenzie stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/12">&#8220;At current high oil prices, few new projects will become uneconomic as a result of the change&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.624.0/13">However, we want to do what we can to ensure that investment is unlocked for those projects that remain at risk, so that they go ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.625.0/1">I am just a little concerned about how the Minister expressed herself in her most recent remarks. My understanding is that Ministers are not supposed to be privy to the individual tax bills faced by individual taxpayers. From what she is saying, it sounds as if a line has been stepped over when it perhaps should not have been.</p>

	<p pid="a.625.1/1">I do not think that that is true. It is perfectly normal and reasonable for the Treasury to work with industry and individual companies to look at the particular problems that they face. That is exactly what the previous Government did, and they introduced field allowances. There is no substance at all to the hon. Lady&#8217;s claim. In fact, she would have more justification for complaint if we were not taking such action.</p>
	<p pid="a.625.1/2">As I have said, the recent very high sterling oil price has resulted in unexpectedly high profits for oil and gas companies, although at the same time it has resulted in financial pain for motorists and the wider economy. The Government therefore decided that it was appropriate to increase the rate of supplementary charge, to redress that imbalance. The fact that we have acted in that way does not mean that we do not appreciate the impact of taxation. However, we believe that investment in an exploration of the UK continental shelf will continue, driven by the record high oil price.</p>
	<p pid="a.625.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" name="Helen Goodman">The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase> asked about forecasting. Of course, there is a range of industry forecasts on future oil prices, but the Government use the OBR, which is entirely independent of us. The OBR forecasts an oil price for the forthcoming years of this Parliament in excess of $100 a barrel for every year of that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.625.1/4">That brings me to the work of Professor Kemp, briefly mentioned by hon. Members. We are aware of his analysis of the impact of the increase in the supplementary charge. That analysis makes it clear that when considering the impact on investment, the tax increases are far less important than either oil and gas prices or the hurdle rate for investment adopted by individual companies. In fact, Professor Kemp&#8217;s analysis points to only a small impact on activity at the level of prices expected and using the level of screening hurdle most commonly employed by active investors. Of course, however, we need to ensure that on those marginal fields that are impacted, we work hard with the industry to ensure that investment can nevertheless take place.</p>

	<p pid="a.626.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is missing the point that because of the high oil price there is continued investment in the North sea. Interestingly, Professor Kemp&#8217;s optimistic scenario is $90 a barrel and 70p per therm, but as I just said, the OBR has projected independently that oil prices over the next five years could be more than $100. That is $10 higher than the most optimistic scenario in Professor Kemp&#8217;s analysis.</p>

	<p pid="a.626.2/1">It is worth pointing out the Professor Kemp states that his projections are all in real terms, so they increase yearly with general inflation, and he gives three different scenarios for a barrel-of-oil price plus the therm price. In each instance&#8212;I will be very accurate here&#8212;field investment is reduced by &#163;19.2 billion, by &#163;19.5 billion or by &#163;29.1 billion. Those are 30-year forecasts. For the sake of accuracy and completeness, therefore, I am sure that the Minister will agree that Professor Kemp and Linda Stephen&#8217;s work points to reduced investment over all the scenarios investigated.</p>

	<p pid="a.626.3/1">I just said that we accept that there will be a marginal impact; however, Wood Mackenzie has said that it does not expect that marginal impact to be high. If we look at Professor Kemp&#8217;s optimistic scenario of $90, which is less optimistic than what the OBR is projecting, and then use the hurdle rate most commonly used by most companies, we see that in the high-price scenario, total future projects are expected to fall from 1,099 to 1,074&#8212;a 2% reduction. We are saying that we recognise that. We therefore believe that the challenge is now for us to work with the industry to ensure that we can mitigate the risk to that 2% of investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.3/2">I turn briefly to the amendments in the names of my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon and my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. Clearly, the amendments enabled them to make the points they wanted to make, but I think they would accept that the way in which their proposals would operate could mean that the supplementary charge rise started later and lasted potentially for a finite time. It might also have a staged approach. All those things would mean that the funding would not be in place to fund the package we want to introduce for motorists. I stress, however, that as my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon said at the end of this comments, the way through this is to ensure that we work with the industry. I am pleased with the engagement we have now had with the industry. We have got through our first meeting with industry representatives after the Budget, which was a chance for them to set out their reaction to a tax rise we did not anticipate they would welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.3/3">The Government amendments demonstrate that we are engaged with the industry and are listening to its concerns. In fact, as a result of that engagement we wanted to address a technical issue that had arisen</p>
	<p pid="a.626.3/4">involving the basis proposed for the apportionment of profits. The Government&#8217;s amendments seek to address that. The legislation provides for how profits in an accounting period that straddles the date of the rate increase are to be split, so that the two tax rates can be applied to the appropriate amounts of profits. Government amendment 11 provides that a company may elect for a just and reasonable basis to be used where a time apportionment would give an unjust or unreasonable result.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.3/5">We have proposed amendment 11 to take account of the concerns of industry. The amendment has an Exchequer cost of &#163;40 million in 2011-12 only. We feel that the change is worth while because it ensures, for example, that the tax change does not affect the tax liability due in respect of transactions that were wholly completed before the Budget and that should not, therefore, have been affected by the rate change. The change follows an approach that the industry has suggested and shows that the Government are willing to change the detail of the delivery of their stated policy aims where evidence of unforeseen effects is presented by the industry. I urge hon. Members to accept the change.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.3/6">This Government will carry on working with the industry on providing certainty in respect of decommissioning tax relief. Industry and officials will be engaging closely on that important piece of work in the coming months, and as previously mentioned, officials and Ministers are closely engaging with the industry in relation to the marginal field developments. We explicitly said that we would do that in the Budget, and we are now following up on that desire to ensure that investment continues to be unlocked. The concerns of gas producers are also being discussed with them. As I have mentioned, the Government are also seeking the views of oil companies and motoring groups about the level of the trigger price for the supplementary charge, and how the oil price for that purpose is to be determined. That informal consultation will be take place shortly, and we expect to be able to clarify the policy mechanism in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.3/7">In conclusion, we want to ensure that the Exchequer obtains a fair share of the value of our natural resource wealth while ensuring that the tax regime does not impede the development of the basin&#8217;s potential. The impacts of the measure are understood, so no further assessment is required, and I urge the Opposition not to press the amendment. It is impossible not to note that they voted&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I was actually referring to amendment 10, which I would have thought Labour Members would recognise, having proposed it&#8212;although I suppose that anyone who has voted for a tax cut on fuel duty, even though they have no way of paying for it because they have set out their stall against getting the funding mechanism from the oil companies, might be expected not to have followed the arguments that I have set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.3/8">The amendments proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon are well intentioned. Let me reassure him once again that we are listening to representations from the industry and acting to ameliorate unforeseen effects. I therefore urge hon. Members to accept the Government amendments. The clause puts in place a fair fuel stabiliser, ensuring that we can pay for much needed help for motorists up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.3/9">The clause also ensures that motorists and businesses suffer less pain from high prices at the petrol pump as a result of higher oil prices that would otherwise simply increase the profits of oil companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.628.0/1">We have had a very useful debate, in which Members from all parts of the Committee have had the opportunity to express some pretty forceful points of view about the industry, as well as present facts from well informed sources. It is perhaps unfortunate that it is so late, but this still stands on the record as a valuable debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.628.0/2">I thank the Minister for her constructive response and for the information about the Government&#8217;s detailed engagement. It would be fair to say that the immediate situation after the Budget was that the Government mounted a robust defence of their line against an industry that was shocked at what it heard. Perhaps the first meeting was less than constructive, although it is clear that things are now moving in the right direction. The amendments in my name and that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40645" name="Robert Smith">the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> suggest how we might have liked the Government to proceed. We recognise that the die has been cast, although it is important that the Government should continue to engage with the industry to understand the issues of competitiveness, because the oil price is worldwide and the UK has to compete for that investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.628.0/3">It is also important to take on board the fact that although the losses in production and investment might be considered marginal, we are talking about margins on huge sums of money and huge resources. In other words, we are talking about 1 billion to 2 billion barrels of oil-equivalent, which is worth &#163;70 billion to &#163;100 billion, and &#163;20 billion-plus of potential lost investment. It is important that the engagement between the industry and the Government finds solutions that can deliver the revenue that the Government need and are entitled to accept, given the very high prices, as well as delivering to the country the investment in long-term production that it needs. I believe that this debate has made a substantial and useful contribution. I welcome the Minister&#8217;s response to it, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.634.3/1">It is a great pleasure to be in the Chamber this evening, Mr Hoyle, for what I hope will be a fruitful discussion on clause 4, on corporation tax. As hon. Members will know, the clause reduces the rate of corporation tax with the aim of reducing it still further over the next few years. That has been done by Ministers because they recognise that there is a need for growth in the private sector, and that is an aim that we would support.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.3/2">We need to consider growth in the private sector, which is a key issue that we must examine in some detail. If time permits, which I am sure it will, I intend to outline the case for discussing the issues related to the need for growth in the private sector. We must examine how we use corporation tax to deal with unemployment, which affects the regions quite considerably, and how we compensate with private sector jobs for the Government&#8217;s massive cuts in public spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.3/3">Let us look in some detail at the question of the economy and unemployment in general. There is real concern about the level of unemployment in the country at large. The economic indicators show that there are currently ranges of unemployment across the United Kingdom that cause concern in relation to unemployment levels generally. One reason why the corporation tax cut has been brought forward is that the Government recognise that they need to look closely at how they can generate private sector employment by ensuring that we expand the private sector as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.3/4">If we look closely at the level of unemployment, we see great disparities across the country. In the north-east region&#8212;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40619" name="Alan Campbell">the Member for Tynemouth (Mr Campbell)</phrase>, who is present, is a representative of that region&#8212;the unemployment rate is 10.2% and in the west midlands it is about 9.9%. Those high figures show that we need to develop the private sector. In London, the unemployment rate is currently about 9.4%. Looking around the Chamber, I see many hon. Members&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.634.5/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman may say that, but this is an argument about corporation tax and if Members wish to participate in the debate I am very happy to stay here for as long as they wish to, because we can discuss this matter in some detail. It is very important that we discuss the circumstances in which we need to ensure that the growth in the private sector is undertaken by the Government&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I mean that the growth is encouraged. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Government Members know that there is a very important debate to be had about whether corporation tax plays a role in helping to grow the private sector. There is some synergy between what the Opposition and the Government</p>
	<p pid="a.634.5/2">believe on this matter, but we need to explore this in detail and I intend to do that. Hon. Members who have supported me in Committees in the past know that I will happily discuss these matters in detail for some considerable time if required. We need to consider what the current situation is, what the levels of unemployment are, what the need for private sector growth is when we are faced with massive public spending cuts and how to deal with those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.5/3">If one looks in detail, as I intend to, at the statistics for jobseeker&#8217;s allowance, one sees that they currently show that the unemployment count increased by 700 in March 2011 and now stands at 1.45 million people aged 18 or over. The unemployment rate for International Labour Organisation-based measures of unemployment was 2.48 million in the period from December to February 2011. We need to look at how corporation tax and the proposed cut in it will ensure that we can raise the level of employment in the regions that have been particularly hard hit.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.5/4">As I have said, unemployment is 10.2% in the north-east, 9.9% in the west midlands and 9.4% in London. In the Yorkshire and Humber region&#8212;I can see Members from that region currently in the Chamber&#8212;the unemployment rate is around 9.3%, whereas in my region in Wales it is 8.7%. That rate is of considerable importance to my constituents and others across north-east Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.636.0/1">My right hon. Friend mentions that the unemployment rate in the north-east is in excess of 10%, but does he recognise that that is before the impact of the budget cuts in local authorities and the cuts in public expenditure that have been announced? In a region such as the north-east, which is heavily reliant on the public sector, that 10.2% will rise greatly over the next few months.</p>

	<p pid="a.636.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that. One of the themes that I shall develop in our discussions today is the cut in the rate of corporation tax to stimulate private sector growth. That private sector growth is extremely important, particularly at a time when we face massive cuts in public spending across the board. There is a debate to be had, which I am happy to engage in, about why and how those public spending cuts are being made, but my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> will recognise that in the Budget proposals to date for the period to 2014-15 there are major areas of public spending cuts where the corporation tax cut proposal is being put in place to ensure that we generate private sector jobs to meet the loss of those public sector jobs across the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.636.1/2">For example, as hon. Members know, we face a 27% reduction in local government spending between now and 2015. We face a 25% cut in Business, Innovation and Skills departmental expenditure between now and 2014-15.</p>

	<p pid="a.637.0/1">There are a range of reasons for those proposals. As part of the Government&#8217;s proposals to cut public spending across the board, there are major cuts which are unfairly hitting the north-east and other regions. I mention these issues because in the Minister&#8217;s justification for the reduction in corporation tax in the Budget proposals, he said that the Government were doing that in order to raise the level of private sector investment to attract businesses to the United Kingdom and keep them here through the corporation tax regime. Clause 4 provides the framework for generating growth in the private sector at a time when we face the loss of a possible 500,000 jobs in the public sector and great pressure on private sector industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.637.1/1">One of the mistakes that the Government make is to think, &#8220;Public sector bad, private sector good.&#8221; Is my right hon. Friend aware of a study undertaken by Durham university which suggests that as a direct result of the cuts in public expenditure in the north-east of England, there will be between 45,000 and 50,000 job losses, and 20,000 of those will be in the private sector?</p>

	<p pid="a.637.2/1">I am acutely aware that in my constituency the public sector and the private sector remain intertwined. They are interdependent. The fact that we have public spending cuts does not mean that only jobs in the public sector work force will be lost. The cuts will also have a strong impact on the private sector as a whole, because contracts are won in housing, local government, transport and capital projects, all of which are put at risk by major cuts in public spending across the board. This is an important part of the debate, because in his arguments for the corporation tax cut, the Minister maintains that one of the ways in which we can regenerate the economy to compensate for those public sector cuts is by cutting corporation tax.</p>

That is the mistake that the Government make.</p>

	<p pid="a.638.4/1">I am happy to intervene on the right hon. Gentleman, who has repeated one phrase five times already in his ruthlessly repetitious speech. He rightly links the level of corporation tax to unemployment. Of course the previous Government, like every Labour Government, put unemployment up. Every time it is in power the Labour party leaves the working man on the dole, not in a job, and we are having to put it right.

	<p pid="a.638.5/1">If the hon. Gentleman reflects on the unemployment figures for May 2010 and May 2011 he will find that unemployment has risen in the past year. It has risen because of the policies of the current Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition, which has ruthlessly cut public expenditure over the past year. The strategy on corporation tax before the Committee is one of a range of tools that we need to explore with reference to how the economy is to grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.638.5/2">It is important that we use this Finance Bill debate to examine the question of growth in the economy. The issue before the Committee is simply a corporation tax cut, which in itself is worthy of discussion, but we need to raise and consider other matters, too.</p>

He may have a little egg on his face at this point.</p>
	<p pid="a.640.5/2">The key issue is the corporation tax cut. An article of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March</phrase> from a national newspaper&#8212;it happens to be <i>The Guardian</i>, before hon. Members fall about with laughter&#8212;assessed how the corporation tax cut would help with maintaining employment in and attracting employment to the United Kingdom. It quoted several senior business people. Mr Roberto Troster, a financial consultant from Brazil, said that the biggest drawback with investment in Britain was not corporation tax but financial regulation and whether we were in or out of the euro. That view might not be shared across the Committee. The managing director of a regional trade body in the German state of Baden-W&#252;rttemburg, whose capital is Stuttgart, one of the major employment sectors of the European Community, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.640.5/3">&#8220;It remains to be seen how Germany will respond with a rate of 29.4%. The decision&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.640.5/4">to cut corporation tax</p>
	<p pid="a.640.5/5">&#8220;will please companies that already have a presence in the UK and will help those considering entering the UK market.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.640.5/6">However, his key point was that it remains to be seen whether it will lead to more firms setting up business in Britain. The head of German packaging company Optima, which is based in south-west Germany, has an office in the United Kingdom and is considering setting up a factory here, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.640.5/7">&#8220;Taxes should never be the decisive factor when it comes to deciding where a business should be based.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.640.5/8">I simply put on the table the fact that we need to discuss what attracts business to come to the United Kingdom, to remain here, and to invest. The level of corporation tax undoubtedly plays a part in that, but we need to look at other factors, including major issues to do with skills development, public spending and employment opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="a.641.1/1">Exactly. One of the key issues that we need to consider is the relationship between the north of Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because that involves important issues to do with the rate of corporation tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.641.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40556" name="Laura Sandys">The hon. Member for South Thanet (Laura Sandys)</phrase> is in the Chamber. I would welcome, as an example, a discussion about whether the 2,400 jobs lost at Pfizer in her constituency would have been retained by a lower level of corporation tax now and in future. I have great concern about the fact that those jobs have been lost, as the article in front of me dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-02">2 February</phrase> indicates. I pay tribute to the hon. Lady for her decision in taking that issue to the heart of Government and to the Prime Minister. I pay tribute to the Prime Minister for arguing with the company about maintaining its presence in Kent. My key point is that the Government have proposed a lower corporation tax rate over the next four years, but Pfizer has still chosen to leave the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.641.2/1">I would like to make it clear that Pfizer has made the specific point to the Government, to me and to its employees that there was absolutely nothing that the British Government could have done, under the last Administration or this Administration, that would have had any impact on its closure decision. I would say, however, that this Government have moved into action extremely quickly to address the situation, to put the right measures in place so that we are, hopefully, at the forefront of achieving enterprise zone status, and to ensure that everybody in my constituency has the support that Government can deliver. The situation was nothing, but nothing to do with corporation tax.</p>

	<p pid="a.641.3/1">I recognise what the hon. Lady says. My point is not related to that issue. My point is that the change in the corporation tax rate has not impacted on companies such as Pfizer that are investing in this country. I want to know from the Minister how we will replace those private sector jobs, and whether the corporation tax cut, which we support, will achieve those objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.641.4/1">We will achieve new jobs in the area by encouraging small businesses to set up, and they are highly sensitive to corporation tax. We can achieve that by ensuring that the private sector feels that Britain is open for business. There is a big challenge in my area and in many other parts of the country. We have to ensure that the corporation tax level is an incentive for new businesses that delivers new jobs in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.642.0/1">I would not disagree with that. In fact, we believe that the clause is very valuable. The simple point I am putting to the Committee is that when we have a trajectory for corporate tax cuts now and for each of the next three years, which will cost considerable lost income, I want to ensure that it is effective, and that it attracts new businesses to Kent and elsewhere. Importantly, whereas the unemployment rate in Kent is 6%, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, it is more than 10%. I need to know how the Minister envisages that corporation tax cut being effective in ensuring that we increase employment in the private sector in the regions where it is needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.642.1/1">Will the right hon. Gentleman explain to the Committee what role he thinks corporation tax played in the deindustrialisation of this country, given that 1.5 million manufacturing jobs were lost under the Labour Government, whereas the previous Conservative Government added 400,000 in the last few years before they left office? Why is it that Labour destroyed so many jobs in manufacturing and stopped us from making things?</p>

	<p pid="a.642.2/1">I pray in aid my constituency, which contains the firm Airbus, which makes world-class planes, employs 6,500 to 7,000 people, and has 50% of the world market. It was supported by investment from the Labour Government through research grants, loan aid and support to develop jobs. I will not take lessons from the hon. Gentleman about the active participation of Government in the private sector to create jobs.</p>

	<p pid="a.642.3/1">I sympathise with the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40556" name="Laura Sandys">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Laura Sandys)</phrase>. When such jobs are lost, it is important that Government, local government and others come together to rally behind jobs. In the north-east, there were numerous examples in the 1980s of the Tory Government doing nothing at all to replace jobs. In contrast, does my right hon. Friend agree that Nissan decided to produce the new Leaf generation of vehicles in the north-east at Sunderland not only because of its efficient and good work force, but because of the regional development agency, which the coalition has abolished.</p>

	<p pid="a.642.4/1">Whatever mistakes the previous Labour Government sometimes made&#8212;every Government will make mistakes&#8212;they believed in partnership between the public and private sector to create employment. The point is that the extra cut announced in this year&#8217;s Budget will cost the Treasury about &#163;425 million in 2011-12 and nearly &#163;1.1 billion by 2015-16. As I have said, we support that general approach to the corporation tax cut, but if we are forgoing income of about &#163;1 billion by 2015-16 through lost corporation tax, we need assurances from the Minister that he believes there will be a trajectory of job creation. We need to know how many jobs will be created by the cut, where those jobs will be, which regions will benefit, how we will develop the public-private partnership through those jobs and how we will develop the private sector for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.642.4/2">The Minister has to tell the Committee exactly how the corporation tax cut will benefit the private sector through job creation. If it does not develop and benefit</p>
	<p pid="a.642.4/3">the private sector through direct job creation, we will be giving businesses a tax cut for no subsequent increase in employment.</p>

	<p pid="a.643.0/1">We heard earlier that the cut would basically give banks a cash hand-out of nearly &#163;100 million, but it will not help the small building companies that are already laying people off in my constituency because local government contracts are being lost and because of the housing market. Those businesses will not be there to benefit from any tax cuts that any Government bring in, because of the local spending cuts that have been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.643.1/1">My hon. Friend makes the point strongly. The funding for regional development agencies and for training grounds, which are being lost, and the &#163;1 billion of public expenditure lost to the Welsh Assembly Government, was money that filtered its way into the private sector. We are now faced with a discussion about the &#163;1.1 billion cut in corporation tax revenues in 2015-16, which is lost income to the Treasury. Ministers say that that will generate private sector employment across the board, with jobs being created and extra investment being brought to the United Kingdom. We need to know from the Minister what the trajectory of that job creation will be, where and how he expects jobs to be created, what his assessment is of the number of new businesses in the regions and whether he expects the corporation tax cut to be crucial in maintaining businesses in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.643.2/1">Does my right hon. Friend recognise that to pay for the corporation tax cut, the Government are having to slash investment allowances by &#163;2.6 billion? That money is needed for the manufacturing industry to create the private sector jobs that this country so desperately needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.643.3/1">When we originally wished to discuss these matters, we looked into that point, because the corporation tax cut is clearly linked to clause 10, which is about the proposed cuts to plant and machinery writing-down allowances. We will come on to that at a later stage, possibly this evening or possibly tomorrow&#8212;who knows? Those matters are inextricably linked.</p>
	<p pid="a.643.3/2">We wish to explore the impact of the corporation tax cut because we want to hear clearly from the Minister how, where, in what sectors and when he expects it to have the impact that he wants. If we are forgoing a considerable amount of tax revenue, we are presumably doing so because we believe it will help to grow the private sector. I need to know from the Minister this evening, or whenever we hear from him, which sectors he believes are under threat; which ones he believes will particularly benefit from the corporation tax cut; which ones would have left the UK had the corporation tax cut not been introduced; which ones will be attracted to the UK because of the lower corporation tax; and how the change fits into the wider growth strategy of training, investment, university education, public sector investment, skill development, innovation and the development of products for us to manufacture and sell to the world at large.</p>

	<p pid="a.643.4/1">The abolition of RDAs will be compensated by the reduction in corporation tax, but how will the Government calculate that? In my constituency of Gateshead, the economy is much diversified compared</p>
	<p pid="a.643.4/2">with the 1980s&#8212;there are many fewer large engineering companies and many more technical engineering ones. However, there is no sign that this gift, in comparison with the RDA offer, will bring the regeneration that the area greatly needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.644.0/1">RDAs are a very important factor in our discussion. The Minister indicated why the corporation tax cut should progress. Simply, he believes that the measure will help to compensate for the loss of public spending across the board. We need to look at that in great detail, and I want the Minister to respond on three particular issues. First, which businesses that would have left the UK will be maintained here by the corporation tax cut? If we forgo that &#163;1.1 billion, which companies would leave if the cut is not undertaken? Secondly, which businesses and sectors can the Minister most attract to the UK from France, Germany and other places abroad because of the corporation tax cut? Thirdly, does he believe that some businesses will not grow in the UK if we do not make that cut?</p>
	<p pid="a.644.0/2">Those are legitimate questions and legitimate points that we needed to make. The official Opposition support the principle behind clause 4 and we will not oppose it. The clause is the direction of travel that we need to take, but it is incumbent on the Minister to outline to us in clear and detailed terms how those objectives will be met. At a time of massive public spending cuts and growing unemployment in the country at large, and when 500,000 are being made unemployed, we need to know how this corporation tax cut fits into a wider growth strategy in the UK as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.644.4/1">That is the key issue. This is why the discussion has strayed into public spending. The Exchequer Secretary has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.644.4/2">&#8220;I make four arguments for prioritising this move to reduce corporation tax. First, corporation tax rates are important in themselves in selling the UK. They are an advert for the economy and for the UK as a good place to do business. By reducing our rate we are sending the strongest possible message that Britain is open for business. Secondly, this cut is a necessary step to help to rebalance the economy&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.644.4/3">which was the very point made just now by my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham. The Exchequer Secretary added:</p>
	<p pid="a.644.4/4">&#8220;As we take tough measures to scale back the public sector, we must provide the necessary boost to the private sector. Thirdly, the OECD&#8217;s estimates suggest that corporation tax is an inefficient and growth-damaging tax. Lower corporation tax rates encourage investment, which this country needs to support the recovery. Finally&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.644.4/5">in the Exchequer Secretary&#8217;s own words&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.644.4/6">&#8220;far from merely being a tax cut for profitable companies, they will provide the boost to investment that is vital for Britain&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-07-12.750"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 July 2010; Vol. 513, c. 750</phrase>.]</p>

The situation that I am speaking under is one that does not expand our opportunities, however, because on this subject I am denied the opportunity of saying what I am entirely free to say in broadcasts or on blogs outside this House. In this House my mouth is bandaged by archaic rules that deny me the chance to be critical of certain individuals. I can be sycophantically, emetically in praise of those individuals&#8212;that is not limited in any way&#8212;but I am not allowed to criticise them. I therefore make the point that I am speaking under constraints that I hope we will remove at a later date. This debate is, I believe, a step on the way towards tabling a motion that will liberate us as MPs to talk freely about subjects that are discussed throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/2">The role of the special trade representative has been a matter of great controversy, discussion and debate. It is a hot topic everywhere, in the newspapers, in the pubs and on blogs, but the only place that we cannot discuss it fully is in this House&#8212;the place where we should be allowed to do so, because we can do something to reform the role if necessary. The role is a very strange one. There is no wage paid, but it is claimed that our present trade envoy has cost the taxpayer about &#163;4 million in the last 10 years, not including the costs to protection officers. What is the job? It is impossible to find a job description, but one might say that skills in diplomacy, expertise in trade and industry, and sensitivity about our ethical standing would be needed in such a job.</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/3">The present envoy was appointed to his role by Her Majesty the Queen after consultation with the Cabinet Office, UK Trade &amp; Investment, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and he was given the title of UK&#8217;s special representative for international trade and investment. Is there a problem with the position at the moment? There certainly appears to be a problem with the lack of competition for the job. There is no open competition; there is no pre-appointment hearing or anything of that kind; and there seems to be only one qualification&#8212;namely, membership of a certain family, as the job was inherited from another member of that family.</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/4">Are there any matters that deserve our concern? Many groups have suggested that there are. A coalition of human rights groups is calling for a review into how the Government do business with non-democratic regimes around the world. Those groups say that the Government&#8217;s stated position on human rights, corporate responsibility and the rule of law is at odds with their apparent position of trading with autocratic or corrupt politicians. Human Rights Watch, Index on Censorship, the Corner House, Global Witness and Campaign Against Arms Trade say that recent publicity has underlined fundamental failings in this country&#8217;s supposedly ethical foreign policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/5">Tom Porteous, the UK director of Human Rights Watch and a Foreign Office adviser, said that recent publicity was making the UK &#8220;look stupid&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/6">Those calls for action follow concern about delays in implementing the Bribery Act 2010&#8212;delays that have left the Government open to claims that they are not really committed to fighting corruption. Campaigners allege that they have yet to receive a response from the coalition&#8217;s international anti-corruption champion, the Justice Secretary, after requesting details of the Government&#8217;s strategy on tackling dishonest business practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/7">Tom Porteous, a member of the Government&#8217;s advisory group, which was created by the Foreign Secretary, and someone whose job is to examine the ethical dimension of British foreign policy, said that Ministers needed to rethink their way of doing business. Nicholas Hildyard of the Corner House has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/8">&#8220;There is an absolute necessity to have an ethical foreign policy with very strict screening into what goes where, proper screening of all government-supported exports in the context of human rights.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/9">Robert Palmer of Global Witness makes a similar point. Richard Alderman, the director of the Serious Fraud Office and a key figure in cracking down on business bribes to win contracts, told the Home Secretary of growing concerns over the delays in implementing the Bribery Act. He reported warning that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the US Justice Department had been unhappy with the coalition&#8217;s decision to push back the legislation&#8217;s introduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/10">Those are bodies of great seriousness, and they are expressing concern about the present situation. Rather more telling, however, is the evidence from Stephen Day, a former ambassador. He writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.646.2/11">&#8220;The suggestion that an envoy is needed to &#8216;open doors&#8217; is insulting to our ambassadors. Has that not been their primary job, as representatives of the Queen to foreign Heads of State? And are they not fully competent to support serious business proposals, as welcome to the host country as they will be to Britain? Trade promotion is a serious, long-term commitment, in which the embassy can give the best informed guidance and work effectively in partnership with the British enterprise and in step with Whitehall and other agencies to consolidate reputations and build long-term success. The message being spread around the world at the moment is that Britain is so desperate for business, and so incapable of competing openly, that it needs a back-door approach and is content to work closely with dodgy fixers and politicians&#8212;i.e. that British business is incapable of winning contracts through professional, legal means .&#8221;</p>

In my experience, having done the shadow trade job, Prince Andrew goes round the world, opens a lot of doors and does a lot of trade for the UK, and I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituency needed the jobs that are created by businesses that export round the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.648.6/1">This is the second part of the debate; the first part on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-17">17 March</phrase> was interrupted when I could not take the line that the hon. Gentleman urges me to take without transgressing the rules of the House. Those rules need to be changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.648.6/2">Stephen Day, a former ambassador, talked about the ambassador in Doha as an example. His letter said:</p>
	<p pid="a.648.6/3">&#8220;We have an excellent ambassador in Doha and Sheik Hamad is the most accessible of rulers, in person and on the telephone. To use such an intermediary strikes me as crassly inappropriate&#8230; Of course the Amirs and Sheikhs engage with trade and finance, but this is generally done privately through agents and associates, not by principals directly. To use&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.648.6/4">an envoy</p>
	<p pid="a.648.6/5">&#8220;for such a purpose is seen by Arabs as crude and unworthy of our historic connections. It is quite the wrong way to promote our interests in this important region of the world and the sooner we are seen to have re-learned how to engage with Arabs the better.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.648.6/6">That is what a greatly experienced ambassador says.</p>
	<p pid="a.648.6/7">There is an argument for saying that the role is of great importance and has great potential to promote our industries and that many thousands of jobs depend on the relationships we have with other countries. Are we doing this the right way? There is powerful evidence from human rights organisations and from the former ambassador that we are not and that we are losing ground because of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.648.6/8">Natasha Schmidt, assistant editor of the Index on Censorship, said people were angered by links between our trade envoy and President Aliyev of Azerbaijan, whose country is one of the most corrupt in the world. It routinely oppresses its own people and there are allegations involving torture of political opponents and rigged elections by Aliyev&#8217;s regime. There are also allegations by some of the employees of the agency of a close relationship with President Aliyev. Natascha Schmidt said:</p>
	<p pid="a.648.6/9">&#8220;It is absolutely appalling that the envoy would have such close links with Aliyev, an authoritarian ruler who has shown himself to be completely intolerant to criticism and is an enemy of free speech&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.648.6/10">We live in an era of openness, transparency and scrutiny of appointments. A major advance are the pre-appointment hearings in the House, when someone going for a major job appears before a Select Committee to justify the appointment. That is wholly healthy and beneficial.</p>

	<p pid="a.649.0/1">I am listening carefully to what the hon. Gentleman has to say, but I must say that I am not entirely clear&#8212;perhaps he will enlighten the House&#8212;whether the purpose is to debate the role of our individual special envoy, to raise the question of whether we need a special envoy or to debate British trade policy and which countries we should or should not trade with. Will the hon. Gentleman enlighten us?</p>

	<p pid="a.649.1/1">It is all those things: the question of whether we need a special envoy and whether it is beneficial or not. Within the limits I have set out, I am able only to point obliquely to my view that it is perhaps not always beneficial to have one. If we have one, that person should not be chosen merely on the basis of what advantages he or she has inherited, and the choice should not be limited to a single family. There should be open competition, so that we can acquire someone who can do the job in the manner that is required. It should not involve work that can be done far more effectively by ambassadors who know their countries and know what the opportunities are.</p>
	<p pid="a.649.1/2">The need for this position, and the manner in which it serves or does not serve the country, should be examined by the House of Commons fully and fairly, and not under the restrictions by which I am governed tonight. The antique rules of the House frustrated my earlier attempts to debate this issue in a meaningful way. In a grown-up, modern Parliament, no issue should be beyond our surveillance and, if necessary, our criticism. It is our duty to remove this gag, and to speak freely as citizens rather than being silenced as subjects.</p>

	<p pid="a.650.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40424" name="Paul Flynn">The hon. Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> has made a number of points that I do not think I can answer tonight, because they are not the responsibility of my Department. I consider that the question of whether he is gagged by the orders of the House is a matter for other House authorities, and I am sure that it will be dealt with in the usual way. I assume that he does not expect me to deal with those points. However, he managed to raise other important issues about the role of the special representative for international trade and investment, although I should say at the outset that I could not disagree more with his conclusions about that job.</p>
	<p pid="a.650.0/2">The hon. Gentleman talked a great deal about what he considered to be the problem of a lack of competition in the job, as if membership of the Royal Family were open to competition. I think most people will find that a rather odd position for him to take. However, I am pleased to note that he is now in favour of competition, as he does not often take that line.</p>
	<p pid="a.650.0/3">I, for one, believe that the Duke of York does an excellent job as the UK&#8217;s special representative for international trade and investment. He promotes UK business interests around the world, and helps to attract inward investment. He has been the UK&#8217;s special representative since <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase>, and it is interesting that there has been no debate of this kind during the period of nearly 10 years since his appointment. During that time he has had a long-standing success in the role, representing a continued interest on the part of the Royal Family in supporting British business and international trade and investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.650.0/4">Since taking on his role, the Duke of York has built a substantial network of contacts at high level in both Government and business overseas. Those links help the duke to make a major impact in a range of markets around the world. He has made a valuable contribution in developing significant opportunities for British business through the role, and continues to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.650.0/5">The hon. Gentleman could have talked about how he would assess that, and what evidence we could provide. Of course, it is often difficult to prove that a particular intervention by a particular person at a particular time results in a particular success. However, if we listen to the voice of British business, it is absolutely clear that it endorses the role of the Duke of York. Many who have worked with the duke have found that he is a real asset for our country in supporting UK business. A letter from a group of prominent business people published recently by <i>The Sunday Times</i> underlines the duke&#8217;s commitment to helping the country to respond to the current very difficult period for our economy through the work that he does in support of a trade-led recovery.</p>

	<p pid="a.651.1/1">I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman makes that point because, as I shall go on to set out, a lot of people have contemporaneously spoken out in favour of the Duke of York&#8217;s work. That letter did say that</p>

Let me give an indication of the cost of these visits. In 2008-09, the costs amounted to just over &#163;149,000 and just over &#163;154,000 in 2009-10, and the flights are paid for by the royal travel budget.

I am rebutting that point of substance.</p>
	<p pid="a.651.6/2">Let me now deal with the duke&#8217;s appointment to this position. We are sometimes asked: what are the terms of the duke&#8217;s employment as special representative for international trade and investment? Does he have a contract? The hon. Gentleman wanted to have a job</p>
	<p pid="a.651.6/3">description and competition for the role. We are also asked who invited the duke to take on this job. In response, I wish to make a number of key points. First, the role is not an appointment within the remit of the civil service commissioners or the Commissioner for Public Appointments. It is a special role and it represents a continued interest by the royal family in supporting British business and international trade. Prior to the Duke of York&#8217;s appointment, the Duke of Kent was vice-chair of the British Overseas Trade Board from 1976 and latterly vice-chair of British Trade International until April 2001&#8212;the Duke of York was appointed in October 2001. So the royal family, in different roles and in different personages, have been fulfilling this type of role for many years. This is not a new thing and successive Governments of different persuasions have found this work to be valuable. Diplomats and business people in our country have valued the contribution made by the royal family in this regard.</p>

	<p pid="a.652.0/1">My hon. Friend makes the legitimate point that many organisations and British business have found this role to be valuable for how they conduct business overseas. This year, many British businesses have recorded in the printed media that they have found in the recent past that the role of the Duke of York&#8212;they made no reference to his specific conduct&#8212;to be useful to the way in which they have conducted their business and their exports overseas. I am sure that the Minister would agree with that.</p>

	<p pid="a.652.1/1">My hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right and I can certainly agree with that. It is also worth pointing out that the Duke of York not only helps UKTI and with related activities but assists in the objectives of other Departments, such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of Energy and Climate Change, when he is asked to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.652.1/2">The duke&#8217;s programme of visits is agreed by the Royal Visits Committee. A great deal of discussion and planning goes into deciding where His Royal Highness should visit and UKTI works with the duke&#8217;s private office to develop a programme of visits that complement the work and support the objectives of UKTI and make best use of the duke&#8217;s time to support the strategic aims and goals of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government. It is not a question of the special representative freelancing: he plans his programmes to operate within a strict framework. The programme is reviewed regularly and is confirmed alongside other overseas visits undertaken by other members of the royal family and by senior politicians such as the Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary and Business Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.652.1/3">The duke&#8217;s visits focus primarily on those priority markets for the UK where the duke is well placed to make a positive impact. His visit programmes generally include visits to priority markets in the middle east, south-east Asia, China, India, Russia, central Asia and South America, as well as to the US and other developed markets. The visits relate to sectors that are or will be key to the UK&#8217;s future export growth. They include financial services, energy, advanced engineering, information and communication technology, life sciences and creative industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.652.1/4">The duke has been visiting many of those priority global markets since 2001 and has developed strong relationships with key opinion formers and decision</p>
	<p pid="a.652.1/5">makers. For example, in 2008-09, His Royal Highness undertook nine overseas visits, visiting 16 countries. These involved 117 business engagements and openings, 27 political engagements and 28 with Heads of State. In 2009-10, His Royal Highness undertook 12 overseas visits, visiting 18 countries. This involved 163 business engagements and openings, 39 of which were political and 18 with Heads of State. This is a record of engagement that this House should recognise.</p>

	<p pid="a.653.0/1">I hesitate to interrupt the Minister reading from the websites of the person and the Department involved, but he has made no attempt to answer my questions or to respond either to the serious criticism by the human rights organisations I cited or to what the former ambassador said about there being a far better way of doing the job, which is to allow ambassadors to do the job for which they are paid and skilled. Is that not a fair criticism?</p>

	<p pid="a.653.1/1">I disagree. I have provided evidence rather than innuendo to show that the Duke of York is undertaking a very valuable role. Let us remember why</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/2">the Duke of York does this role: because it is in Britain&#8217;s interests. It is in the interests of firms, their employees and our economy. The previous Government recognised that and so do we. We have inherited a sick economy where the prospects of growth funded by the public sector or by consumers are very limited, to say the least, after the poor management of the economy by Labour over 13 years. If we are to grow, there are only two sources of growth: trade and investment. Having someone with experience and clout as the UK&#8217;s special representative for international trade and investment is something that we throw away at our peril.</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/3">I do not know what has motivated the hon. Gentleman. His timing is particularly inappropriate coming as it does four days after the royal wedding, when I believe the whole country showed the support that they give to the royal family and all its members. I am proud to be here to support the role of His Royal Highness.</p>
