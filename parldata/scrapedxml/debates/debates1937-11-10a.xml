<p>I am not disputing the statement about the Union Jack. I am merely saying the the reports we have received do not specify that particular fact.

<i>Following is the reply:</i><br/>
An inter&#x2014;tribal quarrel broke out in Mombasa between the Luo and the Washihiri Arabs from 23rd to 27th August. The riot, which arose out of a quarrel between a householder and his lodger, was not directed against Government and was confined entirely to a part of the native quarter. The situation was soon under control and order was reestablished without any casualties being sustained or caused by the police. One Luo and II Washihiri are known to have lost their lives. Such inter-tribal quarrels are unfortunately always likely to arise unexpectedly in a place like Mombasa. The Provincial Commissioner is now engaged in a further examination of the problems arising out of this incident.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a native tenants ordinance, and I assume that the hon. Member is referring to the Resident Labourers Ordinance which has recently been passed by the Legislative Council. Before its introduction the Ordinance received my careful consideration, and I do not propose to advise that it be disallowed on any of the grounds mentioned. The Ordinance actually provides for reduced penalties as compared with those in the law as it stands. The Ordinance, like the legislation which it is to replace, prescribes the conditions on which native labourers leaving their reserve may enter into voluntary contracts of employment on non-native farms; it does not impose compulsory labour. I have been informed by the Governor that it is not proposed to bring the Ordinance into operation until satisfactory provision can be made for the accommodation on other lands of any natives who may be required to leave farms when their existing contracts of service have expired.</p>

<p>asked the Under-Secretary of State for Air whether he is aware that, prior to the departure of Mr. Govind P.

<p>Although doubts had been expressed in certain unofficial quarters regarding Mr. Nair's flying capabilities, there were no adequate grounds for preventing the flight in question, as the pilot had already satisfied the requirements for the grant of a Class "A" pilot's licence, and the flight did not infringe the regulations. As regards the last part of the question, it is the Air Ministry policy to allow private pilots the greatest possible measure of freedom provided they fulfil the prescribed regulations.</p>

<p>My attention has not been drawn to any special complaints in the areas in question, but I appreciate that the considerable amount of night flying which is now necessary in the national interest must cause some disturbance to inhabitants in the vicinity of flying training schools.

<p>asked the Under-Secretary of State for Air whether he is aware that his decision to establish an equipment depot at Bishop's Cleeve, in the County of Gloucester, means the loss to agriculture of three to four hundred acres of fertile land; and whether he will now reconsider the matter and select instead an alternative site at Quedgeley, not open to this objection, using, if need be, compulsory powers to acquire the land required?</p>

<p>asked the Under-Secretary of State for Air what are the several grounds upon which some of the most fertile land in England is to be taken for a munition depot; and why the site at Quedgeley, Gloucestershire, used during the War for munition purposes, and provided with railway sidings, canal, sewerage, and electricity, is passed over for a site where none of these provisions exist and can only be provided at considerable cost?</p>

<p>The decision to establish an equipment depot at Bishop's Cleeve was arrived at after careful consideration of the strategic and other requirements involved and after a thorough investigation of a possible alternative site at Quedgeley had been carried out. The land at Quedgeley used during the War for munition purposes would have accommodated only a small part of the depot, and the acquisition of as much (and as valuable) agricultural land, namely, between 250 and 300 acres, would have been involved, as at Bishop's Cleeve. The provision of railways, other communications, and electricity, can be as easily and cheaply provided at Bishop's Cleeve as at Quedgeley. On the other hand, there were objections from landowners at Quedgeley and none at Bishop's Cleeve, and further delay in the provision of adequate storage for new equipment could not be justified.</p>

<p>The House will recollect that I asked the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) to withdraw from the House. He first of all refused, and I had to name him. He then proceeded to walk out. As he was walking out I rose and was prepared to withdraw my naming of him, but he turned round at the Bar and insulted me, and had no other course to pursue than to allow matters to proceed.</p>

<p>Arising out of a supplementary question put by the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern)

yesterday, when he asked whether I was the person who some short time ago requested a Scottish judge to pass a birching Order, I should welcome permission to make a personal statement in explanation. I was the solicitor concerned in the matter. When appearing in Court I was acting in an official capacity and on the express instructions of the mother of the boy concerned. I made the request to the Sheriff on her definite instructions and in her presence. The calling of the case was in public court and at the same time that I made the parent's request to the Court I stated emphatically that it was most distasteful to me, as I was completely opposed to birching in any circumstances. It was also explained to the Court that the request for birching as an alternative punishment to an industrial school was made at the instance of the parents. In view of the facts of the case I submit that the personal attack upon me yesterday was uncalled for, and wholly unjustified.</p>

<p>As the person who put the supplementary question in the House I want to say that the facts as stated by the hon. Member for Dumbartonshire


(Mr. Cassells) I accept, but I myself could not see why the hon. Member should ask the Secretary of State for Scotland in this House to use his powers to put an end to birching when he himself had requested in a Court that the Sheriff &#x2014;</p>

<p>No, I certainly will not withdraw. I only want to say that I am quite satisfied that the question I asked was in the public interest and a public duty. I could not see this dual role being played. Therefore, I accept the facts and say that, so far as I am concerned, I am satisfied that I performed that public duty and have nothing to withdraw.</p>

<p>beg to move, "That this House do now adjourn."<br/>
Hon. Members in all parts of the House will have learned this morning with a sense of shock of the sudden and unexpected death, last night, on board ship, of Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. The House will desire to pay its last tribute this afternoon to the memory of an ex-Prime Minister, to one who was a Member of this House for nearly the space of a generation, who was for long the leader of the Labour party and in his later years head of the National Government. Assuredly the name and fame of Mr. MacDonald will be associated with the events of 1931, and only two days ago Lord Baldwin paid him a notable tribute in connection with that time. Nevertheless. I do not propose now to dwell upon that phase, for the obvious reason that Mr. MacDonald's action in 1931 aroused controversies the bitterness of which has not yet died away, and this afternoon we shall not desire to dwell upon controversies, but rather upon things on which we can all agree.<br/>
It is not for me to enter upon the part which Mr. MacDonald played in the foundation of the Labour party, but when he entered this House in 1906 the man who had spent his early years in a Highland village in poverty and with but few facilities for education, except of an elementary character, had already established a national reputation and had become a political force. I myself first saw him in 1922, when he returned to the House after an absence of four years, and it was some time after that, after he became Prime Minister for the first time, that I ever spoke to him. But, of course, later on I was to serve under hire as a Member of the National Government and our contact became close. It is of the impressions that he made upon me that I would like to speak a little this afternoon.<br/>
Mr. MacDonald had great natural gifts&#x2014;his handsome presence, his agreeable voice, that strong appreciation of duty which he had, whether it were in his own native hills or whether it showed itself in his passion for human art in the realm of pictures, in which he took so much delight. But I think that the strongest impression he made upon my mind was

that of his courage, physical and moral. He showed his moral courage on many occasions, when in pursuance of his convictions he set himself in opposition to his own friends and to public opinion in the country. I admired greatly his fortitude under the affliction of failing eyesight, when he submitted to painful operations and to increasing disabilities without hesitation and without murmuring.<br/>
Another characteristic which strongly impressed me was his ability to handle an international gathering, an ability which was all the more remarkable because he spoke no other language than his own, and, as far as I know, he understood very little of any other tongue. It was my privilege to serve under him at two such gatherings&#x2014;at the Lausanne Conference in 1932 and again at the London Economic Conference in 1933. There he seemed to be completely at home, and I could not but feel astonished at the wide range of his international acquaintance and the easy terms which he seemed to have established with almost all who took part in those conferences. I suppose it could be said with truth that no British statesman of his time had a wider personal knowledge of international figures than Mr. MacDonald. For myself, as a colleague of Mr. MacDonald, I never received anything but kindness and consideration from him, and I can echo the words that were used by Lord Baldwin the other day when he said "He could not wish for a better chief."<br/>
His end was one which any of us might envy, but to his family our sympathy goes out in their loss, and especially to that daughter who was accompanying him on what was to have been a happy holiday, and who is now left to perform the last sad offices for her father. Just before he sailed Mr. MacDonald told a reporter that he was going "to seek the most elusive of all forms of happiness&#x2014;rest." Mr. Speaker, he has found what he went out to seek, and there perhaps we may leave him.</p>

<p>I would like, on behalf of all my friends on these Benches and of myself, to express our sincere sympathy with the family of Mr. MacDonald in the great loss which has suddenly come upon them. I know how close were the bonds


of affection between members of that family, and I recall also at this time the gracious personality of the wife and helpmeet of whom he wrote that famous memorial. This House also has sustained a great loss in the death of one of its most distinguished Members. He was a great Parliamentary figure who had been for the greater part of 30 years prominent in our Debates, a man who held for more than seven years the high office of the first Minister of the Crown.<br/>
Since the War, we have seen the passing of five Prime Ministers, and the circumstances of their death have been very different. Lord Rosebery lived on until the task and the contest in which he had been engaged had passed away. The scenes in which he played his part had already become history. Mr. Bonar Law was taken from the world within a few months of relinquishing the Premiership. Mr. MacDonald has been given only a little more than two years of comparative rest since he laid down the burden of the Premiership. He had, so to speak, hardly left the battlefield. It is never very easy, while the controversies in which a man has been engaged are still live issues, to judge fairly either his actions or his character. Strong feelings obscure the judgment; the mists of battle prevent clear vision. This is so especially when there has been a parting of the ways between old associates. The events of the last six years are too near to us to allow a right perspective. The actions of Mr. MacDonald in the year 1931, and afterwards, made a breach between him and Members on this side too deep to be closed. Personal relations of long standing were broken, never to be renewed. Our opinion on those events must necessarily differ from that of hon. Members on the other side, and they must inevitably affect our judgment of the man and the course of his life in the last six years. We can only leave those things to the historians in the future and to their judgment, which may well depend upon the course of history in this country and the world.<br/>
For myself, I will follow the example of the Prime Minister in abstaining from any attempt to deal with those years or to assess Mr. MacDonald in those years. I would not like to say anything which might give a wound on this occasion. I would not like to fail in generosity to the

dead or in justice to the living. I would rather turn to the earlier and happier days. Mr. MacDonald started life without any advantages of wealth, influence or position. He had to make his way and earn his living in a hard world. He had to gain a wide education for himself at the same time, and it was due to his determination and his own qualities that he was able to rise to so high a position and to accomplish so much. For nearly 40 years he was one of the chief advocates of the cause of Socialism in this country and he was for many years one of the leading members of the Independent Labour party. He was one of the three or four men most responsible for the creation and development of the Labour party. With his striking personality, great powers of oratory and effective literary style, he spread the gospel of Socialism at a time when its adherents were few and weak, and their opponents strong and, apparently, impregnably entrenched. He added to those other qualities a gift for organisation and for political strategy. For many years he spent himself freely, working at intense pressure. His activities were not confined to domestic circles, and he travelled widely. As the Prime Minister said, he acquired a great knowledge of the personalities on the Continent and the rest of the world. He was a well-known figure abroad before he was prominent here, and his international interests led him to be an ardent advocate of peace.<br/>
He endured unpopularity during the War with great fortitude. Perhaps it is some little achievement that, in 1924, when bearing the double burden of Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, he sought to bring appeasement to a distracted world. He will always be remembered for his services on behalf of the workers. On these benches we shall always like to think of him as he was in the fullness of his powers, fighting against odds in the cause in which he believed.</p>

<p>I rise to associate my hon. Friends and myself with the moving and impressive tributes which have been paid by the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition to the memory of Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. For two long periods in the last 20 years of his public life, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald was the centre of fierce controversy and the object of


ruthless criticism. The merits of those controversies will be judged by posterity, and they do not to-day concern us. Let us now remember only this: that in his public life Mr. Ramsay MacDonald bore himself with dignity, with generosity and understanding towards those who differed from him, and with proud and indomitable courage, which was the more admirable in a man who was by nature so finely sensitive.<br/>
One of my most vivid recollections of the short time during which I had the honour of serving under him as Prime Minister is of a morning when, struggling against the infirmity of his sight, but, as the Prime Minister has said, without murmuring and completely absorbed in the business, he worked with us until the last moment, when he had to leave the Cabinet to undergo a delicate and dangerous operation on his eyes. That

was characteristic, for he never spared himself&#x2014;indeed, he spent himself&#x2014;in the service of the State and of this House.<br/>
He was a great Scotsman who rose by qualities of mind and force of character to high estate, but who remained rooted in the soil of his native parish, in his home in Moray, and in the love of his devoted family, to whom our sympathy flows out this day. So let us unite in saluting the memory of a man whose gifts of leadership and oratory enriched the public life of his generation and who shrank from no sacrifice of effort, popularity, friendship, pain, or health, in the pursuit of his vision and in the service of his country.</p>
