	<p pid="b.521.4/1">It seems eminently sensible that when we set targets, we take account of practical issues such as the fact that patients sometimes fail to turn up and fail to co-operate with the clinicians and the health service. It would be nonsense to tell hard-working NHS professionals that they had failed to meet a target due to circumstances outside the control of either the trust or the professionals and clinicians involved. Think of the damage to morale that that would cause. The announcement made last week is entirely sensible, and it will not affect the fact that we will get waiting times down for audiology in every part of the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.531.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" speakername="Jacqui Smith" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="531"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0004.htm#07111328000453">
	<p pid="b.531.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement on Security Industry Authority licensing checks and the issue of entitlement to work in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/2">The Security Industry Authority was established in 2003 under the terms of the Private Security Industry Act 2001. Before its establishment, the private security industry was largely unregulated, with no national licensing system. The legislation sets out that the SIA must establish that applicants are fit and proper before granting them a licence; the detailed criteria are set out in the SIA publication &quot;Get licensed&quot;. The fit and proper person requirement primarily involves establishing that the applicant has undergone training and that identity and criminality checks have been completed. To date, more than 250,000 licences have been issued.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/3">I must make it clear from the outset that it is the legal duty of all employers to ensure that those they employ are entitled to work in the United Kingdom. The SIA has not failed to do anything that it was obliged to do in law. As my hon. Friend the Minister for Borders and Immigration stated on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-11">11 September 2006</phrase>, in response to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Employers have clear legal responsibilities under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 which makes it a criminal offence to employ a person who is subject to immigration control unless that person has permission to work in the UK. The possession of a Security Industry Authority licence does not give a person a right to work in the UK, and employers are still expected to assure themselves that their employees have the necessary permission.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-11">11 September 2006</phrase>; Vol. 449, c. 2234W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/5">That is a matter of record in this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/6">While under no legal obligation, the SIA has the discretion to seek information that applicants have the right to work in the UK. As a responsible organisation, the SIA decided in April 2005 to initiate a limited right-to-work check on 10 per cent. of non-European economic area applicants. I am informed by the SIA that between April 2005 and December 2006, more than 3,000 checks were conducted and 41 individuals were identified who were not entitled to work in the United Kingdom. Licences for those individuals were refused.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/7">Ministers were informed in April 2007 that a Border and Immigration Agency enforcement operation had identified that 44 people employed by a security company did not have the right to work in the UK. Of those, 12 had been subcontracted to a further company that provided staff to guard locations under Metropolitan police contracts. One of the individuals was involved in guarding an MPS facility where modified cars would be taken for any repair work. Those identified at that stage were immediately removed from their posts. The Metropolitan police have assured me that there was no security threat to any of the vehicles that had to visit that facility.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/8">In June this year, the BIA and the SIA agreed that the BIA would carry out a more intensive check of the 10 per cent. sample of non-EEA applicants. That analysis showed that a higher proportion of non-EEA applicants might not have a right to work than the earlier work had suggested. Ministers were informed and immediate action was taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/9">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase> this year, every applicant identified as a non-EEA national by the SIA also has their right to work in the United Kingdom checked. I am informed by the SIA that of the 32,500 licence decisions made since <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July 2007</phrase>, 740 were refused because the SIA was not satisfied that the applicant had a right to work in the UK. I have been advised by the BIA that all those cases are in the process of being investigated with a view to enforcement action. In addition, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October</phrase> the SIA has required new and tighter identity checks for all applications and renewals.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/10">Although action could be and was immediately taken on new applicants, it remained unclear how many people who had been granted licences before <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase> did not have the right to work. The SIA undertook further work to assess the potential volume of licences that might have been given to people who did not have the right to work in the UK to consider what remedial action should be taken. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-09">9 August</phrase>, I set out my approach to the advice I had received. My approach was that the responsible thing to do was to establish the full nature and scale of the problem and to take appropriate action to deal with it, rather than immediately to put incomplete and potentially misleading information into the public domain. Much has been made of the fact that I said the lines to take were not good enough for the press office or Ministers to explain the situation. The fact is that they were not good enough because the analysis of the issue had not been completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/11">I took immediate action by asking for work to estimate the numbers involved to be speeded up. I was not content to wait 10 weeks to get these numbers and asked for that time to be halved, and to have preliminary advice on my return to the office on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-20">20 August</phrase>. I approved a letter from the SIA to senior managers of all 2,000 private security companies on its records reminding them of their obligation as employers to check entitlement under section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. I made it clear that I did not want to delay the schedule for its release.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/12">I also approved with modifications a second letter from the Cabinet Office to Government HR directors and departmental security officers reminding them that all staff with access to Government assets should be subject to the requirements of the baseline personnel security standard, which includes the verification of an individual's right to work in the UK. I will place copies of the two letters in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/13">I requested an update by 2 pm the following day, and received a further update from officials on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-10">10 August</phrase>. In that update, officials believed that it should be possible to provide revised estimates of the numbers involved by the end of August. In the advice that I received on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-30">30 August</phrase>, I was informed that the SIA and the BIA could build the capacity to check the estimated 40,000 non-EEA nationals who had previously been granted licences at the rate of 4,000 a month from October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/14">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-05">5 September</phrase>, I asked for further details on why that process should take so long and also asked the Under-Secretary of State for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>, who is responsible for crime reduction, to chair a taskforce to resolve and, if possible, to increase the figure of 4,000 a month. The taskforce met on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October</phrase>. As a result of that, the current estimate is that those checks will now be completed in December&mdash;much more quickly than originally planned&mdash;and I will report again to Parliament when that work is complete. Preliminary work by the BIA has categorised the 6,000 cases checked so far into three groups, although those figures are not finally verified. Provisional assessment from the BIA reports that 77 per cent. of those checked have been shown to have a right to work, with 10.5 per cent. shown not to have a right to work. Checks are ongoing on the remaining 12.5 per cent. I repeat that those are early estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.531.1/15">I believe that that is a clear example of the Government's determination to put in place effective systems and procedures further to protect the public and to keep those systems under review. As has been made clear, possession of an SIA licence does not give a person a right to work in the UK. Employers are expected to assure themselves that their employees have permission to work. That is what the law requires of them. We have nevertheless taken action to tackle illegal working in the security industry sector. As I have demonstrated today, Ministers and officials are taking robust action to satisfy ourselves of the scale of the problem and to ensure that the SIA and the BIA work together to address it.</p>

	<p pid="b.533.0/1">I thank the Home Secretary for advance sight of her statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/2">When the current Prime Minister became leader of the Labour party he heralded, in his words,</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/3" class="indent">&quot;a different type of politics&mdash;a more open and honest dialogue: frank about problems, candid about dilemmas, never losing touch with the concerns of people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/4">Faced with one of her first tests, why was the Home Secretary not frank and candid about the 5,000 illegal workers licensed to work in sensitive security posts in this country? She has now admitted to the House that she was first told on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-12">12 July</phrase>, but she instructed officials that the matter was&mdash;I quote from her e-mails&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/5" class="indent">&quot;not ready for public announcement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/6">There are two key issues. Has the Home Secretary dealt effectively with the original crisis and has she been open and honest with the public?</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/7">The response of the Home Office so far has been blunder, panic and cover-up: blunder when it set up the Security Industry Authority and did not ask it automatically to check when granting security licences to potentially illegal workers; panic when it was first told about that in April; and cover-up when it decided not to tell the public because, according to one of the Home Secretary's leaked e-mails, she did not think</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/8" class="indent">&quot;the lines to take that we currently have are good enough for Press Office or Ministers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/9">She says that that was because the analysis of the issue was not complete. Let us be clear about this. The Government have known about the problem since April. She says that they had not completed the analysis by August. It is now November. The House has been sitting since early October. Is this really the first opportunity that she has had to tell the House about the issue? Is she telling the House that it had nothing to do with the advice that she was given that if the media became aware of the issue, they would be likely to focus on the various &quot;negative stories&quot; associated with SIA licences?</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/10">I have a number of specific questions for the Home Secretary; I hope that she will answer each of them. Can she confirm that 11 illegal workers were guarding Metropolitan police buildings? In the case to which she referred of the illegal worker guarding the site where the Prime Minister's car was parked, how can she, or indeed the Met, be sure that there was no actual or potential security threat? How many more illegal workers were guarding Government buildings or other critical national infrastructure? Can she guarantee that no illegal worker is still guarding any Government, police or military building, or any other part of our critical national infrastructure today? Of the 5,000 illegal workers identified, how many have been caught? How many have been removed from the country?</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/11">Given the Home Secretary's stance on employers, how many employers have been prosecuted because of these discoveries? Does the Border and Immigration Agency now notify the SIA immediately when an SIA licence holder's work permit expires? If not, why not? And why has the Home Secretary not made proposals to place a statutory duty on the SIA to check immigration status before awarding a licence, given the Home Office position that</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/12" class="indent">&quot;an SIA licence is seen as a demonstration that the holder is a fit and proper person to work in a position of trust within the security industry&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.533.0/13">The Home Secretary no doubt regrets not making this statement some time ago. The Prime Minister spoke of frank and candid government yet, in one of her first actions as Home Secretary, the right hon. Lady put avoiding political embarrassment ahead of solving the problem and informing the public. That is neither frank nor candid.</p>

	<p pid="b.534.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman says that there are two tests for the Government: whether effective action is taken and whether accurate information is given. I agree that those are the two tests for the Government. I have spelled out the effective action that has been taken already, and the action that we are taking, to tighten the system and to clarify the full extent of those granted licences before <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>, when the full checks were put in place. I also agree it is important for the Government to give accurate information, which is why I have made it clear that I will return to the House when the speeded-up process of clarifying precisely what the situation is has been completed. I will report the results to the House then.</p>
	<p pid="b.534.0/2">On the specific points that the right hon. Gentleman has raised, I made clear in my statement the position with respect to the 12 employed on Metropolitan police contracts. I have received assurances from the Metropolitan police that there was no danger to cars from the activities of those guards. It is also clear that the Metropolitan police, and other employers, will review and take seriously their responsibilities to check the right to work of those who are securing their facilities. It is also clear that in writing as I did, not only to 2,000 private security companies but to Government Departments to identify the need to carry out these checks, and in referring the Departments to the specific requirements relating to the employment of security guards in Government areas, I quite rightly undertook to communicate with those who were able to make a difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.534.0/3">I have a responsibility to act and to explain. I do not make any apologies to the House for being the sort of Minister whose first reaction to an issue is not &quot;What should I say about it?&quot; but &quot;What should I do about it?&quot; That is what I have done. I have taken action and, when I am clear about the situation, I will return to the House and report to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.534.0/4">I want to make one further point to the right hon. Gentleman. He rightly challenged the original legislation. The Opposition's approach at the time of our introducing the Private Security Industry Bill, according to the then Member for Surrey Heath, was:</p>
	<p pid="b.534.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The Opposition's approach to the Bill is that it should not place unnecessary, overly complex, bureaucratic or burdensome regulations on the legitimate sector of the industry.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-28">28 March 2001</phrase>; Vol. 365, c. 980.]</p>
	<p pid="b.534.0/6">To speak now with the hindsight displayed by the right hon. Gentleman is disingenuous, to say the least.</p>
	<p pid="b.534.0/7">Finally, I share the right hon. Gentleman's concern that all those who work in this country should have the right to be here, which is why this Government will introduce identity cards for foreign residents from next year. We are yet to learn whether Opposition Members will support that.</p>

	<p pid="b.535.1/1">My right hon. Friend has made an important point. First, the SIA has expected much tighter documentation of identity since <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October</phrase>. Secondly, the SIA's ability to carry out, as it has done since <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>, the 100 per cent. checks on the right to work of everybody applying for a licence is supported by the ability directly to fax applications to the BIA and by the ability of the BIA to check that information and return it to the SIA. I am content that appropriate new arrangements have been implemented. I am also content that we have speeded up the process for the verification of those granted licences before <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>, but as my right hon. Friend will have heard, I have constantly argued for faster progress in order to be able to report on licences granted before <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.535.2/1">May I start by apologising on behalf of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" name="Nicholas Clegg">my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)</phrase> for his absence from this statement?</p>
	<p pid="b.535.2/2">The previous Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>, famously said that the Department was &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;. Following his review, we should remember that the structures and staff in the Home Office are the sole responsibility of this Government. After 10 years in power, and with a slimmed-down Home Office stripped of many of its functions, how can the Secretary of State explain the continued incompetence in her Department? Is it not the case that the Government talk tough on crime and immigration, whereas the reality is weakness and failure? The Government need to spend less time legislating to create party political divides and more time concentrating on running their core functions effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.535.2/3">Will the Home Secretary publish the findings of her internal inquiries? Will she also tackle the entire culture of spin and obfuscation in her Department? The legions of media officers working in the Home Office are paid by us, the taxpayers, to inform the public and not to conceal the deficiencies of her Department. The Home Office would benefit from a fresh approach based on frankness, openness and transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.535.2/4">Why did the Home Secretary not report the information to Parliament when MPs returned on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October</phrase>, the same day that the taskforce met? What confidence can the public have that the Home Office is capable of running the vast ID cards database, when it is unable to administer much smaller projects properly? Is not the truth that even with a new Prime Minister, a new Home Secretary and all the restructuring, the Home Office under Labour is still not fit for purpose?</p>

That is regulation that, as my hon. Friend points out, supports responsible employment in the security industry and has improved the industry as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="b.545.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his kind words for those who have been working extremely hard in the past 24 hours and beyond to deal with the situation. I am aware of the letter that Councillor Theobald wrote. There is a discussion every year about the estimates of what local authorities will need to expend, and about the amount of money available. Given the length of time that the hon. Gentleman dedicated to that bit of his response to the statement, I was not entirely clear whether he was advancing the argument that the issue in any way affects our capacity, or local authorities' capacity, to respond to the outbreak. If he has any information to that effect, I would be grateful if he gave it to me.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.0/2">We will assess the economic impact. The countryside remains open. On shooting, restrictions were previously put in place, but I can tell the House that I currently have no plans for such a restriction, because, on reflection, what was done last time seemed disproportionate to its potential impact. I promise that there will be consultation if that position changes. I will happily respond to the hon. Gentleman to let him know exactly where we have got to on the implementation of the lessons learned from the incident in February this year. I am sure that he will understand that those who might draw up that letter are now working hard, dealing with the current outbreak, so I will be extremely grateful if he will bear with me.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.0/3">As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Great Britain poultry register was established in December 2005. As of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October</phrase>, the register held details of 24,161 premises, and a very large number of birds have been registered in that time. Keepers of poultry premises with 50 or more birds are required by law to register their holding. Those with fewer birds are not required to do so, but it is possible for those with smaller flocks to do so on a voluntary basis. One of the difficulties is that there will be smaller poultry keepers who are not registered, so it is important that all of us give them the message that they, too, must be vigilant and must report any concerns that they have.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.0/4">The hon. Gentleman raises an important point about the practicalities. Where there is housing, poultry can be taken inside, and netting can be used, but there are real difficulties. We must recognise the circumstances, particularly in view of the proximity of the premises in question to a nature reserve, where a large number of wild birds are to be found. I can assure him that every step will be taken to ensure that containers and lorries are properly sealed. I say again that if anyone has any concerns, it is important that they raise them with me or my officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.0/5">Animal Health has the resources that it needs to deal with the current outbreak, but it is stretched because of the other two diseases with which it is dealing. I will not speculate in the House on whether the outbreak will get larger; we are doing our darnedest to make sure that it stays where it is.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.0/6">On the hon. Gentleman's final point, investigations are taking place on the arrangements that applied at the farm concerned. The most important thing, having locked things down, is to trace the contacts and movements, so that we can take the appropriate action.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-30">30 April</phrase> this year, I asked the then Solicitor-General two questions: first, about my concerns about the leniency of sentencing, and secondly, about how many times he had referred matters to the Court of Appeal on that subject. Sadly, according to the Library today&mdash;some seven months on&mdash;there is still no reply. May I seek your advice, Madam Deputy Speaker, on how I can get an answer to those simple questions?</p>

	<p pid="b.557.0/1">Another thing that people did not find before 1997 was their local hospital's maternity services disappearing and being transferred 15 miles up the road, as has happened in Welwyn, which I visited on Saturday. People in Banbury, where I also visited, did not find their maternity services being transferred to the John Radcliffe hospital 10 years ago. Likewise with A and E services. Right across London, people might well wonder what kind of NHS they have when, after 10 years and three times the amount of money, they cannot visit their local hospital safely, because although it advertises that it has an A and E department, it does not have the necessary back-up to make it one.</p>
	<p pid="b.557.0/2">Lord Darzi, who is on&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, mentions Tomlinson from a sedentary position&mdash;I have a quotation from when she opposed the Tomlinson report&mdash;yet she and her colleagues propose a reconfiguration in London that seems to be based on the proposition that A and E departments will be available in local hospitals that have high dependency level 2 care, not intensive care. However, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has said in terms that for an A and E service to be provided, it is essential that it should be backed up by level 3 intensive care. And these Ministers have the temerity to come to the House and tell us that the reconfigurations are locally determined and based on clinical criteria. They are not; they are being dictated by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.557.0/3">The latest evidence came out only last week, in the <i> Health Service Journal</i>, that the Government are proposing to try to fix the NHS tariff, so that they can force specialist services into centralised, larger hospitals by undermining the viability of specialists in district general hospitals.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.563.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" colnum="563"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0009.htm#07111335000160">
	<p pid="b.563.4/1">I would not be so pessimistic. I was disappointed to discover that Opposition Members oppose the reforms in the Queen's Speech on raising the education-leaving age to 18 and the proposals for diplomas, but it is not too late. Later in my speech, I will urge them to change their minds and consider backing those reforms.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.4/2">In Britain today we need all young people to be in education or training until 18. That is why our Bill will establish new rights for young people to take up opportunities for education and training, and the support they need to take up those opportunities. It will also establish new responsibilities for young people, and a new partnership between schools and colleges, and between local government and employers, so that every young person will be in education or training until 18 from 2015. It is my aim to build a consensus in the country in the next few years on that proposal, even if we cannot manage that in this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.4/3">There are also serious and proper concerns about the legislation. There will be extensive opportunity for debate over the coming months as the Bill moves through each stage, but I wish to address three of those concerns now. First, let me make it clear from the very beginning that this is not a Bill to force young people to stay on at school or college full time until they are 18. I have heard many people refer to our plans as raising the school-leaving age, but we are not raising the school-leaving age; we are raising the education and training-leaving age.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.4/4">Not all young people will want to continue in school or college, so our proposal is for young people to continue their education and training in the way that makes best sense for them. That could mean full-time education at school or college; work-based learning, through an apprenticeship; or one day a week in part-time education or training, if they are employed, self-employed or volunteering for more than 20 hours. That means that we will expand the number of apprenticeships in the next few years. We have already doubled the number since 1997, and we will increase that number further by 90,000, to 240,000 a year by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.4/5">My right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills and I have agreed that we will legislate in the Bill to ensure that there is the proper statutory basis for apprenticeships for 16 to 19-year-olds. That will set the framework for an entitlement by 2013 to an apprenticeship place for every young person who wants to continue their learning on a work-based route and meets the entry requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.4/6">With our Bill, all individuals will have a legal right to train to their first level 2 qualification. Up to the age of 25, young people will have the same legal right to train for their first level 3 qualification. But because my right hon. Friend and I recognise that it is not only young people who need to achieve their full potential, and because 70 per cent. of those who will make up the 2020 work force will be beyond the age of compulsory education, our Bill will also ensure that all adults have the right to access proper free provision for basic literacy, numeracy and first full level 2 courses. That will enable all low-skilled and unemployed adults to improve their skills and secure sustainable employment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.565.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" colnum="565"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0009.htm#07111335000170">
	<p pid="b.565.3/1">It is important that apprenticeships lead to a qualification. I was talking about apprenticeships for 16 to 18 year-olds in England by 2013. Clearly, we can attempt to go further than that as we go up the age range over more years and for the whole UK. It is our determination to match the Leitch ambitions, but there is clearly a lot of work to be done over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.565.3/2">Although we want to make sure that young people can combine education and training with work, it is also our view that no young person should be left out on the basis that education and training are not for them or that it is too hard to meet their needs. That is why the Bill is about both rights and responsibilities. Under our proposals, young people will receive advice and guidance. They will achieve enhanced educational support in the form of educational maintenance allowances and they will have a wide range of opportunities to take up opportunities in school, college, apprenticeship work with training or on a place on a pre-apprenticeship course or an entry-to-employment programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.565.3/3">If young people fail to take up these opportunities, however, there will from 2013 be a system of enforcement. It will be very much a last resort and, as now for young people aged under 16, it will be at the discretion of the local authority, but it is necessary. I make no apologies for saying again that it is necessary to strike the right balance between new rights and new responsibilities. Some will need extra help, but that does not mean that they should be exempt. We will apply the same approach for 17 and 18-year-old mums as we do for school-age mothers now. Of course, they are allowed time off from learning before and after giving birth; of course, local authorities exercise care and discretion in relation to enforcement; and, of course, teenage mothers will need the extra support for child care that we currently provide through programmes such as Care to Learn. However, they should not be excluded from the opportunities and nor should people with special educational needs or people in custody. They will also receive education and training up to the age of 18. When we say that everyone will participate, that is what we mean.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.586.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" speakername="Kenneth Clarke" colnum="586"  time="018:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0012.htm#07111339000138">
	<p pid="b.586.1/1">The Prime Minister has constantly let it be understood that he was far less committed than Tony Blair to all this reform of the health service. He regarded it as what we used to describe as the internal market, and thought that there was a limit to what the market could achieve. The Queen's Speech gives no clue about that. The Secretary of State is comparatively new, because we keep changing Secretaries of State for Health. His predecessor found herself, near the end, in a constant mist. She made little progress in reform and spent her entire time firefighting incident after incident and presiding over debacles such as the junior doctors appointments farce.</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/2">Is the Secretary of State now committed to reform? He nodded and said yes earlier. He will have to reassure me that he does not mean that with his foot taken off the accelerator and a touch on the brake, just trying to keep out of trouble. The NHS will require more. In my opinion, the NHS has never needed reform to be implemented effectively more than it does at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/3">The background is a great financial crisis. I shall not go into the cause of the present crisis, but it finally came to a head with those ridiculous pay settlements and new contracts, which laid down levels of provision for payments that the NHS could not afford. That has produced a fantastic mess, with deficits all over the place. My NHS trust is allegedly &quot;borrowing&quot; almost &pound;10 million, which it will have to repay with interest next year to get itself out of deficit. Primary care trusts with surpluses find that they are &quot;lending&quot; money to the NHS trust to get it out of trouble, so that those that are run well and have surpluses they thought they could use to redesign their services do not have the money at the moment. The growth in funding in the NHS will slow down. The days when everything was buried with money and a 7 per cent. real-terms increase each year could smooth out a lot of the problems are over, and so the need for properly implemented reform has never been greater. I do not quite see where we are going.</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/4">I want to concentrate on the key and most difficult issue in reform towards the model that the Queen's Speech defined as a patient-led service. That is the euphemism for reform in the direction that I have described. The most difficult thing on the way is the purchasing, or so-called commissioning, of services. Patients should have a choice, and I agree with the Liberal spokesman on that. Actually, Liberal Democrats are wrong to dismiss the professionals. None of us has clinical expertise. The patient exercises choice with the advice of his family doctor, usually a GP, who should be in a position to satisfy that choice. I have no idea where we are getting to on commissioning. No subject in the service has surrounded me in more of a mist of incomprehensibility. When I was Secretary of State, I laid down the plans for GP fundholding, to which we were committed. By the time the new Government came to office, half of all GPs in the country were in fundholding practices. The system was becoming popular and the Government made a big mistake by scrapping it. There is no point in going back over that; but then they changed their mind, did not abolish the purchaser-provider divide and revived the scheme under the name of practice-based budgeting, which we are now meant to have.</p>
	<p pid="b.586.1/5">The Government corrected some of the errors that we made. I approve of the national tariff. I will not argue too much about whether practice-based budgeting is exactly the same thing as GP fundholding, but it is the same principle. We are to back to purchasing and commissioning. Most GPs share my hope that they will be given much more control over how taxpayers' money is used for their patients and much more ability to redesign their local services and improve them in directions that they can see are desirable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.592.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" speakername="Ian Taylor" colnum="592"  time="019:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0013.htm#07111342000090">
	<p pid="b.592.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I will of course obey your stricture, much as I would otherwise have been tempted to comment on matters that need further attention in the Queen's Speech, such as the encouragement of the move to nuclear power as part of our overall energy diversity. I will, however, refrain from going down that route.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/2">I want to focus today on the Government's education policies and, particularly, on the subject of science, which is mentioned in the amendment. Let me start by saying that some of the behaviour of the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families during the debate would not have gone down very well with schools. Indeed, he might have been faced with exclusion, even if he did not break any of the rules of debate in this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/3">There is no disagreement between the Conservatives and the Government on the need to encourage more participation. There is no desire to make a distinction between those who can succeed in academic life and those who struggle, and who would&mdash;as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> wisely pointed out&mdash;perhaps be better off following an alternative career path, and therefore an alternative educational path. Furthermore, Conservative Members understand that there are real issues around trying to keep the attention of children, whatever they are studying. The other day, I discussed some of those issues with a police inspector in my constituency. The police are trying to work with schools to keep children in school and to improve children's behaviour, without which no effort by the Government or anyone else will make a significant difference to those who find it difficult to maintain attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/4">In the past 18 months, I have been preparing a submission to the shadow Cabinet on education and science. I have considered existing apprenticeship and training schemes and visited Network Rail's impressive training scheme in Gosport, which takes youngsters when they are 15 to 16-years-old. The first year of that course is residential, and it will train our future engineers for the railway system, which is commendable. In many cases, those children did not want to stay on at school, but they will obtain a structured education within that engineering apprenticeship.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/5">We must reach out and find more options. I do not believe that the Government are attempting to extend the school leaving age to 18, and I share their idea that we should try to find diverse ways of encouraging youngsters to engage in something that will ultimately benefit them and society, and I am sure that my hon. Friends do, too. However, there is an issue: my concern is that in that desire to be inclusive, we are misunderstanding the concept of &quot;excellence&quot;. Of course, everybody should be excellent, but we should not set the barrier for excellence at the point at which everybody can be excellent. I hope that the Secretary of State for Health will take that point on board in answering the debate. It is, of course, easy to malign someone such as me for saying that we must ensure that we keep striving to improve the top level of attainment in this country, but I am not saying that we should forget those who cannot attain it. As I have a short amount of time to speak, however, I want to concentrate on my real concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/6">I shall start with a controversial point. In his opening remarks, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said that Conservative Members are against a 50 per cent. target for university education. I want to rephrase that point: we would like 50 per cent. of young people to be able to go to university&mdash;we would like to see more and do not see why the target should be 50 per cent.&mdash;but the issue is what we mean by &quot;university&quot;. If only 25 per cent. or less of those young people get a decent A-level, it is almost certain that the others will not be able to aspire to getting into our best universities. There are all sorts of ways in which we can try to help them&mdash;I will not repeat <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the speech made by the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase>&mdash;but we cannot ignore the fact that we have a problem. Meanwhile, global competition is expanding, and our best youngsters are being induced to go not only to American universities, but to Australian universities, which is not good for the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/7">There has been some criticism of our best universities for not widening their intake&mdash;in many cases, they have strived to do so, and many of them have schemes to work with schools that they have identified locally&mdash;but we must recognise that we need to improve the standards of entrance, even from today. There has been a decline not in the intelligence of 18-year-olds, but in the standard that they are asked to reach. In mathematics, for example, some of our top universities have to spend at least two terms, and possibly even the first year, bringing students up to the standard that used to be achieved by students when they entered university, and that example involves top-grade entry. That means that we have a problem in making sure that our best children are stretched.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/8">There is a bigger issue. As I said in an earlier intervention, if one considers the number of youngsters who are taking chemistry, physics and maths&mdash;in the past year, there has been some debate about the figure for maths, which may well be due to a blip&mdash;the situation is extremely worrying. Unless we change that, we will not encourage this country's youngsters, who will subsequently become employees, to obtain the necessary skills. Many of our companies already say that they are extremely concerned by that point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.596.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1384" speakername="Eric Illsley" colnum="596"  time="019:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0014.htm#07111342000097">
	<p pid="b.596.1/1">Yes. That is an aspect that I am about to deal with. My constituency has the highest number of people in receipt of the education maintenance allowance, and that has gone a long way towards improving staying-on rates after the age of 16, so I am a big fan of EMA.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.1/2">As I was saying, there is a fear that increasing the staying-on age to 18 could increase the number of young people in my constituency who completely drop out of education. The question has to be asked whether the resources would be better spent earlier in the pupil's lifetime, or whether we should increase the resources spent earlier in an individual pupil's school year in order to prevent the drop-out rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.1/3">I was pleased to see the Government talk about one-to-one literacy classes and the idea of secondary school pupils having a tutor of studies. Experience in my constituency suggests that we need to address problems as they occur in primary and secondary schools rather than allow children to leave school at 16, drift away and be lost from the system. I recall talking with employers a few years ago and finding that they wanted to take children at 16 and provide them with training within the job that they offered&mdash;but they did not want to have to teach the kids how to read and write. They wanted children to leave school with the basics, so that they could take on the training aspects.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.1/4">Let me say a few words about further education funding issues resulting from the Government's moves in that regard. I'm particularly interested in the relationship between the post-16 agenda and the 14-to19 agenda. My question is about the future of the learning and skills councils. Are they still to provide post-16 funding? Is money going to local authorities intended to provide for the 14-to-19 agenda, and if so, will that detract from the money available to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">our FE colleges? My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, referred earlier to the funding gap between schools and colleges. It would be quite wrong to maintain or increase the gap, or just to allow it to continue. The colleges are worried that local authorities will take some of their funding for the provision of the 14-to-19 agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.1/5">Another question to the Government&mdash;I understand that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health cannot respond to it, but I hope that someone else will pick it up and answer it&mdash;is about the relationship between the vocational and the 14-to-19 agenda. We heard the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families talk about diplomas, but will there be any opportunity to mix and match between the two? Can the academic cross over to the vocational and vice versa, or are we to have a dividing line between diplomas?</p>
	<p pid="b.596.1/6">As for the capital funding of Barnsley college, it, like many others, has undertaken a rebuilding programme at the behest of the LSC, which has required it to borrow large amounts of money. Next year the college is embarking on loans of some &pound;10 million. Because of the LSC's delays in agreeing that funding, the rebuilding programme has been held up and almost jeopardised. The college had to agree a rebuilding programme in phases, the first of which was to allow a decanting of the buildings to be refurbished. That first phase almost fell through because of the delays, jeopardising the other phases in the programme. What is the future of the LSC, which has brought about those loans, not only at Barnsley college but at others? Colleges are worried that they might be left holding large mortgages or loans in an uncertain future, given the divisions of funding between the 14 to 19 set-up and the colleges.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.1/7">I repeat that Barnsley has one of the highest take-up rates for the education maintenance allowance, which has been a huge success. It has improved post-16 staying-on rates in my constituency, and I hope that it will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.1/8">Finally, I have a concern about the Sale of Student Loans Bill. Will the Government ensure that students repaying student loans are not placed in any worse situation than at present through the sale of that student debt?</p>

	<p pid="b.602.0/1">It is a great privilege and pleasure to take part in this Queen's Speech debate&mdash;I am not sure whether I am using the right terminology&mdash;on health and education, which are the twin pillars of public services in this country and make such a contribution to our society. They have something in common in terms of the pattern that has been in place since the Government came to power. In both cases, the Government have put in vast amounts of increased expenditure. In cash terms, I think that they have doubled expenditure on education and trebled the expenditure on health. However, productivity has fallen and the hopes of Ministers and not least the rest of the country and those who pay taxes have not truly been delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.602.0/2">We have not yet had a Secretary of State for Health or for Education in this Government who have been prepared to be as entirely honest with the House as they may be with others behind closed doors. Who could be more frustrated than the Ministers of this Government who have put in so many resources and seen so little in return? That is not to say to the Secretary of State for Health that there have not been improvements; of course, there have. There have been improvements in every decade since the second world war. That is certainly so of health and I hope also of education, but the improvements have been too little for the money spent.</p>
	<p pid="b.602.0/3">If we consider issues such as social mobility and the aspirations of many Labour Members and Conservative Members&mdash;although Labour Members are often too grudging to accept that we share similar aspirations&mdash;it appears that, at a time of record levels of spending, we could have seen a real change in the opportunities for those with the least in this country and that we could have tackled the sustained levels of disadvantage that for too long have been a feature of this country. In many countries of western Europe and, indeed, across the world, those problems have been tackled more effectively than they appear to have been here. The Government deserve congratulation on being prepared to will the means and to will the funding, but they have not been able to deliver the policy framework that would have delivered the change that we all hope for. Social mobility has not improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.602.0/4">I wish to touch on a comment made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> who, as I said in an intervention, was parroting the remarks of the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families that Conservative Members are somehow interested only in the few and not the many. I hope that any fair-minded member of the Labour party would accept that that is absolutely untrue. Because the issue is about willing the means as well as the ends, Labour Members must accept that the legislation going through the House over the past 10 years, when coupled with the funding, have not been enough to tackle disadvantage&mdash;be that health inequalities or inequalities of outcome in education. For Conservatives Members to take a differing view and to challenge the Government's record and new legislative programme is not a sign that we are uninterested in the outcomes that we all devoutly wish for. We challenge them because of a profound disagreement about how the outcomes could be delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.602.0/5">That neatly brings me to the subject of the diplomas over which there was a rather angry exchange because the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families entirely misrepresented, I think deliberately&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.608.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="608"  time="020:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0016.htm#07111350000237">
	<p pid="b.608.0/1">I am pleased to be able to speak in this debate on health and education because I wish to raise specific issues relating to access to health services that are clearly pertinent to the proposed children and young persons Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/2">The first issue is the provision of therapeutic services for all abused children, including children in care. I have tabled amendments to achieve that provision to a series of Bills, starting with the Bill that became the Sexual Offences Act 2003&mdash;sadly, unsuccessfully in all cases. I believe that such provision must be made for looked-after children if we are to make a real difference. As an ambassador for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, I agree with the call for comprehensive post-abuse therapeutic provision for children in care, children in custody, children in refuges and children exhibiting sexually harmful behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/3">Child abuse remains an unacceptably large problem in the UK. A study undertaken by the NSPCC in 2000 showed that 16 per cent. of children had experienced some form of sexual abuse, which may well have been by a parent or other relative. Other forms of abuse&mdash;physical and emotional, or neglect&mdash;can also have a traumatic impact on children. In 2006, the Department for Education and Skills said that of 60,000 children in care, 63 per cent. were in care because they had experienced some form of abuse or neglect. Of course, in reality the problems are likely to be much more widespread, because of unreported instances or reporting taking place many years after the abuse occurred.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/4">The long-term consequences of child sexual abuse include anxiety and depression, anger and guilt, difficulties functioning at school, poor self-image, and difficulties with personal relationships and parenting. Adults being treated for mental health problems often identify childhood abuse as an influence. Research shows that 25 to 40 per cent. of all alleged sexual abuse involves young perpetrators. The majority of those children and young people have been or are being sexually, physically or emotionally abused themselves. Therapy at an early stage could therefore help to reduce the scale of the problems over time by breaking the cycle.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/5">Therapy can transform children's lives, but provision is inadequate and patchy across the country. Resources to provide a comprehensive service will be a problem, but I want at least a commitment to a strategy to make such services fully available in time. Camila Batmanghelidjh, the founder of Kids Company, has recently pointed out that the amount of money spent on locking up young people, and the generation of more crime with consequent high reoffending rates, could be reduced dramatically if comprehensive therapeutic services were more widely available. The average cost per child of therapeutic counselling is &pound;5,000; the cost of holding a young offender in custody for a year is &pound;30,000 to &pound;40,000. Surely it makes sense to invest in preventive action such as therapy.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/6">A related issue is funding for residential family therapy and family assessments. In an Adjournment debate earlier t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">his year, my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> raised the case of the Cassel residential treatment centre, which is the only NHS residential hospital for families in the UK. Its services comprise psychotherapy for the parent and child, as well as specialist nursing input. Families are referred when concerns are raised about a child's welfare. Most referrals arise from a child being the subject of care proceedings, which are, in turn, legally enforced by section 38(6) of the Children Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/7">After a 2005 legal case involving Kent county council, which centred on a dispute over whether the council had a legal obligation to fund the treatment of a child at the centre, there are concerns that there is a legal requirement only to fund assessments rather than treatment. It now appears that instead of an attempt being made to treat the family and enable them to overcome problems and become successful, children are simply being removed from the home and put into foster care or adopted. Surely it would be cost-effective to provide preventive services to support families. We must do our best.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.611.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1466" speakername="David Chaytor" colnum="611"  time="020:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0016.htm#07111350000242">
	<p pid="b.611.1/1">I am afraid that I will not, because I do not think it is fair to my colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.611.1/2">I tabled a question at the end of the previous Session, asking the Department to list the estimated number of year 7 pupils in full-time education in the next 10 years, and I was astonished to discover that the answer was not available; there are figures only for the next three years. There is general agreement among local authorities that the reality of the demographics will hit secondary schools in the next decade. I find it astonishing that the Department for Children, Schools and Families does not have readily available figures, or is not prepared to release them. I urge the Secretary of State to look again at the issue, because it relates to my next point about the growth of the academies programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.611.1/3">I support the principle of academies, although their earlier design left something to be desired. I am delighted that the new Secretary of State has made important changes, abolishing the requirement to provide &pound;2 million of private sponsorship and encouraging universities to get more involved in academies. All things being equal, if a school in my constituency wished to be an academy, I would give it my support. However, there is one issue that the Government need to consider carefully: their encouragement, if not their requirement, for all new academies to have their own sixth form. I link that to my point about demographics and falling rolls, because if we go ahead with a massive expansion of the academies programme, and we do not have reasonably reliable information about the number of pupils entering secondary school in the next 10 years, we will build a whole set of new academies&mdash;I think that the figure is 400&mdash;each with its own sixth form, few of which will be able to attract the right number of pupils for a viable sixth form. By the middle of the next decade, we will find that we are starting a programme of closure and rationalisation of sixth forms, and possibly even of academies. I ask the Government to consider that point carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.611.1/4">On the question of 14-to-19 diplomas, I do not understand why the issue is polarised between those who want the diploma to be the prime vehicle, and those who want the A-level and the GCSE as the prime vehicles. Sir Mike Tomlinson's original report was clear in its recommendation that A-levels and GCSEs be self-contained qualifications within the diploma. That is absolutely the right way forward, and as the Government have now announced new diplomas in arts, languages and sciences, I urge them to ensure that individual A-level and GCSE subjects can be fully integrated in those new diplomas. I am sure that that would meet some of the Opposition's concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.611.1/5">Finally, I reinforce <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1645" name="Barry Sheerman">the point made by my Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman)</phrase> on academic selection. I agree with him entirely that although our Ministers have made important speeches this year, the most important speech of the year was made by the former shadow Secretary of State for Education and Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1623" name="David Willetts">the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts)</phrase>, to the CBI on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May</phrase>. Let me put what he said on the record:</p>
	<p pid="b.611.1/6" class="indent">&quot;We must break free from the belief that academic selection is any longer the way to transform the life chances of bright poor kids. This is a widespread belief but we just have to recognise that there is overwhelming evidence that such academic selection entrenches advantage, it does not spread it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.611.1/7">We know that all Members of this House are increasingly concerned about social mobility; I believe that social mobility is related to admissions policies in secondary schools. The hon. Member for Havant believes that, and I think that the Government do, too. The issue is a major priority for all three parties. We really cannot put the matter off any longer; we have to take decisions about the future of academic selection.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.614.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1592" speakername="Sharon Hodgson" colnum="614"  time="020:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0017.htm#07111350000244">
	<p pid="b.614.0/1">I am pleased to talk about education and health in our debate on the Gracious Speech. It seems to me&mdash;and, I am sure, to many other hon. Members&mdash;that it is a major step forward to ensure that we do all that we can to educate children about health. The Government have responded well to the challenges that we face in those areas. At the brand new Cardinal Hume Catholic school in Gateshead in my constituency, it is a joy to see teachers and pupils excited about their new learning environment and the facilities that are on offer to them. Oxclose school in Washington has been fully refurbished using money made available through the building schools for the future programme, and it is a lesson to all of us that we do not always have to knock something down and start again to make it better.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/2">I want to talk about two issues that can be clearly linked across health and education. The Government rightly note the need to tackle obesity, promote skills and change lifestyles. My constituency suffers from health inequalities, which must be reversed. Obesity rates, smoking rates, cancer rates and deaths from heart disease are all higher than average. Despite that, I remind hon. Members that it remains one of the most scenic and friendly places in which one could hope to live.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/3">To help reverse these health inequalities, I know how important it is that we go further still in delivering good quality school food. We hear tales of mums passing pizzas through the school gates, chip shops making record lunchtime profits, and some children causing a mess and a nuisance out on the streets. The solution that I propose is straightforward and simple&mdash;free, universal, locally sourced, hot school lunches, given to all pupils under the age of 16, coupled with a policy whereby pupils are not allowed off the school site at lunchtime&mdash;a lunchtime lock-in, so to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/4">If the scheme is to work properly, packed lunches should be discouraged. A large number of parents send their children to school with a packed lunch, but unfortunately most lunch boxes are far from healthy. What parent would go to the hassle and cost of providing a packed lunch, healthy or otherwise, if they could have a free, healthy, hot school meal for their child? Sourcing food locally would not only cut food miles, but play a role in supporting the local economy. In addition, universal free school meals would remove any stigma that is often attached to claiming free school meals, usually because children would rather be with their friends having a packed lunch or out at the chippie.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/5">Some 250,000 children who are entitled to free school meals do not get them because they do not claim them. In my constituency hundreds of children lose out every day, despite the best efforts of my local councils to increase take-up. A universal free school meals policy has been working in Sweden, Finland and Honduras, delivering significant results. Closer to home, there are pilots in Scotland and north Tyneside. These pilots are possible in England because of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, which removed any statutory obligation on schools to charge for meals, so let us make the most of that change. Surely that is why it was made.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/6">That would, of course, have a cost implication, but the long-term benefits of boosting educational attainment, fighting child poverty and tackling health inequalities must begin to outweigh the cost. Estimates of the cost vary, and I have heard a figure of &pound;2 billion. However, the House of Commons Library, which is highly respected and a credible source, has put the cost between &pound;900 million and &pound;1.1 billion. That includes the cost of providing more meals and restructuring current catering contracts, but savings would be made through economies of scale. That sum is not peanuts, but it is still only about 0.2 per cent. of Government spending. It is worth noting that the cost of obesity is conservatively estimated to be about &pound;3.5 billion a year, and we know the old adage about a stitch in time. I am sure that that provides us with some food for thought, and I hope the Minister digests it well.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/7">The second issue that I wish to raise in the time allowed is closely related to education. I urge Ministers to train a dyslexia specialist in every school, who in turn will train all teachers to recognise the signs of dyslexia. I also propose that during their training all teachers are taught a compulsory special educational needs module, rather than SEN as an optional extra, as at present. As a parent with a severely dyslexic son, I know only too well the pressure and frustration faced by many other parents in the same situation. My son was eventually statemented, and with that comes not only the recognition that he needs extra help, but the extra funding to pay for it. We can give all dyslexic children across the country&mdash;even those without statements&mdash;the help that they need and save money at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/8">Dyslexia affects one in 10 people. That means there are around 1 million dyslexic children in our schools. They need extra help and support. All our brains work in different ways and we need to ensure that pupils with special educational needs are given special teaching, with teachers who are qualified and able to meet their needs. It has taken 10 years of government and we have come an awful long way. We could not have done it without listening to people and stakeholders. We must listen to the parents of dyslexic children.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/9">A recent survey of such parents carried out by the charity Xtraordinary People and the British Dyslexia Association says that nine out of 10 parents think the support that their children are receiving is ineffective, and seven out of 10 believe their children are being given support by staff who have no specialist training in dyslexia. I welcome the one-on-one tuition that is being given to children who are falling behind in school, but for dyslexic pupils what makes the biggest difference is the opportunity to spend time with a specially trained teacher.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/10">I shall give one quick example. Ben, a 12-year-old dyslexic pupil, had spent six years being helped by a learning support assistant, at a cost of &pound;27,000, and he had shown little, if any, improvement. I know this example to be true because it is exactly the same as my son Joseph's. After only 20 hours working with a dyslexia specialist, Ben's reading and spelling age rose by two years&mdash;all that at a cost of only &pound;600.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/11">I am proud to say that the Government are delivering nearly &pound;1 billion in funding for personalised learning, but we must ensure that it is spent wisely and not wasted. I hope that the Minister will give sincere consideration to the points that I have made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.616.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" speakername="Richard Taylor" colnum="616"  time="020:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0017.htm#07111350000245">
	<p pid="b.616.0/1">Quality of care and safety are at the heart of the Health and Social Care Bill, and I shall spend my precious few minutes talking about quality of care. I am not whingeing or scoring political points; I shall just give the House some examples of the truly awful quality of care that is brought to my notice. I shall then consider some of the measures in the Bill to address the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/2">My first example involves a patient known to have terminal cancer. After treatment at a local cancer centre, with which he was very satisfied, he had to be admitted to another hospital for the investigation of an unexplained fever. The admission process took a long time. Staff were busy and there was no sympathy for his family. Eventually, he was admitted, but no information was given to him or his family. When they went to visit him the next day, he said, &quot;Get me out of here; they do not know what they are doing.&quot; The family were told that no doctor was available to talk to them, although at times doctors and nurses were laughing and joking at the nurses' station.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/3">On one occasion, the patient's family were told that he was not in the ward where he in fact was, and they feared that he might have died. When they found him, he was obviously dehydrated and had not been washed. He said, pitifully, &quot;I don't feel safe in this hospital. They are leaving me to die.&quot; Eventually, the family saw a junior doctor who knew nothing about the patient, so they took the patient home.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/4">I have to declare an interest in respect of my second example. My wife's elderly aunt&mdash;a fit 90-year-old, except for her bad case of cancer&mdash;has completed her radiotherapy. She had a check-up on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>; she was supposed to have had a scan. Her journey was wasted, as the scan had not been done. It was done on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November</phrase>. Today, she went for the result, only to be told that it was not available as it had to be reviewed at a weekly meeting, which had not been held. How is that patient-centred care&mdash;care organised around the patient? It is not; it is care for the convenience of the staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/5">I have received letters from people appalled by their treatment in hospital. They mention delays in responding to calls, alarms being ignored, wet beds not being changed, staff sitting around talking and joking, and days without fluids&mdash;&quot;If you can't eat, you don't get anything.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/6">I am speaking out about that sort of thing on the basis of local complaints, but it is a national issue. Compulsory reading for everybody&mdash;Department of Health Ministers, Members, administrators, NHS staff&mdash;is an article in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> this week. It is a personal view, written by a psychiatrist and headed, &quot;So, you want to know what's wrong with the NHS?&quot; It is about the care of the psychiatrist's mother during the course of her schizophrenia, which merged into Alzheimer's disease. He paints a vivid picture of uncaring, incompetent senior health care staff, the difficulty of complaining, the lack of continuity of care and the migration of an elderly woman across five wards in 14 days. I shall give two quotes:</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Those who cannot do their jobs, who cannot elicit histories or examine the sick, are curiously diligent when it comes to applying the rules under which complaints can be made against them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/8">Here is the other:</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/9" class="indent">&quot;It doesn't matter what you do because the &quot;carers&quot; do not care. It does not matter what you say, because they do not listen.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.619.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" speakername="David Burrowes" colnum="619"  time="020:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0017.htm#07111350000249">
	<p pid="b.619.0/1">I commend the amendment, and in particular the reference to</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/2" class="indent">&quot;the absence of measures to improve public health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/3">In his response to the Gracious Speech, the Prime Minister made only passing reference to public health and even less to concerns about drugs. He referred to those in the context of law and order, but we all know that they are an issue in health and education, and therefore appropriate for debate today. They are also relevant to alcohol and the concerns about the lack of appropriate measures to tackle the level of alcohol misuse. The Alcohol Health Alliance has properly raised concerns about the number of children admitted to hospital every day.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/4">The concern about alcohol is that it is the poor relation when it comes to treatment, but the concern about drugs is that the Government have woefully failed. Public money has poured in, with more than &pound;100 million primarily focused on getting people into treatment. What is that treatment? Primarily, 85,000 people per year&mdash;maybe more&mdash;are prescribed methadone, but only 350 or so addicts move to recovery. Treatment is not only about medication or the cul-de-sac of prescription drugs, whose use has been described as a medically managed half-life. Surely we could do so much more, and encourage people into residential treatment rather than, as the Government term it, &quot;exit from treatment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/5">Residential rehabilitation is an exit from dependence that the Government should take seriously. Rather than having a drug strategy that is about harm reduction and ticking a box to say, &quot;You're managed, you're safe, you're okay,&quot; we should be more optimistic. We should do so much better and give people the option of rehabilitation to realise their full potential. We should deal with the human lives that are not just defined by a tick-box, and which should be released from the slavery of addiction to alcohol and drugs. More needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/6">I want to address most of my remarks, however, to something that is in the Queen's Speech: the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill. I was pleased to be a member of the Joint Committee on the draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill, although it had insufficient time for scrutiny and a limited remit. The Government have pinned their colours to the embryonic research mast through their pledge that the new Bill will</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/7" class="indent">&quot;reform the regulation of human embryology and ensure that Britain remains at the forefront of medical research.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/8">The key question is whether the Government's desire is to be at the forefront of medical research or embryonic research. A primary concern is the proposal to permit research into inter-species embryos. Although the presumption in the Bill is the Warnock position, which permits research on human embryos and therefore their destruction, it is important to record the acute concern about the extension and expansion of such research. In its leader on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April</phrase>, <i> The Times</i> rightly stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Unfashionable as it may be to say so, destroying an embryo extinguishes the possibility of a life.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/10">To balance that, I would say that the science editor of <i> The Times</i> was not right in the evidence that he gave to our Committee. He said that</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/11" class="indent">&quot;there is... indifference and perhaps a lack of really strongly held views&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/12">on the subject of inter-species embryos.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/13">We should not underestimate the level of concern among the public. Let me make it clear that the destruction of an embryo after it has been subjected to experimentation and used to create a fusion of human and animal cells matters deeply. The ethical implications, as I am sure we are aware, are immense, not least because that involves tampering with the fundamental essence of human life. Its implications will have an impact beyond these shores, with the scientific world watching, as it did with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, to see how high we will jump or&mdash;in my view&mdash;how far we will sink.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/14">In many places, the Bill will permit things that are banned in countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Canada. It is not surprising that the UK lags behind when it comes to ethical principles. The chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, gave evidence to the Committee and said:</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/15" class="indent">&quot;We have had, generally, in this country a deficit in medical ethics&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/16">In the absence of a clear moral compass, it is inevitable that research seems to cross more ethical boundaries in the name of progress, and wanting to be at the forefront of it. At the very least, the moderate recommendation of the Joint Committee for a bioethical Committee of both Houses should be followed up.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/17">The aim of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill is, we presume, to promote useful research, but the evidence supporting the potential for useful research using embryos or, where there is a shortage of those, inter-species embryos, is limited. Evidence from scientists suggests that there is no chance of embryonic research delivering positive therapeutic outcomes for a long time. The goalposts have been widened since the wild hopes in 1990. It is important that we should pursue alternatives that are not fraught with the ethical controversies surrounding inter-species embryos. Umbilical cord blood is one possibility, as is using adult stem cells, which have already provided more than 70 treatments. I have a ten-minute Bill about how to put in place greater provision for retaining cord blood, so that we can research that possibility further. Why are we speculating in an ethically precarious future? Surely we should be investing in ethical research. Surely we should have a Bill that is at the forefront not just of research, but of ethical research.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/18">The Bill goes further than that, however. It deals with the wider issue of fatherhood and seeks to define the legal parentage of children in a new way. Although there is an increasing cross-party recognition of the importance of the role of fatherhood in social and emotional well-being, the concern with the Bill is that parenthood will move from a biological relationship to a legal responsibility. As a fellow member of the Committee, Baroness Deech, said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-08">8 November</phrase>, the concern is that fatherhood is being downplayed in fertility treatment, with men being reduced to nothing more than a &quot;genetic contributor&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/19">The Government's stance on judicial policy is contradictory, on the one hand encouraging fathers to be part of the birth certificate process, but on the other seeking to remove the need to take account of the father when considering fertility treatment. Doing so has an important symbolic value. We should not sanction fatherlessness; indeed, we should not go further, as the Bill seeks to do, and sanction state deception. In the words of a donor-conceived person:</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/20" class="indent">&quot;I was angry at the idea that where donor conception is concerned, everyone focuses on the 'parents', the adults who can make choices about their own lives. The recipient gets sympathy for wanting to have a child...It's hypocritical of parents and medical professionals to assume that biological roots won't matter to the 'products'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.0/21">We should challenge that and say that they are not &quot;products&quot;&mdash;regardless of whether they are children or unborn children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.623.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" speakername="Brooks Newmark" colnum="623"  time="021:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0018.htm#07111350000251">
	<p pid="b.623.0/1">The Prime Minister's first hundred days can be summed up with a modified form of an old wedding proverb: something old, little new, plenty borrowed, lots of blue. Lumping health and education into one day's debate after two ministerial statements is also something of a marriage of convenience for a Government who have failed to deliver on 10 years of empty promises on health care and education. However, it is less convenient for my constituents, most of whom regard the delivery of good health care and good education as the two most important ways in which Government policy affects their lives. I suspect that my constituents would be happier if there were fewer Bills in the Gracious Speech and more emphasis on the delivery of the services that matter to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/2">As ever, the Government are long on rhetoric and short on progress when it comes to the delivery of proper local health care. The Prime Minister now seems to have cast himself as Hercules cleaning out the NHS stables&mdash;or, more simply, as a cross between Flash Gordon and Mr. Muscle. But, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> exposed last week, his deep clean commitment has more than a whiff of spin about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/3">A further deep clean is now desperately needed: a deep clean of the Government's target culture and centralised control of health care. The Gracious Speech contained a commitment on behalf of the Government to</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/4" class="indent">&quot;providing a healthcare system organised around the needs of the patient.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November 2007</phrase>; Vol. 696, c. 1.]</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/5">Yet the new health and social care Bill will introduce a new integrated regulator, more targets and more interference with front-line professionals&mdash;all, perversely, in the interests of boosting public confidence in a failing system.</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/6">The sickness in the health service is borne out by my constituents' experience of obtaining adequate local health care. Before the 2005 election, they were promised a community hospital, but progress on that has since evaporated as surely as the Labour majority did in Braintree. I have repeatedly raised the fate of that project in Parliament, and I will continue to do so. The primary care trust's latest position is that a full business case for the Braintree community hospital scheme will not be ready until March next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/7">Those delays have already had real consequences for patient care locally. This afternoon, I hosted an event to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Farleigh hospice, which provides support for my constituents and others across mid-Essex. Last year, Farleigh cared for 2,663 people, but its year has closed with the news that the day hospice must vacate its premises on the site of the former St. Michael's hospital in Braintree by the beginning of next year, because the future of the site and of the community hospital that was supposed to be built there is still uncertain. I do not see the Government's commitment to local health care anywhere in the vicious circle that has trapped Braintree's community hospital project since 2005. We have a Government whose unprecedented investment has been matched only by its unconscionable waste. Will the Secretary of State for Health now demonstrate a true commitment</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/8" class="indent">&quot;to providing a healthcare system organised around the needs of the patient&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November 2007</phrase>; Vol. 696, c. 1.]</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/9">by committing to build a community hospital in Braintree?</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/10">Unfortunately, the pace of change on education has left a lot to be desired. Some &pound;1 billion has been invested in cutting truancy, but truancy rates have risen again recently with a hardcore of more than 200,000 children still regularly playing truant. The Government have failed to get to grips with keeping children in school until they are 16, but they now propose to keep children there until they are 18. I agree with the principle that improving skills among young people is both an economic and moral imperative. However, to think that greater participation can be achieved by the simple expedient of higher targets is at best naive, while to believe that either bribery or compulsion are the means to attain those targets is simply cynical.</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/11">I also want to sound a brief note of caution about one of the core principles of the Leitch review of skills. Lord Leitch's exhortation was to</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/12" class="indent">&quot;focus on economically valuable skills. Skill developments must provide real returns for individuals, employers and society.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/13">That is right as far as it goes, but it has its origins in the Thomas Gradgrind school of thought, being &quot;eminently practical&quot; but lacking in essential humanity. We must remember the moral imperative as well as the economic imperative.</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/14">By way of simple example, I recently met my constituent, Mrs. Gina Fost, who is one of many people who are struggling to afford the cost of lip-reading and signing classes as a result of central Government meddling. Providers of adult community learning courses must follow guidance from the Learning and Skills Council. Residents in Braintree and Witham have seen their fees for lip-reading classes increase in the space of three or four years from nothing to &pound;94 and finally this year to &pound;186. The reason for those jumps is that the LSC does not view signing and lip-reading as &quot;basic skills&quot; worthy of full fee remission under the skills for life programme. Consequently, pensioners must pay 37.5 per cent. of the cost of the course themselves. To my way of thinking, however, there is no more important basic skill than the ability to communicate with others. The education and skills Bill will supposedly place new duties on the LSC to support free tuition for literacy and numeracy. If so, it ought to support free tuition for lip-reading and other basic skills, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.623.0/15">We need to reduce complexity in the funding system, not reinforce it. We need to move from a target-led approach to a demand-led approach to skills. In the drive for skills, we need to remember that support for some skills is governed more by a moral than an economic imperative. One of the Government's besetting sins in the past 10 years has been the unholy alliance between profligate legislation, prodigal spending and parsimonious delivery. This year's Gracious Speech is nothing different, which is why I shall vote against it and support our amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.633.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1648" speakername="Alan Johnson" colnum="633"  time="021:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0020.htm#07111355000587">
	<p pid="b.633.3/1">The hon. Gentleman was not a Member of Parliament at the time. The explicit policy of the Conservative party in 2003 was to contract participation in higher education to 36 per cent. as a way to deal with the funding issue. The independent appeal panel in health was introduced by the previous Government, but the Conservatives now say that they would get rid of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.633.3/2">The subject of diplomas and the education Bills brings me to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families was absolutely right when he talked about the progressives and the modernisers on the Opposition Benches. I see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1623" name="David Willetts">the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts)</phrase> in his place; he is certainly one of them, and we had high hopes that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath would be as well. However, one cannot be a progressive on education and oppose the introduction of diplomas and the increase in the education-leaving age. We had high hopes that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1868" name="George Osborne">the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)</phrase> would prove to be a progressive when only a couple of years ago he stated, unambiguously, that the Conservative party&mdash;he was not speaking only for himself&mdash;supported not only our proposal on diplomas, but Tomlinson, lock, stock and barrel. An amazing change of policy has occurred in only a couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="b.633.3/3">The education-leaving age is the issue that will define education in the coming 20 or 30 years. Labour and the Conservatives have a shared ambition to raise participation to the highest possible level. Our ambition is to reach 90 per cent. participation by 2015. The Leitch report is saying that there are 3.2 million jobs that require no qualifications now, but there will be only 600,000 by 2020&mdash;the number of vacancies in our economy. We are expanding hig<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">her education. The hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase> was wrong when he said that our policy is to get 50 per cent. of youngsters into university; in fact, it is to get 50 per cent. of 18 to 30-year-olds into higher education, a big chunk of which will be accounted for by vocational foundation degrees delivered in the workplace. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills is doing great work on following Leitch and increasing the number of people with level 4 qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.633.3/4">On the one hand, a youngster in this world gets the message that it is really important to get qualifications and make the best of their education; on the other hand, they are able to disappear off the radar screen at 16. First, that tends to make GCSEs a school-leaving certificate and the whole education system becomes geared towards a certain proportion of children leaving school at 16. Secondly, it gives mixed messages to youngsters who should be given the clear message that previous Governments gave&mdash;and not just the 1918 Government. God, the Liberal party were in power then; that shows how long ago it was. That Government looked to raise the school leaving age, eventually to 18. The great coalition Government of the second world war, with Rab Butler as Secretary of State, said that we should move from a leaving age of 14 to one of 15 immediately, and then to one of 16&mdash;that took too long&mdash;and said that we should then move to 18, either full or part time. The proposal is that when youngsters get to the age of 16, they either have offers of an apprenticeship, or undertake in-work accredited training, or take diplomas, which are crucial to the diversity of routes that they can take, and have the opportunity to stay on at school, too. All that is crucial to the future of education.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-13b.637.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1648" speakername="Alan Johnson" colnum="637"  time="021:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071113/debtext/71113-0020.htm#07111355000593">
	<p pid="b.637.0/1">The Bill will ensure that every youngster who is properly qualified and wants to do an apprenticeship has the right to an apprenticeship place. It shifts the whole basis on which apprenticeships are offered.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>, who is not in his place, on getting almost everything wrong in his contribution. Incidentally, in an intervention he said the most delightful thing. He asked whether the Secretary of State would agree that there is an epidemic in sexual health. I wish there were an epidemic in sexual health. That would be wonderful. However, I hasten to add that there is not an epidemic in sexual disease. The hon. Gentleman said that productivity in the health service has fallen. It has not. He said that social mobility was getting worse. It is not. There is a long time lag on that, but the latest statistics show that the social class gap has stopped widening, which is an important precursor to narrowing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1731" name="Doug Henderson">My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson)</phrase> made a powerful speech and highlighted the importance of one-to-one tuition for youngsters from poorer backgrounds, as well as those from more prosperous backgrounds. It was an important contribution because raising the education-leaving age will not solve all the problems by itself. Introducing diplomas will not solve all the problems. The measures must be seen in the round, and must start with Sure Start for the youngest children and continue right the way through.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> made an interesting contribution, particularly on the need for therapeutic assistance for children. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and I will work together on children's health on a Joint Committee to try and join services up in the way that the hon. Lady seeks. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North is a fellow member of the David Willetts appreciation society. The hon. Member for Havant was not in his place when my hon. Friend was eulogising his speech. I shall repeat it because I know that the hon. Member for Havant always likes to hear it. The hon. Gentleman said that selection does not spread advantage; it entrenches it. That is right, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North was right to point that out.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.0/5">I wish I could mention all the interesting contributions from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1592" name="Sharon Hodgson">my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Mrs. Hodgson)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>, who is, as always, knowledgeable on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">these issues, my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) and for Braintree, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" name="Lynda Waltho">my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.0/6">Our vision is of health and education properly resourced, offering world-class services, with parents and patients fully empowered through voice and choice to have a real impact on quality. Ten years on, it is a vision that retains hope and aspiration. I commend the Gracious Speech to the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.0/7"><i> Amendment proposed,</i> at the end of the Question, to add:</p>
	<p pid="b.637.0/8" class="indent">&quot;but regret the absence of measures in the Gracious Speech to empower professionals responsible for the delivery of health and education services and of measures which would make those services more accountable to patients and parents; deplore the absence of measures to improve public health and reduce health inequalities; regret the lack of a reformed legislative structure for the National Health Service which would reduce central targets and devolve decision-making closer to patients and enable health services to respond to the need for high quality and accessible care; further regret the lack of measures to deal with school discipline, raise standards in literacy, numeracy, science and languages, address under-performance in the primary sector, tackle disadvantage at its roots and provide effective support in the earliest years; and further regret the absence of measures which would deliver the real improvements needed in these and related public services.&quot;<i> &mdash;[Mr. </i><i> Lansley</i><i> .]</i></p>
