<p>The Eire Government have informed us that their attitude is as follows:&#x2014;They state that, in their view, the right to grant asylum is not in question, and that they can give no assurance which would preclude them from exercising that right should justice, charity or the honour or interest of the nation so require. They

also refer to the absence of a comprehensive international code applicable to the matter, and to the lack of a generally recognised court or procedure for the judicial determination of individual cases. They go on to say that, on the other hand, since the present war began, it has been the uniform practice of the Eire Government to deny admission to all aliens whose presence would be at variance with the policy of neutrality, or detrimental to the interests of the Irish people, or inconsistent with the desire of the Irish people to avoid injury to the interests of friendly States, and that when such aliens land they are deported to their countries of origin as soon as possible. They state that it is not intended to alter this practice.<br/>
The United Kingdom Government, for their part, wish to make it clear that it would certainly, in the words used by the Eire Government, be "detrimental to the interests of the Irish people," were war criminals to be harboured in Eire.</p>

<p>asked the Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, whether he will give instructions that the Union Jack shall in future be flown over the office of the United Kingdom representative in Dublin, seeing that the Sinn Fein flag is flown over the office of the High Commissioner for Eire in London and the swastika flag over the German Legation in Dublin.</p>

<p>As the House is aware, it has not hitherto been the practice to fly a flag from the office of the United Kingdom representative in Dublin. The attitude adopted by the Eire Government towards the war and the fact that enemy representatives in Dublin are in a position to fly their national flags clearly raise special considerations in this case. My noble Friend, however, on re-examining the question, feels that these con-


siderations do not justify a departure from the normal practice obtaining in the Commonwealth. The Union Jack will accordingly be flown in future from the office of the United Kingdom representative on appropriate occasions.</p>

<p>That is a matter in which the Board of Trade is not primarily concerned: it is entirely a matter for the Treasury.

<p>I am glad of this opportunity to clear any misunderstanding there may be about the present position. The instructions so far issued cover the standing down of the Home Guard, not its disbandment. Members are therefore liable to recall if the need arises. The instructions for standing down the Home Guard make it clear that should the Home Guard be recalled for active duty, members will report for duty complete with the items of clothing and equipment which they have been allowed to retain. It will not be until the actual disbandment of the Home Guard that members will be allowed to dispose of, or have their khaki greatcoats, trousers, etc., dyed for use as civilian clothes.</p>

<p>I have been asked to reply. The cost of reducing the pension


age under the new social insurance scheme, for single women only, from 60 to either 58 or 55, for a pension of &#x00A3;1 a week, would, if taken in isolation, require an extra contribution of about 2d. or 5d., respectively, if paid by or in respect of all women until marriage. The necessary contribution would be only slightly reduced if the liability were extended to all women contributors, married and unmarried. As the hon. Member will appreciate, however, if she reads paragraph 11 of the Government Actuary's memorandum, which deals with the basis of the contributions for women under the scheme, a change in the pension age for single women would necessitate a general reconsideration of the rates of contribution proposed for all classes, both men and women&#x2014;a task which I should not feel justified in asking the Government Actuary to undertake at the present time.</p>

<p>Since my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has not himself returned to this country, he has asked me to give, with the leave of the House, a brief account of our visit to the French capital this last week-end. The over-whelming impression left upon our minds by those crowded hours was of the sincerity and spontaneity of the welcome accorded to us by every section of the French people. The House will recall, perhaps, that for reasons of security no announcement was made of the Prime Minister's presence, even on the morning of the Armistice ceremony, in the French papers themselves; yet the news of his coming had spread overnight, widely enough at least for immense multitudes to assemble on the main thorough-fares through which he was to pass. It would be a great mistake to interpret this welcome as a momentary effervescence of spirit in a great capital city at last delivered from four years of foreign rule. It was something much deeper than that. It was rather the expression of a deep thankfulness for suffering at last ended. One felt behind the tumultuous greetings of these vast but orderly crowds the heart beat of a nation once again united with its Allies and confident of its own future.<br/>
It is difficult for us here to picture the life that is endured by a great nation under enemy occupation, completely severed from all contact with the outside world, dominated by enemy propaganda and able only to get encouragement from time to time from some clandestine listening to broadcasts from overseas. Here it is right that I should say that from countless Frenchmen we heard expressions of the inspiration and the will to live which they have drawn front the broadcasts of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and, let it be added, from the daily regular work of the B.B.C. and its contributors.<br/>
Most of the German propaganda was directed against this country but the fact remains&#x2014;a fact of which we should take note&#x2014;that the effect of this propaganda, taken together with the sufferings of the French people in this period of tyrannous enemy rule, has been to place our friendship with France on a surer foundation than has ever existed before in the history of our two countries. It seems indeed that the knowledge that our friendship has survived this, the most severe strain that could be put upon it, gives it a deeper and a more vibrant significance. That, I am convinced, is the message which Paris was giving to this country during that week-end.<br/>
In the course of his speech of welcome to us, General de Gaulle recalled Hitler's claim that his system would last for a thousand years. "I do not know," said General de Gaulle, "what will remain of his system in a thousand years, but I do know that in a thousand years' time France, which has some experience of blood, sweat and tears, will not have forgotten what has been accomplished in this war through blood, sweat and tears by the noble British people under the leadership of their Prime Minister." These are generous words. They were uttered by a man who himself to-day unquestionably inspires and personifies the unity of the French people. He has around him a band of young and vigorous colleagues who have proved their worth in the ordeal through which France has passed. Among them in particular I would like to mention M. Bidault, now Foreign Minister of France. It was a great pleasure for the Prime Minister and myself to meet this gallant man, who was himself the outstanding leader of the French resistance movement. We could see the same vigour, the same confidence in France's future expressed in the thousands of troops who marched past us in the Champs Elys&#x00E9;es, the great majority of whom are very recently enlisted members of the F.F.I., and every man of whom is a volunteer. No one can doubt that when time and opportunity offer, these men will give as splendid an account of themselves against the hated Nazi foe in the field as they have already shown in the bitter and bloody warfare in the interior of France itself.<br/>
I would like to make one reference to conditions in France, because I think we should bear in mind that, despite some outward appearances, life in Paris is a constant struggle with material difficulties. The almost total lack of fuel and of transport are, in themselves, a severe hardship in these winter months, but worse than this is the mental suffering which these people have undergone and continue to undergo. There are still over 2,500,000 French prisoners of war, political deportees and forced labourers in Germany. There is scarcely a family of France which has not a husband or a son still in Germany. All parcels and letters have ceased. In fact, deportees have never been allowed any communication of any kind with their families since they were taken away to Germany. When we consider these facts, we can perhaps estimate, too, what the absence of these men means to France, not only in the loss of a great part of what was best in the nation's manhood, with all the social, economic and military consequences entailed, but also in mental distress for those who are left behind.<br/>
It is not surprising that in these conditions, France, which after all these years has suddenly regained her freedom, should be like a man emerging from a darkened room into a blaze of light, dazed for a moment and grateful still to his friends for a measure of understanding and encouragement. Let us interpret this in the terms of France's position as a great Power. It was indeed appropriate that the three Allied Powers, the United States of America, the Soviet Union and ourselves, were able to invite France, on this very Saturday, to take her place with us as a permanent member of the European Advisory Commission. The new situation which was thus created and the work that must flow therefrom was naturally the subject of discussion between us in Paris. Of these discussions, I will only say now that both the French Ministers and ourselves regarded them as eminently satisfactory.<br/>
I would conclude with this confident message to the House. France's determination to work together with her Allies expresses, I am sure, the heartfelt wish of the French people, and it is the will of the people which is the only sure foundation of a foreign policy in a free land. France will recover. Before now in her history she has shown powers of


recuperation which have astounded the world. It is my belief that she will do this again, and she can be assured that in her endeavour she will have the constant friendship, understanding and help of the British peoples everywhere.</p>

There are two formul&#x00E6; ordinarily used by the draftsmen in these Bills which set up new Ministries. I think that when a new Ministry is to be presided over by a Secretary of State the formula which I am now proposing has invariably been used, but when the Ministry is not to be presided over by one of His Majesty's principal secretaries the formula in the Bill as drafted is more usually employed, but the formula which I venture to prefer is sometimes employed, and was so employed as lately as 1942. There is not very much of great substance in this, and I would not pretend that there is, but there is this much: First, the formula which I suggest is the politer of the two, and I think for that reason is to be preferred; and, secondly, if there is any effect upon the relation between prerogative powers and statutory powers as between these two forms of words&#x2014;if there is any difference and I will not pretend that I am sure there is any considerable difference&#x2014;then the words which I suggest are words which leave the prerogative untouched, and when statutory omnicompetence is beyond challenge it seems to me on the whole useful that the Committee should not accept, except for a very strong reason, anything which might diminish the potential of prerogative, a potential which might come in useful on later occasions.</p>

<p>I should like to raise a point which brings us into rather a different sphere, and that is the significance of the words "may" and "shall" which come before us from time to time. When in a Bill it says that something "may" be done that confers a power to do something; though it is "may", the Minister has got to do it. That is why we are told that "may" has the same meaning as "shall". That is borne out by the Interpretation Act. Here the words are, "It shall be lawful for His Majesty," and the curious position


is that under Section 30 of the Interpretation Act the Crown is put in the same position as the subject. There is no reason why in the case of something applying to the subject the word should be "may" and when it applies to the Crown the word should be "shall". When those who practise in the courts see in an Act of Parliament words different from those which they are accustomed to see they want to know the reason for the difference. They always ask, "What did Parliament really mean"? For that reason I am rather keen that we should have a uniform code in these matters and not a code which seems to vary from Bill to Bill, and to some extent my Amendment raises that issue in addition to the issue raised by my hon. and learned Friend opposite.</p>

<p>Well, my historical friend; I beg his pardon. There is no consistency at all in these matters. When Parliament passed the Ministry of Pensions Act, 1916, a formula was used quite different from any other, because the Act says:
<q>There shall be a Minister of Pensions appointed by His Majesty.</q>
That is a most curious formula. There should be some coherence in these matters. I support my hon. Friend's Amendment. If his is accepted I do not want mine, but if his is not accepted I want mine.</p>

<p>I should like to support both the Amendment of the Senior Burgess for Cambridge University (Mr. Pickthorn) and the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) and to make one or two remarks on the phrase "It shall be lawful." I am not dealing with the precedents in former Acts; I am sure they are of recent date and that they do not go back much farther than the last century. To my mind the phrase "It shall be lawful for His Majesty" is impertinent to His Majesty, because it suggests that His Majesty can also do something which is unlawful, and that is completely wrong. We all know the old maxim which says, "The King can do no wrong." Although the King might appoint a Minister without coming to this House the King would not be doing any-

thing unlawful, but he would be merely misguided. The acts of such a Minister would be unlawful, but not the act of the King in appointing him. This matter has been dealt with by many of our constitutionalists. Long ago a famous judge made it clear that everyone is under the King and that the King is under no one, unless, indeed, Almighty God. Therefore, I suggest that the words "It shall be lawful for His Majesty" are inappropriate. Our Whig ancestors, if they had had any notion of the extent to which the prerogative would have got into the hands of the Executive Government in a generation such as this would probably not have been quite so pushing in their attitude in that particular regard, and I think, although it may be only a matter of phraseology in these days, that the words "It shall be lawful" should be left out of this Bill.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my two hon. Friends for putting down these Amendments and raising this point, because it enables me to tell the Committee that I agree with my hon. Friend that we ought to be uniform. We did carefully consider the most appropriate formula for a Bill of this kind a year ago, when the drafting of the Town and Country Planning Act was under consideration, and I think I can convince the Committee that, on the whole, this formula is best, though I agree there is not a great deal in it. In the first place, of course, it is a fact, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge University (Mr. Pickthorn) emphasised, that the Crown has a prerogative right, exercised, of course, under the advice of Ministers, to create new offices and appoint persons to fill them. They cannot, of course, sit in this House unless there is statutory authority for them to do so. The Minister in West Africa, and the Minister in Washington were appointed under the general prerogative powers, but they could only sit in this House by virtue of the certificate under an Act which we are not discussing to-day. That is important, and I agree that that right is preserved and should be preserved.<br/>
Now we come to a different type of Minister, the type we are dealing with in this Bill, where the office is created by Parliament. There is a difference here. This office has its source in the Statute. My hon. Friend who moved the first


Amendment drew attention to the fact that in the past a different form of words has been used when making a new Secretary of State from those used when creating a new Minister by the powers of the Bill, as happens here. That is because Secretary of State is an old prerogative office and it has been recognised that the Crown can create new Secretaries of State, which would, of course, need an Act if they were going to sit in this House, but otherwise I think would not need an Act.<br/>
The problem which we had to face was what was the appropriate form of words to mark this distinction, that is to say the distinction between the point when an office is created by Statute and when it is the creation of the prerogative power. We considered the precedents. Precedents are not always binding, if they are bad precedents one can depart from them, and, indeed, in one sense in this formula we depart from a precedent. We found, going back to 1756, an Act which set up, I think, the father of the Office of Works. In that Act we found the formula "It shall be lawful," which has been used generally when offices were the creation of Statute. It seemed to us that that had some constitutional importance, and that it would be a pity to depart from a formula which for nearly two centuries had normally been used, when dealing, as here, with an office which was the creation of Statute. We therefore thought it would be right to use that phrase "It shall be lawful."<br/>
It is said that there was a more recent case, in 1942, where there was a departure. I agree that we have not been quite uniform, but when we went into the circumstances in more detail we came to the conclusion that it would be better to get back to the old formula which has its roots in the past in order to mark the distinction which I have demonstrated. I hope the Committee will take that view. I am not quite sure what I am dealing with now. My hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) has an Amendment about the word "shall" in line 6, and I am not sure whether that is before the Committee. It is a rather different point, but I will deal with it. I agree with my hon. Friend and should like to be able to draw up a simple code to say when "may" is to be used and when "shall," but it is not so easy, because of the variety of circumstances which present themselves.<br/>
I will tell the Committee why we use "shall" here. There is not a great deal in it but in Clause 6 there is a power to transfer certain powers. There is no definite group of powers which have got to be transferred, and if we had put in the word "may" somebody might have got up and said "You have only an optional power; you need not do anything at all." Therefore, the word "shall" was inserted to make it clear. I will give the reason, although some may think it a bad one. The word "shall" was inserted to make it clear that it was the intention of the Bill that there "shall" be a transfer of powers. I think that is a good example of a rather unusual set of circumstances which leads one to use the word "shall," and I think it is the appropriate word.</p>

<p>May I point out that under Section 32 of the Interpretation Act, 1889, it is a duty to exercise the power which is conferred, so that the Interpretation Act says in effect that when the word "may" is used, it has the operative effect of "shall".</p>

<p>It is rather an exceptional power because it gives discretion as to whether you "shall" transfer. That is precisely the reason why we thought it best to depart from the word "may," and use "shall." If my hon. Friend will look at Clause 6, he will see that there is a power to transfer any of the powers, but it does not say that you are to transfer, as so often happens in these Acts. Anyhow, that is the reason and I think it is a good reason.</p>

<p>I pointed out to my hon. Friend that he had an Amendment down dealing with "shall" in line 6, and he said he had the leave of the Chair to deal with that. If it was a mistake, I apologise, but perhaps later when the Amendment is moved, I will not have to repeat what I have said. On the


main point, I ask the Committee to allow us to keep the words "it shall be lawful for" and if we get a decision of the Committee to that effect, it might save discussions of this kind in the future.</p>

<p>I am not in the least trying to dispute with my right hon. and learned Friend, but I want to get this matter clear in my own mind. I had a rather vague notion that it was a rule of law&#x2014;I think established by a leading case about 100 years ago&#x2014;that where statutory competence enters a field, prerogative competence is, thereby, for the future, excluded from that field. Therefore, I heard with a little dubiety my right hon. and learned Friend say that prerogative should be and is preserved.

<p>I quite agree that one wants to be careful about how one uses words in this technical field, but, where the office is the creation of a Statute, and not the creation of the prerogative, one is clearly in a different constitutional area from that in which no office has been created by Statute but by His Majesty the King, and all I said was confined to the case such as this where the office was itself a creation by statute.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 6, leave out "Social", and insert "National".<br/>
I am sorry that my hon. and gallant Friend the Senior Burgess for Oxford University (Petty Officer Herbert) is not present to move this Amendment. He is busy elsewhere and therefore I am obliged to move it in his place. I am sure that he would have moved this Amendment far better than I can do; I yield to him in mastery of, but not in affection for, the English language. He has been for years drawing attention to various examples of the practice of Government Departments in presenting to Parliament Bills which contain unfortunate jargon such as there is in this one. The object of this Amendment is to change the title "Ministry of Social Insurance" to "Ministry of National Insurance". It seems that there is no possible reason for using the expression "social insurance" at all. It is very

curious how phrases obtain currency, in quite a wrong interpretation. Very often they do not mean in the least what they appear to say. We had such an example &#x2014;if I may use the analogy&#x2014;in the expression "collective security". Everybody thought "collective security" meant huddling together for common action, whereas it meant the security one hoped to obtain by common action.<br/>
Here we are dealing with another phrase which it is sought to introduce into an Act of Parliament, but which does not mean what it professes to mean. I am glad my right hon. Friend the Minister-Designate is here to-day. I certainly do not like the expression "Minister-Designate". I think it is foreign to the House of Commons and I have never heard it used before. It reminds one of a Crown Prince of a rather unsuccessful principality somewhere in central Europe, although it does mean, to some extent, what it professes to mean. "Social insurance," however, in a Bill of this kind does not mean anything. The insurance is
doubtful. The State contributes a large proportion to that insurance, and I think we can accept the title of the present National Insurance Act, but to put the word "social" in here does not mean anything except in so far that all insurance is, to some extent, bound up with society. Any form of insurance means the insuring either of members of society or, broadly speaking, of their goods, but why put it into a Bill of this kind? It seems to me to be pure jargon.<br/>
If I may use another analogy to show how entirely nonsensical this expression is, I would remind the Committee that the right hon. Gentleman who is about to become Minister of Social Insurance&#x2014;we hope "National Insurance"&#x2014;is at present Minister without Portfolio. I believe it would sound a little odd if we had suggested that a new office should be created known as the "Ministry without Social Portfolio." If you compare that with the expression "social insurance." it seems to me you have a fair analogy, and it shows how idiotic the expression is. I hope the Government will consider this point. This is not a matter of carping criticism; many of us believe that when an expression is used, that expression should mean precisely what it professes to mean, and should not be inserted


merely in order to look nice and agreeable. In other words, it should not be a further example of that from which we have suffered in the past. I hope, therefore, that the Government will change this expression which is, at best, redundant, and, at worst, nonsensical.</p>

<p>I beg to support the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Penryn and Falmouth (Mr. Petherick). I too prefer the word "national" to "social." The word "national", for what it is worth, does stimulate some sort of patriotic spirit. If I, as a non-manual worker, have to pay 4s. 2d. a week for the rest of my life and if when I am ill I cannot get my benefit for several weeks and, because I continue to work, I do not get my pension, I would rather think I was suffering patriotically under a national Minister. If by any chance this scheme does not work&#x2014;and it might not work if the economic condition of our country is not looked after very carefully when the war is over&#x2014;it may well be nothing less than organised poverty &#x2014;I would rather bear with that scheme if I knew, as I have said, that it was being run under a national Minister. That would maintain my spirits. I dislike the word "social" intensely. I have always associated the word with those people in and outside of this House who are concerned with the welfare of all men of all nations but seem to have no friends themselves. I dislike it too when applied to Governmental matters because these things, I believe, originated in Germany. The Germans were the past masters&#x2014;the forerunners&#x2014;of all this sort of thing. In the last century they established social ministers for pensions, for health insurance, and so on. They did that consistently, because they were so full of charity and brotherly love towards one another.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George), who has been recently much extolled, borrowed his scheme from the social aspirations of the Germans, but he did have the decency to call it "national insurance." I remember too that when British doctors were going to refuse to work the scheme because of its obvious injustices he was so impressed by the State sociability of Germany that he even thought of bringing those social-minded German doctors into this coun-

try to take their place. Right up to the beginning of the war the Germans maintained their sociability&#x2014;they had their "Strength through Joy" movement. They promised motor cars for all. They endeavoured to produce perfect physical health in the workman by sending him to the labour camp at a shilling a day. That social method resulted in the most ruthless totalitarian regime in the history of the world, in the most savage war of all time, and even during the war they still stick to their social methods by winter help campaigns.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Gentleman is getting far beyond the Amendment. The question before the Committee is one of changing a name.</p>

<p>I am trying to show why the change of name should be made. I dislike the word "social" because it brings up all these associations in my mind. I want to show how much more preferable "national" is to "social." With your permission, Major Milner, I propose to complete this part of my speech very quickly, but I would remind the Committee&#x2014;I believe this is quite in order&#x2014;that in the year 1789, a nation which was wishing to become super-social and which wanted to establish sociability among nations for all time, quarrelled with its past history, and destroyed its traditions and the happiness of more than one generation. These people did not foresee, however, the corruption and the disruption and the humiliation of the Third Republic. Those are some of the reasons why I dislike the word "social."<br/>
If, therefore, I am to suffer, possibly, under the failure of a scheme of this kind, if I am to become for my remaining mortal years a member of an ant-hill or, a beehive. I would rather do that in a patriotic manner and think that I am suffering under a national Minister however variegated his political coat. I think, perhaps, in saying these things, I have the approval of, possibly, a few of my colleagues. I will not put it too high. I was foolish enough to do this a short while ago and 1 certainly will not do it again unless I have it in writing. But I do not seek the approval of any on this bench or anywhere else who are considering trimming their political sails in a "Jowitical" manner, so as to ensure a safe place for themselves in any provisional Government.</p>

<p>The mover of the Amendment, and myself, and, I hope, others associated with it, somewhat regret it has obtained support from the hon. Member who has just spoken. If he had not spoken, I think I could say with some degree of confidence that the Minister would accept the Amendment, not only for the reasons put forward by the mover, but for considerations which have already weighed with the Committee this morning and which have been put forward by the Attorney-General in resisting previous Amendments; that is to say, the consideration of consistency of language in Statutes and of attaching recognised meanings to words that are employed. We are here faced with the word "social," which we desire to remove. I have looked up the authorities, as I could not remember having seen that word in an Act of Parliament before. I looked up many books and official indices to the various digests. I have been through them all, and I can find the word used only once. It will be found in the official compilation dealing with statutory definitions. The expression "social insurance" is there to be found, but I noticed that it was printed in italics. On looking at the commencement of the volume, I was informed that words in italics were only cross-reference heads, and not terms actually found in any Act of Parliament. Therefore, the onus is heavily upon the Government to establish some specific reason for introducing a word which has never been found in legislation before.<br/>
The good reason would be that the Measure deals with a novel proposal, and a type of insurance that has never been known before, but all Members of the Committee will be aware that insurance for unemployment and health has been found in the law of this country for some time. When one turns to the first Act of Parliament dealing with insurance, the Act of 1911 which, I would remind the Committee, dealt not only with health insurance but with unemployment insurance as well, one sees it is called the "National Insurance Act". Therefore, we already have on the Statute Book an example of the use of the word "national" in a comprehensive sense, dealing with insurance. I therefore put it to the Minister that there is no case and no precedent for the introduction of the word "social", while

there is ample precedent for the word "national" in the sense in which it is implied in the Bill. I therefore support the Amendment.</p>

<p>In supporting the Amendment I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any significance in the word "social". My reason for supporting the Amendment is that the word "social" expresses to my mind one particular section of the public, rather than the public as a whole. As I understand this Insurance Bill it is, in fact, national. Every member of the community will make his or her contribution under the Bill, and will derive benefit from it. Surely, therefore, it is national rather than social.</p>

<p>I must say I was somewhat astonished at the definition that has just been given by my hon. Friend. In his eyes, society includes only a limited number of people commonly known as the members of the best or highest society.</p>

<p>My definition of the word is far removed from that expressed by my hon. Friend. Perhaps, instead of attempting to interpret my views, he would accept my words in the spirit in which they were given.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1840.5" hansard_membership_id="8860" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17927" speakername="Mr. Mander" colnum="1840" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend said that society comprised only a limited number of people and that was the remark which I ventured to criticise. To my mind, that is not so at all. Society includes the whole population in this country, high and low, rich and poor. For that reason "social" seems an eminently suitable word to employ in the Bill. Furthermore, the position is complicated by another Amendment which may be discussed later, suggesting that the word "insurance" should be left out. Of course, I cannot deal with that suggestion now, but it has its bearing on our present discussion. Some of the arguments in favour of the Amendment seem clearly swayed by party passion, and feelings aroused in past disputes and battles. My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton (Dr. Thomas) was obviously influenced by them. There is


some sort of feeling too that the word "social" is too near to "Socialist" and might give the idea that this is a Socialist Measure. A good deal might be said, if we are going in for slogans, for calling the whole Measure "The Beveridge Act" and having done with it, but I would not suggest that either. The Government would be wise and right to maintain the word "social" because, as I say, it comprises the whole of the people of this country, whose needs and troubles and difficulties are going to be looked after by the Measure now before the House.</p>

<p>It would be a great pity if the Committee thought that this question was a matter of party differences. It is a question of the right English word to use, and of the meaning to be attached to the word. I believe that the word "national," as has been said already, is historically justified in this connection. This Ministry is the culmination of a long series of Measures, beginning with the great Measure of 1911, which was a national insurance Measure. It will unite under one Minister all forms of national insurance which are at present separated under three Ministers. On the other hand, whatever meaning we may attach to the word "social," the fact remains that not all forms of social insurance will come under the Ministry. There will be admirable forms of insurance, such as insurance for educational endowment, which will not be comprised in any way within the proposals which are before Parliament now. The Minister will have a great and noble title if he is known as "The Minister of National Insurance." It will be understood by everyone, and it will link up his work with all the great work of the past, of which his office is the culmination. I hope therefore that the Amendment may be accepted.</p>

<p>I hope that the Government will accept the Amendment. I will not go so far as to agree altogether with my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton (Dr. Thomas) but to large sections of the nation there is a little in what he says. The word "social" may be taken as slightly suspect, but there is good precedent for the use of the word "national," which cannot have any political significance attached to it. It seems to me obviously the word to use in this connection. As

other hon. Members have pointed out, the word "national" has been used for years to describe this sort of thing and it would be a great pity if it were thought that the Amendment had been put down with any political object. I am quite sure it was not so, although I did not put my name to it. It seems obvious that "national" is the word that should be used, and I urge the Government to accept it.</p>

<p>I was very glad to hear the speech of the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander), although I would point out that if we are going to discuss definitions we may go on for the rest of the day and not make very much progress. The argument that "society" implies all the society within this nation is very foolish. As I understand the matter, "society" is a term embracing all individuals who enter into continuous relationships with each other, in which case we should have to include the rest of the world, because they are in continuous relationship with each other for a large part of the time. Therefore the definition of "social" has a worldwide significance, and no special relation to the nation at all. I, therefore, feel that we must limit the definition, and the limiting definition is the use of the word "national." I should have thought that was self-evident, and I hope that the Government will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I am in favour of the Amendment, which seems to be supported from nearly all sides of the Committee. To me, the word "social" is misleading. It generally connotes some activity of a voluntary kind. There is, for example, the National Council of Social Services, which is quite voluntary. My desire to be associated with this Amendment has nothing to do with any party considerations. May I assure my hon. Friend the Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) that when I think of the Liberal Social Council I do not think of any particularly dangerous party organisation, because, so far as I know, it is a voluntary body and Liberals have not to attend it, unless they want to. So this word "social" is bad in that connection, because it implies a voluntary organisation. On the other hand, the word "national" means that it is all-embracing and comprehensive. The word con-


veys the idea that the Measure will be compulsory in its effect upon everybody. Just as we have a Ministry of Labour and National Service, where the service arranged by the Ministry is compulsory service, so we shall have a Ministry of National Insurance which will include everybody. We should use the word "national" if the scheme is to be compulsory.</p>

<p>I have a vague idea, if not a strong suspicion, that the expression "social insurance" is the result of a typical Coalition compromise. I imagine that the Labour Members of the Coalition wanted to call the new organism "The Ministry of Social Security," hoping that after the next Election the scheme of the Ministry could be placed upon a subsistence basis. I suspect that the Conservatives then said: "Oh no, it is not a security Measure at all; it is an insurance Measure. Let us call it social insurance." Then the Liberals, both the Liberal Nationals and the National Liberals, wanted to put in the word "national," because that is the only word on which the Liberals of both sides are agreed, but they were wiped out, as a small minority. As the Conservatives were in the majority in the Government, a compromise resulted, and their suggestion was adopted.</p>

<p>I think it is time the Government stated their view on this Amendment. There are two changes proposed in regard to the name by which my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister-Designate is to be known, after this Bill has passed into permanent legislation. It is suggested on the one hand that we should change the word "Social" which occurs in the Title of the Bill to "National," and there is, as the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) has indicated, a further Amendment which will be discussed later, changing the word "Insurance" to "Security." It is perfectly obvious that the acceptance of both these Amendments would result in our having a Ministry of National Security, which puts me in mind&#x2014;</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Member will wait to see whether I am resisting or accepting this Amendment. I have not discussed the course which the Government propose to take. I was saying that it is perfectly clear that we do not desire, in any quarter of the Committee, to have a Minister of National Security. I was not much impressed by the argument of the hon. Member for Southampton (Dr. Thomas). His objection to the use of the word "Social" in my right hon. and learned Friend's title, is based apparently on the fact that our enemies in this war used to be known, and are still known, as National-Socialists. It clearly cannot be brought as an argument against the word "social" in the Bill that the word was used by Hitler in National-Socialism, or the objection to the use of the word "national" would be equally strong.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1844.2" hansard_membership_id="12584" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19381" speakername="Mr. Peake" colnum="1844" time="">
<p>I was indicating to the hon. Member what part of his argument had failed most to impress me. The reason why we included the word "social" in the Bill was that it has been current for many years in international usage. This subject has been discussed at the International Labour Office meetings year after year and for something like 20 years it has been known as "social insurance." Moreover, my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir W. Beveridge) defined it in his Report. If hon. Members look at paragraph 26 of that Report they will see that he says:
<q>The term social insurance' to describe this institution implies both that it is compulsory and that men stand together with their fellows. The term implies a pooling of risks except so far as separation of risks serves a social purpose.</q>
These seemed to us to be quite good reasons for putting the word "Social" in the Title of the Bill. In deference to my hon. and gallant Friend the Senior Burgess for Oxford University (Petty Officer Herbert), whom I had expected to move the Amendment, I looked up the


definition of the word in the Oxford English Dictionary. I found there that perhaps the best definition is that "social" means
<q>marked or characterised by mutual intercourse, friendliness or geniality; enjoyed, taken or spent in company with others.</q>
That would seem, on the face of it, to apply admirably to a scheme of insurance which is to cover, not one subject but several departments, to cover industrial injury, to cover employment, to cover health. These seem to me adequate reasons for putting the word "Social" in the Title of the Bill.<br/>
At the same time, this is a House of Commons matter. Members on all sides have spoken in favour of using the word "National" rather than "Social". There has not been a single speech, with the exception of that of the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton, in favour of the retention of the word "Social".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was not present during the earlier part of this discussion, as I was called out of the Chamber. I think it would be unfortunate in a small Committee, with few Members present, to assume that the whole Committee is burning to change the word "social" to the word "national." The words "national insurance" suggest something for the defence of the nation. When we talk about insurance against war, or the danger of war, and the necessity for heavy armaments, we talk about national insurance against war. Whatever this scheme may be, it is not a militant scheme; it is a social scheme to raise the general standard of security among the bulk of the people, bringing in for the first time the whole of the community. That is its significance. It would be rather unfortunate if the word "national" should be brought in, changing the tone and temper of the whole of this great scheme. I do not think it is the right word. I think this change

for the word "social" suggests that the Government do not see in this scheme. as we see, a great social contribution to the general welfare and security of the common people.<br/>
So far as I am concerned I do not attach too great importance to words. The success of this Bill will depend first on the right hon. and learned Gentleman who is to be the Minister, and secondly, on the various Acts that will follow to carry out the recommendations of the White Paper. That will be the test of this new Department, not its title, not whether it is called the Ministry of "National Security" or "Social Security." I rather see in this change of title a lack of faith, a weakening of enthusiasm, and I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman the Financial Secretary to the Treasury shows himself so easily subject to small pressure from half a dozen Members. Even the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Senior Burgess for Oxford University (Petty-Officer Herbert)&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes. I am not trying to exercise pressure, I am trying to strengthen the Government to stick to their own title. After many months&#x2014;two years&#x2014;they have summoned up courage to create this new Ministry, and because of a half dozen Members they throw over half its title. That is the pressure. I want to strengthen their hands. The right hon. Gentleman who has spoken for the Government showed no enthusiasm for the change. He is only giving way because of pressure. I want to support him in sticking to the original title, which was a good title and bad popular support, and I believe that the nation wants to see it functioning.

<p>I should like to make quite clear, that what has taken place has altered the whole possibility with regard to the Amendment which I and some of my right hon. Friends proposed to move at a later stage. I would, perhaps, be in Order now in saying one or two words on the subject now under discussion. If we are to have an Amendment at all to the Title of the Bill at least let it be an accurate one. We seem to have been allowing ourselves and our imaginations to supply various meanings of the word "national" but the important thing, not only for the immediate purpose, is that the Title should be an accurate one.<br/>
It is also important because there may be developments. This Ministry may not last for ever. It may be in the minds of some Members of the Government to propose to transfer, at some stage, the whole of these duties which are being transferred to this new Ministry, to some form of Board. We may as well have the Title accurately given in this Bill, which confers on the Minister important functions which have nothing to do with insurance. There is assistance at an estimated cost of &#x00A3;69,000,000, the raising of &#x00A3;39,000,000 for the national health scheme and family allowances and training. It has not yet been explained to the Committee why not social security, but social insurance is to provide the sum of 5s. for the first child in a family, when the wage-earner in the family is unemployed. We have not yet heard the explanation of why it should be done in that way. That an allowance should be made in those circumstances, I entirely agree, of course, but why that small section of family allowances should be granted under the insurance scheme, is a matter which requires consideration. Then there is the sum of &#x00A3;39,000,000 for national health insurance and a grant of &#x00A3;500,000 to the Ministry of Labour training scheme.<br/>
The name of "social insurance" is not the right Title for this Bill. The whole question of assistance comes in, which has nothing whatever to do with insurance. The Title of social insurance is in keeping with the lack of enthusiasm about this scheme. The Government have not done justice to themselves or their proposals in this matter. Their statements are all under-statements. With

regard to this scheme they have failed to relate this important advance in social legislation to Article V of the Atlantic Charter wherein we are pledged to co-operate with other nations in promoting social and economic advancement and social security.</p>

<p>It is wider than that. It covers children's allowances, which is not insurance, and it covers assistance, which is not insurance.

<p>I suppose we can continue the discussion as to whether "Social" or "National" shall be used. I am sorry that the Minister so readily gave way. The people of this country for the last two or three years have fully understood all the implications of this scheme, and what the Ministry will have to do. To change the word is really confusing the public mind, however meticulous Members may be about getting the right words. I am surprised that some of my colleagues are supporting the change. After all, there are nations within Great Britain, and the term

"national" might apply either to the Welsh nation, the English nation, the Scottish nation, or the Irish nation. But the word "social" is universal: it applies to all the people in the country. To say that the scheme might apply internationally is merely straining the term. From the very inception of the study of social insurance, particularly since the appointment of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir W. Beveridge) by the present acting Leader of the Opposition, the people of this country have understood the term "social insurance" much better than they are likely to understand the term "national insurance." I think that the Government were quite correct in their first thoughts, and I still hope that they will not give way. We have been using the term in all our propaganda for the last two or three years&#x2014;I am not speaking of my party, but of all the parties in the Government. The B.B.C. have been using the term. It is now a public term, understood by the public of this country, and I sincerely trust that the Government will not give way.</p>

<p>I have hesitated very much t<ob/> intervene in this Debate, because I felt quite certain that, sooner or later, I should be out of Order, as it seems to me quite impossible to discuss the issue between "national" and "social" without discussing the subsequent words "security" or "insurance." After all, the title of the Minister is these two words together. I hope that I shall be allowed to go on to suggest that by far the best title is "social security," and neither "national security" nor "national insurance," which are both inaccurate, and contrary to the anticipations of the public in regard to this Measure.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is perfectly entitled to say that the title should be "social security," bringing in the word "security," but, of course, he must not discuss the insertion of the word "security." He is entitled to discuss how other matters will be affected if the word "national" is inserted.</p>

<p>If you will assist me, Major Milner, I will try to keep straight on this matter. Clearly, "social security" is the title in the Atlantic Charter, and is the title understood by


people in this country, and everywhere, as the right title. Therefore I for one shall oppose this Amendment, with a view to making it possible to alter the title later to "social security." I would say only one more word on this question of insurance. "Insurance" does not cover certain things which are definitely in the Bill. Of course "social security" does not cover security of all kinds, but "social security" does cover all the things which are in the Bill, while "insurance" does not.</p>

<p>The Committee are in some difficulty in discussing subsequent Amendments in this Debate. If I were in Order in discussing now Amendments which I have on the Paper later&#x2014;which I should certainly not be&#x2014;I would argue on the question of whether this was a Ministry of Social Security or not. I do not think it is. The Solicitor-General, on the Second Reading, said that payment in cash is under this Ministry, but benefits in kind are under other Ministries. The whole hospitalisation of this country is outside this Bill. Therefore, it seems to me that it would be describing it altogether falsely, to call the Ministry a Ministry of Social Security. I will not enlarge on that, because I should be out of Order and because I hope to be able to discuss that particular aspect on an Amendment which I have put down later; but to call this a Ministry of Social Insurance would be following a practice which has been accepted in this country for many years. The Government have agreed to bow to the wishes of the Committee on the matter, and, therefore, I hope we shall be able to go on to discuss subsequent Amendments, which raise great issues, and not take a long time over a matter on which the Committee have given their views and the Government have given theirs. I do not think the matter can be properly discussed further, without bringing in other Amendments which have not been reached.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends talk about the vocabulary ordinarily in use among the public. Perhaps the Committee will be interested to know that the average man when he falls sick nowadays, and applies for National Health Insurance sickness benefit, talks about "going on Lloyd George." When,

therefore, this new plan comes into operation, the sick will not bother about "national" or "social" insurance; they will simply say, "I want my Beveridge." They will not even mention the right hon. and learned Gentleman apposite; they will quote the name of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir W. Beveridge). Let me say, as one with some experience of this business, that I do not think it matters administratively very much whether you call it "national" or "social." Everyone who has administered the present scheme is accustomed to "National" Health Insurance. I was sorry the hon. Gentleman mentioned the Atlantic Charter in this Debate. I could not understand the relevance of it at all, because the Prime Minister has thrown over the Atlantic Charter long ago. I cannot see the slightest reason for a party political quarrel over these words. All I would say about the word "national" is that it does at any rate distinguish between a State and a Prudential or a Refuge insurance scheme.</p>

<p>Yes, but he said, without using the forbidden word, that it could not be called a National Security Bill, because it did not cover hospitals. He might just as well have said that the Ministry of Health was not a proper title because the Ministry did not include the functions of the Ministry of Food, which are essential to health.


I think that if that title were used, it would give a stimulus to future Parliaments to bring their Measures up to the standard of the legislation which I hope will be passed here, either before or after the next election.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I have not heard most of this Debate, having been at another meeting, but I am bound to say that I feel a little distressed at the intention of the Government to accept this Amendment. After all, this term "social insurance" is now part of the ordinary talk of men and women. It represents a new conception. It is an idea of the community, through its various social agencies, pulling together all the various forms of insurance for social objects, and I should have thought myself that, if Amendments were to be Amendments accepted&#x2014;and I am not asking that any should be accepted&#x2014;this was the last one which the Government would ever have thought of accepting. I would like to get rid of the term "national insurance." It is not national insurance in the full sense of the term, anyhow. The term "national insurance" is bound up with the old days. Surely, now, the whole idea is of social security, which is not embodied in this Bill, as the Government have admitted, though it is a national aim now. I should have thought the Government very ill-advised to accept the Amendment&#x2014;although I gather there is a good deal of feeling in the Committee in favour of the term&#x2014;and, if the Amendment were to be accepted, I might ask on the Report stage for a further opportunity for reconsideration.</p>

<p>My name is not down to this Amendment, but I have listened to this Debate. We are not discussing anything novel. All we are discussing, as hon. Members will see if they read the Bill, is the transfer of functions of the Minister of Health and Secretary of State for Scotland, with respect to national health insurance, old age pensions, widows', orphans' and old age contributory pensions and supplementary pensions, and these are all developments of national insurance. There is nothing novel about that. Then there are the functions of the Minister of Labour and National Service with respect to unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, which was originally called

national insurance in the Act of 1911. Finally, there are the functions of the Secretary of State with respect to workmen's compensation, which is to be changed from an individual insurance to a national insurance. Family allowances, which are the only novel feature of the scheme, are associated with the scheme of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir W. Beveridge).<br/>
We have only added a bonus to all the benefits and pulled them about a bit. The only thing that is fresh, legislatively, in the Bill, is family allowances; the rest is merely putting a few more storeys on the old structure, and altering the position of the lavatory and the pantry. Why pretend that you are doing something novel, when all you are doing is to pay out larger benefits and collect larger contributions, and bring all this under one Act? Instead of having these matters dealt with by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labour, the Treasury and the Home Office, you put them all into one and call it social insurance. Let us be truthful about it.</p>

<p>I know, but there are some things not in the Bill which are to be done. There are certain aspects of rehabilitation in connection with workmen's compensation. I did not hear the speech of the hon. Member who opened this Debate, but I heard the reply from the Financial Secretary, and I think the grounds on which the Government accepted the Amendment were extremely flimsy. The fact that there are to be social welfare committees, replacing those under the old term in the localities, seems to me an additional reason for calling this social insurance.</p>

<p>I am quite aware of that, but, if my right hon. Friend will read the speech of the Solicitor-General on Friday and the longer one made earlier in the week, he will see that the hon. and learned Gentleman went to great pains to show that, in workmen's compensation, there would be other matters of concern to this Ministry in addition to the mere paying-out of money. I asked the question on this point specifically on Friday. I support the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Greenwood) for the reasons he gave, and because the people themselves think of this Ministry in terms of a social insurance Ministry. The term has a similar connotation in the Dominions and in the International Labour Office and I think that merely to change it and give it the much less interesting title of national insurance is a retrograde step.</p>

Have any of them ever, at any time, suggested that there should be a Minister of National Insurance? Has anybody in this House, or in the country, ever suggested that we should have a Minister of National Insurance? I see the Minister without Portfolio is nodding his head, as if in affirmation, or to suggest that he knows of someone. Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman know of anyone who has ever proposed that a Minister of National Insurance should be appointed?

What has been the demand in the country and in this House? It is that we should have a new Minister of Social Security. What is being put across the Committee is a trick upon hon. Members and upon the people of this country, but the trick is being exposed by this discussion. Who wants a Minister of National Insurance? What is the sense of going to all the trouble of issuing all the reports and White Papers, or the promises which the Minister of Labour has time and again repeated, in declaring that social security would be guaranteed to the people of this country? Now, we are offered a Minister of National Insurance. It is playing with the matter and playing with the people of this country. I say that we should have a Minister of Social Insurance and Social Security, and that the Bill should be in accord with what is understood by the people of this country, who ought not to be tricked, as they are, obviously, being tricked now.</p>

<p>I rather differ from many of my hon. Friends on this side. I think the Government were perfectly correct. The overwhelming weight of argument, and the majority of hon. Members of the Committee, were in favour of this change. I made an almost formal intervention, because I thought the whole thing was finished, but now the Debate is being revived, and by what? By some substantial argument? Not a bit of it, but by political trickery. My hon. Friend behind me makes an attack on this change, but what the change does is to describe accurately the intentions of the Government. What my hon. Friend wants is to deceive the people by words leading them into thinking that they are having what they are not going to get. They are not going to get social security from the proposals of the Government. Then why should the Minister in charge be called the Minister for Social Security?</p>

<p>We are discussing the word "national" against the word "social." We are not having a Minister for Social Insurance; otherwise, the whole thing becomes meaningless. Society includes more than the nation. I know the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir W. Beveridge) fell into the error of using those words, but why should we follow him? I


know that the word "social" has been used for many years in international conferences, but it has been used very loosely. We are not, in fact, engaged in building up a system of social insurance, but in trying to collect from the poor people of Great Britain, large sums of money to redistribute among the poorer. As a matter of fact, the principal burden of the scheme is going to fall upon the poor people, and we are going to collect money from the poor people to pay the poor people. Then what is the use of trying to discuss a scheme of social insurance? I share my hon. Friend's indignation, but I would ask him how would he describe this Ministry if we had a non-contributory scheme of social security. He would have set such a limit to hyperbole that he would not find a name for it at all.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General on Friday said:

<p>My hon. Friend, the other week, made a most modest and impressive speech in describing this proposal. Now, he says it is indeed a scheme of insurance, and the Government have decided, for the reason which the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed gave in his Report, but which I have never shared&#x2014;that people in this country prefer to pay for things rather than have them for nothing. He believed that the principle of insurance was so deeply rooted in the hearts of the British people that they ought to have an insurance system. I accept that, like my hon. Friends here, under duress, but I am not going to practice deception upon my constituents or the people of Great Britain in trying to persuade them that they are going to have things which they are not going to get, and I am astonished at some of my hon. Friends. I am asking for national insurance and for the use of the term "national insurance," which specifically describes for the people the nature of the scheme.</p>

<p>There will be a task in fitting in administration with certain other fragments of administration, but are you going to describe the bulk of this task in the terms of the minor portions of that task? The overwhelming part of his task will be to collect very large sums of money amounting to &#x00A3;600,000,000 or &#x00A3;700,000,000 from agents and contributors and to redistribute that sum. His administration will be concerned with other forms of assistance and help. This will be one-seventh and he wants to turn the one-seventh into the other six-sevenths. An hon. Member says "Rubbish." I have listened with patience to my hon. Friend for some time but I am bound to inform him that I am shocked when Members of the House of Commons try, by altering the language, to change the content of what they are doing and persuade people outside that we are doing what we are not doing. The people in Great Britain have, by the most insidious propaganda for the last two years, been prepared for something they are not going to get. Having used this propaganda and language, my hon. Friends are fixed to this verbal wheel. Let us be honourable and call the thing what it actually is.</p>

<p>Our great national poet asked, "What's in a name?" I am bound to say that the Committee has discussed this matter pretty fully now. I cannot myself think that it matters whether you call this Minister "The Minister of Social Insurance" or "The Minister of National Insurance." In a sense, the scheme that we are going to adopt is the nation's scheme, and in another sense the words "social insurance" have been well known since the work of the I.L.O.; and in the Report of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir W. Beveridge) following his terms of reference, he described it as a "Report arising out of the work of an inter-departmental Committee on social insurance and allied ser-


vices." We want allied services, and this Bill is to establish the Ministry of Social, or National, Insurance, I do not mind which, and for purposes connected therewith.</p>

<p>Will the Minister make it plain to the Committee that it was the Government and not myself who chose the title "social insurance and allied services"?</p>

<p>I said that the words were in the terms of reference and I do not think that they were inappropriate or wrong, and there is no reason to apologise for those words. The words "social insurance" would convey something quite definite to my mind on those lines, and equally so the words "national insurance," and I really cannot think why it matters at all.</p>

<p>We put it in because it was in the terms of reference in the Report and was used by the I.L.O. for the last 20 years. On the other hand, the National Health Insurance Act uses the word "national."<br/>
I am unable to become excited on the question one way or the other. I do not think that it matters a bit whether you use the word "national" or "social." It is a technical matter on which the Committee will decide. I agree that we have sat here for a long time and heard supported from all quarters of the Committee an Amendment in favour of "national" as against the word "social," and with hardly an exception, or with one exception that was worthy of note, feeling seemed to be that way. That being so, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury said that he would accept the Amendment. On that I think we ought to stand and I ask the Committee to come to a decision and settle the matter one way or the other.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of particular importance, I agree, but the Government seem to be very ready to adopt the change. They adopted a word which has considerable usage and it was assumed in all quarters that the Government would stand by their own decision. But in the few minutes that I was out of the Chamber the Government seemed to alter their mind. They now desire to change the Title of the Bill.

Are the Government going to come down with their Whips and order the whole Committee to go into the Lobby and change their decision, on the ground of a few people speaking in this Committee for this change? If the Government cannot go back on their statement to-day, the least they can do is to leave the matter entirely to a free vote of the Committee, and let Members of Parliament choose for themselves. If the Government allege that the Committee wants the change, let them put it to the Committee, frankly and fearlessly, and see whether it is the case. If that is not so, I suggest to the Government that the least they can do is to allow the matter to be raised again on the Report stage and consider whether the House would not like to reverse the change. I am used to the somewhat lyrical language of my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. A. Bevan) but I cannot see any leading of the country "up the garden." The words "social insurance" have become a necessary phrase in this country, and a change would be a grave mistake.</p>

<p>I do not take exception to what the right hon. Gentleman has said. I do not want to over-emphasise the importance of the wording of the Ministry; the success of the Department will be judged by results. My hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. A. Bevan) read into the position very much more and attaches great significance to the word "national" instead of "social." He has gone out of his way to condemn the whole Department of which the Minister is to be the head, and hon. Members on the benches opposite cheered him vociferously for the interpretation he put on the new scheme and the new Ministry.</p>

<p>On the contrary. My right hon. Friend, like a good many other hon. Friends, was out of the Chamber at the beginning and did not hear the Debate. I said that as certain intentions are being disclosed by the Government, they ought to use nomenclature which described those intentions.</p>

<p>The reason why some hon. Members on this side of the Committee and some hon. Members opposite were cheering the speech of the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) is because we happen to have a preference for words which mean what they say, and not for words which suggest all kinds of schemes which could not be carried out.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale and the hon. Member for Penryn and Falmouth (Mr. Petherick) are right, why set up this new Department, with a new staff, a new building, and perhaps two or three Parliamentary Secretaries solely to collect insurance money from the public?</p>

<p>I am glad to see that some of my hon. Friends, the young Tories, have been most vociferous in demanding a Minister of Social Security, and because they want a Minister of Social Security we are going to support this new Ministry. We gave the Bill a Second Reading. In view of the pressure of the character we have had here, and the kind of arguments that have been used, I wish to say that so far as I am concerned, if I am the only one, I shall oppose the change.</p>

<p>I want to deal with that point and then come to the words "national" and "social." The Member for Ebbw Vale made a very wordy argument about the question of national insurance. He says that the word "national" will more correctly describe the contents of the Bill. But the important

thing is that we want this Ministry not to be static, and tied to the contents of the Bill, and that is the danger of tying the Minister down simply to the contents of the Bill as it stands. That is why we should accept the Amendment. We want the Ministry to be something of a character which is continually developing and extending.</p>

<p>The important thing is to start off with the setting up of this Ministry. Certain ideas have been developed in the country and in this House and those ideas have determined that a new Ministry shall be appointed. We do not want the Ministry to be hampered in any possible way. We want it to have the opportunity of reaching up in every direction. That is the importance of not limiting it simply to a question of national insurance, though national insurance may be an essential feature of the Bill. The Ministry, this Committee and the people will be working for a continual expansion of the influence and ramifications of the Ministry. The hon. Member for Ebbw Vale has taken up a very bad conservative attitude on the question of the word "national" as against "social."</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 6, after "Insurance," insert:
<q>who shall hold office during His Majesty's pleasure.</q>
I raised this matter on the Second Reading on Friday, and I had a reply from the Solicitor-General, but I was not as much impressed as I am normally by the hon. and learned Gentleman. Until the present Government came into being, it was almost invariably the case that the words to which I refer appeared in Bills of this kind. The last Bill passed by the predecessors of this Government which created a Ministry was the Ministry of Supply Act, 1939, when it said:
<q>It shall be lawful for His Majesty to appoint a Minister of Supply &#x2026; who shall hold office during His Majesty's pleasure.&#x2026;</q>
I have looked up precedents to the best of my ability and I find that when the New Ministries Act was passed in 1916&#x2014;it received the Royal Assent on 22nd December of that year&#x2014;it established a Ministry of Labour, a Ministry of Shipping, an Air Board, and a Ministry of Food, and in all these cases these words appeared. They appeared also in the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, the Ministry of Health Act, 1919, and in the New Ministries Act of 1916. So here we have a vast volume of precedents. I presume that the various Ministries responsible for drafting these Bills, spread as they have been over many Governments, must have thought the words had a proper significance. The Deputy Prime Minister on Friday, when I asked when it had been discovered that these words were unnecessary, replied that it was shortly after 1939. I hope, therefore, that we shall have from the Attorney-General

or the Financial Secretary to the Treasury some statement as to the way in which this great discovery was made. It is true there is one exception&#x2014;the Ministry of Pensions Act, 1916. I think it is rather strange, this curious inconsistency with which different people draft these Bills, and I think we ought to do better. There ought to be some common form when you are trying to achieve the same kind of purpose. In the Ministry of Pensions Act it says:
<q>In order to unify the administration of such pensions, grants, and allowances as are hereinafter mentioned, there shall be a Minister of Pensions appointed by His Majesty.&#x2026;</q>
without reference to His Majesty's pleasure. That is the only exception I have been able to discover. I tried to find out how the Secretary of State for Burma came into being, but an hour's search in the Library beat me. The index to the Statutes said, "See Secretaries of State." Under that I got to "Burma," which said "See Burma," but there was no answer to the question&#x2014;a complete cross-reference without any answer, for I could not find the Secretary of State. Although there are many references to him in the Government of India Act, there is no reference as to how he came into being. I assume he was created by the Royal Prerogative without an Act of Parliament. As I say, in all these cases, these words have appeared except in the Town and Country Planning Act, this Bill, and the Ministry of Fuel and Power&#x2014;I think there was an Act for that purpose&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, the fourth. They were always kept in before, with that one curious exception of the Ministry of Pensions. I therefore hope that the


Attorney-General will be able to satisfy my mind that there is no malicious conspiracy about leaving out these words.</p>

<p>I entirely agree with my hon. Friend that so far as possible, where you are seeking to achieve the same purpose, you should use the same words. But it is impossible to have complete uniformity of drafting methods because, naturally, each Bill has its particular draftsman and it is impossible to get complete co-ordination as to what may be analogous matters. It was for that reason that I told the Committee just now that in the last three or four years we have given a good deal of thought to what is the best and most appropriate formula constitutionally to insert into a Bill which seeks to create a new Minister. My hon. Friend is quite right in the examples which he gave, but we came to the conclusion&#x2014;and I think I shall carry the Committee with me&#x2014;that the words, "during His Majesty's pleasure," were both unnecessary and had better not be in the Bill. It is a fundamental principle of our constitutional structure that those who hold office under His Majesty hold it at His Majesty's pleasure, unless there is some express statutory condition to the contrary. The most obvious examples are His Majesty's judges, who are removed by His Majesty but who can only be removed if there is an Address to His Majesty by both Houses of Parliament. Everybody serves during His Majesty's pleasure unless Parliament puts an affirmative obstruction in the way.</p>

<p>I cannot be positive about everybody, but it certainly applies to civil servants. Parliament sets up an office but the appointment may be made not by His Majesty but by the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer or another Minister, and sometimes the office is given a definite period of five years. But the category of people I am speaking of are people who are appointed for service under His Majesty

without any statutory period for their dismissal, or a statutory period being assigned to their office. In these cases they can be dismissed at pleasure. When we came to examine past precedents we found that in a number of cases the words, "during His Majesty's pleasure," had been inserted and were unnecessary. It was perfectly obvious that the Minister held office at pleasure whether the words, "at pleasure," were in the Bill or not. I agree that it was patchwork before. It was because we hoped to arrive at a satisfactory formula that these changes were made, and in view of that explanation I hope my hon. Friend will withdraw his Amendment.</p>

<p>We are concerned to see what is the express relationship between the head of the State and any servant of the State, whether the head of the State happens to be a monarch or president of a republic or anything else. The meaning of "during His Majesty's pleasure" is perfectly clear. It means on advice to His Majesty, except where His Majesty has to act without constitutional advice, such as dissolution and, possibly, the dismissal of a Prime Minister in exceptional circumstances. There is need for us clearly to understand whether good government or bad is being carried on. I beg to ask leave to withdraw my Amendment.<br/>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 8, leave out "and of the Secretary of State."<br/>
It will not have escaped the attention of the Committee that there is still a good deal of haziness in the minds of Members as to what this Bill actually does or does


not do, and I think this Amendment gives us one opportunity of clearing up the matter. During the discussion on the Second Reading of the Bill I asked the Solicitor-General during his reply to the Debate:
<q>May I take it that, roughly speaking, services in kind come under the Ministry of Health and services in cash are transferred to the Ministry of Social Insurance?</q>
My right hon. and learned Friend replied:
<q>Yes."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th November, 1944; Vol. 404, c. 1701&#x2013;2.]</q>
That brings up clearly the fact that all the great hospitalisation and treatment services remain with the Minister of Health in England and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland. One of the things this Bill is doing is divorcing payment in cash from treatment. It does not seem to me that that should be done unless it is absolutely necessary, and I submit that it is not absolutely necessary in the case of Scotland. There, you have a Secretary of State who is carrying out not merely the duties of the Minister of Health in England but many other duties, and whose peculiar position is recognised in many of the reorganisations which have been carried out even during the life of this Parliament. In the case of town and country planning these duties are exercised in Scotland through the Secretary of State but not by the Minister of Health in England, and so the combination between town planning and housing, which has been broken in England, has been maintained in Scotland. I submit also that the close connection between treatment and payment which exists in Scotland should be continued there. It is true that advantage has not sufficiently been taken of that close connection in the past, but advantage is being taken of it to an increasing extent.<br/>
We all remember in Scotland what has recently been done through the inquiry, initiated by the Secretary of State, with regard to treatment in the South-West of Scotland, in Clydeside and in other areas. From that inquiry the country was able to derive great advantage. For instance, it was ascertained from some 50,000 cases, that one of the two main causes of present-day disability was dyspepsia. This was an important point in dealing with the nutrition policy of

the country. There is an opportunity for more of that kind of thing being done in the future. Maybe it can be done properly by a Minister of Social Security or Social Insurance; it is the function that the Minister will carry out that is important, and not the label that we put upon him. A Minister of National Insurance may be able to carry out an analysis of the great mass of statistical detail which has been collected and centralised. A great mass of information has been collected on the health of the country, through the insurance system, but little advantage has been taken of it, to influence the remedial steps which should be taken in future. But a system whereby a man who is sick in hospital comes under one Minister and, when receiving cash benefits only, comes under another Minister is not necessarily an improvement. The new steps about to be taken could be utilised by the existing Ministry&#x2014;the Secretary of State.<br/>
The remedial developments which are now taking place in Scotland are developments which will be more and more closely concerned with the proposed work of the Minister of National Insurance. For instance, there is the great extension of hospitalisation which is taking place there, all available for remedial treatment. Some 7,000 beds have been added to the hospitals of Scotland. The Secretary of State has utilised the Emergency Medical Scheme as a means of wiping out one of the greatest blots in Scotland before the war, namely, the waiting lists of hospital cases&#x2014;of people who have been waiting anything from one to three years for attention, for rehabilitation. The control of all the great amount of insurance money and the responsibility for it will pass away from Scotland if this Bill goes through in its present form.<br/>
There are some 340 employees on the insurance side who fear that if the Bill goes through they, or many of them, will have to move from Scotland to some place in England. All that weakens the power of responsible administration in parts other than London. This is a bad feature in our present life. It took place in Wales. When I was Minister of Health the question of the Welsh Board of Health was of interest to me. I took certain iconoclastic steps, not with the object of weakening authority in Wales but of strengthening it. For instance, we trans-


ferred to Wales its own town planning. Unfortunately, under a later Bill this was later re-transferred to London. Well, Wales will fight its own battle, but until we have stronger reasons than we have had up to now we should not consent in silence to the transfer of this piece of administration out of Scotland, where it is properly used, and where it can liaise completely with other parts of Scottish administration, into England.</p>

<p>I think every Scottish Member will endorse what the right hon. and gallant Gentleman has said. I do not know what sort of battle may have been on behind closed doors. I cannot see the Secretary of State for Scotland willingly handing a half of his Department away to remote control in London. If we ever have any trouble with the administration of widows' and orphans' pensions, or the old age pension, we have very little difficulty in contacting someone with responsibility. I have had during the war some experience of remote control of the Ministry of Food and of the inrush of the Ministery of Works and Buildings into Scotland. We are not asking to add to our powers but we certainly do not want any of them taken away. This will arouse considerable feeling throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. They do not seem to realise exactly what is taking place.<br/>
If the Secretary of State were nothing more than a grafter and did not like work, I could understand him sitting back and permitting half his responsibility being removed to the South, but the present Secretary of State is not a fellow like that. I should like to hear the arguments that convinced him that this change was necessary. I do not want the Minister to give away any stable secrets but, if we are to be asked to give our consent to a change like this, it will take a good deal of convincing before he will get the consent of the Scottish Members. If there had been any maladministration, one could see the sense of it. The administration of National Health Insurance has always been centred in Edinburgh. I have no great regard for Edinburgh, as Edinburgh&#x2014;my Scottish colleagues will know what I mean&#x2014;but it is easier to

lift the telephone and get into touch with someone with responsibility at St. Andrew's House than to try to get through the maze not only of the telephones but of corridors in London. I have never been able to contact a Minister in London, other than the Scottish Office, in any Department since I arrived here. We can go to St. Andrew's House and the man at the door knows us all and sees that we get access to the Minister. The prospect of the barrier of flunkeys that we find in a London Department applied to Scotland is too horrible to contemplate. Scottish Members will listen with interest to whatever my right hon. Friend has to say, but I want to warn him in advance. I think Welsh Members are entitled to line up&#x2014;</p>

I am not in the market place asking them for a <i>quid pro quo,</i> but I cannot, for six months in the year, propagate the idea of the same facilities for Wales as we have in Scotland and then lightly let the facilities depart from Scotland without a protest. I have convinced almost every Welsh Member that a Secretary of State is more desirable for the Welsh nation&#x2014;</p>

<p>Possibly I am at fault for introducing it, but you, Mr. Williams, interrupted me, otherwise I should not


have said half as much about Wales as I have said. I had no intention of discussing Wales at all. I hope the Minister's reply will be satisfactory. We do not want one Minister saying one thing and another another, and loyal Labour Members being compelled to vote against the Government again. I hope that the statement that we get will be one with the authority of the Minister behind it. I am sure my colleages will await what the Minister has to say with some curiosity.</p>

<p>I hope I can give some reassurance to the Scottish Members, and, incidentally, also to Welsh Members. The object of setting up this Ministry is to make one Minister solely responsible for the various schemes of social insurance, assistance, including supplementary pensions and workmen's compensation. If the Amendment were accepted, we should get a complete division of authority, and this would result. The new Minister would be responsible for health insurance payments in England and Wales, for unemployment insurance payments throughout Great Britain, contributory pensions in England and Wales, assistance other than by way of supplementary pensions in Great Britain, supplementary pensions in England and Wales, old age over 70 pensions in England and Wales and workmen's compensation in Great Britain. That would be a quite unworkable set-up. What I propose is this. In the first place, it seems to me that the main principle upon which the new Ministry must work is devolution. It must decentralise. It must leave, as far as possible, Scottish officers sitting in Scotland to deal with Scottish problems with the very minimum of interference and reference to England. As far as the 340 officers who feared that they may find themselves removed from Edinburgh to London are concerned, many of them may be married people and I can understand that it would be a serious matter for them, but I do not think there is the slightest reason to fear any such thing. My intention, as far as I have anything to do with it, is that Scottish problems shall be settled in Scotland. I think I can do something to improve upon the present lay-out very considerably.<br/>
It is so easy to say that these problems all come under the Secretary of State for Scotland to-day but I would ask the Committee to consider in what sense they do.

Let us always distinguish between medical benefit and sickness benefit. They are terms of art and they are defined in the Act of 1936. Medical benefit means treatment and attendance, sickness benefit means, of course, periodical payments which, after a time, give rise to disablement benefit and so on. Both benefits are, in some sense, at present, under the Secretary of State for Scotland but observe in what sense. Medical benefit is, of course, run through insurance committees and the Secretary of State for Scotland has power to give directions and instructions to insurance committees about this, that and the other matter. Sickness benefit to-day is run through approved societies, and the Secretary of State for Scotland has the right to make rules and regulations concerning approved societies, but the link that ought to be provided by the Secretary of State having ultimate control of both these functions fails in its effect altogether by reason of the fact that he has not got control at the critical point of time.<br/>
For instance, the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) last week referred to the fact that there were shelves upon shelves of medical reports which were not used, and that is true, because these reports belong to 101 different approved societies and there is no system whereby they communicate either to the Ministry of Health in England or to the Secretary of State for Scotland the conclusions that they ought to draw from the vast mass of statistics which they accumulate. If, for instance, an epidemic is breaking out in one of our great cities in England or Scotland there is no means by which the approved societies can communicate with the Ministry of Health. If there is one area of a town which shows a greater incidence of disease, which may point to bad drains or bad housing conditions, there is no system whereby they communicate in any way with the Ministry of Health or the Secretary of State for Scotland. Those Ministers have to rely for their medical statistics on other methods altogether. They have their own clinics and hospitals. In so far as their own doctors are consulted, information filters through but this great source of potential information, which might be of such enormous value in enabling health visitors to carry out their job, is denied them. Under the new dispensation I


hope that this will happen. If you are to have a co-ordinated system of paying these sickness benefits, which, of course, are paid on the faith of doctors' certificates, I hope we will have a department which will see to it that these statistics are analysed and gone through and checked so that useful information can be obtained, and the department will be run in collaboration between the Minister of National Insurance and the Secretary of State for Scotland, so that we shall be able to give him what he has never been able to have before, the mass of information which comes from the payment of sickness benefit, based, as it must be, on doctors' certificates. It may be found that a large number of people in a particular area, at a particular time, are getting benefits. That would be at once a pointer, and the medical officer would look into it to see what is the matter. That is something which you cannot do to-day.<br/>
2.45 p.m.<br/>
Therefore, without being able to give details&#x2014;the details have not yet been worked out&#x2014;arrangements will be made to enable Scottish business to be settled on the spot with the minimum of reference to the headquarters of the Ministry in London, and that the Ministry in Scotland will keep in the closest touch with the officers of the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is the Minister of Health for Scotland. By no means one of the least important results of paying out these monies will be to enable the Secretary of State to have all the possible information to enable him to perform his part of the concern, that is to say, the medical benefits of treatment and attendance. What I have said about devolution to Scotland of course applies to other areas of England and Wales. I am satisfied that it is only on these lines that this Ministry will be able to function properly and well. I need hardly say that I shall keep in the closest touch with the Secretary of State for Scotland in this matter, and I hope that, from what I have said, the Committee will realise that the Amendment would not enable us to carry out our idea of a unified service.</p>

<p>I must confess to disappointment, for the Minister has not said a word justifying the proposed change. The Bill proposes to transfer to London work which is at the moment efficiently

done in Edinburgh. I am satisfied that the machinery existing in Scotland is ample to give the Secretary of State all the information he wants. Nothing has been said against the present system of the Secretary of State being responsible for old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and health insurance. The bigger scheme may be more comprehensive, but no one will convince me that the capacity of the Department in Edinburgh is not such that it could not cope with the additional responsibility. We shall have to divide the Committee on this matter because we cannot allow it to go without protest. The devolution indicated by the Minister simply means that whoever is responsible in Scotland will hold only a secondary responsibility, and will be able to do nothing without consulting headquarters in London. It is no narrow nationalism which prompts me to take up this attitude. Scotland has at the moment an efficient machine, and we have been given no adequate reason why it should be scrapped. I am not prepared to put a new engineer in charge of that machine or to agree to putting the Secretary of State in the position of a second engineer who is unable to do anything without reference to remote control in Whitehall. Scottish Members are not going to stand for that, and I hope that my hon. Friends will force the Amendment to a Division.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman made a statement a few minutes ago to the effect that the 340 members of the Scottish health insurance staff would remain in Edinburgh to carry on under the new plan.

<p>I raised the issue because the right hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned it several times. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will forgive me saying that he is mistaken in stating that the Ministry of Health does not gather information from approved societies about the health of the people. The Ministry of Health and the Scottish


Board of Health from time to time call upon those societies to give information as to the health of their members, especially in relation to certain categories. I suppose that, on the whole, it will be financially beneficial to the Scottish and Welsh insured population to have a unified scheme for the whole country, but there is no doubt that this Bill is a serious blow against devolution for Scotland and for Wales. Whatever may happen regionally, the whole of this vast insurance business will in the end, for good or ill, be centralised in London.</p>

<p>In resisting the Amendment, my right hon. and learned Friend dealt with medical benefits and sickness benefits, indicating that the first were benefits in kind and the second payments in cash. He also said that medical benefits were in the hands of the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, whereas sickness benefits were in the hands of the approved societies. He said that he could give Scottish Members some assurance and that the new Ministry of Social Insurance would be able, since they would pay out sickness benefits, to gather all the necessary statistics so as to be able to advise the Minister of Health or the Secretary of State as to where the greatest amount of sickness benefits were being paid out, so that new and increased medical benefits could be given. Surely that was no argument against the Amendment. It was merely saying that where sickness benefits were on the increase, the new Ministry would have such evidence before it that it could send a message post haste to the Secretary of State for Scotland, if the increase was in Scotland, and advise him that something ought to be done by way of improved medical benefits. It seems to me that we are seeking to build up far too unwieldy a machine. It would be better if the payment of sickness benefits remained in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland and, instead of being paid through the approved societies, should be paid through local insurance officers under the Secretary of State. He would thus have the statistics in his hands much earlier than he could get them from the new Ministry. My right hon. and learned Friend has not convinced us that the centralisation proposed in the Bill is a good thing. Many of us believe that in the days to come, if we are to build up a

better way of life, we shall have to go in for the process of devolution rather than of centralisation.</p>

<p>There were two points in the right hon. and learned Gentleman's reply. The first was that, if he was not the supreme authority for the United Kingdom in all these matters, things would not work very well. We have plenty of instances in Scotland of powers which are carried out by a Minister in England being carried out by the Secretary of State. I see no reason why, under this scheme, the powers which are exercised by the Minister of National Insurance in England could not be exercised by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Second, the right hon. and learned Gentleman seems to think that if matters were all gathered together in his hands, the great quantity of statistical information could be put to better use than if we had matters carried out in Scotland under the Secretary of State. I do not understand that point. Statistics can be got out and sent to Scotland, and I imagine that the Secretary of State is as well able as any Member of the Government to appreciate statistics and to put them to good use.</p>

<p>I listened to the Minister trying in his suave manner to get Scottish Members to believe that there was no robbery going on here&#x2014;robbing Scotland of its independence. Scotland is watching this matter to see how the House will handle the situation. This means that Acts of Parliament that are to apply to England are to apply also to Scotland. We have had to pay the penalty many times of trying to make Acts of Parliament that were intended for England, operate in Scotland. The outstanding case was the Rent Act. I am giving this as an illustration. We have laws of our own in Scotland, we have songs of our own and a language of our own. We are a distinct race. We have a Secretary of State, a Lord Advocate and a Solicitor-General of our own, proving that our laws are not the same laws as those of England. The Rent Act which was passed here provided that any increase must be signed by the owner. That is all right in England, but it does not apply in the same way in Scotland.<br/>
In my constituency, Sir Robert McAlpine owned 10,000 houses, and the


rents were dealt with by a factor. It was the factor who signed and not the owner. We challenged that. We brought it to the House of Lords, and we won, so that the people in Scotland had the right to retain the rent for nine months because it was illegal and because it had been signed, not by the owner of the houses but by the factor. That is an outstanding instance of how the laws differ between Scotland and England, and I do not want the same thing to happen here. I am not putting in a special plea on behalf of the present Secretary of State; I am putting in a plea for Scotland; and I say we are not going to be relegated to second place to England. That is what is being done to-day. It is being done in a nice fashion, but the same arguments have been put forward time and again over the last 20 years when attempts have been made to tie Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to London. I hope that the Scottish Members will divide the Committee on the question.</p>

<p>While being very appreciative of the way in which the right hon. Gentleman, the Minister-Designate, approached the question, I cannot say that he has brought complete conviction either to my heart or to the hearts of other hon. Members sitting on these benches. What was his chief argument? It was that we were moving over from the approved societies, which he said had not been affected by the new position. That is to say, the matter has been changed from a functional to a geographical basis. The administration is now to be on a geographical basis. It is true that in the past the Secretary of State has not received all the aid he might have done from the approved societies, though he has the power to call for such aid or information, and, in many cases, has called for it. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Fraser) said that when the Secretary of State wishes to do so, he can call on the approved societies for the information he desires, and the fact that he has not done so, up to the present, is not an argument against the machine. We all know that in a change-over of this kind new contacts are picked up and existing channels of information are destroyed. In spite of everything, I think we shall have to register our views. We

cannot accept the explanation given as completely satisfactory.</p>

<p>In Scotland there is a very strong desire for a continual advance in the administration that exists, towards further powers that will give us an opportunity for representation of our own. In connection with this matter it is proposed to take away certain powers from Scotland, instead of giving powers to Scotland. I would particularly call the attention of Welsh Members who are making a fight for a Welsh Department to this position. It is important that they should know it. I would ask them to consider how serious it is, when everybody feels that there should be this development, that, instead of extending the functions of the administration, the opportunity should be taken on a Bill of this kind to limit the administrative powers of the Scottish Department. I would appeal not only to Welsh Members, but to English Members also who have, for a considerable time, suffered as subjects of a sort of dependency of Scotland, or claimed to be oppressed by the Scottish influx into England, to realise the importance, even for England, of the greatest possible measure of administrative power being maintained and extended in Scotland. I am certain the Welsh Members will see the importance of supporting this Amendment, but I would ask the English Members to realise the importance and the value, from the point of view of the whole administration of this country, of ensuring that the greatest measure of administrative power is left in the Scottish Department.</p>

<p>I have listened very intently to this Debate, and I think I can claim to be just as good a Scotsman as any other hon. Member who has spoken. I am wondering whether we are not being led astray by this nationalistic spirit of which so many hon. Members have spoken. I think the only criterion by which we should judge this situation is that of efficiency. Is the new set-up going to be more efficient than the old set-up? I cannot see that we are going to get any increase in efficiency by dividing this business in two. I feel also that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would never have agreed to this scheme if he had not been convinced in his own heart that this was the efficient and proper way. From that point of view, I rather doubt


whether by dividing on this question we should be doing the correct thing in the interests of the country as a whole. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friends to regard the matter more from the efficiency point of view than from the nationalistic point of view.</p>

<p>I have been induced to rise to my feet by the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher). His plea to Welshmen has brought me to my feet. The point now being argued is that we are in a reconstructive period of social insurance&#x2014;national insurace as it may now be called&#x2014;that there shall be pockets within the country controlled by a Minister other than the Minister responsible. I thought my hon. Friends from Scotland would have been convinced by their past experience. They ought to have known that supplementary pensioners in Scotland under the present system get, on an average, 2s. a week less than supplementary pensioners in England and Wales. I wonder how far that is due to this administration once removed from the general direction. I want to submit that if we are to have one department in Scotland and to have, perhaps, in the dim distant future, some other department in another part, it means that we shall have three departments controlling this national social insurance with, as it well may be, three different standards&#x2014;three different rates of benefit for the same contribution. All that is bound to arise if we departmentalise this national scheme. I know of no Welsh remedy for poverty and I know of no Scotch remedy for poverty. I am not interested in nationalism of any sort. I am amazed that my hon. Friend should take up such a reactionary point of view.<br/>
I take the view that here is a system which places upon every citizen in this country the same obligation, irrespective of contributions. In respect of those contributions, every citizen, whether he is in Wales, Scotland or England, is entitled to the same standard of benefit and to the same efficient service. That can be given only if the scheme is controlled from one centre. If it is to be controlled from three centres there will be three different standards of benefit, three different systems of working the scheme, and three different rates of reward to the people employed. I hope that the Amendment

will not be pressed because, so far as I can see, a case for it has not been made out.</p>

<p>I am not discussing the rates of benefit, and I am surprised that the Deputy-Chairman permitted my hon. Friend to make that intervention. It is not the Scottish Office which determines the U.A.B., which is not under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Office. If there is a disparity, as my hon. Friend suggests, the responsibility does not lie in Edinburgh. One would think, to hear my hon. Friend, that we were asking for something based upon a narrow Scottish nationalism. We are simply asking that the efficient machine in Edinburgh should be utilised for the purpose of administering the new scheme. If my hon. Friend had been in and heard the Minister, he would have heard him make the promise of devolution, of opening offices in Edinburgh or using the existing offices, and of putting a new engineer in charge. All we say is that the people in charge of this service at the moment in Edinburgh, and in Scotland, are the most efficient people to deal with it, without in any way interfering with the autonomy of either England, Wales, or Scotland, or without even postulating that you can cure


poverty by a narrow nationalism. We know all those things, and we do not want to be lectured on them. I certainly object to a Member coming in when a Debate is half-way through and saying that no case has been made out, when he never heard the case. I am satisfied that if he had heard the Minister's reply he is honest enough to have admitted that the Minister-Designate never replied to the case that was put at all.</p>

<p>On a point of Order. My hon, Friend persists in making the statement that I have not heard the case made out. I want to point out that I have heard five or six hon.

<p>I do not think there will be an extra first mate or an extra second mate. I have had sufficient experience of the Department in Edinburgh, and as a member of a local authority, to know that it is a backward step to try to set up an administration without the power to take decisions. The hon. and gallant Member who interrupted me is an old naval commander. He knows that if a sub. took a decision involving the safety of the ship without consulting my hon. and gallant Friend there would be hell to pay. I have been a seaman myself and I know what happens when there are too many bosses. If we have too many bosses administering the scheme the result will be the same. The Minister's suggestion of devolution frightens me if it means that when district or regional complaints have to be dealt with there will be nobody in power to take a decision other than at Whitehall.<br/>
I have already said that Whitehall frightens me even by the look of it. If you want to contact the Minister you can do it within two hours in Scotland, but if you want to do it in London&#x2014;well, one is lucky to find the Minister in London. One may have to go to Paris, Moscow or Washington. If he is in London, by the time one has got all the flunkeys, doorkeepers and side-steppers out of the way, the day is finished. We intend to divide the Committee on this matter, which is not one of narrow nationalism but of sheer, practical politics. I ask for as big a measure of support for the Amendment as we can muster.<br/>

<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>

<p>We have just had a Division on a point in Clause 1, and I hope I may be permited to ask the right

hon. and learned Gentleman one or two specific questions on the Clause itself. I think it is worth repeating that the insured population in Scotland and Wales will be better off financially by being included in a unified scheme rather than if Wales,


England and Scotland were placed in separate sections. But what worries some of us&#x2014;and perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman will be able to enlighten us on this&#x2014;is whether the administration and determinations on claims, apart from the collection of contributions and the actual payment of benefits, will be dealt with on a regional basis in Scotland, and the same applies to Wales, of course. I would not like, for instance, to see the Scottish region centred in Carlisle or the Welsh region centred in Bristol or Liverpool.</p>

<p>I cannot see how any Minister could possibly answer the hon. Member on this Clause, because the question of Wales does not arise on it, so far as I can understand.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1887.2" hansard_membership_id="3316" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30825" speakername="Mr. Davies" colnum="1887" time="">
<p>I do not want to challenge your Ruling, Mr. Williams, but when the right hon. and learned Gentleman takes over the whole of the insurance scheme, including Wales, he must cover the Welsh Board of Health which is now within the Ministry of Health. The whole of the insured population of Wales now come under the Ministry of Health, and the right hon. and learned Gentleman's new Department takes them over in due course.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1887.3" hansard_membership_id="7096" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16721" speakername="Sir W. Jowitt" colnum="1887" time="">
<p>The new Department takes over a particular part&#x2014;sickness benefit and medical benefit&#x2014;but if the Welsh Board of Health is responsible for medical benefit, the Welsh Board of Health will remain in the position of the Ministry of Health.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1887.4" hansard_membership_id="3316" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30825" speakername="Mr. Davies" colnum="1887" time="">
<p>When the right hon. and learned Gentleman's Department takes over some of the functions of the Ministry of Health he is taking over the Welsh Board of Health at the same time.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1887.5" hansard_membership_id="8284" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28887" speakername="The Deputy-Chairman" colnum="1887" time="">
<p>I must stick to my point. In the general matter, Scotland has a separate administration. Wales may have for one particular benefit, but it is not separate in the same way as Scotland is. Therefore, we cannot discuss Wales as a separate unit for all these things which are being taken over.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1887.6" hansard_membership_id="3316" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30825" speakername="Mr. Davies" colnum="1887" time="">
<p>Then I want to raise the case of Scotland&#x2014;and my arguments will apply equally to Wales. The hon. Mem-

ber for Caerphilly (Mr. Ness Edwards) will appreciate the argument in favour of retaining administration in Scotland better if I put it this way. Many approved societies include members from Scotland but their central offices are in England. For illustration nearly all the large friendly approved societies are in Manchester. A large number of trade union approved societies have their central administration in Manchester and London. A great number of these approved societies which the right hon. and learned Gentleman is taking over have members in Scotland, and that in spite of the fact that their offices are in England. When he establishes his new scheme he can, if he wishes, regard Scotland for the first time as a region on its own.</p>

<p>I must remind the Committee that we have already discussed this matter very fully. I am perfectly sure that we cannot discuss devolution again on the question "That the Clause stand part," and particularly not on this Clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1888.1" hansard_membership_id="3316" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30825" speakername="Mr. Davies" colnum="1888" time="">
<p>All I wanted to know was whether there will be a regional office in Scotland&#x2014;I think I am entitled to discuss that&#x2014;and whether that regional office, under the right hon. and learned Gentleman's new Department, will be situated in Edinburgh, as is the case with the Scottish Board of Health at present. I hope that I shall be able to discuss a similar position in regard to Wales at a later stage.</p>

<p>If I am entitled to answer, I can do so in one word. The answer is, yes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1888.3" hansard_membership_id="9084" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/27564" speakername="Mr. Graham White" colnum="1888" time="">
<p>I and my hon. Friends very cordially welcome this Bill, and especially this Clause. We particularly welcome paragraph (<i>b),</i> under which
<q>the functions of the Minister of Labour and National Service with respect to unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance</q>
are taken over by the new Minister. The cordiality of our welcome will be increased if advantage can be taken of this occasion to deal with the anomalous constitutional position of the Unemployment Assistance Board.</p>

Amendment which was ruled out because it was out of Order. It is certainly not in Order to discuss the Unemployment Assistance Board.</p>

<p>I am not sufficiently new to the procedure of the House not to know that that was a device that one should not employ. But this is a matter to which we attach great importance. Unless there is an opportunity to discuss it, we shall seek the opportunity, on this Bill and on every other occasion which presents itself, to make clear our views.</p>

<p>Are we to take it from that indication that all these matters, in relation to Scotland, pass under the control of the new Ministry, and that that Ministry will take over all such matters, which now have to be taken up with the Secretary of State for Scotland?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1889.4" hansard_membership_id="7096" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16721" speakername="Sir W. Jowitt" colnum="1889" time="">
<p>That is so. The Bill enables all these matters to be transferred to the new Minister.</p>

<p>What I am anxious about is whether the administration of pensions will be completely under the jurisdiction of the new Minister and will not be dealt with outside his Department. Can I have satisfaction on that point? There is a second point. Are we to take it that in each area a regional administration will be established, and that what the Minister really will do is to expand that regional type of administration to carry out the functions that are delegated to him by this Clause?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1889.7" hansard_membership_id="7096" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16721" speakername="Sir W. Jowitt" colnum="1889" time="">
<p>One must be careful in using the word "regional," because it has awkward connotations in some people's minds, but in the sense in which the hon. Member used the word, the answer is, yes. The new Minister will have regional organisations in various parts of the

country. With regard to the other question, on the main Bill we shall have to discuss the position which we cannot discuss to-day, namely, the relationship that the new Minister will have with the Assistance Board. I cannot anticipate that; it is a major matter which will have to be considered then. But, in so far as supplementary pensions are under Ministerial control, they will, of course, come under the control of the new Minister&#x2014;that is, without prejudice to the question, that we have to discuss, of what the relationship of the Assistance Board and the new Minister will be.<br/>
Question, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill," put, and agreed to.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 1, to leave out "any," and insert "a."<br/>
There are two Amendments down to this Clause and my name is attached to both, but the second one is the one which, I think, Mr. Williams, you have called. After my hon. Friends and I had put it down, it seemed to me that the word "a" was better than "the." This Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Amendments to Clause 4:
<q>Page 2, line 18, leave out 'any,' and insert 'the.'</q>
<q>Page 2, line 25, leave out from 'member,' to end of Clause.</q>
We had a Debate on Friday on whether there should be more than one Parliamentary Secretary under this Ministry, and I urged very strongly that one ought to be enough. Other hon. Members agreed with me, but I do not know what view the Government take. I am feeling a little hopeful that they do not want to see that spectacle of the other House being filled with retired gentlemen at &#x00A3;1,500 a year, which is one of the delightful possibilities under this Bill, and, in the cheerful anticipation that some Minister is going to answer me kindly on this occasion, I beg to move.</p>

<p>I wish to support the Amendment. I prefer the Amendment which you called, Mr. Williams, to the one which stood in my name. Obviously "a" is more specific than "the" and will enable only one Parliamentary Secretary to be appointed, instead of one or more. The object of the Amendment which I am supporting is to remove uncertainty and make the intention clear. I feel sure that no hon. Members will want to leave the matter so that any number of Parliamentary Secretaries may be appointed. Clearly, in this instance, one is sufficient, and I hope the Government will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>Hon. Members will realise that the Parliamentary Secretary is appointed by the Minister, but how Parliamentary Secretaries come into being is a little curious. The Prime Minister invites His Majesty to approve of them and, after these motions have been gone through, I believe that the Minister, under a seal, appoints them. Here there is no reference either to the Prime Minister or to His Majesty. It is just a flat appointment by the Minister, and I am not certain about it. I have not had time to look it up, but I think it is unusual. In the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1916, Chapter 68, the thing is rather differently worded, and I do not know whether the point has been considered. For example, in Section 9, Sub-section (2) it says:
<q>Notwithstanding anything in any Act, an additional Parliamentary Under-Secretary may be appointed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</q>
"Appointed to," not "by." Will the Attorney-General be good enough to explain? Like me, he likes these things done tidily, and, when we are trying to do the same kind of thing, we ought always to do it in the same kind of way, and I am just wondering why the Govern-

ment have chosen those words "appointed by the Minister" instead of "to the Minister." As I understand it, at the present time, though the actual formality of appointing is done by the Minister, the Prime Minister says he has a vacancy and invites somebody to fill it. As a matter of wisdom and courtesy, he probably does consult the senior Minister, but the appointment is by the Prime Minister subject to the approval of His Majesty. Those words of the Act of 1916 are rather interesting, because "appointed to" clearly indicates somebody else, and not that the Minister makes the appointment. I should like the Attorney-General to look into the point and let us have his view on the matter.</p>

<p>I was very pleased that the right hon. and learned Gentleman looked kindly at the Amendment for one Parliamentary Secretary, because I understand that, since the war began, we have established eight new Government Departments, and, of course, this present Bill will make the ninth. At the beginning of the war, we had 26 Ministers; now we have 39. We had 24 Parliamentary Secretaries in 1939; we now have 40. Consequently, the House of Commons has to be careful what it is doing, lest the majority of the Members of this House might become Government servants, which, of course, would be a calamity and take us right into the totalitarian stage. I am pleased that this new Ministry is being set up, but I would not like to see it so overburdened with under-secretaries to the extent that it might be challenged later on by those who are not enamoured of the Ministry at all.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 7, leave out from "1941," to end of paragraph.<br/>
The words proposed to be left out are:
<q>other than powers or duties conferred or imposed under Sections thirty-five to forty- three of the National Health Insurance Act, 1936 (which relates to the administration of medical benefit)</q>
This Amendment is of importance. I am not certain whether it is a desirable Amendment or not, but it raises the very important question, "Are you going to separate entirely the responsibility for medical benefit from that of cash benefit?" Before a man is entitled to sick pay, the doctor has to come into the picture. There has to be certification that he is qualified for a weekly cash payment, or any payments that may be authorised under the existing Acts or any future Acts. This Committee should think before it decides that the right place for medical benefit is outside the scope of the authority of the Minister of National Insurance. I should have thought that, on many grounds of administration, he should have taken with him the administration of medical benefit. The fact that the Minister of Health has a general responsibility for health, does not really mean that the Minister of Health should be concerned with the administration of medical

benefit. His is the sphere of preventive medicine, and of seeing that a town has good sewers, a pure water supply, and that nuisances are abated&#x2014;all the requirements of the Disraeli Public Health Act, 1875.<br/>
That work is not very closely connected with the organisation of a lot of doctors not engaged in public health services at all, but in the normal work of attending the sick in hospitals or in their own homes. It is quite distinct from the position of medical officers of health. I see no prejudice to the Minister of Health, if this work goes to the Minister concerned with health insurance. It would be better that the Minister should take these powers with him. In any event, it is unfortunate that he is prevented by the words of this Clause, without a further Amendment, from taking them with him. If we leave out the words which my Amendment suggests omitting, it will still leave a decision to be made in the future, after consultation. The Bill says, "Any of the powers" and on Friday, when talking about Orders in Council, the Deputy Prime Minister seemed to think that these paragraphs said "all the powers." They do not. There is to be choice hereafter by the Government of the day of the powers in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>g</i>) that are, by Orders in Council, to be transferred to another Minister. If my Amendment is carried, the Government will have months to make up their mind whether the administration of medical benefit is to remain. All I am asking at the moment is that they should not make a final decision but leave the door open. This is in order that they may make a decision different from that contained in the Bill. The Amendment merely opens the door of opportunity. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will agree that there is a case, at least, for reconsideration, and on those grounds I move the Amendment.</p>

<p>I support the Amendment, if for no other reason, because it leaves the matter open. If the Clause stands as it is, the decision is finally taken and nothing further can be done without further legislation. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to accept the Amendment in order to leave the matter open for a decision later, after further consideration.</p>

<p>I hope that the Government will not accept the Amendment.


The speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) unduly emphasised those aspects of the responsibilities of the Ministry of Health which were taken over from the old Local Government Board. I am one who believes that the Ministry of Health has got at the present time too many different functions to discharge. It is the Ministry which has responsibility for almost every subject which does not appear to fall under any other Ministry. The Home Office is in rather the same position. As things are at the present time, the Ministry of Health is responsible for matters such as rating and the finances of local authorities in addition to health duties. It is logical and reasonable that, under this new comprehensive insurance scheme, there should be a special Department and a special Minister who will be concerned with the insurance and the financial side of the service. It is extremely desirable that the Minister of Health should be free from those various pre-occupations of insurance in order to give increased time and attention to other purely medical responsibilities which rest upon him. Therefore, I hope that the Government will draw a logical and reasonable distinction between the insurance services, which are responsible for providing financially against all the changes and chances of life, and will keep those special medical services, which are closely connected with the medical profession and hospitals, still under the existing Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will not accept the Amendment. The question of medical benefit is purely a health matter. In spite of what the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) said, you cannot separate curative and preventive medicine. It simply cannot be done. The Ministry of Health really has to deal with health and all medical matters which appertain to health, and the importance of prescribing for patients, and things of that kind, and I hope that the Government will not on any account listen to the claim for the Amendment. The administration of the insurance benefit, linking it up with the medical benefit, depends on medical certification. I want to make sure that, under the regulations, rules or procedure with regard to medical certification, there shall be consultation

between the two Departments so that the Minister of National Insurance will not have the power alone to make regulations and decide exactly what medical certification has to be done. The doctors should be free to certify according to their conscience and their own ideas, within the accepted limits of the ordinary medical procedure with regard to prescribing. There should be no departmental regulations specifically that they must certify in a particular way in order to get the benefits available to the patient. I hope that the Minister of Health will still have the power to retain that position.</p>

<p>The Government do not propose to accept the Amendment. We do not think that this matter should be left open. It is desirable that this distinction should be drawn in the most emphatic way at the earliest time, that is, the distinction between medical benefit, which means medical treatment and assistance, and sickness benefit, which means periodical payment of sums of money after certification by a doctor.</p>

<p>Let us see what these Sections are other than the powers or duties conferred or imposed under Sections 35 to 43 of the National Health Insurance Act. Let me read the rubrics of the Sections:
<q>Section 35.&#x2014;(Administration of medical benefit.)</q>
<q>Section 36.&#x2014;(Power to remove practitioner's name from list.)</q>
<q>Section 37.&#x2014;(Powers of Minister where medical service inadequate.)</q>
<q>Section 39.&#x2014;(Supplies of drugs.)</q>
<q>Section 40.&#x2014;(Powers of Minister where supply of drugs is inadequate.)</q>
<q>Section 41.&#x2014;(Provisions in respect to persons authorised to supply drugs.)</q>
<q>Section 42.&#x2014;(Powers of Minister when he removes names of medical practitioners and chemists from list.)</q>
All those are obviously functions which fall exclusively within the control of a health department. The Minister of Health will, shortly, if the proposals are carried through, be in charge of a comprehensive health service, and all those matters are quite obviously part and parcel of the comprehensive health service which is not merely preventive medicine,


which is not merely public health medicine but any of the varieties and aspects of medicine which concern the health of the people, and it would be wrong to transfer those powers from the Minister of Health and take them to this new Department.<br/>
Of course, the hon. Member for Rochdale (Dr. Morgan) will realise that I cannot pronounce as to what the policy of the Minister will be, but I am quite certain that, in the matter he has mentioned, there will be the closest consultation between the new Ministry and the Ministry of Health, and the latter would obviously give advice upon the kind of topics which the hon. Member touched upon in his speech. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the most important point has been missed. It is that doctors ought not to be controlled by the Minister who will be paying benefit. I think that is all-important. The doctor ought to be under a different Minister altogether, for it will be a very bad thing if a man who wants a certificate has to go to a doctor employed by the Ministry of National Insurance. As I understand this Clause, as it stands, the doctor will be completely outside the control of the Minister, and in order that some assurance may be given to those who will claim benefits, they ought to feel that they are not going to a servant of the Fund from which they are claiming benefit. From that point of view I hope the Committee will not accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I think, in a way, the Minister-Designate inadvertently deceived the Committee by reading out the titles. "Administration of Medical Benefit" sounds like a job done by the Minister of Health but it is really done by a body called the local insurance committee, and the Minister only comes in as an approver later on. As to the "Powers to remove practitioners' names from list," this is

only after such an inquiry as may be prescribed. "Supplies of drugs" is a commercial function which had better be done by the Ministry of Supply if one is in being. So, for the right hon. and learned Gentleman to describe these as being things in which the Minister of Health would naturally be expert, was really to deceive himself and the Committee. I do not mind because, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman said, he only went through the rubrics; next time he ought to read the rest of the Prayer Book.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 4, line 25, leave out "enactment."<br/>
This is quite clear. I realise that these words are governed by the words which appear above, and they are, presumably, limited to such incidental, consequential, and supplemental provisions as appear to His Majesty to be necessary and expedient. Nevertheless, I must say that I dislike the proposal by an Order to amend an enactment. I quite appreciate the right, by an Order, to amend any other Order but when we come to enactments, delegated legislation is trespassing on the privileges of Parliament, and I think we ought to watch it. I know that this point has frequently been argued out before, and the defence is that no Minister has ever behaved badly, but that is not a reason for saying that if a Minister commits murder, he shall not be punished. It is just as well that the restriction should continue to exist.</p>

<p>I think that my hon. Friend has raised a point of some importance, and I feel that although there is a good deal to be said for a provision


of this kind, when new and somewhat wide legislation is introduced, in order to enable all those small consequential alterations to be made in the large volume of statute laws which will be affected by a Bill of this kind, it is only right that the House of Commons should keep it very narrowly under review. I would like to draw the attention of the Government to the special report of the Select Committee on Statutory Rules and Orders, which stresses the importance of the House of Commons retaining control over any delegated legislation of this kind. The Committee pointed out that where delegated legislation does enable existing legislation to be amended, it is most important that there should be a special provision for Rules or Orders of that kind to be laid before the House, and for there to be an opportunity for a Prayer. There is a subsequent Amendment which deals with that point, but I hope the Government will realise that it is this special provision, namely Statutes passed by this House to be modified by delegated legislation, which makes it especially important at a later time for us to move that any rules or Orders of this kind shall be laid before the House with ample opportunity for the House to pray against them. This point was also made by the Dunmore Committee.</p>

<p>Was it not the case that at the time of King Henry VIII an Act of Parliament was passed which gave His Majesty, by Order in Council, the right to repeal any Act of Parliament? It seems to me that this is a similar instrument that gives power to His Majesty, by Order in Council, to repeal, modify or adapt any enactment. If I am right in saying that this is the King Henry VIII Clause, or something like it, I do not think it is sight that the House should ever pass such a Clause without challenging it, and I therefore ask the Government to show cause why it is necessary to insert it in the Bill. In this case I

can well understand that it may be that there are a number of Acts of Parliament already in existence which ought to be repealed in whole or in part, but I maintain that when the Government bring forward a new Bill it is their duty to see that under the Act or provisions of the enactment or Rule or Order, and particularly when an Act of Parliament is to be changed, that enactment should be put in the form of a Schedule to the Bill which it is proposed to pass.<br/>
I think this is rather an excuse, if I may say so, for some wide and sloppy draftsmanship. I imagine that it has been designed to sweep up the crumbs, as it were. Suppose the Government find, during the course of the machinery which it is proposed to introduce, that there is part of an existing Act which has to be repealed, then they are able to do it by putting in this particular Clause. I do not think that is a satisfactory way of doing it. The Government ought to take all the trouble they can, when envisaging the machinery they propose to use, to see that if it entails any changes in existing enactments a Schedule should be put into the Bill saying precisely what they are.

<p>I want not only to support but to press for the acceptance of this Amendment. To leave these words in the Clause as it stands is really to support sloppy legislation. If there is any Act of Parliament which needs amendment it should go in the Schedule


to the Bill. I would like to ask the Attorney-General: Are these words really necessary? I suggest that it is proper, when this type of legislation is before the House, that the House should retain its power of control over such legislation.</p>

<p>First, let me say that I do not in the least complain about a Clause of this kind being challenged&#x2014;indeed, I welcome it&#x2014;because it gives those who are responsible for the Bill an opportunity of trying to convince the Committee that these are things not put in lightly, but because there is a strong case for them. Let me tell my hon. Friend the Member for Penryn and Falmouth (Mr. Petherick) that this is not the Henry VIII Clause, that is to say if one adopts the ordinary terminology. The Henry VIII Clause was a Clause which appeared in certain Acts&#x2014;I think mostly towards the end of the last war&#x2014;and which gave the Minister power to amend that Act by Order in Council, and then said that these Amendments, when made, should have the same effect as if they had been originally in the Act and had passed through all stages in both Houses. Rightly, I think, objection was taken to that. Of course, people can call a rose by any other name and I shall not quarrel with my hon. Friend if he chooses to describe this Clause as one analogous to the Henry VIII Clause. It is, however, put in not as a matter of sloppy drafting but to prevent there being a long and cumbrous Schedule, and particularly with regard to this Bill, because you cannot say at this precise moment what amendments in enactments may be necessary. This Bill empowers the Government, by Order in Council, to transfer certain of the functions of existing Ministers to the new Minister. I think it is generally desirable that there should be a little elasticity there. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams), in his last Amendment, asked for more elasticity. Everybody agrees that it is desirable that there should be a certain amount of elasticity at the moment as to where precisely that line is drawn, but the decision as to where the line is drawn will affect the question as to what amendments of enactments is necessary to make.<br/>
Let me give a few examples. For instance, in the National Health Insurance Act, 1936, there are hundreds of refer-

ences to "the Minister." When these Orders in Council under Clause 6 have been drawn up, in, say, go of these cases for "the Minister," there will have to be read "the Minister of National Insurance," and in 10 cases "the Minister of Health." Whether it will be 90 or 91 depends on the decisions which are taken under Clause 6 and, therefore, there is no question of sloppiness here. It will be necessary to amend enactments, and the vast bulk of the Amendments will be this alteration of terminology&#x2014;for instance, "In Section so-and-so for 'Minister' real 'Minister of National Insurance'." That is a good example of the necessity for having these provisions. It would be impossible to produce a Schedule now in a final form because it will depend upon the nature of the decisions which are taken under Clause 6. The same point also arises in the Unemployment Act, 1934, where there are references to "the Minister of Health" which will now have to be "The Minister of National Insurance." I hope the Committee will agree that it is necessary to have a provision of this kind. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon said, there has never been a case where it has been suggested that it has been abused and that the Order has gone wider than these words legitimately justify. I appreciate that the fact that it is necessary to retain power to amend enactments reinforces the argument which will be advanced later on other and wider grounds for saying that these Orders should be subject to a negative Resolution, but I would ask the Committee to reject the Amendment. I hope I have shown that it is necessary to have the power and that it is not due to sloppiness.</p>

<p>I dislike this sort of language and I support the Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Penryn and Falmouth (Mr. Petherick) called it a Henry VIII Clause. The Attorney-General said it was not because the Henry VIII Clause


enables a Minister to amend an Act by Order in Council. To start with, the Minister cannot issue Orders in Council and, secondly, what is the difference in language between amending an Act and modifying an enactment? It seems to me it is exactly the same principle with slightly different language and it is in effect the same system as the Henry VIII Clause, to which I strongly object. I agree that at this stage it is not possible to put all the Amendments required in a Schedule to the Bill but there will be a large number of Bills in the next Session dealing with various aspects of the matter. Would it not be better to put the several Acts in the Schedule rather than have this objectionable system? It is not only Acts passed by this House but Acts passed by the Parliament of Northern Ireland 'which can be repealed, modified or adapted. I hope the Attorney-General will have another look at it and see if it cannot be done in the way we are most anxious that it should be done.</p>

<p>I think my right hon. and learned Friend was technically right but substantially wrong. He is right in this respect, that a few years ago, when the Henry VIII Clause started to be used fairly freely, it was giving power to the Government of the day in one Act of Parliament to alter that same Act of Parliament, but I do not think he was quite correct, taking the long view, because it was just a loose expression which was invented at that time. It referred to a very important principle of a Statute of the time of Henry VIII which gave His Majesty the power to alter not only any given Act but all Acts of Parliament simply by Order in Council. We feel that the principle is really the same and that it should be watched rather closely.</p>

<p>They have been inserted in previous Acts for this reason. The Sub-section deals with the transfer of property and it was thought that, although the Order in Council provided for the transfer, someone might suggest

that it was necessary to have a formal legal transfer in the form of a conveyance. The words have been inserted before to prevent any argument and to make it clear that the Order in Council, without any further instruction, operates as a transfer of the property.

My hon. Friend is concerned with the meaning of the word "before." The object is, and it is a necessary object, to see that when we make a change of this kind we do not force people to start all over again. They may have given notice to the Minister of Health as part of a procedure which is incomplete at the time when the new Ministry is set up. The word "before" is inserted to cover those cases where there is to be or can be something, say, in the nature of a hearing before an authority.

<p>I beg to move, in page 5, line 24, leave out Sub-section (7), and insert:
<q>(7) Every Order in Council made under this Act shall be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after it is made, but, notwithstanding anything in Sub-section (4) of Section one of the Rules Publication Act, 1893, such an Order shall be deemed not to be a statutory rule to which that Section applies.</q>
<q>(8) If either House of Parliament within the next twenty-eight days on which the House has sat after such an Order in Council as aforesaid is laid before it, resolves that the Order be annulled, the Order shall thereupon cease to have effect, except as respecting things previously done or omitted to be done, without prejudice, however, to the making of a new order.</q>
I am in the happy position of knowing what this Amendment means. Its effect is to bring within the control of Parliament the Orders in Council which are to be issued by the new Minister. Although I attach great importance to the Amendment, I need not take up much time in arguing it. In the first place, I am encouraged by the speech of my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General on a previous Amendment to think that this Amendment may receive sympathetic consideration. In the second place, the matter was fully discussed on Second Reading, and I am obliged to move the Amendment, not merely on the narrow ground which was indicated by my right hon. and learned Friend a few moments ago, but on the much broader grounds which were advanced by my hon. Friends the Members for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) and Penryn and Falmouth (Mr. Petherick) on Second Reading, because the reply which was then given by my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General was unsatisfactory. The Solicitor-General, it is true, accepted the fundamental argument which was put forward in support of the principle which this Amendment embodies, when he said:
<q>The control of the House over all subsidiary legislation, and, indeed, over Ministerial action, is a vital part of our constitution and one which we all value.</q>
But he then went on to argue that here this was merely a matter of transfer of powers and of timing, and that the Orders in Council were merely the instruments by which the new Minister would give effect to the will of the House as already expressed in this Bill. He said:
<q>This House, by passing the Second Reading, is approving of the general principle of the transfer of powers. It is, then, a

matter for the Government during what period and at what time these powers will be transferred.</q>
Further on he said:
<q>This is merely the putting into force of specific powers laid out in the Bill, the transfer of which has been approved by the House.</q>
He went on to argue that,
<q>as regards the timing of the transfers, it is merely an administrative matter &#x2026; which does not need the special requirement of an affirmative or negative Resolution.</q>
Furthermore, he referred specially to the Orders in Council which are contemplated under subsection (4, <i>a</i>), and he pointed out that these Orders would be
<q>limited to provisions which are either incidental or consequential or are necessary to an Order in Council making the transfer. It is only for that limited purpose</q>
that they would be required. So that, he concluded,
<q>I do not think that when we are limited to incidental, consequential and supplemental provisions, there can be a very formidable inroad into the privileges of the House."&#x2014; [OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th Nov., 1944; Vol. 404, c. 1704&#x2013;6.]</q>
I am afraid that my hon. and learned Friend did not fully appreciate the case which had been made and was not fairly interpreting the Bill as it stands. His case was based on the argument that the powers to be transferred are specifically laid down in the Bill and that the House, by passing the Bill, is itself reaching the decision in regard to these transfers and leaving the new Minister nothing to do but merely to implement that decision. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon pointed out in interrupting the Solicitor-General, the powers to be transferred are by no means specifically laid down in Clause 6. That Clause does not state exactly which powers are to be transferred, but merely makes a list of groups of powers, any of which can be transferred. I think that my hon. Friend was quite right in anticipating that the partial transfer of powers might well lead to difficulty and consequential problems which should have the attention of this House. I submit that it goes even further than that, because in Sub-section (3, <i>b</i>) there is specific provision for Orders in Council to be made if His Majesty consider it necessary or expedient to do so, providing for:
<q>the transfer to the Minister of any power or duty conferred or imposed on an existing authority by or under any enactment other than those mentioned in Sub-section (1).</q>


So that clearly the position is completely open, and this Bill does not provide for the specific transfers which are to be covered by the Orders in Council. I hope that the Government will accept the Amendment and will apply to these Orders the salutary check which is applied normally to Orders by submitting them to Prayer by either House of Parliament. The argument may be advanced, as it was by the Solicitor-General, that in these matters we must trust the Minister. That is an argument which has been used rather too frequently in the last few years. It is an argument which it is invidious to challenge, but it goes dangerously far along the road which leads to that abomination, the totalitarian State. I would ask my right hon. and learned Friend to adopt another argument this time and rely, not on the good will of the Minister, but on the good sense of this House and of Parliament not to abuse its position.</p>

<p>I wish to support the view which my hon. Friend has put so well. He has covered the ground so clearly that it is not necessary for me to add another argument, except to say that the Government are very sensitive to feeling in all quarters. Earlier in the day they gave way on another issue because of what they thought was the general feeling of the Committee. Perhaps I may, from this corner of the Committee, add to the feeling in support of this Amendment, which raises a fundamental issue. From whatever angle of approach we look at the problem, we want to know what powers are transferred, and to have the right to criticise as to whether they are adequate or are too great. They will probably be too small for me. We want to have control by the House of Commons. Therefore I support the Amendment.</p>

<p>The Government are always vulnerable in Committee, from one of two angles. If they give way to what appears to be a general feeling in all quarters of the House they can always be told that they have no mind of their

own. If, on the other hand, they strenuously resist hon. Members' suggestions, they may be asked: "What is the use of a Committee stage?" We try to hit the happy medium. The Bill was introduced without a provision for a negative Resolution against Orders in Council, on the basis that it was, in effect, merely a machinery transfer Bill, in which case I would be inclined to support the provisions of the Bill as they were put forward. It was looking at it in that light which led the Government to put it forward as the Committee find it at the present time; but we feel there is great force in the argument which has been put to-day, and which was put also by my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams), in, I think, an interruption of the Solicitor-General rather than in the speech he made earlier, and of which I am sure the whole Committee will be conscious, as a result of the discussion which we have had.<br/>
It is said, and said rightly: "This is not a mere transfer of machinery Bill. You cannot tell by looking at the Bill precisely what is going to be transferred, because that is going to be the subject of separate decisions." I was justified in resisting an Amendment just now on the ground that we could not tell exactly what Amendments of any enactments we should have to make until the policy decision had been taken as to where the line should be drawn. Therefore, we have come to the conclusion that Orders in Council under the Bill come out of the category where the House would be unreasonable to ask for the negative Resolution procedure and come into the category where the negative Resolution procedure is appropriate.

<p>I am sorry. I meant the Abbey Division (Sir H. Webbe) said: "Let us proceed on the basis that the House will show common sense in the use of its powers." I am quite happy to proceed on that basis. As a matter of fact, although slight heat is sometimes developed on this subject, I do not think that hon. Members who do not sit on these benches have great complaint of Ministers or that Ministers have any complaint of the exercise of powers by the


House of Commons. We have no reason to think that anything other than good sense will be brought to bear upon these Orders, as upon others. Therefore, we think, for the reasons which I have given, that the case is made out for putting these Orders into what I call the negative Resolution pigeon hole. There are three pigeon holes: The affirmative Resolution pigeon hole, the negative Resolution pigeon hole and the no Resolution pigeon hole. We think that the Orders in this case should go into the middle pigeon hole and therefore we accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>It may seem a little ungracious of me to detain the Committee upon an Amendment after we have had a concession, but I hope I may be forgiven &#x2014;I shall be quite short&#x2014;as I think there are one or two other points which might usefully be put to the Committee. One is that the Government might look at these matters more often from the point of view of what they really need in order to do the business in hand, and not always come to us with Bills which ask us for a much bigger cheque than they intend to spend, and then, if sufficient of us make a fuss, proceed to write across it, "Not more than &#x00A3;100." That is rather an ungracious way of doing it.<br/>
Secondly, I would like to ask the learned Attorney a question. He said there were three pigeon holes into which these things could be put, but there is a fourth, which he omitted. There is the pigeon hole which demands that draft Orders shall be laid before the House, which is stronger, from the point of view of the House of Commons, than either the positive or the negative Resolution procedures, because it makes amendment practicable. And, thirdly, I was a little disquieted by his suggestion that if this had been a mere machinery transfer Bill the Government would have dug their toes in. I ask the Government not to accept that as a principle. Even if this were a mere machinery transfer Bill, to draw the line between the mereness of the transfer and the possible legislative effect of some machinery transfers is very difficult for us. It makes it all the more difficult when Bills which everyone wants to see passed are considered at the very end of the Session and the Government ask us to take the Committee stage and all other

stages on the next Parliamentary day to that on which we discuss the Second Reading. This makes it very difficult.<br/>
I am not sure whether my recollection is right, and there has been no time to correct it, but in one of the earlier Bills of this sort, I think it was the Ministry of Health Act, 1919, provisions equivalent to these were submitted in the original Bill and not after protest, certainly in the Act, they were submitted to the fourth pigeon hole process, the one which the Attorney-General left out. That is, they had to be placed before the House of Commons in draft, so that the House could not only accept or reject them but could, possibly, amend them. That is the tightest of all these controls. I am very grateful to the Attorney-General for the concession, but I hope that the Government will not accept the assumption, at which he seemed to hint, that where a Measure can be defined, or assumed, to be a mere machinery transfer Bill, the House ought not to expect any kind of control at all. I am sure that we shall be laying up trouble for ourselves if that assumption goes unquestioned.</p>

<p>I rise merely to make a suggestion. The Government have seen the force of the argument which was presented, and they have given in a most gracious way what the Committee requested. It might be possible to save a good deal of Parliamentary time in the future if the Prime Minister, in the middle of all those multifarious duties which he has, could write a letter to the heads of Departments or to the Ministers concerned, pointing out that in matters of this kind, where powers have been asked for, they should not indulge in great amendment by Order in Council. He might point out to the Ministers that it would be very much better if, when Bills are being drafted, the power of the House of Commons to pray against such Orders should be granted. I believe that would save a lot of Parliamentary time, and would be very much better from the Government's point of view.<br/>

The Committee derives from an early date when there were four national areas each with its separate fund, and there are still to this day four separate insurance funds for those countries. The main functions of the Committee in the past have been to deal with financial matters which arise in circumstances of this sort: where an insured person, having lived for some time in one area, moves to another, various financial adjustments have to be made; and various financial adjustments have sometimes to be made with regard to an approved society which carries on its business in both areas. They also make regulations concerning the valuations of approved societies. I have been at pains to check up this matter. The Committee have never yet exercised any functions except in regard to what I might call the payment of sickness benefit. They have never arrogated to themselves the right to exercise any function or to make any regulation with regard to medical matters. Whether they actually have the power or not is not quite plain, because Section 160 of the Act is drafted in such a way that it looks as if they may increase their powers by making their own regulations. They have never yet done so.<br/>
When the Ministry of National Insurance Bill becomes law and the Orders in Council transfer certain functions of the Ministry of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland to the Minister of National Insurance, then the Joint Committee must be reconstituted, because it

would be impossible for the Joint Committee dealing with the financial aspect not to have the Minister of National Insurance as one of its Members. Exactly what the constitution of the Committee will be I cannot pledge myself at the moment, but it is obvious that the new Minister must be a Member of a Committee which deals with matters which are peculiarly within his province. I am afraid I am not acquainted with the provisions of the Section about which the right hon. and gallant Member questioned me, but I shall, in dealing with that matter, collaborate with the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the same principle will apply, namely, in so far as that Section deals with medical benefit that will remain entirely his concern. In so far as it deals with sickness benefit that will become the concern of the new Minister.</p>

<p>I would say just one or two words of good will to the Minister-Designate. As he knows, I am rather critical, but not of this Bill nor of the powers which are to be given to him. What I am worried about is the cost of the additional powers. I think Members ought to realise that even if no further legislation takes place the Minister has a very big job. People are thinking that this Bill does not matter, but we are transferring to this Minister services which at the moment are costing &#x00A3;500,000,000 a year. In peace time this Ministry will be far and away the largest spender in the Government, bigger than the Defence Services. This Ministry will be one of the biggest spending Departments, and one which in times of difficulty will be the subject of the biggest number of Debates. When my mind goes back to the Debates about unemployment insurance and assistance I can foresee the Minister having a very busy time. We all wish him well. We can accept it that he is to be the Minister, because approval has been given to the announcement in advance that he is the Minister-Designate. Next week he will have a Portfolio in which he can keep his bits and pieces&#x2014;betting slips if he goes in for such things, or unpaid bills and that sort of thing. I have never discovered what a Minister keeps in his Portfolio. A portfolio means the thing in which to carry around bits of paper. People think of a portfolio as being something like a seal, but I presume that really a portfolio is one of those beautiful black bags, decorated with the Royal arms. We shall look

with curiosity at the right hon. and learned Gentleman when he comes into the House in the new Session, to see with what kind of portfolio he has been decorated.<br/>
Aside from that frivolity, I wish him well. He has an enormous task. He has to master the contents of the National Health Insurance Acts&#x2014;fortunately for him, they were recently consolidated&#x2014;the Old Age Pensions Acts, the Contributory Pensions Acts, all the provisions with regard to widows&#x2014;I know how complicated some of them are&#x2014;all the provisions in regard to social insurance&#x2014;which at the moment do not loom very large, for when we live on borrowed money there is not much difficulty, but after the war it will be a very different matter. Then there is the problem of the Assistance Board. I presume that it is all coming to him. I do not know what is to happen to the Chairman and the existing organisation of the Assistance Board. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has the biggest problem which any Minister ever had in peace time. For that reason, I wish him good luck.</p>

<p>This is one of the most important Measures that we have had before us for some time.

<p>I think I can guess why those particular names were selected, and I rather suspect that the hon. Member can guess. I should think that they were selected because they were the leaders of the various organised political parties in the Government. My hon. Friend can be assured that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland is well able to look after himself, and that he is not

a person who submits to any considerable political pressure&#x2014;certainly not from me. If my hon. Friend had seen him sitting by my side this morning, smiling happily, he would realise that an undue amount of duress had not been imposed upon my right hon. Friend. I sincerely thank the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) for wishing me well. I am very conscious that the task I have is an immensely important task. On its being done well depends the happiness of tens of thousands of people. For that very reason, I have been anxious not to try to paint it as an even greater task than it is. Taken by itself, without a great many other things, such as full employment and the rest of it, it cannot, of course, bring security or happiness to everyone; but if I am to be entrusted with this task. I shall do the best that in me lies in introducing a Measure which, I ask the House to realise, will be of immense complexity. It will be an enormous task to get it ready, and I wish it were true that, as I have heard, the Bill was nearly ready, because it is by no means true. I must ask for kindly consideration from the House, and I believe that I shall get it. I shall do my utmost to see that no undue time is lost in getting on with the job.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two in reply to the observations of the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Etherton). I am very sorry that he introduced a needless note of party feeling into what would otherwise have been general good wishes to the Minister from all sides of the House. He called attention to the fact that just at the moment of his speech my hon. Friends on the Liberal bench were not present. But he knows that a number of them have been taking the deepest interest in the progress of this Measure and all that has gone before it. The hon. Member for East Birkenhead (Mr. G. White) has pleaded for years for such a Measure of co-ordination as we now have in this Bill, while the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed {Sir W. Beveridge) has done more than any other man in this country to make possible the work to which the Minister-Designate is going to devote himself. I am glad that the name of this most important Ministry has been altered to correspond with the reality. It is to be a Ministry of National Insurance.


But I hope it will lead the way to a Ministry of Social Security, and I think that, however difficult the path may be, every hon. Member of this House will be glad when that day comes, and we shall all wish the Minister-Designate every success in the great task he has undertaken.</p>

<p>Thousands of workers who live in the central London area are extremely upset that they may have no opportunity of doing their Christmas shopping. By a Home Office Regulation that comes into force next Monday and continues until 13th January, large numbers of the shops in the central London area will be compelled to close at 4 o'clock: Before I proceed, I would like to apologise for raising this matter at such short notice. It so happened that the Adjournment period to-day had been taken by the hon. Member for Oxford (Mr. Hogg), who, for reasons best known to himself, gave it up, and, therefore, the opportunity came my way. The only reason why I have taken it, and have not been able to give longer notice to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of War Transport, is because this Regulation comes into force next Monday, and, therefore, it is very unlikely that before then there will be another opportunity to raise what to thousands of people is a very urgent matter. While on the subject of the Parliamentary Secretary for War Transport, I should like to thank him for his courtesy in coming down to the House

to-day at such short notice. In the same way, I appreciate, like many other hon. Members do, the personal care and consideration he invariably gives from his Department to all inquiries from M.P's.<br/>
This Regulation for the closing of shops in the central London area at 4 o'clock is creating more bad feeling than, perhaps, anything has done for a long time past. How, in Heaven's name, is a worker, who works and lives in central London and whose work takes him or her up to, say, five o'clock or 5.30 p.m., going to get the shopping done when the shops which are available to them close at four o'clock? I believe that all Departments, including the Home Office, are against this imposition&#x2014;all except the Ministry of War Transport, and I understand that the main reason for the objection of that Ministry is this. They say that, unless the hours are staggered, there will be undue congestion. The idea is, I believe, that shoppers and shop assistants shall be able to get back to their homes between 3.30 and 4.30 p.m., and factory workers and others afterwards. The first observation I should like to make is that there are comparatively few factory workers in the central London area, and the second point to which I should like to draw the attention of my hon. Friend is this. Why, if traffic has worked more or less satisfactorily up to now, is it necessary to change conditions during the next six weeks, and especially over the Christmas period? I suppose that an answer to that would be that, by that means, one could get more people back home by black-out. Why is that necessary? Surely the necessity for this no longer exists to the same extent? I can well understand that, earlier on, it was very desirable for people to get back to their homes, and to what security they could find there, before the black-out, but now the same necessity does not arise.<br/>
My experience has been&#x2014;and I may say that I have already had a considerable amount of representations on this subject, and only to-day there were three deputations in the Lobbies from various bodies&#x2014;that what is going to aggravate people more than anything else, more than being congested, as undoubtedly they may be, is that thousands are not going to have a fair opportunity of doing the shopping for the various necessities of their existence as well as for Christmas. Incidentally, a large proportion of workers in the central


London area do not travel, or do not travel very far, because they live in the central London area, and I think that some hon. Members would be amazed if they realised the number of poor people who live in congested areas in my constituency, which is supposed to be one of the richest boroughs in London. Remember, there are thousands and thousands of workers who live in the central London area.<br/>
Now from the shops' point of view this regulation is grossly unfair, especially to the small trader. Take, for example, part of my constituency&#x2014;the Edgware Road. This Regulation is arbitrary to the extent that there will be a collection of shops on one side of the road which, from next Monday, will have to close at four o'clock, while their competitors on the other side of the road can stay open until the usual time. I have had several small traders come to me and say that this, in effect, means ruin to them. They state that their larger competitors, who may stay open longer, will have the advantage. These people often rely on Christmas trade to make all the difference between profit and loss. It is a little significant that, at a conference that was called by the Home Office and took place on 18th October last, no representatives of the chambers of commerce concerned were invited. Surely, they should have been invited?<br/>
The London public have had a grim enough time without unnecessarily ruining their forthcoming Christmas, to say nothing of ruining some small traders. This one-sided Regulation is by no means essential. Therefore, I would make this last-minute appeal to the Minister to use his influence to give these poor, hard-pressed people a break.</p>

<p>I should like to add a few words in support of what has been said by the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for St. Marylebone (Captain Cunningham-Reid). I, too, to-day, as one of the Members for the Borough of St. Pancras, have been approached by the St. Pancras Chamber of Commerce in this matter and it is extremely unfortunate that this brake should be put upon trade in the coming months, and particularly during the Christmas trade. I understand that my hon. Friend the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport will raise the arguments of his Department as to why this should be done. I would like to say to him and to the House, that large numbers of these people affected, probably the majority of the people affected, do not use his transport at all. Many of them are London and North Eastern and Great Western railway workers who have to walk home and will not be able to do Christmas or any shopping during December. I hope that this last-minute appeal, as my hon. and gallant Friend called it, will be accepted and that the Regulation will not be given force.</p>

<p>Before the Minister replies, I would like to put a suggestion to him which he can also consider and which is in keeping with the various aspects of the trade as divorced from the arguments used by the hon. and gallant Member for St. Pancras, North (Wing-Commander Grant-Ferris) and the hon. and gallant Member who raised the issue. When we are considering whether there should be a relaxation of an Order such as this, we need some concrete evidence as to who is complaining and from whence is the complaint coming. That is very important. I have the privilege week by week of seeing reports on almost every kind of resolution about everything that matters and lots of things that do not matter from every trade union in the 73 areas around London and the immediate vicinity associated with this particular agitation in Marylebone and St. Pancras. Frankly, I have not seen a mention of this issue from any of the trade unions or any of the trades councils during the past week or two. Trades unionists, war workers and shop-steward movements are not backward in coming forward if there is any agitation which they think worth while backing. If our people were suffering from this particular issue, I would be the first to take up the case for the workers of either Marylebone or St. Pancras, not from the point of view of the hon. and gallant Gentleman who raised these issues, but from the trade union point of view.</p>

<p>The hon. Member said that he is not aware from whence representations have come. I do not know whether he was in the House at the beginning of my remarks, but if


I did not make the matter clear perhaps I may now do so. I have had several representations from small traders in my constituency, and even more representations from war workers who are not able to cope with the problem of their shopping during the festive season.</p>

<p>I do not wish to be unfair in examining the question, but I want the Minister to examine every angle and every argument. I do not dispute for a moment that small shopkeepers may have put forward pleas of the kind to which the hon. and gallant Member has referred, and, what is more, I believe that somehow these unfortunate small shopkeepers in Marylebone and St. Pancras are linked up with the West End of London. This particular Order was made to apply to the West End of London because people will, for some reason best known to themselves, perambulate round the West End of London later than they ought to do.</p>

<p>While this is a free country, there are a lot of regulations which we have to accept. My lad is serving in the Forces like other lads and he is doing it because he recognises that there is a need in the name of the country, but he is not free. What is more, we want these people who have sufficient time on their hands to go round the West End of London to recognise that there are war workers who want to get home. We do not want these people crowding London's buses, tubes and the Southern and Great Western Railways when railway workers want to get home.</p>

<p>I travel home by tram, train, bus or tube. I never use petrol in London and it is on very rare occasions that I get a taxi, as I believe is the experience of other hon.

<p>Conditions are the same, but there are reasons in the next few

weeks why we do not want to encourage this sort of thing. I began by asking where the protest had come from, as no one has brought evidence that it has come from the trades union or the trades council or from the factories, other than an odd deputation, and has given no material evidence that, in particular, St. Pancras workers themselves have protested against it.<br/>
I feel that if the small shopkeeper has a case for selling in the back street of Marylebone or St. Pancras there should be, within reason, facilities for him to dispose of or sell his goods. If there are goods in the large stores in the West End of London which the workers want, they are snapped up before very long, as people come from all the suburbs of London. It is the small shopkeeper at the corner of the street in Marylebone and St. Pancras that matters and I would not like to see, by decision of the Home Secretary or the Minister of Transport, an injustice done to the small shopkeeper. He is there rendering a service to the consumer because it is convenient for the consumer to go to the small shopkeeper.</p>

<p>It would be an injustice to him. I have received letters the other way round from thousands of shop assistants in the London area saying that they hoped they would not have to go back this winter to what happened last winter because the position is fair all round. We want to be equitable with regard to the small shopkeeper, the shop assistant, and the consumers, including war workers and everybody else.</p>

<p>I am not asking that we should close the shops at four or half-past four. I am simply concerned with an Order and the reason for it. To talk about closing shops at 4.30 in the afternoon as a general practice is absurd. We could never really operate such a system, but something unusual has happened and we must apply a remedy, which is the one suggested in the Order to which the hon. and gallant Member objected. I beg of


the Minister to weigh up the various considerations and see whether there is not something to be done to divorce these small shopkeepers in the back streets of Marylebone and St. Pancras from the general terms of the Order which is applicable to the shops in what we understand to be the West End of London&#x2014;Harrods, Selfridges, Gamages, Barkers, and all the different firms&#x2014;if they closed at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, in the main it would not affect them very much. Those people would still have time on their hands, and the stock of the choice goods would be sold before 11 o'clock on most days, so that would not bother war workers very much.<br/>
I do not want to make a mistake on this in suggesting lengthening the hours for shop workers, or giving the grocer&#x2014;because the grocer is not involved in this argument&#x2014;or the man who sells boots and shoes or wearing apparel, the opportunity to keep open until 8 o'clock. We do not believe in those silly ideas any more, but half an hour, or an hour probably, added to this order&#x2014;maybe until 6 o'clock&#x2014;would be in keeping with the rest of London. I believe that Tooting should not have an advantage over St. Pancras or St. Marylebone, so I ask the Minister to weigh up this as best he can, with all the arguments put forward, but bearing in mind that we, as trade unionists, are keeping a close eye on this issue. We are not going to agree simply because two or three people with corner shops come along and ask to keep open until 6, 7 or 8 o'clock at night as they did in those bad old days&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is not suggested, it is true, but the hon. Member for Wallasey (Mr. Reakes) would do well to keep out of it because, as far as he is concerned, I know that the hours in his area are not unlimited but the shop workers there would not admire him if he suggested that they should keep open in Wallasey one hour longer, because they can keep open until 6 o'clock in Wallasey already.</p>

<p>It is the last thing I should suggest, but if the Home Office, or any other Government Department, suggested closing at 4 o'clock on Merseyside during the Christmas shopping period, there would be strong protests made, and I would be the first to make them, because it is a ridiculous hour to close.</p>

<p>I did not know this subject was to be raised, and I have not been able to fortify myself by reference to the document which I am about to mention. To some extent, if it had not been for a Report by the Select Committee on National Expenditure, which was the result of evidence taken by the sub-committee of which I was chairman, possibly this Debate would not be taking place. I observe with interest that the Debate is to be replied to, not by the Home Secretary, who customarily deals with shop matters, but by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of War Transport.<br/>
The situation with regard to passenger road transport was and is bad. At the time we conducted our investigation, it was, I think, even worse than it is now, and one of the recommendations we made in order to avoid three lots of people trying to get home at the same time&#x2014;factory workers, shop assistants and customers&#x2014;was that something should be done about the hours of closing shops during the winter. This has nothing to do with trade union principles or any of those things; it is entirely a matter of transport, so far as I am concerned. Our recommendation was made in the light of the appalling transport situation. We all know, if we leave this House after dark, how difficult it is to get home, and some kind of effort to stagger the traffic, to a certain extent, was necessary. I have not looked at the Report, and it is now over two years ago since it was made, but it contained a number of recommenda-


tions, one of which was that during the winter months, so long as traffic facilities were bad, some steps should be taken, the effect of which would be to make to go home earlier than other workers the people who worked in shops and their customers.</p>

<p>I am much obliged for the observations made by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for St. Marylebone (Captain Cunningham-Reid) in opening this discussion. Nevertheless, I must explain that owing to circumstances over which I have no control, and perhaps he had not either, I first heard at five minutes to four that this matter was to be raised on the Adjournment. The House will understand that that left me in a rather embarrassing position. I am not blaming my hon. and gallant Friend&#x2014;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, owing to circumstances over which neither she nor I had any control, I did not hear about it until five minutes to four. My position is rather more embarrassing than the House can know because, at 12.30, another hon. Member asked if I would let him raise another matter on the Adjournment to-day, and I had to reply that, unfortunately, it was impossible for me to give him a proper answer and therefore I hoped that he would desist, which he agreed to do. I hope, therefore, that my other hon. Friend will not feel that I owe him an apology when he reads his HANSARD to-morrow. In any case, I think the hon. and gallant Member who raised this matter would not have a grievance if I said that I would note what he says, but could not make a substantive reply at such short notice. However, in view of the fact that there is great interest in this matter in the House, and because it is of great importance to my Minister and to the London Passenger Transport Board, I will do my best to make a substantive reply to the arguments that have been put forward.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Wing-Commander Grant-Ferris) asked: Why change the conditions when the traffic is

going on quite well? Why take special measures to get people to go home before black-out, when otherwise they would not do it? The answer is very simple. We are not changing anything in comparison with what we have done for the last four years. This is the last of four years in which we have been obliged to make this arrangement. There is a change which I will explain in a moment, but the principle is the same. In the second place, we do not make people go earlier and move the peak forward. The peak of traffic moves itself forward, because, during the winter months, people who stay in their offices later in summer leave much earlier, and our winter peak, whether we like it or not, owing to the habits of the population of London, which we cannot control, is from 4.30 to 6 o'clock. It is a fact we have to accept. An hon. Member asked: If you have it at 4, why not all the year round? The answer is that the main peak of traffic moves itself to an earlier hour.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend spoke of the conference held by the Home Secretary in October. He complained that his four chambers of commerce had not been invited. I do not quite know how that happened but, in any case, it was not the responsibility of my Noble Friend, and I am sure the Home Secretary would have been very glad to have seen them then if he had been aware that they wanted to be received. However, I understand that he has seen them since.</p>

<p>I see. In any case there was a meeting last October with all the main shopkeeper associations throughout the country. At that meeting the shopkeepers asked for a later hour. As my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. E. Walkden) said, the shop assistants asked that the present hours should be maintained because they thought it was right. At that meeting, in deference to the wishes of the shopkeepers, the Home Secretary, after consulting with my Noble Friend, made an important concession from the practice of previous years. Up to now we have had 12 to 13


weeks&#x2014;in November, December and January. This year we have only eight weeks. It was a concession to this demand made, because this was the fifth year of the war. Everybody, I am assured by my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, who took the chair at that conference, went away quite happy. The four chambers of commerce put this forward, primarily on the ground of convenience to the general public. They asked that the hour should be five instead of four. Perhaps it would serve the interests of shopkeepers to have another hour&#x2014;I am not so sure&#x2014;but I do not think it would help the general public very much, and certainly it would not help war workers because they are still in their factories at 5 o'clock. They could not possibly get there in time.</p>

<p>That is the whole point. How are war workers, or any workers for that matter, if they work until 5 or 6 o'clock, and live in the central London area, to do their shopping, when shops close at 4 o'clock?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-14a.1927.1" hansard_membership_id="9813" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18920" speakername="Mr. Noel-Baker" colnum="1927" time="">
<p>They certainly cannot do it if the shops dose at 5, and 5 o'clock is really impossible because it comes at the height of our traffic peak. What, after the Home Secretary's concession made in October, is the present position? For these eight weeks shops will be closing at 4 o'clock. But any shop that sells food for human consumption, or any restaurant, is exempt from that regulation. They can keep open until 6 o'clock, or later if they are restaurants. All shops with no more than two assistants are also exempt on the ground that their trade does not add much to the existing traffic. From 13th January until 3rd March, under another regulation, with the details of which I will not weary the House, the closing hour is to be 6 o'clock. After that there is no war-time restriction; the ordinary peace-time regulations apply. In spite of that many shops voluntarily close at 5 o'clock, or earlier, all through the year because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster said, they can easily sell their goods before that hour, and they see no reason why they should keep open longer.<br/>
I am grateful for the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams), who spoke

with authority, and said that this closing of shops is part of our general policy of staggering traffic. We have staggered factory workers all around London all through the year. They do not like it; it means that they have to get up half an hour earlier in winter and travel in darkness. It imposes inconveniences on them and, some say, hardship. But unless we had done that we could not have handled our traffic throughout the war. This staggering of shop hours is a small contribution toward the general policy to which factory workers themselves are making a great contribution all the year round. It is a contribution to which, however much we may regret it, we must stick. It is sometimes asked why we do not apply the same policy to theatre traffic at a later hour. People say, "Why do you not do something about that?" But theatre and cinema traffic is, by the different times of closing, already partially staggered, and apart from that it does not come at the same time as the war workers' peak of traffic.<br/>
Lastly, I have heard it said, "In the fifth year of the war this is a small relaxation and surely it could be allowed." Well, everybody wants relaxation; everybody is weary. But alas, transport is still in the war. Our transport machine is geared to the urgent necessities of war. If we adopt the hon. and gallant Gentleman's proposal we should have to have more buses at the peak hour, and we cannot do it. We cannot carry shoppers and shop assistants in addition to the ordinary peak traffic for two reasons&#x2014;first, we have not the vehicles, and second if we had, we have not the workers to run them.</p>

<p>Well, a date has to be chosen, and if we had had our way we would, on transport grounds, have changed the date a fortnight ago. We have found, broadly speaking, that in the winter months the peak of traffic is earlier than in the summer months. We cannot control it, and the hon. and gallant Gentleman will have to accept it, just as we do, and as the workers on the buses


have to accept it. We have not enough workers even to keep our normal scheduled services running as they should. Let my hon. Friends reflect that we are trying to improve our services and do it when we have the maximum sickness among our workers.

<p>I am glad to repeat my assurance that this Regulation does not apply to the small shopkeeper with only two assistants and does not apply to food shops, so that workers will, therefore, have a chance to get to these classes of shops.

<p>May I say how pleased I was to hear what my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary had to tell the House? This is a very old question which we have heard debated for the last 20 years. There are two points I want to put to the hon. and gallant Member for St. Marylebone (Captain Cunningham-Reid). The problem of keeping shops open has always turned around the position that one set of shopkeepers has always been penalised by competition. I do not think that is the case here, because people who go to Barkers, Selfridges, and Swan and Edgars are, generally speaking, of a different type from those who go to small food shops.</p>

<p>We had exactly the same argument when we talked about public houses. On one side of Oxford Street they were closed an hour earlier than on the other. If I had my way they would all close at an earlier hour. I am sure that Members of all parties are very alarmed at the accidents on the roads, and I should have thought every Member would bear that point in mind when we are talking about traffic. It is terrible to think of the numbers killed when, in fact, the traffic, I understand, is less than it was. No one as yet has been able to collect the voices of the customers who are involved here. The shopkeepers and the shop assistants have spoken, but in all my experience I have yet to find any organisation of any kind among the customers who have ever said at any time that the shops anywhere are closing too early.</p>

<p>On the point about accidents, does the hon. Gentleman realise that the area in question has the best record for accidents in the whole country?</p>

<p>Yes, simply because of these closing arrangements. If the shops were opened until six or seven, the accidents would probably double, and the hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct. But let us all understand one thing. These are just in the transition stage. I hope that some day we shall get back to the ordinary course adopted under the Shops Act, and even then there would still be complaints of some shopkeepers competing unduly with the rest, but on the whole I agree with what has been said by the Government on the subject.</p>
