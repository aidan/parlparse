<p>You, Mr. Speaker, will be as disappointed as am I by that reply. My question referred to new initiatives. Is the Under-Secretary aware that I am disappointed that he is unable to institute new initiatives? I had in mind freeport status for Prestwick.

<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Government are considering applications for freeport status. I should have thought that the hon.

I should have thought that all hon.

<p>Will my hon. Friend underline yet again the great success of British Aerospace at Prestwick in introducing the successful Jetstream aircraft, which was conceived and is being built in Scotland?

<p>With permission, I shall arrange for the relevant figures for each health board to be printed in the <i>Official Report.</i> For Scotland as a whole the total geriatric bed complement at 31 March 1982 represented 39&#x00B7;2 beds per 1,000 of the population aged 75 and over. This is close to the 40 beds per 1,000 recommended in the report, "Scottish Health Authorities Priorities for the Eighties". There are variations between areas, but I am satisfied that all health boards are endeavouring to meet the needs of their areas.</p>

<p>Does the Minister concede that in the truncated debate in the Scottish Grand Committee the Secretary of State said that improvements were made when phase 1 of the Dunfermline and West Fife hospital was opened?

<p>The question is about geriatric provision. The hon. Gentleman should welcome the fact that the Fife health board provided an additional 60 beds at Whyteman's Brae last November and that work is well advanced on a further 120 beds for the elderly in Dunfermline. With recent developments at Glenrothes and Stratheden hospitals, that means that considerable improvements have been made in Fife for the care of the elderly.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for mentioning the improvements in Fife under the present Government, but does he recognise that the improvements involve catching up? Will he ensure that the Fife health board continues to improve geriatric and psychogeriatric provision in the area?</p>

<p>I agree that we are talking about a catching-up exercise by the Fife health board, which has gained substantially from the more equitable distribution of Health Service funds. It stands to gain further from the continuation of that redistribution. I welcome the priority that Fife health board has given to the care of geriatrics in its use of the additional funds.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that the average which he considers reasonable hides wide discrepancies? Does he accept also that it is not good enough that beds should only be available 100 miles away from some areas where they are needed? Will the Minister try to ensure that enough beds are made available in every area in Scotland?</p>

<p>In my main reply I conceded that variations exist in different areas. That is one of the main matters to which health boards must address their attention. They must ensure that geriatric beds are provided where the demand is, and not, as sometimes happens for historic reasons, in areas which are a long way from the demand. That is part and parcel of the priority which I expect health boards to give to geriatric care.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is welcome to think of himself as an aging person. Does my hon.

Does he agree that in many areas there will not be enough beds for geriatrics and psychogeriatrics in the future?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. Health boards must plan not only for today but for demographic changes between now and the end of the century, and I assure my hon. Friend that health boards do that. When considering the plans that they have submitted to my Department we shall examine carefully the provision for likely demand and the way that it will change in different areas.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that Cleland hospital in my constituency has a long waiting list? Is he aware also that some people have to travel as much as 100 miles to visit patients there? Is he further aware that the hospital board and its administrators are helpful, but that they can do nothing without the beds? What does the Minister propose to do about hospital care in Lanarkshire?</p>

<p>Lanarkshire health board, like some other health boards in Scotland, has a problem in matching its beds to the demand of the area. Let me repeat what I said. Lanarkshire, like other health boards, has to take account in its planning of geriatric provision now and in the future. I have made geriatric care a priority, and I continue to underline that.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that many of the authorities which are dependent on a share of the redistribution for the day-to-day business of running the Health Service in their areas are no longer able to finance or even forecast an expansion along the lines recommended by the SHAPE report in 1980? Does he agree that the present funding of the Health Service is inadequate to meet the responsibilities of Scotland as a whole and to avoid the disparity in provision at which he hinted today? He did not have the guts to come here today and tell us the exact position, although no doubt it will appear on the record. The fact is that the authorities do not have the money to do what he is asking them to do.</p>

<p>The disparity in provision existed in 1979 when we took office. It was inherited from the Labour party. Since 1979 we have increased the amount of money for the National Health Service. It is now at a historic high. We have put more money into the Health Service in Scotland than has ever been put in before&#x2014;far more than one would imagine from the crocodile tears of the Labour party.</p>

<p>Is it not humbug for the Secretary of State to suggest that an extra tier of Government would cost more money when that extra tier of Government already exists, warts and all, in the form of his own Department? Will he admit that last night's events show that the House is not up to the job of scrutinising Scottish affairs properly, because many Tory Members voted against repressive legislation for England, and the same Tory Members are apparently so ignorant of what is going on that on 5 December they voted for virtually identical legislation for Scotland?</p>

<p>I do not recall Opposition Members objecting when, if one likes to put it that way, Labour votes in England forced through nationalisation measures.

<p>As the right hon.

<p>As 99&#x00B7;5 per cent. of the civil servants employed by the Scottish Office work in Edinburgh, does it not make nonsense of the Secretary of State's argument that there would be an increase in bureaucracy if we had a Scottish Assembly and that extra costs would be involved in creating an elected Assembly?

<p>The hon. Gentleman's first figures are wholly inaccurate and quite wrong, and the rest of his question therefore falls. As for the rest of his

<p>Will the Secretary of State accept that there is deep and justified anger in Scotland at the lamentable spectacle of him sitting paralysed and ineffective while thousands of jobs on the lower Clyde are lost? Worse still, he is trying to cover his own glaring inadequacy by misconceived and tasteless attacks on the work force, which he is trying to make the scapegoat for the whole catastrophe. Will he now realise that if he had acted in a timely and decisive manner it would not be a matter of having to scramble around looking for some private sector rescue operation?<br/>
If it is possible for a third party to complete the contract, why is it not possible for British Shipbuilders to do that, given that, either way, it has to fund the losses to date? Does the right hon. Gentleman not at least realise that the minimum that we can ask is that he gets British Shipbuilders and Britoil around a table now to ensure that there is no possibility of disagreement about saving this contract, which is in the interests of the workers on the lower Clyde and, equally important, of this country if it is to have a creditable position in North sea technology?</p>

<p>Our fiscal and licensing-policies are designed to maintain the momentum of exploration and development in the North sea.

<p>I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his statement.

Will he further acknowledge that his hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst) has stated that the solution to the problem might be a private buyer? It is difficult to conceive of a private buyer taking over a yard which the Minister, the Prime Minister and the Government have spent many months running down, condemning and rubbishing.

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Government have done what they could in financial terms? Over &#x00A3;100 million has gone into Scott Lithgow to shore it up so far, and the only ultimate way of saving Scott Lithgow is to remove it from the present management and put it into private hands. In the past, before the nationalisation of Scott Lithgow, that yard was in profit. It did some of the best work in shipbuilding that was ever done on the Clyde.

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the intense interest that she has been taking in this important matter. On the question of finance, she is, of course, right. I should have mentioned earlier in these exchanges that the Government have not only been trying to persuade all concerned to do what they could to regain confidence between the supplier and the contractor in this matter, but have put in literally millions of pounds worth of money to help keep the contract going for as long as it has continued, amounting to approximately &#x00A3;13,000 per man employed. As to the future, what is necessary is to see whether there is a way of building up a management for this contract that will carry the conviction and the confidence of the person who is going to buy it, that is, Britoil. It is to that end that I and my colleagues will, of course, do everything we can to help.</p>

<p>It is the case that, when these very large and extremely difficult industrial crises arise, there are two levels of activity which any responsible Government must take. The first is to do everything they can to try to build some new activity from the old one that has come to grief, and that is what we are trying to do in this case. Secondly, in the regrettable event of a new enterprise not being successful, the Government must do all they can to help


the area concerned. There are numerous examples in Scotland of very successful activities funded by the Government and the SDA in recent years.</p>

Does the Secretary of State accept that Labour Members, too, are extremely worried about our future credibility in the oil-related industries? Is he aware that in our view it does not help to have a Secretary of State making comparisons between the Scottish work force and coolies recruited from the paddy fields of Korea and generally talking down the essential competence of working people in Scotland?

<p>The chairmen are, of course, well aware of my wish to encourage them to seek ways of improving their efficiency, increasing patient throughput and reducing waiting lists. From 1979 to 1981 the Government had some success in reducing the waiting lists which we inherited, but, when the Health Service dispute occurred, waiting lists increased again. Time after time I told the House that the dispute was damaging patient care and I invited Labour Members to condemn it, but they never did so. Yet now they are surprised that waiting lists have rocketed upwards. I trust, however, that they will be delighted to hear that between March and September last year waiting lists declined by 8,000.

<p>I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman, who has had a career in the law in Scotland, would understand that we have a unique system of criminal law.

<p>Because it is in the commercial interest of Scotland, which I believe hon. Members on both sides of the House would agree is a desirable objective. Contrary to what the hon.

It is still considering it as a matter of top priority. I am sure the hon.

<p>No, not at all.

<p>This is a difficult matter. If I recollect accurately, the shadow Secretary of State for Scotland was reported in the Scottish press as saying, "Oh! This is a hot potato."

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the further action I propose to take over the Kincora affair, about which I previously reported to the House on 18 February 1982.<br/>
In 1981, five people who had held positions of responsibility in homes and hostels for children and young people in Northern Ireland were sentenced to imprisonment for sexual offences against those in their care. Following these convictions the police continued their investigations into a number of outstanding matters, and the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary asked Sir George Terry, then chief constable of Sussex, to investigate allegations about the way in which the police had conducted their inquiries and to have a general oversight of the continuing investigations.<br/>
The RUC has completed its investigations. Sir George Terry's inquiry has also been completed. He has concluded that the RUC was justified in not mounting a full investigation before it did, in 1980; that there had been no concealment of evidence of a homosexual ring involving residents of the homes or others, nor evidence of homosexual practices by officials or police officers; but that there were shortcomings as regards the administration of the child welfare services. The Director of Public Prosecutions has considered all the papers and concluded that no ground existed which would justify any further prosecutions connected with the affair.<br/>
The convictions in 1981, together with others in 1982 and the events surrounding these cases, have been the subject in Northern Ireland of allegations of misconduct and of widespread disquiet. No other inquiry could be pursued without the risk that it would render further prosecutions impossible. Sir George Terry's inquiry has been thorough and his conclusions, as they bear on some of the wider allegations, are clear.<br/>
Although the extensive investigations which have been conducted have produced no evidence that would justify my asking the House to approve an inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, the House will share my wish to be satisfied that every possible step has been taken to ensure that there is no repetition of these unhappy events. I propose accordingly to establish a public inquiry under the powers contained in article 54 of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972. His honour Judge Hughes, a retired circuit judge, has agreed to chair this inquiry. The names of the other members of the committee of inquiry will be announced as soon as possible.<br/>
I shall circulate the full terms of reference in the <i>Official Report</i>. They will enable the inquiry to examine the administration of children's homes and young persons' hostels whose residents were subjected to homosexual offences which led to convictions or where homosexual misconduct led to disciplinary action against members of the staff; the extent to which those responsible for residential care could have prevented the commission of such acts or detected their occurrence earlier; the implications for present procedures and practices within the system of residential care; and to make recommendations with a view to promoting the welfare of such children and young persons and preventing any future malpractices.<br/>
The committee of inquiry will be able to consider what more should be done. It will be for the committee to determine its mode of operations and from whom it will seek evidence. It will be able to sit in public if it wishes. Those who give evidence in good faith will, as a matter of law, have protection in proceedings for defamation. Although the inquiries by the RUC and Sir George Terry, taken with the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions, mean that it is exceedingly unlikely that fresh evidence justifying prosecution will emerge, my right hon. and learned Friend, the Attorney-General, has undertaken to give immunity from prosecution for evidence which would incriminate a witness in respect of offences involving homosexual relations between males, and related offences such as counselling, procuring or soliciting. The inquiry will have power to subpoena evidence in Northern Ireland and its report will be published.<br/>
I believe that this inquiry will enable such lessons as there are to be learned and acted upon, and will provide the best basis for confidence in future in the provision made in homes and hostels for children and young persons.</p>

<p>The House is grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his statement, which hardly comes as a surprise. Will he speculate on how the timing seems to have been generally known to the media before it was known to the House?<br/>
The House will have confidence in Judge Hughes, but will the right hon. Gentleman explain the reasoning that led him to exclude an inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, which at first sight seemed to be the most obvious procedure? Will he confirm that the terms of reference are sufficient to ensure a full investigation into all aspects of the matter, which no previous investigation has achieved&#x2014;the administration of this home and of young people's hostels in Northern Ireland generally, the methods of ensuring that the authorities are fully informed of the welfare of young people under their care, the role of the police in this matter, what became of the various complaints made over the years before the matter came to light, and the political implications? Will this committee have a duty and power to investigate previous inquiries, whether they were misled and how?<br/>
The House notes that the inquiry will have power to compel the attendance of witnesses who in appropriate cases will be accorded immunity from prosecutions in respect of offences disclosed in their evidence. Perhaps more important, will they also be accorded physical protection if they request it?<br/>
As this is at least the fourth investigation into the events at Kincora, does the right hon. Gentleman recognise that this is his last opportunity to allay public disquiet, if it can properly be allayed, and that this time he had better get it right?</p>

<p>I felt that a 1921 Act inquiry was not justified because none of the allegations that have been made and investigated by the Terry report and the police has suggested that this matter would justify an inquiry under that Act. When we discussed this two years ago I made it clear that the House would need to be absolutely certain that a 1921 Act type of tribunal was essential before it would permit such an inquiry under those terms. For example, the Salmon report felt that a 1921 inquiry should be used only in very exceptional circumstances.<br/>
In this case I did not believe that it was justified, particularly as I believed that the manner of the inquiry and the terms of reference &#x2014; with the committee sitting under an experienced judge such as we have been able to obtain&#x2014;would present an opportunity for all the matters relevant to what has happened in these boys' homes over the years and the innuendo surrounding this whole affair to be properly examined.<br/>
If it is necessary for physical protection to be given by the police, it will, of course, be given. I give the House that assurance.<br/>
I was not aware that there had been any breach of the etiquette surrounding the notice that I would make a statement to the House, but if there was, I apologise to the right hon. and learned Gentleman.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that we in Northern Ireland are used to the fact that the press knows what is happening in advance? It is therefore no surprise that the press was able to speculate on what would happen on this occasion.<br/>
Despite his judgment about a 1921 Act inquiry, does the right hon. Gentleman accept that many people will doubt whether the allegations of misconduct and widespread disquiet, which have circulated in Northern Ireland for some time, will be dispelled by the nature of the inquiry that he has announced? I do not criticise the chairman of the inquiry who has been asked to investigate this matter, but I query whether the terms of reference are too narrow to deal with the problem. My hon Friends and I would prefer a much wider inquiry to deal with the issues.<br/>
Does the Secretary of State disagree with those hon. Members who take issue with that part of the report which says that, bearing in mind the pressures on the Royal Ulster Constabulary, it was not surprising that it did not investigate the matter before 1980? Like many of my friends in Northern Ireland, I think that because of the pressures of security duties upon the RUC, reinforcement should have been sent to help it instead of distracting it from other important investigations. We believe that the care of young people is a vital responsibility for the state. When it takes them under its care, it is our responsibility to look after them.<br/>
I welcome the forward-looking aspects of the inquiry. I hope that the Secretary of State agrees that the sooner guidelines are given and the sooner confidence is restored, the sooner those in this sensitive and responsible area will be helped to do an excellent job. Many workers in the field have felt under a cloud because of the allegations. Will those journalists who have used the freedom of the press to impute different motives or to allege certain acts be brought before the inquiry so that they may be asked to substantiate their allegations, which have caused continual unrest in the Province?</p>

<p>We have chosen not to follow the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 because the Salmon report made it clear that tribunals of inquiry under the 1921 Act should be set up only sparingly and in very special circumstances on matters of urgent public importance. Successive Governments have accepted that recommendation. I am confident that the inquiry that I have announced is wholly appropriate for its task.<br/>
I can answer the direct question by the hon. Gentleman. The power of subpoena is available to the inquiry. It could, if appropriate, call journalists to give evidence.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is important, among other matters, for the conduct of children's homes to be seen to be above reproach. Immediately after the events came to light, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the Sheridan inquiry was set up. All the boys' homes have been looked at carefully and fresh guidelines have been laid down, which I believe will all be implemented by February at the latest. A great deal of work has been done in the past two years. We have dealt with most of that side of the problem.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that Sir George Terry understood why the police did not investigate the matter before 1980. I believe that it would be within the inquiry's terms of reference to examine why no inquiry was instigated before 1980. This goes to the heart of much of the concern expressed in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>All constitutional and political parties in Northern Ireland have independently and unitedly made approaches to the Secretary of State for a complete, full and in-depth inquiry into this affair. Several approaches have been made by the party leaders to the Secretary of State asking for a full, public, judicial inquiry. Has it not been made abundantly clear that nothing less than the fullest possible judicial inquiry will satisfy the demands of justice and allay the fears of the general public in Northern Ireland? Opinion in Northern Ireland is that the Government have been dragging their feet. Will the inquiry be permitted to plumb the depths of the matter and consider the numerous other homes which have been under suspicion for several years, or will it be nothing more than a gloss on the surface of the affair?</p>

<p>The Assembly had two debates on the subject. I have seen the party leaders and at all times they have asked for a judicial inquiry to be held in public. That is the gist of what they have required. I believe that I have satisfied their demands without setting up a 1921 Act type of inquiry, which I do not believe to be appropriate in this case.<br/>
It will be up to the inquiry and the eminent judge who will preside over it to examine anything which is relevant to the particular boy's home, or to the other five boys' homes, and the circumstances which led up to the problems. Immunity will be given to witnesses who come forward and people will be protected from the law of defamation, provided that their motives are proper. I believe that it will be possible for the inquiry to be conducted along the lines suggested by the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea).</p>

<p>Has not the 1921 Act type of inquiry often been criticised for its unfairness to individuals brought before it? The Secretary of State has announced improvements in the supervision of homes.

<p>We have used experience on this side of the water to help us with the problems that we encountered in Northern Ireland. Of course there has been close liaison between the social services Department in Northern


Ireland and the DHSS in England. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for what he said about use of the 1921 Act type of inquiry which I have much in mind and which I thought that the House would have in mind if I brought a resolution to that effect before the House. The problem for the House and for the Government is that there is little between a 1921 Act type of inquiry which involves many disadvantages for many innocent people, and the type of inquiry that I am suggesting. There is no easy middle course for such an inquiry. That is why I have tried as best I can to provide wide terms of reference within the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972.<br/>
I have no wish to drag my feet or to cover up the affair in any way. It has been much on my mind in the last two years. I should like an inquiry to bury the issue once and for all by finding out the facts, if there are facts to be found. If there are no facts, I hope that people will have the grace to say that rumour-mongering has been engaged in and that that is the end of the matter.</p>

<p>It is now nearly two years since the Secretary of State expressed his intention of appointing a committee with a High Court judge as chairman to sit in public. Why has it taken such an inordinate time for an inquiry to be set up? Why are we not now to have a public inquiry, but essentially a private inquiry with the power to sit in public if its members wish? Why is police conduct in the Kincora affair outside the proposed inquiry's terms of reference, as was made clear in today's statement, when the only inquiry into police conduct was by a police officer?</p>

<p>In answer to the hon. Gentleman's last point, it was carried out by a chief constable from another force. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question about why it has taken so long between my original announcement in February 1981 and today is that the report by Sir George Terry, which was commissioned by the Chief Constable of the RUC, did not come out until last autumn&#x2014;I think it was the end of October. Until that report was considered by the Chief Constable and then referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to see whether any prosecutions were to be brought under it, there was no way in which I could set up an inquiry. Had I tried to set up an inquiry before the report was available, anyone who gave evidence to that inquiry would have had to be given immunity, that might have prevented people who could have been found to have committed offences from being charged with those offences. So that was the reason for the delay. We have a judicial inquiry. It is expected to meet in public. I think that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question. The judge in question is not a High Court judge, but he is a judge of great experience. So I think that the inquiry qualifies as a judicial inquiry.</p>

<p>Although I have considerable sympathy for my right hon. Friend and his statement, I should like to ask one or two questions about the inquiry. My right hon. Friend said that it will meet in public, if it so wishes. He then went on to say that those who give evidence in good faith will, as a matter of law, have protection in proceedings for defamation. How does one define the phrase "in good faith"?<br/>
My right hon. Friend also said that it was exceedingly unlikely that fresh evidence justifying a prosecution will emerge. He also said that the Attorney-General has

undertaken to give immunity from prosecution for evidence that would incriminate a witness. I have to tell my right hon. Friend, in spite of my strong sympathy and support for the work that he does, that I am profoundly concerned about the terms of reference for the committee of inquiry, particularly as he said that it will be for the committee to determine its mode of operations and from whom it will seek evidence.</p>

<p>I do not think that I can decide from whom the committee will seek evidence. It must be a matter for the committee either to call people to give evidence or for people to come forward to give evidence. In answer to the other matters that my hon. Friend raised, witnesses who in good faith give evidence, believing it to be true, will be protected in defamation proceedings. That is a judicial expression of witnesses acting in good faith which I think will be understood, and is understood, by the judge and by lawyers who may attend with any witness who comes forward.<br/>
Perhaps I might clear up the matter of immunity by saying that my right hon. and learned Friend has decided that no evidence given by a witness to the inquiry, nor any document that he is required to produce, will he used against him in any subsequent criminal proceedings for an offence involving homosexual relations between males, or attempting, aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring. soliciting or inciting, or conspiracy to commit any offence of that kind, or withholding information about any such offence.<br/>
That is the precise ruling that the Attorney-General gave on the matter. Should it become apparent that a witness has evidence which is of material interest to the inquiry but which cannot be given without risk that it could lead to prosecution, my right hon. and learned Friend has agreed to consider whether immunity should be extended to cover it. I think we have gone as far as we can to ensure that this inquiry will be entitled to get all the facts of the situation.</p>

<p>In view of the history of this affair and its extremely protracted unravelling, does not the Secretary of State think that it might have been wiser to regard this as one of those exceptional cases in which it would be appropriate to proceed under the 1921 Act? Secondly, in view of the desirability of reaching final conclusions and putting the matter beyond further anxiety, can he say when he expects the Hughes inquiry to complete its business?</p>

<p>I cannot give any information about the time that it will take. I want it to get on straight away. I shall, of course, announce the names of the other two members of the inquiry team as soon as possible after consulting the judge. I hope that it will be a reasonably short period, but it will depend on the number of people who come forward to give evidence. This time, it must be a complete inquiry. As for whether I am right in my judgment about the 1921 Act type of inquiry, it is my judgment that the House would have been reluctant to grant those powers, and I did not wish to put the House in the position of having to consider the matter when I myself did not believe, as the Terry report has already dealt with a large number of these allegations, that it would have been right in this case. I have seen and heard nothing since, despite what a few hon. Members have said, to make me change my mind.</p>

However, may I invite my right hon.

When we receive demands from many groups, such as the Campaign for Homosexual Equality, for a reduction in the age of consent among adults for homosexual acts, we should bear unhappy circumstances such as these in mind.</p>

It was a very thorough inquiry, conducted by two superintendents under Sir George Terry, and took a good deal of time to compile.</p>

<p>The answer to that is yes, but I must point out that the underlying problems of the Kincora affair go a good deal wider and deeper than just the problems of homosexual affairs in one home. Although the prevention of that must be the first aim of any Secretary of State or his Ministers, my other aim is to bring to an end the chapter of rumour, innuendo and charge levelled against people in Northern Ireland without, as far as I can find out, any basis of fact.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to abolish standing charges for gas, electricity and telephones.</q><br/>
I make no apology for returning to an issue that has occupied the House on a number of occasions in the recent past. Many hon. Members will know from letters and from their surgeries that this issue continues to worry many of our constituents. That is hardly surprising because standing charges are now a major source of income for the nationalised industries concerned. For gas and electricity they produce over &#x00A3;500 million a year, and for British Telecom the sum is over &#x00A3;800 million a year.<br/>
Standing charges have shot up rapidly recently. For example, in 1977 the standing charge for gas was only &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;50 a quarter. By 1982 it had reached &#x00A3;9&#x00B7;20, a sixfold rise in five years. A great many consumers are now paying substantial sums every quarter in standing charges. For gas, the figure is now &#x00A3;9&#x00B7;90, for electricity it is &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;45 and for telephones it is &#x00A3;16&#x00B7;27 a quarter.<br/>
These are charges over which most consumers have no control and in the vast majority of cases they are not related to the level of consumption. They are annoying for all consumers, but for those on small fixed incomes they are a nightmare. If we add to the basic standing charges that I have mentioned the standing charges for water and sewerage services, we find that a single pensioner is now paying about &#x00A3;39 a quarter, or over &#x00A3;156 a year, in standing charges. That represents one month's pension every year for a single pensioner going out in standing charges for which there is no tangible benefit; the costs of the services must be met over and above them.<br/>
The Government have reacted to the problem by seeking to limit standing charges for gas and electricity to 50 per cent. of the bill, and British Telecom has introduced a rebate for those who make a very small number of calls. I do not dispute that this approach has helped some small consumers, but they must be very small indeed. For example, anyone who uses more than 10 units of electricity a week pays the full electricity standing charge, and anyone who makes more than eight 3p telephone calls a week ends up paying the full standing charge to British Telecom. The rebate scheme has had some unfortunate side effects. Pensioners groups are already worried lest some pensioners try to cut down on consumption still further to evade the standing charge and, in so doing, over-economise on essential items such as heating.<br/>
We approach the problem against the background of substantial profits being made by the industries concerned. For example, in the last financial year the profits of the gas industry before tax and interest were over &#x00A3;500 million, and for electricity they were over &#x00A3;800 million. For British Telecom, after tax and interest, profits were &#x00A3;365 million. The Government have been requiring the gas and electricity industries to raise their charges over and beyond what is needed on a commercial basis and have then been taxing away an element of that profit. In that situation, standing charges are an insidious form of flat rate taxation which bears hardest on those who are least able to pay.<br/>
The original aim of the charges was to cover the basic costs of installation, metering, servicing and similar items, but the costs these days are no longer directly related to individual cases; they are purely flat rate charges. An

anonymous spokesman for the Electricity Council was reported in the Daily Mirror in October 1982 as having said:
<q>There is really no fair way of dividing it all up.</q>
If there is no fair way of doing it, we should stop doing it. It is time that we reconsidered our whole approach and moved towards the abolition of standing charges, although, clearly, that could not be done at one fell swoop and would not be the final answer to the problem.<br/>
If we were to replace standing charges by increased charges for units of gas, electricity and telephones, some consumers would gain and some would lose. About 60 per cent. of all consumers would pay less and 70 per cent. of all pensioners would pay less, but some large users would pay more. For example, families in all-electric homes would be worse off. However, we must face the fact that a great many people are already unable to afford a decent level of heating in their homes. The abolition of standing charges would remove a great deal of the present confusion and would concentrate attention on that problem.<br/>
The relief of poverty is a matter for the social security system. We should not make one group of poor consumers subsidise another, which we are doing by means of the standing charges. It is clear that the charges cannot be removed at a stroke; they must be phased out over a period. We should achieve that objective as part of a comprehensive attack on the whole problem of fuel poverty, and to do that will require sustained pressure. I urge the House to support my Bill as a contribution to that pressure and, even more important, as a gesture of sympathy and support for millions of pensioners on whom standing charges bear so heavily.</p>

<p>New Clause 9 would repeal subsection (10) of section 2 of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, which provides that a tenant who has received an offer to sell, but subsequently withdraws his application, shall not be entitled to make a fresh application for a further period of 12 months. Amendment 1 is a consquential amendment, which would delete subsection (3) from clause 1.<br/>
In Committee we had a very useful discussion of the transitional provisions in clause 1. Subsection (3) in particular sought to provide that where a tenant had received, but not accepted, an offer to sell on the date the Bill takes effect, he should be entitled to withdraw his application and submit a fresh one, to take account of the higher levels of discount available, without having to wait the normal period of 12 months which would be required under section 2(10) of the 1980 Act.<br/>
Hon. Members on both sides of the House pointed out, however, that this appeared to place at a disadvantage tenants who might have withdrawn their applications before the Bill took effect, possibly in anticipation of its provisions. These tenants would still be caught by section 2(10) and would have to wait the full 12 months before they could submit a new application.<br/>
In replying to these points, I said that I did not favour amending the Bill specifically to allow tenants who withdraw their applications during the passage of the measure to reapply immediately it takes effect, without waiting for the normal 12 months, because this would run the danger of introducing legislation which was retrospective. However, I said that I would be prepared to consider the case for removing the 12-month ban on reapplications entirely. The ban was introduced into the 1980 Act to deter frivolous applications in the early days of the right to buy, when tenants might have been encouraged to make probing applications to try to find out what the selling prices of their houses would be, even though they had no serious intention of purchasing. There is no corresponding time bar on reapplications under the English legislation, and this does not appear to have caused any problems in England and Wales. This is why

we are proposing that section 2(10) of the 1980 Act should be repealed in its entirety and I trust that the new clause will be welcomed by right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House.<br/>
I took it from the debates that we had in Committee that this suggestion would find favour with both sides of the Committee. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) makes a face. I suppose that every body is entitled to change his mind. I cannot remember whether the hon. Gentleman was still on the Committee when we discussed this matter, but my recollection is that there was general support for this suggestion.<br/>
If section 2(10) is repealed there is nothing to stop a tenant who has a current offer to sell, which he has not yet accepted, at the time the Bill takes effect from withdrawing his application and submitting a fresh one immediately, and subsection (3) of clause 1 therefore becomes unnecessary. As a consequence, amendment 1 proposes that this subsection of clause 1 should be omitted.<br/>
I hope that the new clause and the amendment find favour with the House.</p>

His response in bringing forward this new clause fulfills the obligation that he gave the Committee. What is even better is that this is an imaginative way of dealing with a minor problem, and the result has been a substantial improvement of the Bill.

<p>I undertake to take up the issue raised by the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) with my colleague in the Ministry of Defence. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied that that will be done.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) asked whether new clause 9 will involve increased administration. As far as I am aware, it will not. Perhaps I should have said earlier that new clause 9 owes much to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Henderson) who produced a constituency case in Committee. That case highlighted the difficulties which could arise. I am grateful to him for doing that. New clause 9 is an improvement.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) asked about current applicants. If new clause 9 is passed there will be nothing to prevent tenants who have received an offer to sell when the Bill takes effect from withdrawing their application and submitting a fresh one so that they might benefit from the higher rate of discount. However, that provision is restricted to tenants who have received an offer to sell but have not accepted it. It is clear that once an offer has been accepted the contractual arrangement involved creates different circumstances. People who consider whether to withdraw an application and to submit a fresh one should bear in mind whether the valuation of their property might have changed in the time between their original application and the new one. They will have to take that into account when deciding whether that would be the right way in which to proceed.<br/>
With regard to the point made by the hon. Member for Maryhill, I might not have detected enthusiasm&#x2014;I used the word "favour". As he is always a conscientious representative of his party on the Front Bench I always take it that if he does not oppose something in his normal robust way, his silence can be construed as acceptance of what is proposed. That is why, with some confidence, I suggested that new clause 9 would be regarded as an improvement by hon. Members on both sides of the House. I hope that it will find favour.</p>

New clause 7&#x2014;<i>Sale of houses by island councils</i>

<p>These new clauses deal with the problems faced by islands councils when they are required to sell teachers' houses in remote areas. I hope that they


meet the undertakings that I gave in Committee. I trust that they will be supported by right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House.<br/>
In Committee we discussed an amendment that was tabled by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) that would have given islands councils discretion to refuse to sell houses that were required for educational purposes. Although I did not feel able to accept that amendment as it stood, I said that I would consider proposing an amendment enabling islands councils to refuse to sell some houses that were required for educational purposes, provided that they had my right hon. Friend's consent. That is the effect of new clause 10. The approach is similar to treatment, prescribed by the 1980 legislation, of houses that have been specially adapted for the needs of elderly people. That approach has proved a satisfactory means of guarding the interests of landlord and tenant when there are houses of a special category which it is important that councils should be able to retain if they are to be able to carry out their statutory duties.<br/>
The hon. Member for Maryhill also tabled an amendment intended to enable islands councils to apply to the sheriff court to recover possession of a teacher's house when the teacher's employment had ended. I said that I would consider it, but I also said that I had reservations about it, bearing in mind the fact that the tenancy was otherwise secure.<br/>
On careful reflection, I am prepared to accept the principle of the amendment which also has a precedent in the treatment of amenity housing for elderly people. If the islands councils do not have some means of recovering possession of such houses the amendment that would enable them to refuse to sell teachers' houses in certain circumstances would have little value as the teacher would be able to remain in the house as a secure tenant and, indeed, to hand it on for one succession. It would, therefore, be many years before the house became available and, in the meantime, the council would still find itself faced with the difficult problem of trying to find alternative accommodation for a new teacher. Those are important considerations.<br/>
New clause 12 provides, therefore, that the islands councils may apply to the sheriff court for recovery of possession of a teacher's house once his employment has ended but it contains several safeguards for the teacher, which I consider to be extremely important. In the first place, the islands council must make out the case for recovery to the court and it will need to satisfy the court that the house is held for educational purposes, required for the accommodation of another teacher and that the council cannot reasonably provide alternative accommodation for that teacher.</p>

<p>The Minister keeps referring to teachers. Although in most cases it is teachers who will be affected, the provision refers to educational purposes. Does that include janitors' houses? What would happen to janitors when they retire, as they would require local authority housing far more than teachers?</p>

<speech hansard_id="221606" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.335.1" hansard_membership_id="543" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2331" speakername="Mr. Ancram" colnum="335" time="16:30:00">
<p>The provision includes janitors&#x2014;their houses are included in those which are required for educational purposes. The hon. Gentleman's understanding is probably the same as mine. I am referring to teachers because it was in respect of teachers that this matter arose.<br/>
Their case illustrates what we are trying to achieve more simply than would be the case if we attempted to use a generic term that covered all possibilities. The island council must make out the case for recovery to the court, and it will need to satisfy the court that the house is held for educational purposes, is required for the accommodation of another teacher and the council cannot reasonably provide alternative accommodation for that teacher.<br/>
Under section 15(2) of the 1980 Act the court may order recovery only if it is satisfied that the council has made suitable alternative accommodation available for the "teacher" so there is no question of the teacher being left without a home.<br/>
Given those fairly strict safeguards to protect the interests of the teacher, it is appropriate to provide some mechanism for the islands councils to recover possession of these houses, if they are genuinely required for the employment of another teacher and it is impossible for the councils to make alternative provision. I emphasise that, although a council may in certain circumstances apply to the court to recover possession of a house, teachers who live in such houses will otherwise continue to enjoy full security of tenure and will have all rights under the tenants' charter.<br/>
In Committee it was appreciated on both sides that a particular problem related to the islands councils, and I hope that the House will feel that, in putting forward these new clauses, I have fulfilled my commitment made at that time to try to find a solution, not only to help the councils and relive their problems but to go some way towards safeguarding the interests of the tenants of those houses who in other circumstances would have security of tenure. I believe that the balance is about right, and I hope that these new clauses will find favour with the House.</p>

<p>As the Under-Secretary of State has pointed out, these new clauses which were debated in Standing Committee were drafted by the Western Isles council. I believe that the Under-Secretary agrees that they struck a sympathetic chord across the parties. I am grateful for the way in which he has attempted to recognise the special factors applying to the islands and the fact that the island authorities are education and housing authorities, which places them in a unique position in relation to Scottish local government and the operation of this legislation.<br/>
The Educational Institute of Scotland has been in touch with me. It was on the horns of a dilemma as it represents teachers in posts and concerns itself with teachers who may be retiring or thinking of doing other things. I understand that the institute is broadly happy with the Government's proposals.<br/>
It was made clear in Committee that certainly the Western Isles council had operated in a fairly responsible fashion. Its main concern was to safeguard the position of the remoter islands where housing provision is a problem. There is anxiety about the bureaucracy that may be emanating from the Scottish Education Department, at New St. Andrew's House. It is important that the bureaucracy is not too heavy-handed. I do not know how much island-hopping the Under-Secretary manages to achieve in his role as the Minister responsible for housing in Scotland. I know that he went skiing this winter and returned with a broken leg, and I hope that he recovers soon. He will need to stand on his own feet because of the


housing measures that are coming from New St. Andrew's House. I trust that in this matter there will be a lighter touch at the tiller in New St. Andrew's House.<br/>
It is important that the islands should be able to safeguard their position as education authorities. They have made it clear already that the right of teachers to buy houses will not be injured and alternative accommodation will be made available. The islands which are both education and housing authorities would make the position more realistic. I thank the Under-Secretary for doing his best to meet these problems.</p>

The new clause makes provision for application to be made to the Secretary of State for Scotland for authority to refuse the application of the sitting tenant to purchase the house and for him to grant refusal.<br/>
We have talked about the islands, but we must bear in mind that there are rural areas on the mainland that are equally remote where houses are possessed by regional authorities for educational purposes. A headmaster who chooses to retire or who for some reason is removed from the house he occupies and who wants to purchase his house is unable to do so under the provisions of subsection (1)<i>(a)</i>(ii).</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has this point wrong. A teacher is not entitled to purchase that house under existing legislation, and this legislation does not alter that position.

<p>That may be so, but the purpose of tenants' rights is to give the individual the right to purchase the house that he occupies. There is no reason why a person occupying a regional authority house should not have the right to purchase that house.<br/>
What happens if the regional education authority refuses the right to buy to a person occupying a house on his retirement or when he leaves educational employment? What steps should be taken to approach the district council &#x2014;the housing authority in that area&#x2014;to enable that person to purchase a house? Such a person has given valuable service to the community as a teacher or head teacher in a rural area where there are a limited number of houses and it may not be possible for the region to provide another house. Can measures be enacted to ensure that such a person receives a house from the district authority?</p>

<p>I welcome the Government's acceptance of these new clauses. The Western Isles and the Orkney and Shetland islands councils have faced a difficult problem. No doubt, the Under-Secretary is aware that those councils have accepted the principle of the Government's legislation on the purchase of housing. In towns such as Stornoway, Kirkwall and Lerwick, where teachers have no trouble in purchasing their houses, this practice has been widely

carried out. The problem has been entirely in the remote islands. From my knowledge I can assure the House that there have been several cases when it was almost impossible to attract applications for teachers even when a house went with the position. If a house could not be offered this would be extremely damaging to education in the Western Isles and the Orkney and Shetland islands. I am grateful to the Government for their recognition of this anomaly, for accepting the new clauses as a way out of the problem and for the assistance of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) and both sides of the House.</p>

<p>I welcome the new clause and understand what my hon. Friend is hoping to achieve, but I am sad that the principle has not been extended to include all tenants of all regional councils.<br/>
I am at something of a loss to understand the logic of the Minister's position in being prepared to let teachers have the right to buy, unless the islands' council can demonstrate that it requires the accommodation for other education purposes, in an area where public sector housing is presumably in short supply, whereas in Central region or other regions in Scotland&#x2014;for example, in Stirling where public sector housing is more readily available&#x2014;tenants are to have no such rights. I am slightly disturbed that constituents, like the former teacher living in a house declared surplus by Central region about whom I have written to the Minister, are unable to enjoy the right to buy and to obtain a discount simply because of the ideological opposition of the Central regional council to council house sales. I do not see what basis of equity or what justification can allow a situation to continue where regional councils are able to sell such properties declared surplus to district councils at very substantial discounts. There are recorded examples well in excess of 50 per cent. where sitting tenants are living in those houses, yet the tenants are not allowed to enjoy any such discounts.<br/>
I am sure the House will be grateful to me if I do not rehearse the arguments for the new clause to be further extended to cover all tenants of regional councils. Indeed, the arguments were put in Committee very ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mrs. McCurley). In Committee on the Tenants' Rights Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 the then Shadow Secretary of State put the arguments very forcibly and, as always, was supported by his colleagues. He argued that if a right to buy were to exist at all it should be available equally to all tenants. I believe that that position is as valid today as it was then.<br/>
I ask my hon. Friend to take that argument on board, as I believe he promised to do in Committee, and even at this late hour to offer some hope to those tenants of regional councils outwith the islands, because the House is dealing not with private tenants in this amendment but with those who are suffering considerable hardship for no good reason. He has the support of many of us, and he has gone some considerable way to meet the islands' councils. I wish he would go a little further and meet the arguments that were put during the Committee stage.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the Minister for the way he has approached the problem put to him by the islands' councils. I think it is in some contrast to the attitude the councils found in the Scottish Office when the principal legislation was going


through in 1980. I am particularly grateful to the Minister for sparing the time to meet both me and the vice-convenor of Orkney islands council. I think he would agree that the vice-convenor of that council put forward very well the case for an amendment of this nature.<br/>
The anomaly has already been demonstrated that the islands authorities, being more than education and housing authorities, do not find themselves in the same position as for example, the Highland region. I think the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. McQuarrie) was slightly confused on that point. The problem has not really existed in the towns. Orkney islands council has received applications and sold houses to teachers in Stromness and Kirkwall. The problem could well arise in the outlying islands. In Orkney the island of Rousay has a two-teacher school and two houses belonging to the local authority, which it built in its capacity as an education authority. One was the subject of an application to purchase and, should the purchaser retire, as might well be the case, and intend to stay in the island, it would pose great problems if the council had to house an incoming teacher.<br/>
It must, therefore, seem somewhat churlish if we did not welcome the new clause wholeheartedly. However, two specific points prompted my right hon. and hon. Friends to table an amendment. First, we see an attitude emanating from the Scottish Office that the Scottish Office knows best. I submit that, even though the Secretary of State in terms of subsection (2) of the new clause will require information to enable him to ascertain whether the conditions mentioned are fulfilled, none the less the local authority is the body best able to understand the local conditions and to make the appropriate judgment in such a situation.<br/>
From figures given recently in a parliamentary answer, all three islands authorities have not held back in selling local authority housing. They are all well above the Scottish average as a percentage of the public sector stock. Indeed, they would exercise such a responsibility and such a discretion reasonably and properly. It is a matter of regret that the Secretary of State has not been fit to give them that discretion.<br/>
The other practical fear expressed to me by councillors and officials in the islands is that the machinery adopted is such that if a teacher, no doubt very often one with long service with a local authority, makes an application to buy a house, the local authority will then be put in the position, as it were, of the "baddie" who will be going to the Secretary of State to stop him doing so. The fear was expressed that this might cause unnecessary ill-feeling in a very small community. The preferred situation in the outlying areas is that there be a general principle that, where it would be unlikely that a teacher would be given a house, if the situation was such that the council could agree to do so, the council could give a right and opportunity that would not otherwise have existed.<br/>
None the less we recognise that a significant concession has been made. We shall not press our amendment to the vote and we shall not oppose this important new clause that the Government seek to add.</p>

<p>I welcome the new clause proposed by the Minister although I take the point made by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace). What concerns me&#x2014;and it is obvious from the two speeches the House has heard from the Government Benches&#x2014;is that there has been opened in the armour a chink that the

Government will try to exploit to extend even further the right to buy by local authorities. The Minister will obviously now face a campaign from his Back Benchers to extend this right to buy to regional authorities and, one assumes, to all other Government Departments&#x2014;the Ministry of Defence, the prison service, and so on. I welcome any move that brings control of the sale of council housing back to the local authority, who, as the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said, are the people who know best about it.<br/>
I was delighted when the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) said that all tenants should have the right to buy. He very quickly qualified that when some hon. Members asked about people in private tenancies. Some of us believe that if there is to be this right&#x2014;and we do not think there should be&#x2014;it should include all tenants in private properties either where those private properties have been built by public fund, as is the case for some private properties in my constituency, or where the landlord has received substantial grants from the local authority or from national authorities in order to restore those properties.

I am surprised that Conservative Members wish the right to buy to extend only to public housing and are not prepared to argue for its extension to private properties, especially those which have been the subject of substantial injections of public funds, in some cases far exceeding the original purchase price paid by the landlord.

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) for his welcome for the new clause and his recognition that it is a genuine attempt to meet a problem. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has gone, as I wish to comment on his contribution. In this context, I should qualify the statement that I made when he intervened earlier. Although a janitor is indeed in the same position as a teacher in an island authority, many janitors live in tied houses and thus do not have the security of tenure which would give them the right to buy. Therefore, although my answer was correct in theory, the normal regulations regarding tied accommodation will in practice apply to many janitors.<br/>
I was most interested in some of the comments of the hon. Member for Cathcart. I hope that his hon. Friends will inform him of my replies, as I know that he has had to go to a meeting. In the new clauses, the right to buy is being restricted and qualified for the first time. Yet the hon.

I live in hope that before today is out we shall hear something from the Front Bench spokesman about the Labour party's position as he was unduly, unnaturally and uncharacteristically reticent on the subject in Committee.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. McQuarrie) was right to say that prison officers in his constituency were purchasing their council houses, but that is because the Government voluntarily offer prison officers the right to buy their houses on the same terms as those enjoyed by district council tenants. We have been encouraging regional authorities to operate a voluntary system of selling houses which are surplus to requirements

on the same basis. The Government are setting an example in this respect, but I must make it clear to my hon. Friend that prison officers do not have the right to buy, for the same reason as applies in the case of regional councils. First, the Government and such councils are not housing authorities. Secondly, most of the houses owned by regional councils are required for operational purposes.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sterling (Mr. Forsyth) also referred to this matter and I know that many hon. Members are concerned about it. It was unfortunate that my hon. Friend, who attended the Committee assiduously, could not be present to move his amendment, but I listened carefully to the points ably put on his behalf by his hon. Friend the member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mrs. McCurley).<br/>
As I have said, most regional council houses are required for operational purposes. For example, they may be let in connection with employment by the concil or on a temporary basis pending development. If councils have houses surplus to requirements, however, we have always recommended and shall continue to recommend that they should be offered for sale to tenants on the same basis as under the right to buy.</p>

<p>The Minister complains about Labour party policy, but will he clarify the Government's policy on the sale of council houses to speculators? He must be aware that Edinburgh council currently plans to sell off more than 100 houses to Messrs. Miller, Barratt and Wimpey. That is an insult to the 12,000 families on the council waiting list, which is bad enough, but because the developers have been guaranteed 90 per cent. improvement grants many genuine owner-occupiers are being denied similar grants. Do not the Government feel strongly about that? They are always intervening in local government. Will they intervene in this case?</p>

<p>It is perhaps not surprising that the hon. Gentleman has succeeded in bringing in a matter which could not be further from the subject of the debate which relates to the interests of teachers on islands. As the hon. Gentleman well knows, the subject that he raises is a matter for Edinburgh council, which owns the properties; I could not possibly comment on it in this debate.<br/>
As has rightly been said, there is a connection between the position on the islands and that of the regional councils. There has been a varied response from the regions to the application of a voluntary sales policy. Some have been more willing sellers than others and I appreciate that tenants find it difficult to understand why their chances of buying their homes are better in some areas than in others.<br/>
I should like to see the voluntary sales policy implemented more uniformly. I shall be asking the Department to approach the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in the near future to see whether we can achieve an improvement in this respect. I accept that a problem has arisen where a region sells houses to a district, since the operation of the 1980 Act's cost floor prevents tenants from buying at a discount. This is one problem which my hon. Friend has encountered. As I said in Committee, this can be solved simply by bringing forward an order under section 1(7) of the 1980 Act which would exempt cost floor provisions. In Committee I gave an undertaking, which I repeat, that we will give serious consideration to making such an order.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his remarks on the point that arises when property is being sold to a district. I wish to press him further. The position of tenants under regional councils, which have decided for reasons best known to themselves not to sell at a discount even though the property is being declared surplus, is untenable. The purpose of bringing in the right-to-buy legislation was to get away from the position where some tenants could enjoy the right to buy because they had progressive local authorities, whereas others were doomed never to have the right to buy.<br/>
My constituents who have been caught in central region find it difficult to understand why it is possible, as my hon. Friend has correctly pointed out, to put a restriction on the islands councils which means that a teacher can buy unless the regional council can demonstrate to the Secretary of State that the property is required for other purposes. What danger would there be in applying that safeguard to all regional councils? The Scottish Office may urge councils to sell but at the end of the day councils controlled by a Labour majority will refuse to comply.</p>

<p>I appreciate the point that my hon. Friend is making. As I said, I am concerned because the voluntary policy has been operating less well in some areas. At this stage, I should like to take this up first with COSLA to see whether we can get a better system of voluntary sales. My hon. Friend will appreciate that it is always difficult to ascertain what houses are surplus to requirements, when they are surplus and whether they might be required again. The matter is not simple. That is why, if the system can be operated successfully on a voluntary basis, that is the best way. I shall give serious consideration to making the order to which I referred to cover the other matter.<br/>
It is important for my hon. Friend's constituents to realise the distinction between islands authorities and regional authorities. The island authority is at once the housing authority and the education authority. It is wearing those two hats simultaneously. That is the basic difference and one of the reasons why the difficulty arose. Therefore, there is a specific reason why the measure was required for the islands, although I shall bear in mind the points that my hon. Friend has made about regional tenants. I hope that my hon. Friend will be satisfied for the moment with what I have said.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) welcomed my acceptance of the amendments. I hope that he will appreciate that it was not so much a case of acceptance as of presentation, because these are Government amendments. They are a sincere Government attempt to recognise a problem that has existed in constituencies such as his. He made points about the difficulties faced by island authorities as education authorities. He will obviously appreciate that the rights of people who have been granted secure tenancies are also important. That is why we must get a balance, which I think is achieved by the two new clauses.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) referred to island-hopping. I feel fairly sensitive about the second word at this time; I am sure the hon. Gentleman did not mean it in that context. I assure him that I have visited a number of the islands, probably as many as he has, and I, too, am aware of the difficulties that they face.<br/>
5.15 pm<br/>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) dealt with new clause 7. I understand that the

authorities themselves might have felt that it would have been easier and simpler if the decision had been left to them, but the hon. Gentleman was wrong to suggest that this would create difficulties, because people would feel that the islands authorities were against them if the matter had to go to the Secretary of State. If the islands authority was taking the decision, it would be even nearer the front line. Therefore, the argument put forward by the hon. Gentleman did not hold much water.<br/>
More important, we went for this system rather than the one the hon. Gentleman suggested because of individual rights. I am not suggesting that any islands authority would act other than most fairly, but at the same time there could be an element of being judged in one's own cause. I am sure that as a lawyer he knows the theory why that is not satisfactory. There is an element of arbitration between two possibly conflicting points of view. In these circumstances, the fairest and best way to operate the system is by asking the Secretary of State to consider the matter and make the decision. That is what we have tried to achieve through the new clauses. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that this is the better way to approach the problem and that he will support the two new clauses.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has said that he will endeavour to get a voluntary agreement in consultation with COSLA in regard to regional authorities agreeing with district councils on giving a house to a person who is leaving the region. What will happen if a district council says to the region that it cannot house that person? A person who had faithfully served a regional council in a rural area and who was unable to obtain a house with the district council would be left out in the cold. Does my hon. Friend intend to take steps to try to ensure that the person who is unable to obtain a house from the district council because of its failure to get agreement with the regional council will at some time be able to purchase a house from the district council?</p>

<p>Perhaps I may write to my hon. Friend on that point. There could be a difficulty. If a person occupies a house because of the occupation in which he indulges as an employee, when the employment ceases, the person may be in difficulty. This does not happen just to people who have been employed by a regional authority. I do not think that a specific course of action could be adopted. I sympathise with the difficulties which regional tenants have had in some areas.<br/>
I want to see the voluntary policy operating more successfully. There are steps which I can take to try to achieve this. If at the end of the day nothing is achieved, I will be prepared to consider the matter again. If regions sell houses to district authorities and thereby undercut, the right to buy provisions for tenants, the best way to deal with that is by an order. As I said, this is a matter to which I want to give serious consideration. I hope voluntarily to find a solution which will satisfy my hon. Friends the Members for Stirling and for Banff and Buchan.<br/>
I hope that the House will approve the new clauses.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The new clause would extend the benefits of the right to repair to tenants of district councils and other housing authorities, who occupy tied houses. Although tenants of tied houses do not have security of tenure, they already enjoy the other rights that make up the tenants' charter under the 1980 Act with the exception of those rights that would conflict with their status as service tenants. The right to repair will be in addition to the tenants' charter. It is appropriate that this new right should be extended to tenants of tied houses. An amendment to this effect was brought forward in Committee by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) and, while I supported the underlying principle, I said that the amendment's drafting was not entirely acceptable. I seem to recollect that I gave it fairly high marks, on the advice of those who advise me on drafting.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman agreed to ask leave to withdraw his amendment on the understanding that the Government would bring forward a suitable amendment on Report with exactly the same intention, to extend the right to repair to tenants of tied houses.

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows the answer to his question. They are the tied houses referred to under section 10(4) of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980.

<p>This new clause and the two amendments that go with it are technical amendments which relate mainly to the Bill's transitional provisions. I hope that I shall not need to detain the House long.

That will also apply to clause 2, which was inserted in Committee, and the new clauses dealing with the removal of the 12-month restriction on re-applications to purchase, and the sale of teachers' houses by island councils. As a result, section 1(4) becomes redundant and the purpose of amendment No. 2 is to leave it out. New clause 13(2) introduces a new schedule of repeals which gather together all the provisions repealed elsewhere in the Bill.<br/>
Subsection (2) also provides that section 13(12)<i>(b)</i> of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 is repealed and shall be deemed never to have had effect.

<p>The purpose of the right to be consulted is to create more opportunities whereby public landlords may properly and adequately consult their tenants. The tenant participation advisory service has, for some time, pointed to the disparity which exists north and south of the Tweed in respect of such rights, because the Housing Act 1980 introduced consultative arrangements in respect of England and Wales. I understand that there are still some teething problems in respect of that legislation, but we feel that it is important that similar rights should be extended to Scottish tenants. There was a move to do so, which was rebutted by the Government during the course of the original tenants' rights legislation.<br/>
In Committee, it was suggested that the report of the Scottish Consumer Council entitled, "Tenants Associated&#x2014;a Survey of Tenants Groups in Scotland" had shown that there was not a great deal of interest in tenants becoming more involved in the management of their properties. The director of the Scottish Consumer Council, Peter Gibson, wrote to me recently pointing out that that had misconstrued the reality, and that only a small minority of tenants were not disposed to becoming involved in arrangements for greater consultation. The great majority of tenants would appreciate being more directly involved in the decisions taken by public landlords, which would ultimately and directly affect them.<br/>
There was a debate, as the Minister knows, in the Scottish Grand Committee on 1 February last year dealing with tenant participation. His predecessor, the present Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, was then charged with responsibility for Scotland's housing. The Minister's hon. Friend is something of a movable tenant because his responsibilities at the Scottish Office have changed constantly since his arrival. During that debate, he extolled the virtues of tenant management schemes and moves towards greater consultation.<br/>
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland spoke at a conference that I chaired in the Mitchell library, Glasgow, in September 1982, which dealt with the issue of tenant management schemes in Scotland. I recall that he chastised the Scottish local authorities at that time for falling behind their English counterparts in extending the development of housing co-operatives.<br/>
5.30 pm<br/>
It is timely to have the debate this afternoon, because the Minister may have had time to read a copy of the report by the review committee on housing co-operatives in Scotland, which was published recently. The review committee was set up following discussions at the conference seminar held in Glasgow. It examined closely all aspects of housing management co-operatives in Scotland, and some of the reasons why there has been reluctance, if not difficulty, in extending housing cooperatives there.<br/>
The review committee was chaired by Anja Amsell, the director of the Scottish council of the YWCA Housing Society Ltd. Maryhill was well represented on the review committee and brought a measure of good sense to its proceedings, arising from our experience gained on the tenant management schemes operating now in the Summerston area. Indeed, the Summerston housing cooperative was the first to be established in Scotland, arising largely from the initiatives taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), when he


was in charge of housing in Scotland. Those initiatives were followed quickly by schemes in Invershiel, and Caulderquilt, and we have high hopes of other tenant management co-operatives in the area.<br/>
It is important for the Government to address themselves to the review committee's report, because it makes some practical suggestions about the way to extend tenant participation and tenant management co-operatives in Scotland. The report was studied jointly by the tenant participation advisory service and the Co-operative Union education service. I hope that the Minister will at least give a hint today about how he sees the future role of TPAS, the Government funding of which is up for auction in 1986.<br/>
Tenant management co-operatives should be the subject of a "sleeves-rolled-up" exercise. The newly founded bodies invariably need practical assistance rather than a lot of extra paperwork or interesting leaflets and publications. It is felt that the TPAS might be able to develop its practical support. It is usually up to local authorities, the Scottish Special Housing Association, which operates two tenant management co-operative schemes, the new towns and the housing corporations, as public agencies in receipt of public funds, to give practical support. I hope that the Minister will comment usefully on some of those matters.<br/>
As an aside, a paper was sent to me recently about tenant owners' repair co-operatives, which was produced by ASSIST Architects Ltd. That organisation seeks to promote the concept of owner-occupiers in tenement blocks being able to join others to repair their properties effectively on a co-operative basis, rather than entrust the work to the sometimes unsatisfactory services of factors. The Minister should consider that matter and decide whether that approach can be extended to become the principle and practice of good housing management in Scotland. There is no doubt that there are peculiarities about the problems in tenements, which require a specific and practical approach, not only by the public landlords but by the Scottish Office.<br/>
New clause 2, dealing with the provision of tenant information, is designed to ensure that some of the misunderstandings about tenants' rights and obligations are cleared away. Sometimes the people who work in the busy offices at New St. Andrew's House do not appreciate that their work does not always reach individual tenants and their households. In the new clause we are seeking to create greater awareness of rights and obligations. Shelter in Scotland has highlighted the need for bodies to provide information that is more easily digested in the average household. Sometimes we tend to use language which, even for the experts, is a wee bit cumbersome and tiresome to read. The purpose of the new clause is to ensure that there will be greater dissemination of information. It will be information that is provided rather than information that is simply published, which is more likely to be read by people who know their way about.<br/>
If the Government's approach on the consultation paper on the right to repair is any guide, there is a need to ensure that the information is adequately disseminated. The Minister can screw up his face, but the fact is that many organisations did not know that that consultation paper had been issued. As the Minister knows, I took it upon myself to make sure that all the community councils and tenant

organisations in my area got a copy of it. Some of those people were very indignant in the returns that I have seen. They must have been quite indigestible for Mr. J. Irvine in room 404 of New St. Andrew's House, when he received them.<br/>
I hope that the new clause will meet the approval of the Minister and the House.</p>

<p>I support the commendable new clause proposed by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen). I was surprised at how enlightened the Labour party has become. Too often in the past it has treated council tenants in a paternalistic way, especially at local level. The provisions for consultation suggest that new standards are being sought. Whether the lower echelons at council level will be willing to accept some of the provisions in the new clause that the hon. Gentleman generously brought to the attention of the House remains to be seen.<br/>
There is no doubt that there has been a change in recent years in the attitude of public landlords to their tenants. Some of them were provoked by demonstrations of annoyance by tenants over lack of consultation, particularly about modernisation schemes, when people found that cherished fitments that they put into their houses at their own expense were torn out as part of a modernisation deal that had to be complete in every respect, according to bureaucratic ideals. Housing divisions began to find that they could not get away with that. Gradually the processes of consultation improved. An example is the work by the Scottish Special Housing Association which has been good about some modernisation schemes that have been brought to my attention.<br/>
A study of the administration of the public housing stock over the years will show that there are things that the local authorities have done in their wisdom to attempt to improve conditions, such as removal of private garden space and the installation of open-plan, common ground. This was done against a welter of opposition from tenants. There was no doubt that the maintenance of garden ground by the public authority improved the environment and outlook of the neighbourhood somewhat. It also led to something that could have been avoided if there had been consultation. In certain sectors there were natural pathways where members of the public or neighbours of certain tenants could move from their houses to the shops or from bus stops to their houses, pathways which took them past the living rooms and windows of council houses. This caused unsightly, muddy paths where there should have been nice, cleanly cut grass. Because of a lack of prior consultation, I suspect that many members of this House began to receive requests from affected tenants for fences to be put up in order to protect the immediate environment of the houses.<br/>
It is sometimes very difficult to know where to draw the line but it is easier and can prevent trouble if the people who live in the area are consulted first. They will not lightly get rid of something that may be to their advantage. Imposition, however, is a bad thing. Many tenants tend to feel that they are pawns on a vast and impersonal board, to be moved about as the housing authorities direct. This attitude is sometimes reinforced when they go to offices, talk to different clerks on different days and are given different information. It is, therefore, very important that


the proposals for consultation and provision of information be rationalised and for there to be a positive duty on the part of the landlords to provide for this.<br/>
These are very useful clauses. I hope that the Government will take them on board. I do not consider the clauses very radical&#x2014;more's the pity; some tenant management schemes go well beyond what is set down in the new clauses. If the Government will not accept them, in the interests of the principle, I hope that the Labour party will press the matter to a vote, but I cannot see any reason for the Government to turn down the excellent suggestions which are before the House.</p>

<speech hansard_id="221667" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.351.0" hansard_membership_id="1766" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29822" speakername="Mr. Hugh Brown" colnum="351" time="16:45:00">
<p>I have reservations about these clauses, although, to be diplomatic&#x2014;never one of my noted characteristics&#x2014;I would avoid the temptation to cause the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) to remind the House that he once accused me of being a "white settler" in some of these matters. I do not take exception to that, because to some extent it is quite true.<br/>
Unlike the present Government, I have always firmly believed in the right of local authorities to do as much as possible without interference from Government or from anyone else. Holding these views casued me a lot of difficulty because many members of my party, not just in the House but outside, wanted to dictate to local authorities, especially Labour-controlled authorities.<br/>
I therefore approach this matter with an open and fair mind about the desire and intention behind the new clauses to provide the maximum information to tenants or to anybody else who will be affected by the decisions of a housing authority and I am 100 per cent. in favour of encouraging, cajoling and even threatening colleagues in local authorities who are sometimes not the best communicators in the business.<br/>
5.45 pm<br/>
I do not think that the Government will accept the clauses. I do not know that the Minister is going to give any indication to me before I put my foot in it, but I imagine that he is not going to accept them, because it would mean writing them into the Bill, and, apart from possible drafting errors in them, they do not form a commitment that I am particularly keen to see in the Bill. My purpose in supporting the new clauses is to gain a recognition from the Minister that there is still a need to encourage participation and consultation between housing authorities and their tenants. I hope that in the light of my comments the Minister will respond in a fairly objective and not too partisan manner.<br/>
One matter which I would like clarified and which I do not think was raised in Committee is the present position of the tenants' rights charter. We are dealing here, after all, with an extension of the tenants' rights in the 1980 Act. Can I ask if all the new leases have now been agreed? We have all received correspondence from the Scottish Consumer Council about difficulties that were being exprienced. If my memory serves me right, in both Hamilton district council and Renfrew district council there was some legal tangle because some authorities&#x2014;not, I think, these two in particular&#x2014;were trying to write into their leases conditions that went far beyond what this House expected of them. In other words, instead of having a tenants' charter containing their rights, some Scottish housing authorities were trying to put into leases conditions that tenants would do repairs which were really

the responsibility of the landlord. I am not making a party point on this becuase I am sure that it applied to different housing authorities, whether Labour-controlled or not.<br/>
It was against that background, which I am sure the Minister will appreciate, that there was unanimous support for the general principles of the so-called "tenants' charter". The previous Government were involved and had been holding discussions and it was the 1980 Act that was thought to be the first opportunity that the new Government had of putting these in. It was an entirely separate thing from the sale of council houses. We are really at one, therefore, on the need to have some kind of tenants' charter. As I understand it, there was a requirement on housing authorities to prepare leases and to clarify the position regarding repairs in the first place. Can I ask the Minister if that has all been completed? I understand that, certainly in Glasgow, there are difficulties in keeping to that timetable.<br/>
It follows from this that there is a real need for information. There is the argument that, when we are not very certain or dogmatic about exactly what needs to be done, we can always ask for more research and information because it means that we have more time before we must make up our minds. This is concerned to some extent with the sale of council houses too. I am genuinely worried about the sort of ghetto mentality that might develop because of the policy on the sale of council houses. I am not trying to be controversial. The Minister knows what I am talking about, because in Edinburgh, with a Conservative council, just as in Glasgow there are areas where, no matter what sort of solutions are being tried in Edinburgh, the housing authorities have a great responsibility for the state of some of the major housing schemes. This applies not just to Glasgow and Edinburgh but to other authorities.<br/>
I am, therefore, not making a party point when I say that I am worried that in these areas it is not just a question of giving tenants rights but of trying to encourage people to believe that the housing authorities care about the quality of the environment in which people live. This is why I feel concern. I do not want to write in provisions which are all right in nice, quiet middle-class areas such as Milngavie and Bearsden where there are very few council houses and where it is easy to believe in the principles of consultation and discussion and all the rest of it. That is not nearly enough to begin to tackle some of the problems with which I am concerned.<br/>
Obviously, I cannot speak for my Front Bench, but the principle of giving information is a means of stimulating greater public interest in the problems faced by some of these communities. In my opinion those problems will get worse rather than better because of the housing policies that the Government are pursuing.</p>

<speech hansard_id="221668" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.352.0" hansard_membership_id="543" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2331" speakername="Mr. Ancram" colnum="352" time="16:45:00">
<p>In a sense we have had a useful debate on tenant participation as well as on the subject matter off the two new clauses. As always, I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown). He is right that not all leases have yet been completed. I understand that about half have been, but the rest are satisfactorily on their way to completion. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that within the tenants' charter those leases provide a useful source of information on tenants' rights.<br/>
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern about certain areas. I have always taken the view that information and


discussion are important to deal with some of the problem housing areas. The attempt to involve tenants is important, and I certainly do not object to the principle.<br/>
However, I was surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman say that he would support the new clauses. I recall that in Committee that he talked about statutory consultations. Indeed, he said:
<q>I must confess that I am not a statutory Member of Parliament. I have always objected to people in the Labour movement&#x2014;and we seem to have more now than ever before in outside bodies that are legion&#x2014;saying that we must have a statutory right to do this, to do that and to do the next thing.</q>
He then made an important point that struck a chord with me and, I suspect, with other members of the Committee. He said:
<q>As a Labour councillor I would resent Parliament telling me that I should consult my constituents."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 6 December 1983; c. 373.]</q>
In a sense, that seems to be the principle behind the new clauses. They create a statutory duty to consult. Therefore, in the light of what the hon. Gentleman said in Committee, I was somewhat surprised to hear that he would support them.<br/>
I also listened carefully to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson). Most Conservative Members would agree that one of the problems on many Scottish council house estates is that for too long tenants have been moved about like pawns and have been treated in a statistical rather than personal way. There has been an element of depersonalisation, and that has motivated my support for the tenants' charter and an increase in tenants' rights. That has certainly motivated the Government's intention to pursue that course. It is an extension of that to look at tenant participation and consultation. As I have said, I have no opposition to the principle of that form of consultation.<br/>
We have heard that new clause 1 would require landlords to prepare a scheme for consultation with tenants on housing management matters. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) would concede, that proposal is borrowed from the Housing Act 1980. Elsewhere in that Act&#x2014;this is perhaps a technical point&#x2014;there is also a definition of what constitutes
<q>a matter of housing management".</q>
Whatever my view on the generality of the new clauses, without such a statutory definition it would be extremely difficult to establish which matters should be placed before tenants and which should not.<br/>
Even were the new clause not defective in that way, I could not recommend its acceptance. From some of the comments made in Committee I understand that the hon. Member for Provan was not the only hon. Member who feared statutory consultation. As a constituency Member of Parliament, and from what I have been able to ascertain from my Department, I believe that there is very little evidence of any demand from tenants for the introduction of formal arrangements for consultation. Indeed, to impose a statutory duty on councils to consult their tenants would add a heavy burden in terms of manpower and resources. That is another element of which we must be conscious. Given the concern that Labour Members have previously expressed that the Bill should not add to local bureaucracy and administration, I was somewhat surprised when the hon. Member for Maryhill tabled the new clauses.<br/>
I do not oppose the principle of consultation where the demand for such consultation exists. I believe, however, that such consultation will be more effective if it is based on arrangements entered into voluntarily. That is why my Department funds the tenant participation advisory service, a principal aim of which is to promote tenant consultation.<br/>
The hon. Member for Maryhill talked as though the TPAS was funded only up to 1986, but a three-year funding is beginning at this precise moment. I would not like it to be thought otherwise.</p>

<p>I am carefully following my hon. Friend. He seems to have put his finger on the nub of this matter, that consultation and good relations between a local authority and its tenants have more to do with the spirit, intention and attitude&#x2014;my hon. Friend used the word "depersonalisation" which is the other side of the coin&#x2014;rather than with rules, regulations and mandatory procedures.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That is an important aspect of this problem. The hon. Member for Maryhill, who takes a great interest in these matters, will know that voluntary consultations such as he has held, with housing associations and council estate tenants are more likely to be successful than something which is imposed.<br/>
New clause 2 would require authorities to provide tenants with more and clearer information about their tenancies. I have some sympathy with the aims of the new clause, but I cannot accept that the administrative and financial burden for local authorities which would result would be justified. The 1980 Act already requires authorities to provide tenants with a written lease, which must contain the terms of their tenancy. The additional information on leases which new clause 2 would require authorities to issue to their tenants would solve no problems but would, I suggest, be little used by the tenants and would impose additional burdens on housing management staff, who, I am sure, have many more pressing problems to deal with.<br/>
There is little between us on the principle of the need to consult and inform, but that can best be done informally. The Government have shown their support for that in their support of the TPAS. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Maryhill to ask leave to withdraw the new clauses. If he does not, I must urge the House to reject them.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a few comments. The Minister knows that it is not my intention to delay progress.<br/>
Several parts of new clause 2 are worthy of comment, although I do not necessarily speak in their support. I understand that some difficulty has been experienced in the interpretation of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981. I am not a lawyer and I have always thought that to be a big help in the House because it has prevented me from becoming too technical. I apologise for raising this matter. I know that the Minister has some knowledge of the matrimonial homes legislation. Concern has been expressed and there has been


misunderstanding about rights in that respect because some authorities play off that legislation against the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977.<br/>
New clause 2 is sponsored by Shelter, as are most of the others. It would be less than generous not to recognise that some of the voluntary bodies working in the housing sphere have come across difficulties associated with the interpretation of the 1981 Act and the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. Will the Minister assure us that he is aware of the problem with which clause 2 deals and which might help us out of our difficulty?</p>

<p>I am not aware, and as far as I know neither is my Department of any specific problem relating to the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to enlarge on the issue, perhaps he will write to me and I shall, of course, reply.<br/>
The purpose of new clause 2 is to provide information. It does not seek to solve any specific problem. I hope that my hon. Friends will have heard what I said earlier, and that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) will withdraw the motion.</p>

<p>I note what the Minister said. I am impressed by the new-found sympathy for housing authorities and their manpower and resources as that sympathy is not usually shown when we seek it elsewhere. Perhaps I gave the impression when I spoke earlier that I regarded this issue as entirely a management exercise.<br/>
I extolled to the Minister the virtues of the review committee report on housing co-operatives, although I see it as being the ultimate in tenant involvement. The two new clauses are designed to trigger off consultation and the right to information which we regard as important. The clauses are intended to be the primary stage in good housing management policy.<br/>
I thank the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) for his remarks. I have always considered it important for tenants to think that they can get close to the bodies that are responsible for their tenancies. We should narrow the gap between the bureaucrats and the tenants. From what I have seen in my constituency, I believe that it is important to involve tenants in the management of housing schemes. At one time one could say that tenants were concerned primarily with their houses, but I believe that they have become increasingly concerned, and rightly so, with their immediate environment. Housing management co-operatives have provided the opportunity for tenants to involve themselves collectively in their immediate environment.<br/>
I am aware of the reservations of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) in certain matters, but his diplomacy is not a matter on which I would criticise him. He was right to touch on the issue of written leases, with which we shall be dealing later. The Opposition think that it is important to put down a marker on the right to consultation and more information. We must press the new clauses if only to show the earnestness of our intent.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The clause involves a technical matter of some importance. Section 16 of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 deals with leases and secure tenancies. Section 16(4) of that Act enables a tenant in a secure tenancy who considers that the lease drawn up by his landlord does not fairly reflect the tenancy's existing terms to go to court to settle the dispute.<br/>
I understand that difficulties arise if a tenancy agreement is in the process of negotiation and has not been executed because of a dispute about the terms. We may be wrong technically, but we are advised that recourse to the courts to settle a dispute cannot take place until a secure tenancy exists. The new clause aims to make it clear that when a dispute occurs about the drawing of a tenancy agreement, the tenant has recourse to the sheriff court to settle the dispute instead of only after the agreement is executed. Without a change, the tenant would have to put his name to the tenancy agreement before having the right to go to the sheriff court to dispute the terms.<br/>
I do not wish to delay the House further, because debates about broader principles are still to come. I hope that the Minister can comment on the new clause and reassure us that the difficulty is met. I hope that he will regard the problem sympathetically.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for setting out the reasons for the probing new clause. I shall explain the position, but I can not provide authoritative interpretation of statute, because that is a matter for the courts.<br/>
There is no ambiguity about section 16 of the 1980 Act, which provides tenants with a means of challenging conditions in tenancy agreements drawn up by their


landlords if the conditions do not fairly reflect the existing terms of tenancy. However, when a tenant has signed his lease, the existing terms of his tenancy are, by definition, the terms embodied in that lease. There could be no question of that lease failing to reflect those terms fairly. In short, there is no doubt that a tenant's right under section 16 to challenge the terms of the tenancy agreement drawn up by his landlord ceases when the tenant signs that agreement.<br/>
However, section 17 enables tenants, after they have signed their leases, to apply to the sheriff to strike conditions out of the leases if they consider that the conditions are unreasonable and the landlord refuses to agree to the waiving of those conditions. So tenants have the right to challenge the terms of their tenancy agreement before they sign it if they consider that it does not fairly reflect the terms of the tenancy, and they have the right to challenge the terms of the agreement after they have signed it, if they consider that it contains conditions that are unreasonable in terms of section 17.</p>

<speech hansard_id="221684" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.359.0" hansard_membership_id="78" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2318" speakername="Mr. Dewar" colnum="359" time="18:15:00">
<p>It is unlikely that any other hon. Member wishes to join this little debate. I see that I am right. I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said, he is saying that I have misunderstood the situation, and I accept that. He says that under section 16(4) there is a clear right to challenge the terms of a lease before it is signed, if there is a dipute about how it is drawn up, and that in the aftermath &#x2014; as one might call it &#x2014; of signature and execution, it is still possible under section 17 to petition the courts on the ground that a condition of the tenancy that has been executed is unreasonable. Presumably, because of that statutory right, it could not be argued that the tenant was barred from arguing that case because he had signed the lease at an earlier stage.<br/>
If that is so, and despite the becoming modesty of the Minister's remarks about his authority on matters statutory, I am quite happy to accept what he says. The new clause came from the Scottish Consumer Council, which has taken a helpful interest in this amending legislation, and I have no doubt that it will be interested to know what the Minister said. If there is further confusion, no doubt it can be cleared up in other ways at later stages of the Bill. I thank the Minister for his explanation, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This new clause is about the continuing problem in Scotland of the lack of suitable housing for elderly and disabled people. It seeks to remove, or exempt, local authorities from the obligation to sell housing stock such as one or two-apartment housing that is particularly suited to the needs of elderly and disabled people.</p>

<speech hansard_id="221690" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.360.1" hansard_membership_id="2909" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13723" speakername="Mr. Craigen" colnum="360" time="18:15:00">
<p>I am hardly on my feet before I am interrupted. I am trying to establish in the Minister's mind the importance of the scarcity of accommodation for elderly and disabled people. About one quarter of households in Scotland are now occupied by single people, and the great preponderance of those households are occupied by single elderly people.<br/>
It has become politically popular &#x2014; certainly, it is politically necessary &#x2014; to refer to the importance of sheltered housing accommodation. I know that in Glasgow there is a substantial waiting list for sheltered accommodation. I think that it runs to about 5,000, but not long ago it was only 3,000, and that was worrying enough. Moreover, the problem is reflected in many other parts of the country.<br/>
The great majority of elderly people do not require sheltered housing, but they require suitable and adequate housing. It is important that the housing stock of one-and two-apartment houses should not be so eroded that the limited options available to the local authorities are reduced. We believe that provision should be made in the amending legislation to safeguard elderly and disabled people. I urge the House to accept the new clause.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) introduced his new clause in an extremely reasonable manner. It is one that sounds fine superficially, but the more one looks at the proposition that it contains, the more one sees that it would be counterproductive if it were accepted, partly because it would be a restriction of the rights of tenants who had been given rights under the 1980 Act, and partly because one of the great merits of the sale of council houses is that it deals with the very problem to which the hon. Gentleman refers &#x2014;the need for more accommodation for single persons, particularly single elderly people. The best way to provide resources which otherwise would not be available is by pursuing the sale of council houses with enthusiasm and encouraging tenants to seek to buy their own houses. In that way councils can provide the houses that are needed now, and not the houses that were needed 20, 30 or more years ago. The sale of council houses to sitting tenants is one way of dealing with the problem that the hon. Gentleman seeks to remedy. I therefore oppose the new clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="221692" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.360.3" hansard_membership_id="8408" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3055" speakername="Mr. Maxton" colnum="360" time="18:15:00">
<p>I support my hon. Friend's important new clause, particularly as it affects Glasgow, part of which I represent. Glasgow has many houses that were built for the single elderly person. However, they are not covered by the present legislation because they are not strictly sheltered housing for the elderly, specially developed for elderly and disabled people. I have quite a lot of one-or two-apartment blocks in my constituency. They are occupied almost exclusively by elderly people, and they are required for more elderly people when the present occupants leave. One block in my constituency, at Dougrie Place in Castlemilk, has an alarm system attached to a nearby old folks' home. In theory, the alarm goes through to the matron or the person who is on duty at the home, and that person phones the doctor. Unfortunately, financial restrictions have meant that the system has never


been operated, although it has been installed for some two years. However, those houses do not come under the legislation, and they should do, particularly in view of what was said by the hon. Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Henderson).<br/>
6.30 pm<br/>
Glasgow district council has been allowed a capital allocation of &#x00A3;52 million for the coming year. That sum will be available only if the council is prepared to increase rents by the exorbitant amounts that the Government would like to see imposed, and if it fails to do that it is likely to have its capital allocation reduced to &#x00A3;39 million. I have talked to Glasgow district councillors about the matter and it is clear that even with the full &#x00A3;52 million, not one new house will be built; all that money will have to be used for the redevelopment and improvement of the existing stock. Thus, no new sheltered housing will be available in Glasgow.<br/>
That &#x00A3;52 million includes the supposed sum that will come from the sale of council houses, but that is a myth. It is said that if one house is sold, another can be built from the money received. If properties that are occupied by elderly people are sold to those people, they are likely to have a long tenancy behind them and, when this measure is passed, they will receive the full 60 per cent, discount. In other words the council will receive only 40 per cent. of the value of the house, and it cannot build a new house at modern values on that basis.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman says that no new sheltered housing will be built in Glasgow next year. Will the housing associations be building any sheltered housing in Glasgow? A special allocation of funds is made to the housing associations specifically for building sheltered housing, and I can hardly believe that not one house will be built by them under the sheltered programme.</p>

<p>Some may be built by housing associations but they will not necessarily be available for allocation by the district council to those tenants whom the council believes require sheltered housing. In my constituency two areas have been allocated to the Hanover building association and one to the British Legion Association for sheltered housing, but neither body is able to start building because it does not have the funds. In other words, it is not just a question of the district council not having the funds to do this type of building; even the associations that are specifically there to build such houses do not have the funds to do so.<br/>
I was saying that, in the main, for the properties about which we are speaking the district council will receive only 40 per cent, of their value. Equally, in most cases, particularly when dealing with the elderly and retired who are seeking to purchase their homes, the loans that are given to purchase those houses come from the local authority. Thus, the authority does not make a net capital gain on the deal. On the one hand it is selling property at a low price and on the other is having to lend the money to enable people to buy. People over 55 are unlikely to obtain a mortgage from a building society, even though they must seek one in the first instance.<br/>
Therefore, it is not true to say that the local authority will get extra capital resources from the sale of council

houses with which to build more new properties. Indeed, it can be losing from its stock those houses that are needed desperately for elderly people who cannot afford the rents of bigger houses, who no longer wish to live in bigger houses but who wish to have the protection that is often provided in blocks of flats &#x2014; even those without any special arrangements &#x2014; because they are more secure than the normal tenement blocks.<br/>
In an area such as Glasgow, which has an ageing population, more and more people require this type of accommodation. It is a disgrace that while the local authority is being forced to sell off its houses, it is being restricted in the amount of capital available and is unable to build new houses to replace them.<br/>
I welcome the new clause because it would extend the existing provision and mean that more houses would be available, not just for the few elderly people who can afford to purchase them, but for the large bulk of tenants in council houses who are getting older and who require different accommodation. Further, if these properties are maintained within the housing stock, elderly people will come out of the three, four and five-apartment houses, so releasing them for the younger people who require them. That would make more sense than the blanket sale of council houses that the Government desire.</p>

<p>I see merit in part of the new clause. I listened with interest to the remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) but I should have thought that there was adequate provision for the needs of the elderly in section 1(11) (c) of the 1980 Act, which says:
<q>where a dwelling-house is one of a group which has been provided with facilities (including a call system and the services of a warden) specially designed or adapted for the needs of elderly or disabled persons.</q>
That means that some elderly persons' houses may not be sold, and presumably that would preclude the right of some elderly people to purchase their houses. It is our intention to give the elderly just as much right as younger people to purchase their homes.<br/>
I see some merit in the new clause in relation to the disabled. Where a local authority has provided a house for a disabled person, not only the district council but the social work department of the region will have subscribed to the finance that was necessary to make alterations to the property, such as the building of ramps, the widening of doors and converting the bath into a shower. Such houses should be retained.</p>

<p>This is the third time that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. McQuarrie) has got it wrong. We are debating a measure that amends the existing Act, which states that if ramps are built, doors are widened and other alterations are made for a disabled person, that property cannot be sold by the district authority. That provision was inserted in the original measure largely as a result of Opposition pressure. It would not be a bad idea if the hon. Gentleman had a quick look through the Act before making speeches on the subject.</p>

<p>I take no notice of what the hon. Gentleman says. If he reads the new clause he may get a bit of intelligence into his head because it refers to
<q>a dwelling-house &#x2026; which the local authority usually lets to elderly or disabled persons.</q>
I see merit in the proposal because of the inclusion of those words. I assure the hon. Member for Cathcart that I am


aware of what the Act says, having read it probably with more understanding than he did. I was a member of the Standing Committee and played an active part in those deliberations. Perhaps the Minister will explain the precise position of houses that are adapted for the disabled. Will they be released for sale or will they be restricted, in the way that the new clause proposes, and not be available for purchase?<br/>
If my hon. Friend can give us an assurance that housing for the disabled will be retained, I shall accept that that is what we are looking for. I do not subscribe to the view that the general ratepayers of any local authority, particularly in small local authorities such as mine, should be subjected to the expense of adapting a house for the disabled when that disabled person does not want to purchase the house and ultimately dies, leaving the house available. If the person has not purchased the house, a member of the family could do so. The new clause as it stands would allow the local authority to retain the house and refuse to allow the person to take possession. That is not contained in the Act and that is why I am asking for clarification. If my hon. Friend can give me that clarification there is no need for the new clause.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) introduced the new clause in his customary reasonable manner, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Henderson) pointed out, it is sweeping in its effects, as the speech from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) made clear. The hon. Member for Cathcart raised a number of related general points, in particular about the capital allocation to Glasgow. The capital allocation takes account of the point made about loans being provided by the authority, that individual authorities' estimates of income from receipts are adjusted to exclude sales where the authority provides a loan. However, in general, 95 per cent, of loans for council house purchases are made by the private sector. We are extremely encouraged by the way in which the financial institutions have risen to the challenge of the opportunity provided by the right-to-buy legislation.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart made a second point about rents in Glasgow. He did not make it clear to the House, although no doubt he will have an opportunity to do so, whether he is in the McFadden group or the backbench group that overruled the views of the executive and the officers in that debate.</p>

<p>No doubt the ratepayers of Cathcart will be interested in that information.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, North-East said, the new clause would remove the right to buy from elderly and disabled tenants and from anyone who happens to live in a house that the authority could claim was ordinarily let to the elderly or disabled. For example, someone who had inherited a tenancy from his or her parents would be denied the right to buy under the new clause. As a result, almost all one or two-apartment houses in Scotland might be excluded from the right to buy. As my hon. Friend said, the right to buy gives authorities extra resources to improve their housing stock elsewhere.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. McQuarrie) asked me to elucidate the provisions in the

existing legislation concerning the stock of sheltered and amenity housing for elderly and disabled people. I am happy to give him the reassurance that he seeks In the 1980 Act, sheltered housing is wholly excluded from the right to buy. If tenants were allowed to buy individual sheltered houses this would undermine the viability of such schemes, which will have been designed as a unit with a warden and services.<br/>
6.45 pm<br/>
My hon. Friend also asked about special needs housing, adapted housing, for the elderly and disabled, where the house did not form part of a sheltered housing development. The sale of such houses is not of immediate consequence to other tenants, but if such houses have been built and adapted with special features for elderly people, section 4 of the 1980 Act allows an individual authority to impose a pre-emption condition on the sale of such houses, which will allow the council to buy the house back, if it wishes, when it is for sale.<br/>
In addition, when an authority receives an application to purchase from the tenant of the house that has been specially adapted for elderly people, it can, as an alternative to imposing a pre-emption condition, make: an application to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State under section 3 A of the 1980 Act for his consent to refuse to sell the house. These provisions are working well; we have received no representations to the contrary.</p>

<p>One thing that has emerged from the debate is that, given that the number of houses roughly meets the number of families now, which is different from that in days gone by, there seems to be general agreement in the House that there is still a shortage of accommodation for elderly people.

<p>New clause 6 would safeguard the future of houses in rural areas that have been sold under the 1980 Act. It provides that the sale of a house in a rural area as defined in the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 should be restricted to applicants who have an interest in the area. The 1980 Act refers to applicants who are employed in a local authority area, or who will be offered employment in that area, or who wish to move into that area, or who are more than 60 years old and wish to move into the area to be near a younger relative or have special social or medical reasons for requiring to be housed in that area. In other words, houses should be allocated to people who have a direct interest in the area. That excludes people who merely want to spend their summer holidays there.<br/>
One of the problems that rural areas face is that they generally have fewer council houses so that if they are sold their availability for people who wish to move into the area is even more restricted than in more densely populated areas. In remote parts of Scotland only 19 per cent, of housing is owned by the council. In the north-east of Scotland there are a few areas where the sale of council houses has already created significant problems.<br/>
It is a pity that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Mcquarrie) has left the Chamber. [HON. MEMBERS:

"He has not."] I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. He has moved. He might be interested to know that if all the applications for council house sales in, for example, Gardenstown in his constituency were processed, 25 per cent, of council housing stock in the area would be sold.

<p>Yes. If all applications for council house sales around Turriff are processed, about 13 per cent, of the council housing stock there will be sold. The eqivalent figure for Peterhead is 6 per cent. In Gordon district, in the remote parish of Corgarff, only 33 of the 62 houses are permanently occupied. In other words, more than half are holiday homes. Only one council house is available. The constraints that I have mentioned significantly restrict local authorities' ability to meet local housing needs. It is important to emphasise that we are discussing the resale of council houses. Without the proposed safeguards we are in danger of allowing some remote villages to degenerate into mere holiday villages that are evacuated during the winter.</p>

<p>How many of the 13 per cent, of houses that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, bearing in mind the fact that, thanks to the Government, tenants enjoy security of tenure, would be available for rent? If tenants wished to occupy them, how long would they have to wait? The hon.

<p>We are worried about tenants who live in council houses exercising their right to buy and then selling them as holiday homes to people who have no interest in the area. New clause 6 would protect the community from the effects of such sales. We have allowed for such a condition to be waived by a local authority in special circumstances. I accept that there might be no demand for a house other than as a holiday home. Having it used as a holiday home is preferable to its being empty, but selling it for such a purpose should be a last resort. It is regrettable that such sales are frequently a first resort, as they provide commercial advantage to some people, although they do considerable damage to the community.<br/>
When the 1980 Act came into effect my local council expressed anxiety that, as a result of the expected sale of 3&#x00B7;4 per cent, of council houses, the hopes and desires of many people on the waiting list would be frustrated. Gordon district is well on the way to selling more than 12 per cent, of its housing stock. When I last spoke to the council I was advised that the number on the waiting list was substantially greater than the number of houses that had been sold. I do not object to the principle of such sales, but merely wish to highlight the fact that the consequence of the right to buy, without provision of safeguards for rural areas, is that waiting lists get longer and people who want the privilege of living in a council house and,


ultimately the opportunity to buy that house, are finding acquisition of such a home more difficult. That is regrettable.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman said that the number of houses that have been sold was roughly equivalent to the numbers on the waiting list.

<p>I do not have all the figures but I assure the hon. Gentleman that some houses have been resold as holiday homes. New clause 6 would prevent that.<br/>
Without additional safeguards, the sale of council houses as at present applied leaves many people on the waiting list with a longer wait. My local council made that point to me last week. It is having difficulty housing people. The Minister knows that my correspondence bag, unlike that of the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) &#x2014; perhaps because of the different needs of our local authorities&#x2014;is filled with inquiries about how to apply successfully for a council house. Since being elected I have received only one letter about the difficulty of buying a council house. The problem, as reflected in my post bag, is relevant. There are parts of the Highlands and Islands where the problem is even more acute. I hope that the House considers the new clause and I urge the Government to recognise the consequence of providing no such safeguards.</p>

<p>I view this new clause with the greatest concern. We have already&#x2014;albeit with some justification&#x2014;reduced the rights of one group of tenants to buy. The new clause asks us to force people who exercise their right to buy to sell only to a limited group of people. When I saw the new clause on the Order Paper, I wondered whether its supporters had read section 26(3) of the 1980 Act. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) made it clear that he had done so, which makes me even more surprised that he moved the motion. The new clause states that the only people to whom one is allowed to sell a council house are those who work in the area. That seems to be a reasonable group of people. Section 26(3) states that anyone who
<q>wishes to move into the area of the local authority and the local authority is satisfied that his purpose in doing so is to seek employment".</q>
The mind boggles as to how the local authority could be expected to deal with that criterion. What measures could the authority apply? How could a person demonstrate to the satisfaction of the local authority that the intention of the move was to seek employment?<br/>
People aged over 60 wishing to move to be near relatives may well be a category who should be potential purchasers of council houses, as are people with special social or medical needs. What about everyone else? What about those who want to retire to an area simply because they like the area? Are they to be denied the opportunity to purchase a house which formerly was a council house? [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes."] Opposition Members say, "Yes," and that is predictable. I expect such an argument from people who do not believe in the right to buy. These restraints make a nonsense of the right to buy and of what

will be the biggest investment in the lives of many of the council tenants who exercise that right. The new clause seeks to prejudice that investment and to undermine the rights of relatives of those people to dispose of the property' at the best possible price. This is an "all things to all men" clause. It is supported by people who mouth support of the right to buy but who in word and deed support measures that would seriously undermine that right.<br/>
We were told that the basic reasoning behind the new clause was to prevent the development and provision of holiday homes through resales. We were given many statistics, but not many on how many holiday homes we are discussing in Scotland. I suspect that there are precious few&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is revealing that one Opposition Member who put his name to the new clause does not even know how many council houses have been sold as holiday homes in his constituency. That seems to demonstrate the disingenuous attitude observed by hon. Members when the new clause was moved.<br/>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has been harsh about the drafting of the new clause. I have some misgivings about it.

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that information and for the opportunity to examine new clause 5 to which his name is attached. The new clause is surely not a triumph of drafting; it is so badly drafted that I would almost suggest to the Minister that he accept it because it would have no effect. The new clause states:
<q>This section shall not apply where the sale of dwelling houses situated within an area or community which is designated a rural area or community by the district or island council exceeds 25 per cent, of the stock available to rent".</q>
As the new clause does not define the date at which the stock is available for rent and each sale reduces the stock of housing available to rent, the new clause will never have any effect. It ill behoves the hon. Gentleman to draw attention to the drafting when he has put his name to new clauses which, although we understand their intention&#x2014; we know that the Opposition are against council house sales &#x2014; would have no effect. I am horrified that the new clause should come up at this late stage, when opinion


poll after opinion poll and election after election have shown that the Scottish people wish to exercise their right to buy.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) ought not be unduly worried about the number three because the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), as we came to know in Committee, thinks in multiples of three. We received 300 letters every time we had a meeting of the Standing Committee. A mistake was made in the new clause in putting down 25 per cent., instead of 33 per cent. If that had been done the hon. Member for Stirling would have fully understood the intention of the new clause.<br/>
We point out, as did the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), that the Government ought to note the problems that arise in rural areas. I say that as an hon. Member representing an urban constituency. Distinct problems arise in rural areas. Only yesterday, I obtained a reply from the Under-Secretary about the percentage of housing stock that has been sold. House sales in certain rural areas of importance run into percentages of double figures, whereas in most urban authorities they are less than 10 per cent. With local authority sales of more than 10 per cent, in Stewartry, Gordon and the Western Isles, the Government must take cognisance of the effect of that sales policy. In the new clause we are seeking to draw attention to that aspect.<br/>
There is a clear distinction between the new clause proposed by the Liberals which, as the hon. Member for Gordon pointed out, is about resales and our new clause which is about sales. Rather than try the patience of the House, and lukewarm as we are about the ineffectiveness of new clause 6, we would be inclined to give the new clause a measure of support if only to show that we share a common concern about the likely social and economic impact of the unrestricted sale of houses in rural areas.</p>

<p>I listened with great care to the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), the intervention from the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen). I speak with some authority. It could be said that north Tayside is a rural and a holiday tourist area and that the sale of council houses by Angus district council and Perth and Kinross district council is something of which I am proud. Indeed, Perth and Kinross district council have sold 1,586 houses. Angus district council has sold 1,005 houses.<br/>
I shall now quote comments from the authorities who allegedly should be troubled by what hon. Gentlemen have been saying. Opposition Members have been theorising; I shall now talk in practical terms. No great stress or difficulties have been caused in the rural areas of Tayside, North as the result of an aggressive policy of selling council houses. Those of us who served on the Standing Committees on both Bills giving tenants their rights know that these problems are in the rural areas. I never minced words in Committee and I never minced words during the election on my views about giving the right to everyone to be able to purchase council houses. It is interesting that in my own constituency the Labour candidate, who was opposed to the sale of council houses polled just over 2,000. Is that not staggering?<br/>
If hon. Members suggest that in Tayside, North we do not understand the problems of council house tenants, I have news for them. In the town of Forfar more than half the houses are council houses. To suggest that we do not understand such problems and the problems in rural areas is absolute nonsense. I think that Liberals and SDP Members should think through very carefully what they are asking for. To suggest selling a council property to a tenant who then resells it at some later date to somebody else who wants to buy it and to live in the area&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "AS a holiday home."] I do not care, frankly, if it is being sold as a holiday home. My constituency would fall apart were it not for people going there on holiday. Let me make it quite clear that the largest proportion of income in my constituency is from tourism and the large number of people who come on a transient basis are vital to the economy. Indeed, some of them even come to pick berries, and they, too, are vital to the economy. To suggest that there is something ghastly and wrong about it is nonsense. I hope that the Government will reject this, as I expect them to do.</p>

<p>I suppose that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is the only Conservative Member opposite from a Scottish constituency who can crow in the way he has just crowed because, as he will know from an article published in <i>The Scotsman</i> last week, with a bit of luck, he could be the only Scottish Conservative Member of Parliament left in the next Parliament. I found the argument he was advancing pretty alarming for his constituents. It sounded as if he would be happy for every council house in Forfar to be sold off as a holiday house. I cannot visualise that happening, but, even if it did, he sounded as if he would be quite happy to leave the house letting policy to the Earl of Strathmore. I suggest that the local education authority, whoever may be its members, is better placed to look after the needs of people who want to rent houses than is the Earl of Strathmore or any of the other gentry in the territory of his constituency.<br/>
New clause 6, moved by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), deals with the same problem as new clause 5, and I would be more inclined to support new clause 5. I suggest that new clause 6 goes about things in a rather complicated and relatively ineffective way. It does not seem the best way to try to regulate the disposal of houses by tenants who buy their houses in rural areas where there is a shortage of houses. It would probably be more effective to deal with the problem before it arises in the first place.</p>

<p>The hon. Member made an observation during the speech of the hon. Member for Gordon, and he quoted approximately half a dozen different organisations that wanted new clause 6.

<p>I know that the hon. Gentleman is an authority on stupidity. If the hon. Member could contain himself for a minute or two, he would begin to understand why I have misgivings about this approach to what I regard as a serious problem.<br/>
Apart from the fact, as the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) said, that this tactic would reduce the value


of the houses of some tenants who purchase them in certain areas &#x2014; and it would be discriminatory if this kind of condition were to be imposed on sales already taking place &#x2014; it would also be shutting the stable door after the horse has gone. The houses in question would already have left the rented sector for all time. This is one approach to the problem, but perhaps not the best. Hon. Members can weigh up the argument in the course of the debate. There is already one sort of posthumous safeguard, which would come into operation only when it is too late to do any good, in the form of section 4(6) and (7) of the 1980 Act.</p>

<p>The restrictions in the 1980 Act, and the fact that we are talking about the sale of council housing to sitting tenants, mean that the tenant buying the house in the first place is presumably resident in the area, but under the present Act he can then resell it. It is a little misleading, therefore, to suggest that the tenant in the first place is not resident.</p>

<p>I accept that this is one approach to the problem. However, I am not certain that it is the most effective way of going about it. As I have said, there is the proviso in the 1980 Act that says that when one-third of the housing stock has been sold and when the Secretary of State is satisfied that an unreasonable number of houses sold have become second homes, then and only then can the Secretary of State make an order, subject to approval by Parliament, designating the area in question as a rural area where certain restrictions can be applied to the disposal of houses sold to tenants. I understand that even those restrictions apply for only 10 years. I do not think that that safeguard and the other one discussed in the debate go far enough.<br/>
In small remote communities where there may be very few houses to let in the first place, where the open market sale prices and private sector rents may be grossly inflated by demand for holiday accommodation, where incomes of people seeking rented accommodation may tend to be very low&#x2014;and I think that applies to all rural Scotland-the situation for people seeking houses to let has always been difficult. I believe that it is getting worse, however, in the long term because of the way in which the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 operates.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way. It surely is a non sequitur to suggest that any tenant who buys his house in a rural area will sell it on to a holiday maker or some such person. If Opposition Members are going to bring forward these new clauses, they must do a great deal more than merely chunter about the possibility of such sales. They must lay before the House facts and figures to justify the fear that the sale of council houses in rural areas will result in tenants selling them on to people who wish to have holiday homes. I have heard no evidence from the Opposition to justify the hon. Member's contention.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that short speech. If he will contain himself a little longer he will hear my arguments. I do not say that every tenant who buys a house will resell it as a holiday home, but such a person is as likely as anyone else to sell to the highest bidder, who is most unlikely to be on the council waiting list.<br/>
As a significant number of houses are to be taken out of the rented sector through sales to sitting tenants&#x2014;a

trend which will no doubt accelerate as a result of the increase in discounts&#x2014;safeguards are provided, but they will have only a marginal effect and will operate only when more than one third of existing district council houses have become holiday homes. I represent a mainly rural constituency and I have some experience of the problem that is developing. I cite just one example&#x2014; Stenton &#x2014; an attractive village at the foot of the Lammermuir hills.<br/>
In October 1980, when this performance started, there were just 16 council houses in that village. The last breakdown of the situation in East Lothian, a couple of months ago, showed that five of those houses had been sold. The proportion sold is just short of the one third required to trigger the safeguard in section 4 of the 1980 Act, but we do not yet know how many of those properties will become holiday homes. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I wish that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst) would shut up. There is plenty of time. We have all night. The hon. Gentleman can make his own speech in his own time.<br/>
As I was saying, we do not yet know how many of those houses will be sold on to become holiday homes because the sitting tenants who bought them have not yet had time to move on and dispose of them. At this stage, the situation has not changed, but the time bomb is ticking away and there will be serious problems in the future. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) survives for long as a Member of Parliament for that area, which is unlikely, he will face the same problems to an increasing extent.</p>

<p>I am coming to that. Conservative Members seem to be getting very etched about this, but I have all the facts and figures. I wish to draw attention to the plight of the one individual and the six families now on the waiting list for a house in Stenton at a reasonable rent. That figure is thoroughly up to date, as I learnt from the Conservative councillor for that area on the telephone this evening. He is worried about the plight of those people. The whole House should be concerned at the plight of people waiting for houses as there is no more fundamental need for a family than a home of its own.<br/>
In Committee, the Minister constantly protested that council house sales made no difference to the problem because the tenants would have remained in the houses in any case. That is all very well in the short term. The problem arises when the occupier disposes of the house. If he had remained a council tenant the house would have been offered to the next person on the waiting list for rent, but that will not happen. The house will be sold to the highest bidder. In Stenton, as in so many similiar villages in rural Scotland, the next purchaser will probably be a commuter or a person seeking a holiday home. There will


be no hope for the young local family seeking a first home to rent. The problem will take a long time to build up, but it has already been identified as a serious one and it is bound to get worse. Conservative Members representing rural areas of Scotland will have to face the damage that they have done.<br/>
The problem exists throughout Scotland. Many people predicted that there would be more sales in the attractive rural areas, and that trend was confirmed in statistics given by the Minister in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) on Monday. They showed that the percentage of housing stock sold has reached double figures in only five areas&#x2014;Stewartry, north-east Fife, Gordon, Kincardine and Deeside and the Western Isles, all almost entirely rural areas. In those and other rural areas council housing always represented a smaller proportion of the total housing stock than in other areas so the high proportion of sales represents an even greater relative loss of accommodation to rent than might appear at first to be the case. I have illustrated the point by citing the case of Stenton, but I could give many other examples.<br/>
The Labour party has been worried about this problem from the outset. In its briefing paper to hon. Members, Shelter cites the Tweeddale district council's housing plan and the Scottish Consumer Council report on the same subject. It also quotes a leaked report from the Scottish Office dated 1979, before the problem began to build up, which stated that in rural areas
<q>many people are not able to command income sufficient to meet their basic housing needs in the private sector and reliance on the local authority as a major force in adequate housing provision will continue.</q>
If that is the official information, one wonders why the Scottish Office seems content to see a continuing rundown in public sector housing in rural areas.<br/>
In addition, district councils in rural areas find it difficult to replace the houses that they are forced to sell, due to a combination of two factors&#x2014;the higher cost of building in remote areas and the Government's unremitting squeeze on capital allocations. That means that there is and will continue to be a rundown in public sector housing in Scotland. As I said in my intervention in the speech of the hon. Member for Stirling, Rural Forum is also worried about the problem. That is an umbrella organisation set up by the Scottish Council for Social Service, including a wide range of organisations. I shall give the whole list.</p>

We are passing legislation to give people the right to buy their council homes. Whether there are resales in 10, 20 or 30 years is a matter for a future Government. The people who are purchasing council houses in rural areas are the existing tenants, who are most unlikely to leave their homes. Any houses that are being purchased as holiday homes in the rural parts of my constituency are in places like New Aberdour, where dilapidated cottages are being renovated. The rural area is being repopulated in that way but not by taking over council houses and reselling them as holiday homes. I do not see that happening in my constituency.</p>

The new clauses have been conceived by the organisations quoted by the hon. Gentleman. They were not conceived by the hon. Members in whose names they stand. It has been obvious during the debate, when pertinent questions were put, that the people other than the Labour Members in whose names new clause 6 stands, did not have the requisite information to enable them to answer those questions.</p>

<p>Will not the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the 1980 Act has been in operation for three years but because our proposal has not yet been accepted we have no machinery to find out what happens to council houses after they are sold to the private sector? Therefore, unless the Government are prepared to commission research to find out how many are resold, we shall not know unless the new clause is accepted. To challenge us for not having the information is unreasonable.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member knew his constituency well enough he would know how many of the council houses had been resold. He would know the people who are in them and could assess what kind of people had bought them. I am sure that in Gordon district not one solitary house of the 10 per cent. of council houses sold since the 1980 Act has been resold as a holiday home. I know part of that constituency, as the hon. Member well knows, because I gave him quite a portion of it in the redistribution.<br/>
I shall not detain the House further because I do not consider that either of the new clauses merits further debate. I shall oppose them wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>We have had an entertaining, if not an enlightening, debate. I am always intrigued by the knowledge the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. McQuarrie) displays of his constituency.<br/>
I want to deal with the balance of probability. Up to the moment, because the compensation that would go back to the authority would penalise people if they resold, the balance of probability, particularly in areas where there has been a reasonably stable population, is that it is unlikely that houses have been resold as holiday homes. It would be difficult for my hon. Friends and other hon. Members promoting the new clause to give statistical information.<br/>
What is emerging is that on balance of probability the provisions of the 1980 Act will have a more severe impact in rural areas than in urban areas in terms of changing the population. It is difficult to support new clause 6 because I do not see how we could embark on that type of amendment. However, there is merit in new clause 5, in which the Labour party is saying that the Government should examine the provisions of the Act in relation to sale rather than resale.<br/>
There is an obligation on the Secretary of State and the Scottish Office to investigate over a time the impact of the 1980 Act on the changing balance of population in rural areas. I understood the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) to say that the benefits flowing from the legislation are marvellous and that he does not care what happens when council houses in Forfar are resold. That approach is too broad-brush. According to the hon. Member, if all local authority houses were sold to tenants and then resold as holiday homes the economic impact would be&#x2014;</p>

<p>If I am interpreting wrongly what the hon. Gentleman said, I apologise. He gave me the impression that he did not care whether all local authority houses in the public domain in Forfar were resold and became holiday homes because holiday homes and that type of accommodation were extremely beneficial to his area. I hope I am not misquoting him; I understood from him that his constituency would collapse if it were not for people coming in for recreational and holiday purposes. That might be beneficial to the cash flow but the sociological impact would be enormous in a place like Forfar. I would not regard my constituency as a rural area but the sociologicalimpact would be great if that happened in places such as Kincardine.<br/>
If the Minister resists the new clause, he should say what surveys he will carry out through his office into the impact sociologically and on the balance of population, particularly in rural areas, of the resale of council houses.<br/>
If people look for houses to rent in rural areas, but local authorities are prohibited from building houses because of the housing support grant, there is an obligation upon the Government to say how they would subvent local authorities which find that a large number of previously publicly owned houses are left vacant because they are holiday homes. That has a sociological and social impact.<br/>
I suspect that the Minister will resist the amendments, but I hope that we shall be able to persuade him that he has some obligation to take up the suggestion that has been made &#x2014; which, I believe, has the support of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce).</p>

<p>Having listened to some of the almost theological arguments from Conservative Members, I think that I should clear up a couple of misapprehensions. I am happy to give the SDP's support to the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce). The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was right when he said that we are debating a theoretical point. The hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) fairly pointed out that the legislation had not existed long enough for its effects to be fully known. That is a legitimate point with which I would not disagree.<br/>
I take issue with the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. McQuarrie)&#x2014;I am sure he will not be surprised about that &#x2014; who seems happy to make a decision tonight and to leave it to Governments in 10, 20 or 30 years' time to deal with the consequences. What worries me about the scheme and the possibility of resale is what might happen within that time in an area such as the Highlands of Scotland which is distinctive and has particular problems. It has been at the receiving end of the policies of Labour and Conservative Governments to attract the type of tourism and inward investment about which the hon. Member for Tayside, North spoke, and which I support, and to maintain an indigenous local population. It must be acknowledged that we are discussing the resale of council houses &#x2014; the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) may not have been clear about the distinction&#x2014;because I must make it clear that the SDP-Liberal alliance in Scotland, as much as south of the border, supports the right to buy. There is no equivocation about that. However, once people have about exercised that legitimate right to buy, the Act should provide for monitoring of the resale of council houses. In the Highlands, we face indigenous decline, economic recession and depopulation, and have done so for a long time. That is why I believe that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan is perhaps misguided when he says that we should not worry about what will happen in 30 years' time. That will be a significant period in the Highlands because many of the problems we face go back longer than 30 years.<br/>
Decisions taken here will have far-reaching consequences for the Highlands for a long time. They will not be the problems that one could expect a Government in 30 years' time to deal with. When a problem needs Government action to solve it &#x2014; we are talking about depopulation and large numbers of empty houses being used only for a few months of the year&#x2014;it is almost


impossible to cure without draconian measures. It is a theoretical debate, but it raises serious principles. The Highlands have legitimate anxieties which deserve to be aired.<br/>
One talks to district and regional councillors and people who live in the Highlands, whose family background is there, and they confirm that one of the basic problems is that young people are moving out of the area because there is nothing there for them. Also, as the population becomes older, the available housing, whether private or council, which has been sold to sitting tenants, becomes more and more&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am not. The housing becomes more attractive for people to purchase. The problem is impossible to quantify. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan may be right; we might have to wait 20 years or 30 years to see the effects of the legislation.<br/>
The fact that there is genuine anxiety means that it is right that the matter should be debated in the House. If the Government do not accept the amendment, I hope that, none the less, the Minister will say what steps the Government will take to monitor the position, because it could become serious.</p>

<p>We have had an entertaining and useful debate on these two clauses. It is not a new debate, because we have had it on a number of occasions previously. It was rehearsed fairly fully in Committee. I am sure that if the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has anything to do with it, we will have it again.<br/>
I welcome the opportunity to make clear once again for the benefit of Opposition Members&#x2014;I made the point over and over again in Committee, but it did not seem to get through although it is a simple concept-that houses that are sold are not lost to the housing stock. If tenants were not allowed to buy their own homes, there is no evidence that they would be likely to move away. Every time Opposition Members make such assertions I ask them to produce the evidence. They return time after time and make the same assertions, but when pressed they have no evidence to show that there is any truth in what they are saying. If the great majority of people who buy their own houses had not been able to do so they would have continued to rent them, often for a considerable number of years, whether they were in urban or rural areas.<br/>
The hon. Member for East Lothian has mentioned the village of Stenton on many occasions. I recollect it from my short association with that area. When he first mentioned it I said to myself, "The hon. Member might have difficulty finding out what is happening in the large urban conurbations because the numbers may be a little beyond him. In Stenton, the numbers are small. As a Member of Parliament he will be able to find out the facts about particular matters." He has found out one thing. He has told us that five council houses have been sold. He makes a dramatic issue of that. However, when we asked him to tell us how many of the houses have been resold,

he said, "I cannot." If he is prepared to make an assertion on low figures he should at least have the basis of those figures correct.<br/>
When the hon. Gentleman raised the subject of Stenton before Christmas, I challenged him to say how many of those houses would have become available for his waiting list had the right to buy not been available. Four weeks later he returns to the Chamber and makes the same speech, but he still cannot give us any information. He must learn that if he is to put forward an argument and claim that there is strength behind it he must back it with facts. Otherwise the Conservative Benches will get tired of listening to what he has to say.</p>

<p>I apologise to the Minister for intervening in his speech, but as I am in the Chamber I shall take this opportunity to do so. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will address his mind to the real question, which is what will happen to the houses that will be sold when the present occupiers move on? Does not the Minister accept that such houses will be sold to the highest bidder, and will not be available to anyone on the council house waiting list?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman asks me to speculate, so I shall say that the house may be sold to the highest bidder. For all I know, the hon. Gentleman's house may be sold to the highest bidder. On the other hand, he may decide to leave it to his family, as may the owners of these houses. The hon. Gentleman must realise that it is unsatisfactory to look that far into the future to try to draw definitive conclusions from pure speculation.</p>

<p>No, I must get on. We have spent much time on the debate, and I want to cover some of the points raised.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North made the point better than I possibly can. He represents a rural area where the district council has pursued an agressive sales policy, but where none of the problems that Opposition Members keep theorising about have appeared. That is the proof of the pudding. The evidence produced by my hon. Friend, as the constituency Member for a rural area, should be taken into account by Opposition Members.<br/>
Another point that is worth making, but which is often ignored, concerns the point that Labour Members accuse us of removing houses from the council stock and leaving local authorities without the means to do anything about it. But those houses are being sold, albeit at a discount, to realise receipts for the local authorities. District councils should consider using some of the additional money released through sales to reduce council house waiting lists.<br/>
I listened closely to the argument of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) on new clause 6, which he tabled. Every time I hear him on the subject he argues in favour of council house sales but has reservations about selling them. Perhaps it is a typically Liberal stance to be for something in theory, but frightened of it in practice.<br/>
The objects of new clause 6 are rather different from those of new clause 5, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen). New clause 6 ensures that houses sold in rural areas are not subsequently resold to persons who do not have a direct


interest in the economic wellbeing of the area or other, social, reasons for wishing to live there. The clause aims to ensure that the houses are not subsequently resold as retirement homes, holiday homes, or as houses for those commuting to work in neighbouring areas.<br/>
I can see no justification for the new clause in relation to sales of former council houses to retired persons and commuters. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who suggested that it is plainly unfair to make such restrictions.<br/>
The position in rural areas is no different from that elsewhere. I have already said that the sale of a council house does not reduce the overall housing stock of an area, and has little or no effect in the short or medium term on the availability of houses to rent. A tenant who does not buy is likely to continue paying rent.<br/>
With regard to sales of former council housesas holliday homes, I still believe, as I said in Committee, that the 1980 Act already does all that is necessary to prevent many former council houses in rural areas being sold as holiday or second homes.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang), who is silent by dint of his office, tabled an amendment to the original legislation because he foresaw some of the difficulties. His amendment was accepted by the Government, and is now part of the Act. Section 4(6) and section 4(7) of the 1980 Act enable the Secretary of State to make an order permitting authorities to impose pre-emption conditions on sales of houses in rural areas, provided that more than one third of the council houses in the area have been sold, and that an unreasonable proportion of the houses sold have been resold as second homes.<br/>
During the passage of the 1980 Act, we took the view that the likelihood of substantial numbers of council houses being resold as holiday homes was remote. Our experience since then, which has been backed up by some of the speeches made by my hon. Friends, has not caused us to alter that view. To date not one authority has approached us to suggest that the conditions have been satisfied and to ask for an order to be made under section 4(6). Perhaps that is one of the most powerful arguments against the case made by the hon. Member for Gordon.<br/>
I suggest, therefore, that the problems that hon. Members have suggested arise in rural areas are more imagined than real. They have not been substantiated by facts. The new clause is unnecessary. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw his new clause and that he has listened to the hon. Member for Maryhill, who paid him a backhanded compliment, as the Labour party often does, saying that he would support the new clause as it was ineffective. I hope that the hon. Member for Gordon will realise that that is not necessarily the best reason for proceeding with such a new clause. I hope that the hon. Member for Gordon will ask leave to withdraw his new clause. If not, I must ask the House to reject it, and new clause 5.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This is really a probing debate. Had the Minister met the conditions of the 21-day rule which he was proposing in respect of landlords' response in the consultation document, we would not be debating this new clause now. As the Minister knows, I wrote to him during the recess, asking for his comments on the representations which had been put to him last month by the Scottish Council for Single Homeless in respect of the situation facing those with shared tenancies. The council is concerned that a situation may have arisen where a shared tenancy in a public sector dwelling would not be secure because it would not fulfil one of the three criteria set out in the original legislation.<br/>
As I understand it from the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, formal opinion of counsel has been obtained in respect of Edinburgh council to the effect that if a district council or housing association lets a flat to two or more persons on a sharing basis there can be no secure tenancy. It may be that the Minister will be able to clarify this matter. He has had these representations from the Scottish council. I wrote to him in advance of today's debate and it will be interesting to hear what he has to say.</p>

<speech hansard_id="221774" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.382.7" hansard_membership_id="1766" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29822" speakername="Mr. Hugh Brown" colnum="382" time="19:45:00">
<p>The Minister will probably agree the no organisation that makes representations to Government attracts more sympathy than the Scottish Council for Single Homeless. That genuine and sincere organisation has always cared for the problems associated with single people, and increasingly such problems affect a larger proportion of the population. More and more young people now leave home and form new relationships, but it is slightly misleading to think that all the single homeless have problems.<br/>
In our attempt to use a shorthand phrase, there is a danger that we are unclear about which groups are affected. I merely ask the Minister to show some sympathy for this problem, which should appeal to his philosophy on the extension of tenants' rights.<br/>
I do not seek to create difficulties for housing authorities, but several problems spring to mind. There is a need to modernise and rehabilitate multi-storey flats. The Minister will probably be aware of the Red road flats in Glasgow, the Westercommon flats owned by the SSHA in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for


Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) and the sale of Martello Towers in Edinburgh. Those examples suggest that we should consider how we can better use multi-storey blocks. Perhaps in future such accommodation can be shared by several young people, students or whoever. We should at least pay attention to a problem that may well develop.<br/>
We are all in favour of releasing as many people as possible from mental hospitals, and I am sure that the Minister is well aware of the good work done by some authorities that have introduced group tenancies. However, that presents problems for the DHSS as no one person holds the tenancy.<br/>
There is common agreement in the House that such groups should be treated as sympathetically as possible. We should certainly consider whether those involved in group tenancies have individual rights, although as my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill said, counsel opinion seems to be that they do not.<br/>
Another group that springs to mind, which unfortunately does not attract the concern of the public, is offenders who are being resettled. There is at least some justification for demonstrating to the Scottish Council for Single Homeless that we are aware of the problem. Hopefully, we can approach this matter in a genuine, non-partisan manner. Such problems are real and we should show some sympathy and understanding.</p>

<speech hansard_id="221775" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.383.0" hansard_membership_id="543" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2331" speakername="Mr. Ancram" colnum="383" time="19:45:00">
<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) for the way in which he made his remarks. I shall deal with some of those points later.<br/>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) has not yet received a reply to his letter, but he must appreciate that over the holiday period the impeccable timing of my Department is not quite as tight as it normally is.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman expressed concern about certain aspects of the existing law and reflected the concern of the Scottish Council for Single Homeless. In particular, he was concerned about security of tenure as it relates to shared tenancies.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I am not able to provide an authoritative interpretation of statute, because that is a matter for the courts. it may, however, assist him and the House if I outline my view of the present position.<br/>
Shared tenancies typically involve the granting of a tenancy to a group of people &#x2014; usually unrelated &#x2014;occupying a single house. Normally, tenants have a bedroom of their own and share communal living accommodation. In general, that is standard and typical.<br/>
Such shared tenancies can be constituted in three different ways&#x2014;first, through a head tenancy, where one of the group is the tenant and the others have the status of lodgers or sub-tenants; secondly, through a joint and several tenancy, where all members of the group are joint tenants; and, thirdly, through group tenancies where all members of the group have individual tenancies.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
The position with regard to security of tenure is relatively straightforward in relation to the first two ways of constituting a shared tenancy. In the case of a head tenancy, the one tenant has security of tenure and enjoys all the other rights that comprise the tenants' charter, and

the other members of the group, in common with other lodgers or sub-tenants, do not enjoy any of the tenants' charter rights.<br/>
In the case of a joint and several tenancy, each and every member of the group is a secure tenant in the same way that a husband and wife who are joint tenants both have security of tenure. Those two categories are relatively straightforward.<br/>
Where, however, the shared tenancy is constituted by several persons, each of whom has an individual tenancy, I admit that the position is not quite so clear. My advice is that none of the tenants has security of tenure, as none of them satisfies one of the necessary conditions for a tenancy to be a secure tenancy&#x2014;that the tenancy must be a tenancy of a dwelling house which is let as a separate dwelling. This is true even where sharing tenants have exclusive use of one bedroom, as that bedroom is not itself let as a separate dwelling. Rather, it is let as a dwelling in conjunction with the shared use of the other communal facilities in the house.<br/>
Our view, therefore, is that tenants who occupy shared accommodation on the basis of an individual tenancy do not have security of tenure. Moreover, I consider that to give them such security in the absence of a much more thorough review of the role and status of such tenancies could cause more problems than it would solve. That is something of which we should be careful. It could, for example, lead to a situation where all the tenants have a right to buy all or part of the house irrespective of the wishes of the other members of the group. That would cause great problems.<br/>
The granting of security of tenure to such tenants could also undermine current attempts by some authorities to provide short-term accommodation in shared tenancies for special groups. The three groups that I intended to mention are the same as those referred to by the hon. Member for Provan&#x2014;the single homeless, the mentally handicapped and ex-offenders.<br/>
This is something of which we should all be cautious. To create security of tenure could undermine some of the important attempts to give such people short-term accommodation, which by its nature must require no security of tenure. After all, such accommodation is usually provided on a short-term basis in an effort to assist the person in question establish or re-establish himself within the community, and it is essential to the success of such schemes that authorities retain control over who occupies the accommodation available and how long they remain there.<br/>
I appreciate that uncertainty exists in this area, but I do not think that the suggestion of the hon. Member for Maryhill is a solution.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the Scottish Council for Single Homeless was concerned about the right to a house, not the right to buy. I know that security of tenure under the Act gives the right to buy, but that was not the concern of the council. It was pressing for some security to be given to some of the individuals involved in these group tenancies, for example, under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act.</p>

<p>I appreciate that. The new clause was framed in this way because the Bill involves security of tenure and the right to buy. When security of tenure is created, one of the benefits that it brings is the right to buy.


Bearing in mind what I said earlier, great problems and difficulties could be caused for the type of person whom the hon. Member for Provan is seeking to help. I hope that the hon. Member for Maryhill will withdraw the motion.</p>

<speech hansard_id="221778" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.385.0" hansard_membership_id="2909" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13723" speakername="Mr. Craigen" colnum="385" time="19:45:00">
<p>I note what the Minister said. We are not dealing with a simple matter. From what the Minister said, the Scottish Council for Single Homeless has cause for concern. It appears that the right to buy is cutting across the right to a secure tenancy, as we heard from the Minister's response.<br/>
I accept the Minister's apology for the delayed correspondence. I teased him about the timing of his reply and he will recall my remark about the 21-day rule. He assured me that Christmas and the new year came within the 21-day period, so some working days were available to complete the reply that I requested. It would be useful to know whether the Minister will discuss the issue with the Scottish Council for Single Homeless. I am sure that the council does not wish matters to remain as they are. If I received such an assurance, I would beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

<speech hansard_id="221785" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1984-01-18a.386.0" hansard_membership_id="2909" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13723" speakername="Mr. Craigen" colnum="386" time="19:45:00">
<p>We made it clear in Committee that we are in favour of a right to have repairs carried out. There is no doubt in my mind that those hon. Members who have public sector housing within their constituencies accept that genuine complaints and dissatisfaction exist about the repairs service. There is a need to strengthen cyclical and planned maintenance in the public sector. It is important that we achieve improved management of our housing stock, but that involves increased resources to housing authorities to enable them to carry out their responsibilities. Where landlords have responsibilities for repairs, it is essential that they carry them out.<br/>
The Minister did not fully answer in Committee the question about the extent of planned maintenance programmes in Scotland. He told my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) that a university research project is examining local authority housing repairs. If the Minister would speak to some tenants&#x2014;I do not encourage him to go into public houses&#x2014;he would learn more than the university researchers. I see that he is nodding. It is important for him to learn on the spot about the problems that tenants face and not rely too heavily on academic research.<br/>
I am worried about the tremendous cutbacks in resources in real terms to Scottish housing authorities since the Government came to office. Since 1979 the figure involved in real terms is &#x00A3;125 million. The cuts put a tremendous strain upon the maintenance and repair budgets of our housing authorities, and it is exceedingly difficult for many to carry out their proper responsibilities.<br/>
I do not intend to dwell at length on some of the major issues. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the housing authorities to eradicate the problems of dampness, to tackle asbestos stripping and removal and the structural problems in industrialised buildings that were put up in the 1950s and 1960s. Those factors are part and parcel of inadequate funding faced by local authorities in carrying out their legal obligations as public sector landlords.<br/>
When dealing with new clause 2 in Committee, we faced the problem of considering enabling legislation. It was based on reports that the Government were to receive at the end of last year&#x2014;a consultation document called "A Right to Repair". The closing date for the submission of opinions was 31 December. The consultation document was not circulated as widely as it should have been.<br/>
I said in Committee that Glasgow district council did not receive a copy of the document until the shadow Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) gave it a copy. The closing date for responses from COSLA members was the end of November, which telescoped the procedure. The Minister has suffered from not having a sufficient background in local government affairs. Had he known more about the way in which local authorities operate when submitting views, he would have realised that they have a cycle of meetings. If one meeting is missed, a month must elapse before a further meeting can take place, but perhaps he expected councils to have special meetings to comment on such an important consultation paper.<br/>
Will the Minister give a preliminary report on the response that he has received? Few people have had a good word to say about the consultation paper. If the scheme is enacted, many tenants, when they look at the close print, will consider that they have been sold a pup. That is why it is important to enshrine in statute the right for repairs


to be carried out rather than be short-changed by accepting the present right-to-repair scheme that the Government embodied in their consultation paper.<br/>
I shall not detain the House by dwelling for very long on some of the pertinent points which were raised in Committee about the way in which effective repairs should be performed. We were worried that the scheme might exclude the elderly and people on low incomes. Such people would be troubled by having to pay for repairs and waiting to be reimbursed. We were worried because full reimbursement might not take place and that there may be a sliding scale from 75 per cent. to 100 per cent.
8.30 pm<br/>
The Government argue that tendering is good practice. I am surprised that the consultation document did not say that tendering was expected for minor repairs. In the building industry it is elementary to seek estimates for repairs. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) is as busy as ever. He gave me a list of housing authorities and their supplies and appliances. The mind boggles at the number of items that have to be kept in store. Will local authorities operate a type of Unipart service? Will they have to publish prices for items such as sinks or window frames so that others who put in tenders have that knowledge? Many practical considerations are involved.<br/>
The need for insurance cover is an alarming prospect for tenants who opt for do-it-yourself repairs. In Committee we discussed health and safety regulations which we believe to be important. It is strange that a Conservative Minister should in Committee suggest that if repairs are not carried out tenants should withhold their rents. It is strange that the Minister should reiterate that.</p>

<p>I do not wish to take the debate outwith its scope, but my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxon) is correct. By altering housing benefits legislation the Government will make many tenants worse off, but we shall have the opportunity to debate that important matter on another occasion.<br/>
We must encourage local authorities and other housing authorities to improve their planned maintenance and cyclical repair arrangements. The Government are falling down by the measures that they are taking and the funding that they are denying housing authorities for repairs.<br/>
For emergency, essential and routine repairs the Government should rely upon an improved delivery

service by housing authorities which, as landlords, are legally responsible. The Minister may contradict me when discussing the consultation document, but problems arise whether repairs are left to do-it-yourself Indians or fly-by-night cowboys.<br/>
The Committee discussed common repair schemes, but inevitably problems will arise in relation to gas, electricity, rewiring and dry or wet rot if the Government are not careful in the way that they engineer the right-to-repair scheme.<br/>
Our greatest worry is that parts of public sector housing are slithering into slumdom. The evidence is available. The Minister shakes his head, but he does not see the communities that Opposition Members see. The Minister denies it, but he is wrong. The facts are indisputable. Local authorities are experiencing more and more problems in keeping housing stocks in proper order. That used to be true of the private sector. I acknowledge that house improvement grants have helped, but the Minister has decided to cut and run on that issue. The evidence is of a deterioration in public sector housing stock. It is essential to establish a right to repair by the landlord and a proper repair delivery service.</p>

<p>My impression is that the House agrees that repairs are not always done as well as they might be done. If the standards of the better local authorities were applied universally we should probably not have to discuss this legislation today. Unfortunately there are substantial variations in the quality of repairs and the way in which they are carried out. I shall not pursue any political guesstimates about which local authorities are best at handling repairs. The general desire in the House is to provide tenants with the right of repair. The differences come to light in the way it is carried out and in the way it affects different people.<br/>
In Committee and again tonight, Opposition Members have said that certain categories of people &#x2014; they instanced poorer people&#x2014;might not benefit from some ways in which the right to repair might be carried out. Surely that is not a good argument against proceeding with the right to repair, if sensible schemes can be devised.</p>

<p>If many people benefit from it, the fact that not every person benefits is not an argument in itself. There is no reason why we should not try to meet all the problems. Indeed, poorer tenants should get their repairs done anyway. If some of the pressure on local authority maintenance departments is reduced by the right to repair scheme, it is more likely that the tenant who wants repairs done by the local authority will find that the local authority provides that service more effectively.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is wiser than I thought. He was a member of the Committee with me, and I thought that he had grasped the whole point of his Government's consultation document better than he apparently has.

<p>I do not understand what is puzzling the hon. Gentleman. At present tenants should have their repairs carried out. If it is convenient and sensible for the tenant to arrange his own repairs, at no cost to himself, that


is surely a good thing. If that releases resources in the local authority to provide a better service for all tenants, that is surely a good thing.<br/>
Reference was made in a pejorative way to fly-by-night operators coming in. Certainly no one would want to encourage such operators in the real meaning of the word, but that does not mean that individuals or small firms cannot provide a competent and adequate service. If there is a retired joiner living in the area who can carry out minor repairs, it would be of great benefit to him, as well as to other people, for him to do those repairs. That would avoid involving the great bureaucratic process. Opposition Members may describe that joiner as a fly-by-night operator, but I would regard him as providing a useful service.</p>

It is important to get the right to repair right. We all know that it will not be easy to get a comprehensive scheme absolutely right first time. It is therefore all the more important that at each stage of the evolution of my hon. Friend's scheme he consults as widely as possible, including the House, so as to get it right. I would find it most acceptable, perhaps on an Opposition day, at any rate at some point, to have an opportunity to debate the scheme either on the Floor of the House or in the Grand Committee, before an order is placed in the House. That will help hon. Members and will help to produce a scheme that will provide not only the right to repair that we want tenants to have, but will ensure that it defies the Jeremiahs of the Opposition who do not appreciate that a competent Government can produce schemes to meet difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>I support the right-to-repair principle, but I wish to speak specifically to amendment No. 4, standing in the name of the leader of the Liberal party, myself and my Liberal and Social Democratic colleagues. I accept that the amendment has been included in this group of amendments because the thrust of its argument is similar. The matter was discussed thoroughly in Committee, but it was not satisfactorily resolved. That is why my colleagues on Second Reading tabled an instruction, which regrettably was ruled out of order, that increased funds should be made available to cover such a scheme. The fact that the Government propose that this scheme, of which we still do not have full details, is to come out of existing local authority budgets &#x2014; which, as we all know, are severely constrained&#x2014;has encouraged me to table the amendment, which would enable local authorities to protect their own repairs policy and to ensure that the less

privileged tenants in local authority housing do not suffer disadvantage as a result of the introduction of a scheme that gives tenants rights to repair.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman will listen to the argument, he may get my point. If there is a fixed amount of money and a new scheme is introduced, particularly if that scheme proves to be successful and popular, it means that the tenants who take advantage of the scheme effectively reduce the amount of money that is available to the local authority to carry out repairs under other schemes &#x2014; for example, a sensible planned budgeted maintenance on a section of its own housing stock, which many good local authorities rightly regard as the basis of good housing management. The fact that its budget has been distorted by the requirement to carry out repairs could cause considerable difficulties, both in budgeting and planned maintenance programmes. That is my colleagues' first concern about the likely effect of the scheme &#x2014; should the scheme be effective, and we assume that the Government intend to bring forward a scheme which they believe will be popular and widely taken up.<br/>
That brings me to my second point. For tenants who are in a position to take advantage of such a scheme, clearly the scheme is a good one, but, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) pointed out, what about those tenants who are on low incomes or on social security benefit, who are simply not able to fund, even for a short time, the cost of such repairs? If they are told by their local authority, "We are unable to carry out your repair because our budget has been exhausted by the tenants' right to carry out repairs scheme", those people will be at a considerable disadvantage, and they will have to wait even longer for repairs to be carried out than they would otherwise.</p>

<p>Because the money would have been committed to those tenants who have taken advantage of the scheme that the Government seek to introduce. It is a simple point that Opposition Members seem to have no difficulty in grasping, although Conservative Members seem to find it very abstruse.<br/>
I said in Committee that I do not object in principle to a scheme such as the Government propose, but I am concerned that the Government have produced no safeguards for either local authorities that wish to carry out planned maintenance programmes or for tenants on low incomes who cannot take advantage of the scheme. It is therefore reasonable to allow local authorities to limit the proportion of their budget that would have to be committed to such a scheme so that they can plan to use the remainder of their budget to meet the requirements of tenants who want repairs to be carried out, specifically to be paid for by the council, and to carry out their own planned programmes.<br/>
That recognises that good housing management requires budgeting. The Government are not allowing those councils to plan but are requiring them to run the risk of a system that is not controlled but is at the whim of individual tenants. If that becomes the only system, or the bulk of the system, the whole programme of maintenance


will be severely disrupted. As requests that the Minister should carry out a pilot scheme have been refused, I hope that he will publish a more detailed draft scheme before laying orders before the House.<br/>
Local authorities should have the right to limit the proportion of their budgets that are allocated to the scheme, at least until it is seen how the scheme works, so as to protect their plans and to protect those tenants who will not be able to benefit from the scheme, as so far outlined, because they will be unable to afford to do so.<br/>
I will not detain the House longer because I am sure that the thrust of my argument is clear to, and is accepted by, Opposition Members, who perhaps have less difficulty then some Conservatives in understanding how councils manage their housing budgets.</p>

<p>The way in which the scheme will affect people on low incomes should receive the careful attention of the House. In a caring society, people living in council properties enjoying social security benefit&#x2014;properly enjoying such benefit; I am not arguing against that&#x2014;and who are thereby obtaining relief on their rates and rent, may find, in view of the discretion that exist in this sphere, that the social security departments are funding these repair activities, and I would not object to that. After all, social security is an avenue of housing revenue. Going into council rent coffers are substantial sums especially when over 50 per cent. of tenants are enjoying benefit. If that were extended to repairs, councils and tenants could benefit substantially.</p>

<p>A number of hon. Members have had consultations during the Christmas recess on some of the issues that arise out of the subject under discussion, and I am sure that the Minister appreciates that we wish to make a constructive contribution to the debate, though it is a shame that we are constrained by the time factor. We are discussing an important part of the Bill.<br/>
Although the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was a member of the Committee, he was either ill or out of the country at the time; I will only say that he was missed from the Committee. It is clear, possibly because of his absence on those occasions, that he does not understand the position. Perhaps the Minister will gently remind him that there is no question of the DHSS being involved in the matter. I understood the Minister to give an indication in Committee that contractors would have to wait until the housing authority paid the bill, so ensuring that nobody was out of pocket. A statement to that effect might clear up some of the misconceptions of various organisations.<br/>
The proposed new clause is our alternative strategy, so to speak, to what the Government propose, and it comes straight from the Labour party manifesto, unlike some of the other proposals that we have been discussing. It is marvellous to be able to speak without official responsibility for my statements; I confess that I did not think that the way in which we would put into effect the principle of giving a right of repair had been well thought out. "Right of repair" is a nice-sounding phrase, but while I am in favour of the principle, I am more concerned to gee up some housing authorities that should be performing better in terms of repairs. There is general recognition of the fact that the service of repairs for most council tenants in Scotland, irrespective of who runs the authority, has not been good, and hence our concern.<br/>
As a result of the consultations that I had, I persuaded a community council in Easterhouse to sponsor a seminar. I did not try to influence that gathering. I simply supplied information so as to focus minds on the subject about which comment was invited in the consultation paper. I made no effort to sell or oppose the scheme. About 30 delegates were present, representing a variety of organisations, and they were unanimously opposed to the whole concept. If that sounds depressing, perhaps it means that more education should be given on the subject.<br/>
The representatives came from various organisations, including the local Communist party and street committees. I discovered that there was acceptance of the advice of the Scottish tenants' organisations, although it was wrong on perhaps six points out of eight. I am not against the Scottish tenants' organisations &#x2014; local authorities must have somebody with whom to discuss matters&#x2014;but there has been a failure on the part of the Scottish Office to educate people into understanding some of the thoughts behind the scheme.<br/>
As I said in Committee, I do not know where the idea of the scheme originated. There had not been a great demand by any local organisations for it, so how the Government came to think it up escapes me. That is why, when representations were made by the various organisations to which I have referred, there was unanimous opposition to the idea. Although Glasgow district council, in the evidence that it submitted on the document, did not come out and say that it opposed it, that evidence was so full of criticism that it was obviously not a popular concept.<br/>
I am sure that the Minister will take on board the spirit in which we are discussing this issue. I accepted his assurance that before the regulations were drawn up, opportunity would be found, through the usual channels, to discuss the matter. If the Government are determined to go ahead with the proposal, they should at least provide opportunity to enable us to discuss the final form of the scheme in the light of all the opposition that has been forthcoming. It is clear that some of the comments that have been made have come from people who either do not understand what is proposed or are deliberately misinterpreting the scheme.<br/>
I understood the Minister to say in Committee that nobody would be out of pocket unless he chose that course, and that if it was a do-it-yourself job, people would be able to buy materials. If someone went through all, the procedures as outlined and then got the contractor to do the job, the payment would be made by the authority within a certain specific time, so that the tenant would not be out of pocket. I am either right or wrong about that, and the Minister will tell me.</p>

<p>The basic principle is correct. The hon. Gentleman will know that I said that a tenant would be able to enhance the type of repair being done if he wished to pay for it out of his own pocket. Those would be the circumstances in which they would not receive the whole grant.</p>

<p>I accept that. There is a clear implication that if a tenant wants to do something extra, that is his responsibility and the Minister is right to make that qualification, which I understand. The basic principle is that no one should be out of pocket. I am not arguing for the scheme, but saying that there is no point in our


repeating misconceptions that people have that the poor person or somebody on social security will not be able to take advantage of the scheme. That should not arise. It is not an argument for the scheme but a point of clarification.</p>

<p>I at least pay attention to what the Minister says, and if I criticise a scheme I know what it is. If there is someone on social security who wants a job done, my understanding is that the contractor will need to take on board, just as he would with anybody else, the fact that he might have to wait for six weeks for the bill to be paid.<br/>
I feel a little resentful at times about my inability to convince even the Scottish tenants' organisations. I tell them that we have raised a matter, but they now have a point in the submission that is wrong. I do not understand whether this falls into the category of people deliberately not wanting to understand the scheme. The scheme is not popular. It may be that with education and a bit of advice people might understand it better.<br/>
I give the Minister a word of warning. The real problem that emerged from an area such as Easterhouse was the concern about jobs in the direct labour organisation. This is not a partisan point. That department has gone down from about 6,000 people to about 4,000, and apprehension was expressed that if too many private or do-it-yourself jobs were done that could have a serious effect on the viability of a department that is now operating under an Act that imposes conditions on it. I am not arguing for or against, but pointing that that was a real concern and one that the Minister will have to take on board because it is part of the opposition generated to the scheme. I do not think that the scheme will make much difference, but I hope that there will be further opportunity to discuss it if the Government go ahead.</p>

<p>It is difficult for those of us who did not serve on the Committee to be able to discuss schemes that have not been properly brought to our attention. That is rather like putting the legislative cart before the horse. The Government should have issued a consultative document before legislation was introduced, obtained comment on it and then built that comment into the Bill so that all those who have participated in the process would know exactly what the Government had in mind and whether the scheme stood any chance of success.<br/>
I have found that the standard of repair work in my area has worsened in the past year or so. There is probably no single cause for discontent among council tenants worse than waiting for repairs to be carried out. That is particularly so if they are promised repairs by housing inspectors but when representatives of the DLO come

along they are told that the DLO will repair some things but not others, which the tenants had thought that the housing inspector had passed for maintenance.<br/>
I spoke earlier about tenants being treated like pawns but there is probably even greater frustration among tenants who know that things are wrong with their houses&#x2014;draughts come whistling through windows that are broken, doors may be insecure for days if not weeks&#x2014;and there is insecurity among the tenants who have to put up with such conditions.<br/>
There has been silence on this today, but as far as I can tell from constituency correspondence there has been a shortage of fitments. Repairs are promised, but it is suggested that materials are out of stock. That excuse seems to have been more prevalent in the past year or so than previously, although I am sure that there will always be a problem if there is a sudden run on a particular fitment which must be put into a house. Local authority housing departments need always to improve management, coordination and liaison so that when repairs must be done they are done promptly and to a reasonable standard of workmanship.<br/>
If that criticism of shortages exists, we must address our minds to the scheme that the Government might have in mind. The hon. Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Henderson) seemed to see no problem for the poorer tenants who might have difficulty in financing repairs until money is available from the housing departments. No assumption can be made that if, because of the requirements of bureaucracy or otherwise, a voucher or receipt is passed into the housing authority a payment will be made immediately so that the tradesman is paid off. It may take weeks, if not months, for that to happen.</p>

Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce)&#x2014;that a problem could occur if the scheme were an outrageous success. I am not in a position to determine whether that is likely. If it were a success, there could be a rush to carry out repairs which had been accumulating over weeks, if not months. In that case, there would be a run on local authority budgets set aside for housing repairs. Local authorities are required by central Government to budget. They do not receive any additional money to meet repairs coming out of sequence, which can occur.<br/>
We have just had an example of such a rush. The Government's scheme on the 90 per cent. grants for improvement was so successful that the amounts being expended increased to not tens but hundreds of millions of pounds. That occurred to such an extent that the Government became alarmed and had to cut the grants to


50 per cent., and a freeze was put on. The scheme could work on a much smaller scale. If it proves successful, repairs will be carried out.<br/>
What happens to the remainder of tenants who might in normal circumstances want to have their houses repaired? Money will not be available and they will have to wait, even though some of the anticipated repairs might be more urgent than others carried out under the Government's scheme.<br/>
I followed the suggestion by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) about the DHSS advancing money.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is now suggesting that the DHSS will not advance any money. I should have thought that it would be most unlikely that the DHSS would accept any local government obligations or lend money for a period. That could leave in difficulty tenants who are on supplementary benefit. Many of the properties that tenants occupy are not in a good state of repair and are running down. There is a question mark over the scheme.<br/>
New clause 14 is simple. It says:
<q>It shall be the right of a tenant under a secure tenancy to have repairs to the dwelling house carried out".</q>
That first part of the new clause is a contractual right that tenants already enjoy under the terms of their lease from the local authority. The new clause continues:
<q>under procedures agreed by each landlord and its tenants.</q>
I am not sure what the new clause adds up to. The caveat in amendment No. 4 suggests that there should be a limit on the amount of funds available under the scheme to local authorities so that there is some cash left over for other tenants who wish to go through the usual procedure of having repairs to their houses carried out by their landlords. That is a common law right. I am not sure that the drafting of amendment No. 4 is sufficient to deal with the problem. However, that should not provide the Government with an excuse. If they find that there is a point to the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Gordon, they should reword the amendment appropriately.<br/>
I am dissatisfied with the details of the scheme that have been made available to us. It is one of those ghastly examples of amateurish legislation. The Government have jumped into something but have not worked out exactly what they intend to do.</p>

<p>I am pleased that we are debating an issue which affects a large majority of council house tenants rather than something such as the sale of council houses, which is of concern to a small minority. Repairs are the second most common problem which are brought to my surgery. The most common problem is house transfers. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) tells me that earlier today he heard me speak for the first time in four and a half years. I wish that he had not come here to hear me a second time.<br/>
The third most common problem that arises in my surgery is one to which Conservative Members never address themselves. Far worse than the problem of repairs to council houses is that of people who live in private rented property. It is always much more difficult to tackle those problems than to approach the local council. As often as not, I have to get the environmental health

department to come in and put an order on the landlord if those repairs are to be done. That is not necessary with local authorities. Perhaps Conservative Members should think a little more about private landlords and a little less about attacking local authorities and council house tenants.<br/>
I listened with considerable interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown). I was not a member of the Committee and he clarified for me many of the things that have worried me about the scheme. One of the reactions that we are getting from community councils such as those which I have consulted in my constituency, tenants' organisations and other organisations that represent council house tenants is generated by the fact that there is complete distrust of the Government's housing policy. Even if such people suspect that there is something in the Government's scheme, their reaction, knowing what the Government have done to them through housing policy in the past four and a half years, is to say that if the present Government are putting something forward, it must be wrong. I can understand that reaction. My hon. Friend the Member for Provan is right to say that tenants will not have to pay for repairs. Local authorities will have to bear the cost of them within six weeks. I think that presumes that it is an undisputed repair&#x2014;in other words, that the local authority, having got the repair done, agrees it was necessary and that the work done is up to the standard required. If there is a dispute about it, presumably it could take considerably longer than six weeks before payment is made.<br/>
9.15 pm<br/>
I know that my hon. Friend's reaction will be that it is not the tenant who has to wait for his money, but the builder. How many building companies &#x2014; some hon. Members opposite used to be in the building business themselves&#x2014;are prepared to wait on an indefinite basis to get their money? Building companies have cash flow problems. A smaller company particularly can readily go out of business if it does a fairly major repair for a tenant which comes into dispute and drags on, because the company cannot continue to operate if it does not have the necessary cash. Hon. Members opposite who have been in business will appreciate that point.</p>

<p>The hon. Member says that it is a judgment for the business man, but then one comes back to the basic objection. In the case of the poor tenant who cannot afford to pay anything to the builder, the builder, knowing that he will have to wait six weeks to be paid, will make the judgment that he will not carry out the repair because there is no guarantee that he will get his money within a reasonable time. To the tenant who has the money, the builder will say, "You pay me and claim it back."</p>

<p>I think that we all know which party dominates that organisation, and sometimes we all have our doubts about it. The fact is that we do represent people, though I accept that they should have taken the


points and got them right. As I said earlier, there is suspicion of the Government's housing policy. Builders might make judgments that result in a fallback to exactly the same position as previously.<br/>
A further problem with the scheme is the inability under the proposals for the local authorities to make planned work schedules as to what they going to do, which areas they will tackle for major repairs, how they will tackle emergency repairs and how they will lead through and carry out minor repairs. That seems to be the central argument against what is essentially a haphazard way of doing repairs. Glasgow has undoubtedly &#x2014; and quite rightly&#x2014;been one of the district councils most criticised for its repairs, but over the past two or three years it has at long last begun to put proper planning and managerial schemes into operation. At the point where Glasgow is now beginning to get it right and to get schemes worked out, it is hit by the Government in two ways. First, it is hit financially. Glasgow is finding it very difficult to carry out repairs because it does not have the money to do so, even though it would wish to do so and even though it has worked out schemes.<br/>
The second point arises from the introduction of this scheme. Tenants from a specific area&#x2014;this is likely to be on an area basis at first, because people copy one another&#x2014;will get repairs done, money will have to be put in, and then it will be found that the local authority has insufficient money to continue with the repairs, which will hit the poorer tenants in areas like Castlemilk road and Drumchapel and Easterhouse.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. They, too, will be threatened. Moreover, the direct works department in Glasgow has in the past been one of the largest trainers of building trade apprentices. That function, too, will be threatened.<br/>
There is clearly a common concern about the fact that repairs are not always properly carried out, but there is a major difference of opinion about how the problem should be tackled. The Conservatives, as usual, wish to go for free enterprise at the expense of public enterprise but to the benefit of their friends in private industry.</p>

<p>I heard someone say "Oh, no!" as I rose to speak, but I am as entitled as anyone else to contribute to the debate. I am all for local authority tenants having the right to repairs, but the Government must face many responsibilities in this context.<br/>
Many houses in my constituency were built as a result of the encouragement given to Glasgow district council

and the old Glasgow corporation by various Governments since 1945. The designs of some of them are disastrous, but the blame cannot be laid entirely at the door of the local authority. When the corridor-type maisonette housing in my constituency was first built it was extremely popular, but once people spent a winter in it they found that dampness literally ran down the walls. Parents now tell me that their young children are suffering from bronchitis and asthma, so something must be done. It is desperately difficult in a city such as Glasgow to transfer people to the areas to which they wish to go, and the landlord has an obligation to ensure that the houses are kept dry.<br/>
By all means there should be a right to repairs, but does that mean that tenants can demand that the work carried out on their maisonettes or Bison flats in Springburn should completely eradicate the dampness? If that is not the case, the Minister is saying that tenants in those homes do not have the same rights as those in conventionally built houses. If the tenants have that right, however, it is unfair to leave the burden entirely with the landlord, either Glasgow district council or the Scottish Special Housing Association.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will bear in mind that throughout Glasgow and the west of Scotland many people are suffering from chest complaints and very bad health due to damp housing conditions. I hope he will tell us how he will eradicate the problem.<br/>
There are in my constituency multi-storey flats 32 storeys high. A simple thing like the repair of a window means that a squad of men have to get a cradle up the side of the wall before they can do the repair. I represent the highest part of Glasgow. If there is a strong wind, no work can be done. With the help of the Government, the local authority must consider the type of material that windows are made of so that they will withstand the inclement weather that we get in Scotland.</p>

<p>The speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) was different from the others in that it dealt with aspects of housing not covered in the new clause. The hon. Member referred to problems in certain houses in his constituency, and, indeed, in mine, which require capital expenditure. Bids have been made to the Scottish Office, and the provisional allocations that have been made have taken account of them. But the hon. Gentleman has come here today after his council has announced that it will not increase council house rents, although it knows that the likely result will be that the capital available to it will probably be reduced to pay the equivalent of the amount it transfers to its rate fund contribution. Therefore, perhaps the hon. Member should aim his remarks more to his councillors in Glasgow district council than to me.</p>

<p>Surely the Minister has missed the point I have made, that neither Glasgow district council nor its predecessor, the corporation, was entirely responsible for the non-conventional housing that was built in Glasgow. Government after Government, including Labour Governments, told local authorities such as Glasgow, who were in desperate straits in regard to housing, that if they did not build multi-storey flats and maisonettes they would not get the grants they needed to build houses. The Minister must face the responsibility. It is not a question of a local authority not putting up rents. The Government must consider the problems that they have caused for tenants in this type of accommodation.</p>

<p>I am sure I would be out of order, Mr. Speaker, if I were to go much further down that road, which is beyond the remit of the new clause and the amendments.<br/>
When he began his speech, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) was constructive and I was prepared to treat his speech as we had treated all contributions on this part of the Bill in Committee &#x2014;on the basis of consultation, because constructive ideas were put forward in Committee. Those consultations are all being taken account of in reaching a draft scheme.<br/>
I was saddened by the end of the hon. Member's speech, because he had been doing so well in terms of being constructive. Then he suddenly decided to launch into politics, which is perhaps not surprising in the House. However, the way he did so left a lot to be desired as regards accuracy. He said that Scotland was slipping into slumdom; I think that was the phrase he used. I should like to give him some figures. In the public sector &#x2014; I presume he was talking about the public sector &#x2014;improvements in 1979&#x2013;80 were 33,500; in 1982&#x2013;83 they were 49,900. I do not believe that that is slipping into slumdom. The number of houses below the tolerable standard fell from 113,000 to 82,000 between 1 April 1980 and 31 March 1983. I believe that that again gives the lie to the suggestion that Scotland is slipping into slumdon. I know that the hon. Member for Maryhill has held his present position for only a short time, but if he wishes to maintain his credibility &#x2014; credibility is, after all, important&#x2014;I hope that he will study the figures before he makes the type of statement that he has.</p>

<p>There are 82,000 houses which remain below a tolerable standard. The problem appears to be manageable when set against an improvement of 37,000 houses in the past five years. That puts the matter into context.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) made a useful contribution. I shall bear in mind a great deal of what he said in drawing up a scheme. He was correct to say that one of the things we must do is to publicise the scheme. I said in Committee that I would not just provide a summary of the comments made in consultations but that I would ensure that a draft copy of the regulations would be available for comment before they are formally laid before the House. I hope that in that way I shall allow hon. Members a chance to comment upon them before they are laid. As I said throughout the Committee, it is my intention to try to produce a workable scheme. I believe that the only way in which I can do that is by listening to the constructive comments that have been made.<br/>
The hon. Member for Maryhill raised this point, and I am sorry that I am not yet in a position to tell him the general lines of the submissions that have been made in response to the consultation paper. One of the reasons for that is that, although the deadline for comments was 31 December, some late submissions are still coming in. In particular, my Department will be meeting COSLA to hear its detailed view on the scheme. In the time available, the

convention could only submit its preliminary comments in writing. I am considering how best to make a summary of the comments available. It will be done as quickly as possible once they have all been received. I am sure that the House would not wish me to give part of the comments and perhaps get the context wrong as a result.<br/>
I have listened to the valid points that hon. Members have made and they will be taken into account in arriving at the eventual draft regulations.<br/>

<p>The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) asks who said that. The hon. Member for Provan made it clear that this came from the manifesto. I remember that in Committee he was the first person to point out that there had been a commitment to a right to repair in the Labour manifesto.<br/>
In Committee we had a full discussion of the principles behind this type of amendment. As I said, I sympathised with the aim of improving repair services offered to all tenants including those, who for whatever reason, are unable or unwilling to take advantage of the proposed right to repair. I am still not convinced that the amendments are the best way to achieve that.<br/>
New clause 14 provides that secure tenants shall have the right to repair carried out by their landlords. However, tenants, whether secure or not, already have this right under common law, as I am sure the hon. Member for Garscadden knows from his legal background. Where a repair is the responsibility of the landlord, his duty to carry out that repair must of necessity imply a right on the part of the tenant to have the repair carried out. I assume that, when read with amendment No. 6, the new clause is intended to give tenants the means of enforcing that right if the landlord fails to carry out repairs within a reasonable period. However, tenants already have legal remedies available to secure the carrying out of repairs that their landlord fails to do. I am prepared to repeat to the hon. Member for Maryhill the example of the tenants' common law right to withhold their rent and use the amount held back to pay a contractor to carry out the repairs.<br/>
Amendment No. 6 is intended to set out the procedures under which tenants may exercise that right. It provides that landlords must draw up a programme that will list the repairs for which the landlord is responsible, classify them according to their urgency, specify the time limits within which the repairs will be carried out and establish a method for resolving disputes. I hope that that is a fair summary of the amendment.<br/>
Tenants should, of course, already know of the repairs for which their landlord is responsible. They are defined in statute &#x2014; section 8 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966 &#x2014; and any additional repairing obligations are listed in their tenancy agreement. However, the amendment proposes&#x2014;this is novel&#x2014;that the landlord should be required to "prioritise" those repairs and state the time limits within which they will be undertaken. I have always followed the language of the hon. Member for Garscadden with much interest. Although I have consulted many dictionaries, I cannot find the word "prioritise" in any of them. I wondered whether that was a new Scottish word that he had discovered which was not yet included


in the Scottish dictionary. However, it is the hon. Gentleman's amendment, so I am not answerable for that word.<br/>
Presumably the intention is that the landlord should classify the repairs according to their urgency. However, it is left entirely to the discretion of the landlord to decide what time limits to set. Where the repair services are already unsatisfactory, there is no incentive on the landlord to improve.<br/>
The main objection to the amendment is that it fails to say what sanctions there will be for tenants if their landlord does not carry out the repairs within the time limits, which he will set. Admittedly, there is to be some vague machinery for resolving disputes, but that machinery is itself to be set up by the landlord, so it can hardly be considered impartial. There is to be no penalty or sanction against landlords who fail to meet their undertakings. Therefore, the amendment has no teeth. It is largely a presentational exercise and adds little or nothing to tenants' existing common law rights.</p>

<p>If the amendment is the flesh on the bones of the Labour manifesto and has no teeth, perhaps that is the best sign so far that the Labour party has not changed.<br/>
We have adopted a different approach in our right-to-repair scheme. We believe that it is desirable that tenants should be given a general right to carry out repairs themselves and to be repaid and that that will meet the wishes of the many tenants who are able and, indeed, anxious to get the work done themselves. It is consistent with our aim of giving tenants as much freedom as possible to live in their own homes in the way they choose and will be a significant addition to the rights already available under the tenants' charter, including the right to improve. It seems strange that the right to improve should exist but the equivalent right to repair is not available.<br/>
To provide that landlords must set themselves time limits within which they will undertake to carry out repairs is a much less useful provision from the tenants' point of view. It is already open to landlords to undertake to carry out certain repairs within specified time limits on a voluntary basis. That might be commended as an example of good practice. This group of amendments, however, which leaves the most important details to the landlord, could be successful in improving repair services only if the provisions have the wholehearted support of the landlord. Even the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) might feel that in certain situations he could not put his hand on his heart and say that he would get that from his own district council. However, where such support exists, a statutory requirement is unnecessary. Where such support does not exist, the provision is likely to be ineffective. Unlike the Government's proposed scheme, the amendments would add nothing of substance to tenants' existing rights and I hope that the Opposition will withdraw them. If they will not, I must ask the House to reject them.<br/>
Regarding the amendment put forward by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), I listened carefully to what he said in its support. Again, I believe it to be misconceived. He expressed concern on two, points which he had also made in Committee. The first was that the

introduction of the right to repair would lead to an overall increase in an authority's expenditure on management and maintenance. The second was that the right-to-repair scheme could lead to a situation where an undue proportion of the resources available for expenditure on management and maintenance would be required to make statutory payments to tenants who carried out repairs under the scheme.<br/>
As I indicated in Committee, I consider those concerns to be unfounded. Under the proposed scheme, as the hon. Member may recall from the consultation document, tenants will be entitled only to carry out repairs that are necessary and would otherwise be the responsibility of their landlord. The scheme will not, therefore, result in authorities having to pay for any repairs that they would not have had to carry out and pay for in any case. The type of repairs that we are looking at are inevitably reasonably small. We discussed in Committee the type of cost limit that would be put on them. They would be short-term to medium-term repairs that would, in any case, be carried out by any responsible authority within the course of a financial year. In such circumstances, unless the authority has been dilatory in carrying out repairs that were necessary, I do not see why there should be any effect on that authority's budget.<br/>
I recognise that some authorities have argued that it will cost them more to administer the scheme, but that depends very much on the arrangements that they adopt. I must say again that the experience in some of the English schemes suggests that an authority may well make savings on its expenditure on management and maintenance. Similarly, because the right to repair will not alter an authority's financial responsibility with regard to repairs, the introduction of such a right should not pose any insuperable problem for authorities in making adequate provision in budgets for all necessary repairs.<br/>
I hope that, given these views, the hon. Member will reconsider carefully the points that he made, because his fears seem to be groundless.<br/>
Having said that, I return to the point that I made earlier. I wish to see the right-to-repair scheme work. I am prepared to listen to constructive comments. The principle has been accepted by the House in the Second Reading of the Bill and I believe that, given the constructive approach adopted by many people outside the House, we shall have, when we lay draft regulations before the House&#x2014;which I have said I will make available before that&#x2014;a scheme that will be workable.</p>

<p>There was a slight air of unreality about this debate in having the Under-Secretary lecturing us about credibility and showing a certain unwelcome determination in going to the very end of a very long and complicated script that had obviously been given to him.<br/>
Of course we are all united in the wish to improve services where repairs are concerned. We all accept that there are very real problems here, largely due to inadequate resources and funding. I do not want to run through the arguments at any length. The scheme that is at the moment in draft and that we have had an opportunity of looking at still seems to many of us to have quite considerable difficulties in terms of the practical administration of a right-to-repair scheme. Certainly all the advice that I have had, not just from district councils but from other professional people in housing management, suggests that there will be a great administrative on-


cost which will increase with the rate of take-up of the scheme. I believe that there will be very considerable problems for those who have to administer the scheme in terms, for example, of arguments about which jobs fall within the ambit of the scheme, inspection before and after work is carried out and half a hundred other problems referred to extensively not just today but much more fully in Committee.<br/>
Let me make it clear also that, like my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), I have done my best to consult in my local area not just the Glasgow Forum of Housing Associations and the Glasgow Council of Tenants, to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) and I have talked. In my own constituency, the community councillors in Knightswood, Drumchapel and Temple, areas very much affected in the west of Glasgow, feel almost unanimously that, although it may be a worthy objective to try to improve the repair service, this is in many ways misconceived in its approach. There is an understandable feeling that there is a sort of escapism here and that it is an attempt to get round the fact that, as a look at the housing support grant figures and housing finance in general shows, the problems are very much to be laid at the Government's door.<br/>
We would like to find the right solution. The Minister was good enough to say that he had a great deal of sympathy with the objectives of new clause 14. He went on&#x2014;and it is always possible to do this in complicated matters when one is in Government&#x2014;to make a large number of points about the way in which the spirit of new clause 14 had been translated into actual amendments. That is no doubt true, and no doubt it contains many faults. We hold to the view that tenants should be given the right to have repairs carried out and that they should be given the means to do so. It is in support of that principle that we hold to new clause 14 and the associated amendments, and invite the House to divide in their support.</p>

This fairly simple technical amendment provides for transitional provisions to coverclause 2, on the same basis as most now approved for clause 1.

The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that regulations setting up the right-to-repair scheme may provide for disputes arising under the scheme to be referred to arbitration rather than the sheriff court.<br/>
When the right to repair was discussed in Committee, hon. Members on both sides expressed concern that tenants might be deterred from pursuing disputes before the sheriff because they might find the procedures involved complex or forbidding. It is clear from the wider consultations that many people who have been asked to comment on the scheme share these concerns.<br/>
The majority of disputes arising under the scheme are likely to be of a technical nature&#x2014;for example, over the adequacy of a repair or the appropriate level of payment. In Committee I accepted that there was merit in the suggestion that disputes of a technical nature might be settled by an independent arbiter, for example, a man of skill. I have tabled the amendment in response to representations. I hope that in the light of the acceptance that the suggestion found in Committee the amendment will be welcomed and approved.</p>

<p>I do not propose to detain the House long, but I spoke at length in Committee on the subject. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on agreeing to table the amendment. The amendment uses the words
<q>determined in such manner as the regulations may specify".</q>
May we have an assurance that when the draft regulations are introduced the Minister will have full details of the regulations?

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
Our election manifesto pledged us to extend the right to buy and also to strengthen the tenants' charter to give tenants a right to carry out repairs themselves and be reimbursed. The Bill fulfils those commitments.<br/>
May I say to those Opposition Members who are making such a noise that I have sat in this Chamber since 2.30, and until about half an hour ago I had not noticed that the requirement of haste had been met in any of the speeches that came from those Benches.<br/>
Under the Bill's provisions we have increased the maximum discount which long-term tenants may receive under the right to buy, from 50 per cent. to a new level of 60 per cent. after 30 years. We have acted to replace the landlord's discretion to count time spent as the child of a tenant&#x2014;a discretion which a number of landlords had not operated fairly&#x2014;with an obligation to count such time.<br/>
Throughout the Bill the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) and his colleagues have made clear their opposition to these changes. I wanted to say a few words because, since Second Reading, I have been asking the official Opposition to tell us their position on the sale of council houses. I am now told by the hon. Gentleman who is the shadow Secretary of State for Scotland that I am not likely to get that information tonight. Having gone through a Bill of this nature, which is of such importance to council tenants, it is quite amazing that the official Opposition are not yet in a position to tell us their policy on the matter. This dithering and havering by them gives a greater justification to legislation of this kind than I should have thought possible. It is for that reason that I believe that the Bill is a major contribution to our objective of enlarging choice in home ownership and extending the rights of tenants. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<p>If this little Bill is the fulfilment of the Tory manifesto, all I can say is that it is a hoodwinkers' charter. The majority of tenants that we represent are more concerned about higher rents and rent premiums than they are about the proposed increases in the discounts for sales.<br/>
The main concern during the course of the Bill was about section 17A and the enabling legislation. If the Government were as concerned about an alternative mechanism for the right to repair, I suggest that they ought to be introducing a scheme whereby those tenants who

want to carry out their own repairs are then enabled to send the bill straight to the Scottish Office for 100 per cent. reimbursement.<br/>
The consultation paper on which the enabling legislation is to be based is the big lie in Scottish housing. The scheme will continue the housing crisis and the lack of confidence in housing circles and will do very little for Scottish tenants.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the draft Undertaking between the Secretary of State for Scotland and The North of Scotland Orkney and Shetland Shipping Company Limited and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which was laid before this House on 19th December, be approved.</q>
The Government's commitment to ensure the social wellbeing and prosperity of the island communities in Scotland has been amply demonstrated over the past five years by our policy of increasing materially the level of support for sea transport services. Revenue support has increased threefold since 1979 from &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;2 million to &#x00A3;12&#x00B7;3 million in the current year. Over the period we have not only increased support but widened the coverage of support payments, most notably to include the services to the north isles.<br/>
In July 1979, the House approved an undertaking between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the North of Scotland Orkney and Shetland Shipping Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the P and O Steam Navigation company, the purpose of which was to enable my right hon. Friend to make revenue payments to the company to allow it to reduce fares and tariffs on the arterial scheduled services between Orkney and Shetland and the mainland. Under that undertaking almost &#x00A3;6&#x00B7;6 million was paid in the four years ending in March 1983. In the current financial year payments are likely to total &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;2 million. The reductions currently in force are a 30 per cent. rebate on return tickets bought on the islands and a 15 per cent. rebate on all other tickets. Northbound freight traffic is eligible for a 15 per cent. rebate while southbound freight traffic receives a 50 per cent. rebate. The differential rates for freight subsidy reflect the wishes of the islands councils. In addition, the transport of bulk freight to the islands by coastal shipping companies is eligible for assistance and several shipping companies currently have undertakings with the Secretary of State under which the shipping services they provide receive support, which is also passed on to the customers in the form of rebates on tariffs.<br/>
The vessel that provides the main passenger and vehicle ferry link between Lerwick and Aberdeen, the MV St. Clair, is now almost 20 years old. Although the vessel was not built specifically for this route, it has given sterling service over a number of years and is generally held to have served the community well. Because of the age of the St. Clair, the company has been considering what steps need to be taken to ensure that the Shetland Isles continue to receive an adequate service in the future.<br/>
To build a new vessel of comparable size to the St. Clair would cost at least &#x00A3;20 million. The revenue that could be earned from the service would be quite inadequate to fund such an investment. An alternative possibility would be to acquire another, but newer, second-hand vessel, but the company would find it difficult to justify investment of the scale required to carry out this option now. A third option, given the suitability of the St. Clair for the Aberdeen-Lerwick route, is to carry out a major refit and programme of enhanced maintenance on the vessel to extend its useful working life by up to 10 years. An independent technical

examination of the St. Clair has confirmed the feasibility of such a life extension, and the Government and the company have concluded that this option represents the most cost-effective means of securing the continuation of an adequate sea transport link between Aberdeen and Lerwick. It is, of course, in the fare-paying public's interest as well as that of the company and the taxpayer to achieve the most cost-effective solution.<br/>
The full cost of the refit will be about &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;2 million. In addition, there will be extra maintenance requirements that would cost a further &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million over a 10-year period; a total bill of some &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;5 million. The revenue generated by the service could not meet those costs in full. and the company has, therefore, sought assistance from Government. We consider that the extension of the life of the vessel represents a practical means of securing the continuation of this essential service at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer. We therefore propose, subject to the approval by the House this evening of our draft undertaking, to offer the company assistance of up to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million towards these exceptional costs.<br/>
The life extension work falls into three parts. First, there are costs attributable to extraordinary annual maintenance because of the age of the ship. Secondly, there are engineering and other renewals to meet contemporary standards. Thirdly, there is major refurbishment of passenger accommodation.<br/>
The company will meet the full cost of the additional annual maintenance of the vessel. The Government propose that grant equivalent to 75 per cent. of the actual cost of the engineering renewals should be made available. The works include new engine crankshafts and liners, stabiliser housings and items such as facilities for disabled people and the refurbishment of the galley and crew accommodation to contemporary standards. In addition, we propose to meet 45 per cent. of the cost of refurbishing the passenger accommodation. The works will include the installation of 23 additional two or four berth cabins, each with en suite facilities, the modernisation of existing passenger cabins and refurbishment of passenger public spaces and the modernisation of the restaurant and cafeteria areas. We believe that with these improvements the St. Clair will provide a first-rate surface link between Aberdeen and Shetland and should also, incidentally, provide an additional attraction for Shetland's tourist industry.<br/>
The present undertaking between the company and the Secretary of State to which I have already referred enables my right hon. Friend to reimburse the company for the cost of the reductions in its charges to users. The draft undertaking which is the subject of this evening's debate is based on the current undertaking and I do not therefore propose to go through it in detail. The differences are in paragraphs 7 to 9 which contain provisions to enable the Secretary of State to make advances to the company by way of capital grant. Paragraph 8 limits the amount of capital grant payable in any case to a maximum of 75 per cent. of the actual capital expenditure to be incurred by the company. Paragraph 9 provides that capital grant will not be payable until the facility in respect of which it is paid has been brought into use except that instalments may be paid in advance.<br/>
The draft undertaking is laid before the House under section 2(3) of the Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act 1960. The Act empowers the Secretary of State to make grants to shipping operators in the Highlands


and Islands but obliges him to lay a draft undertaking before Parliament and to seek the approval of this House if he proposes to make a grant of more than &#x00A3;10,000. In this case, as I have said, revenue and capital expenditure, to be made available in the current year will amount to some &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;5 million. That sum will be met from existing public expenditure approved by Parliament in the Roads and Transport (Scotland) Vote.<br/>
I understand that the arrangements that we have reached with P and O, subject to the agreement of the House this evening, to assist in the refurbishing of the St. Clair, have been generally welcomed in Shetland and I am confident that with the benefit of this refurbishment the ship will continue to provide an excellent service for the Islands. I commend the draft undertaking to the House for its approval.</p>

<p>The Minister has been looking at me across the Table for so long today that he probably wants to send me away on a long sea voyage. I hope that it will not be on the St. Clair, in view of the complaints that have been registered about it. I note what he said about the order, which seems to have been broadly accepted on the islands. However, this debate gives us a useful opportunity to comment and to question the Minister on other aspects of shipping services to the isles.<br/>
The undertaking subsidises the user rather than the operator. Nevertheless, there has always been a fair amount of anxiety over the lack of publicly available information about the money that is paid over in pursuance of the undertaking. With regard to the refitting of the St. Clair, in view of the Minister's comments about the vessel's extraordinary state I thought that we might be getting a right-to-repair consultation document. There is a substantial element of public investment towards this private sector company's involvement in the vessel's refurbishment. Local opinion would prefer a completely new vessel. I should have thought that, if only to improve the fortunes of the United Kingdom's shipbuilding industry, there might be considerable merit in the Government responding in that way.<br/>
As the Minister has been keen to tell us today of his party's fulfilment of its manifesto, would he throw a little more light on the manifesto commitment of the Conservatives in Scotland in 1979 in respect of moves towards a road equivalent tariff? The principle of RET was well buttressed by the excellent report produced by the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Lambie) has gone back into the Chair of that Select Committee because I heard his praises sung in respect of the report on rural transport and ferries, and it worries me that that report may well be gathering dust in Government circles whilst the Government show a certain dragging of feet over the implementation of road equivalent tariff.<br/>
There is no doubt that the Highlands and Islands development board has been particularly keen on seeing the introduction of RET because it recognises with its responsibilities, the significance of transport costs on the economic and social landscape of the Highlands and Islands. I hope that the Government will make more positive moves here. They may get a slight nudge when

the Montgomery committee reports, I believe by Easter, on this matter. I am sure it is bound to touch on the issue of shipping services that are such a lifeline to our Scottish islands.<br/>
With those comments, I hope the Minister will be able to expand a little more and to reply to the points I have made on the wider issue.</p>

<p>I welcome this undertaking, which has been generally welcomed in the islands. I have relatively recently fought an election campaign in the islands, and, no matter how many issues were brought up, underlying almost all of them was that of transport.<br/>
The cost and the availability of transport is fundamental to the economic and social welfare of the islands. It is also fair to say that P and O ranks along with British Rail almost and our airport services, in that when people find transport does not quite fit their needs or they meet a hold-up or some irritation when making a journey the operator is a target for some criticism. When one takes a step back from an immediate problem, I think one recognises the valuable service that P and O has given and continues to give to the northern isles.<br/>
The Minister mentioned the various steps that it is hoped will be taken to refit the ship and the benefit that would provide to tourism in Shetland. I should also like to put in a plug for the Shetlands tourist industry. Not only will the better accommodation give my constituents a more comfortable journey to the mainland, it will encourage more people to go and seek out the delights of Shetland, not just for its natural beauty but also for the specialist interests it has to offer various holidaymakers.<br/>
With regard to the Select Committee report referred to by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen), even at the time when the members of the Select Committee were wending their way by sea from Aberdeen to Lerwick on the St. Clair it was known that in the relatively near future some decision would have to be made about the future of the vessel providing that passenger service and, freight service in terms of whether there would have to be a new vessel or a major overhaul. The Select Committee in its report stated that a major overhaul could be only a temporary measure. It invited the Scottish Office, without any approach from P and O, to undertake its own cost-benefit analysis and to make a comparison between the costs of a new vessel, a secondhand vessel and a major refit.<br/>
Now that this proposal has come forward today I hope that the Government will not feel they have done their bit and can lose sight of the problem. I hope that they will continue to keep an eye on it. I hope that they will not necessarily wait for a further approach from P and O, but will monitor the situation and undertake the cost-benefit analysis recommended by the Committee, and at the same time looking into the possibility of a lease-back arrangement, which was another suggestion made in the report of the Committee.<br/>
This undertaking not only enables the Secretary of State to make the capital grants to P and O but reiterates the subsidy measures for freight and passenger charges. I do not wish to detract from anything that they have done in this regard since they came to office. While compliments are being handed out, it is also fair to say that it was the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Millan)


when he was Secretary of State for Scotland who took the initial steps towards providing help for the northern isles shipping, no doubt under great pressure from my predecessor. It was the present Administration who implemented much of the work done by the Labour Secretary of State.<br/>
These measures are of considerable benefit to the islanders, not only in reducing the cost of goods coming in but in decreasing the cost of exports from Shetland. As oil development goes over the hump, the native industries of Shetland, such as food production, fishing and knitwear, will depend heavily on relatively low transport costs for their exports if they are to prosper in the future.<br/>
I welcome the Minister's undertaking at Question Time today that a statement will be made about the subsidy for 1984&#x2013;85 in the very near future. I should welcome even more an assurance that there will be an increase in the subsidy. In the past few weeks P and O has announced its intention to increase fares and charges by 7 per cent. That is more than the general rate of inflation, but no doubt the company has to take account of the money that it will have to find for the refit. Nevertheless, in view of that increase, the islanders will be looking for a substantial increase in the subsidy.<br/>
The Government are committed to increase the subsidy over a period so that the phasing in of road equivalent tariff will not be such a big jump when it comes and I welcome the Minister's assurance that there will be a statement on RET before too long. I recognise that there are problems in deciding which formula to use and whether there should be a cut-off point, but when the previous undertaking was given on 25 July 1979 by the then Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), we were told that the Government were
<q>undertaking a thoroughgoing review of the present system of ferry subsidies. When this is complete, which we hope will be by the end of this year, it should be possible to say when and at what cost the Government can honour their manifesto pledge to move towards a road equivalent tariff for ferry charges."&#x2014; [<i>Official Report,</i> 25 July 1979; Vol. 971, c. 831.]</q>
The end of 1979 has been and gone, as has the end of 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983. We should now welcome a definite commitment to a date for the introduction of road equivalent tariff and specific information about the cost. The islanders will certainly be keeping an eye on the Government to ensure that that pledge is honoured and that it does not disappear, as did the pledge to abolish domestic rates, like snow off a dyke.<br/>
Finally, from time to time there are complaints&#x2014;I recall that towards the end of last year the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. McQuarrie) complained about this at Question Time &#x2014; about the amount of money spent on the Highlands and Islands. Quite apart from the citizen's right to earn a living and enjoy a comfortable lifestyle in the place on which he was born and brought up or to move to the islands if he wishes, it must be remembered that transport is quite heavily subsidised in many other parts of the United Kingdom. Many of my constituents own cars and pay the full road fund licence fee although they have very few miles of roads on which to operate. They do not have immediate access to hundreds of miles of motorway. We thus contribute to the national economy as well as receiving the subsidies involved in this undertaking. If the social and economic life of the isles is

to be sustained, measures such as this are vital. We are grateful for the present measure and look forward to a new vessel for the route in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) said that when inquiring from people in the Shetlands about the order he heard praise being heaped on the Select Committee for its work and on me as its chairman. I think my reputation at that time was enhanced because 1 was the only member of the Select Committee who was still standing when we entered Lerwick harbour in the morning after our journey from Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Not only had my capacity in whisky drinking equalled that of all the other members of the Select Committee, but I had also built up a tremendous reputation because I had managed to defeat even some of the councillors from Shetland who had accompanied us on the journey. I think that was the basis of our reputation, more than what we did as members of the Select Committee.<br/>
The new undertaking between the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Orkney and Shetland Shipping Company Limited replaces the one which has been in force since 1979. The need for a new undertaking is to enable the Secretary of State to make capital grants to P and O
<q>in respect of the acquisition, provision or improvement of a facility".</q>
The immediate reason for the new provision is undoubtedly the Government's decision to provide support of up to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million for a major refit of the Aberdeen-Lerwick vessel, the St. Clair.<br/>
When the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs undertook its rural road passenger transport and ferries inquiry in 1981&#x2013;82 it made some relevant points in paragraph 81 of volume 1 of the report; we stated:
<q>However, the return on capital employed by P&amp;amp;O Ferries on the service is comparatively modest, and anxieties were expressed to us that the costs of vessel replacement might eventually lead P&amp;amp;O to withdraw from the service. When we travelled on the <i>St. Clair,</i> which dates from 1965 and is principally used to provide a passenger and roll on/roll off service between Aberdeen and Shetland, we were told that major overhaul or replacement of the vessel would soon be required: overhaul would provide only a temporary solution, and replacement&#x2014;even by a second-hand vessel&#x2014;might cost some &#x00A3;12 million.</q>
The Minister has stated that the up-to-date estimate is &#x00A3;20 million. Quoting again from paragraph 81, we said:
<q>This problem is currently under discussion with the Government.</q>
Later in the paragraph we stated:
<q>As a first step, however, we recommend that the Government, instead of waiting for proposals from P&amp;amp;O, should forthwith initiate an independent cost-benefit analysis of the alternative methods of meeting the future requirements for a vessel to serve this route, including a comparison between the costs of overhaul and replacement.</q>
In our informal discussions as a committee we were told that P and O was principally worried about the St. Chair's ballast tanks and the fact that at that time about &#x00A3;350,000 was needed to put them right. We were also told that this would keep the boat going for perhaps five more years, but would scarcely be worthwhile. The St. Clair dates from 1965, and reservations were expressed by Shetland


councillors about a boat of 20 years operating a regular service in the sort of weather conditions that prevail around Orkney and Shetland. In the Secretary of State's reply to the Select Committee he admitted that the St. Clair was then nearing the end of its useful life. If in 1982 the Government were saying that, why are they wasting money now to provide a refit and refurbishment for this vessel?<br/>
I hope that when the Minister replies he will answer the following questions. Was there a full cost-benefit analysis of alternative methods of providing a vessel for the route, as the Committee recommended? The refit, according to the press notice put out by the Secretary of State, will equip the St. Clair to carry on for "up to 10 years." That was not the advice that was given to us during our investigation. "Up to 10 years" is a canny statement by the Government. Does it mean 10 years? If it means less than that, how much less? In return for this capital assistance, are the Government requiring additional information about P and O's finances over and above the information already supplied under the 1979 undertaking? Throughout our discussions the Shetland islanders wanted to know how much P and O was getting out of providing these services for the Shetland Islands.<br/>
It is correct, as the Minister stated, that revenue grants to P and O have risen over recent years, and the Government must be congratulated on that. They have risen from &#x00A3;0&#x00B7;72 million in 1980&#x2013;81 to &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 million in 1982&#x2013;83, and they are estimated to be &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;3 million in the current year. However, like the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), I would like the Minister to tell us the road equivalent tariff as it is directly affected by the order. Will the Minister give the House some information about the level of fares being charged compared with recent years? It is not the increase in subsidy that is important to the Shetland islanders; it is what they are paying in hard cash for the fares. How much have fares risen since the introduction of the last order?<br/>
The Committee recommended that all ferry charges should, with effect from 1984&#x2013;85, be based on road equivalent tariff, which in turn should be assessed on the basis of running costs. We said that if that recommendation were accepted, no special treatment for the north of Scotland service would be required; but that if RET was assessed on the basis of full operating costs, a "cut off' in respect of distances over 80 km would be necessary to avoid the longer routes such as Aberdeen to Lerwick being penalised.<br/>
The fact that the new draft undertaking merely continues the previous arrangements for revenue grant and tariff discounts is a further sign that the Government have turned their back on RET and their manifesto promise.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will take as much pride in saying that the Government will keep to their manifesto promise as he did in the last debate when he was following their manifesto promise on tenants' rights.<br/>
It is worth recalling that in paragraph 72 of its report the Select Committtee commented on the lack of a coherent pattern or strategy underlying the Government's decisions on ferry investments. In their reply the Government said:
<q>the forthcoming need for substantial new investment provides the opportunity for a review of ferry policy &#x2026; The Government intend to make full use of this opportunity.</q>

Those where brave words, but the Government have not yet given us any information tonight on the result of this strategy and investigation into ferry policy, not just on these routes but on the west coast routes as well.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will consider the Select Committee's report again and return in the near future, not with this small order but with answers to the recommendations by the Select Committee, and the decision that the Government will introduce the RET in the next financial year. If the Minister does that, I shall be the first to congratulate him on carrying out the Tory party manifesto not only at the election last year but at the election before that.</p>

<p>I support the points made by other Opposition Members. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Lambie), I was a member of the Select Committee that visited the Shetland Islands during that investigation. I made some friends there during that visit&#x2014;so many that I returned with my family to spend a holiday there the year after the investigation. Far from having taken just one trip on the St. Clair, as my hon. Friend did, I have taken three trips on it.<br/>
The people of the Shetlands will welcome the fact that money is being put in to upgrade the vessel. However, I seriously wonder whether the Government are throwing good money after bad. Will it be cost effective to spend money on revamping the present vessel? It is 20 years old. Those of us who have travelled on it seriously wonder whether it should continue on a regular service in those waters for many more years.<br/>
The St. Clair has to travel between Aberdeen and Lerwick not only in the relatively good weather that the tourists experience in the summertime, but in gales, as in the past few months, when the St. Clair has carried vital supplies to the islands. Is that vessel up to the job? Should we not take a more radical approach to the problem and plan to replace the vessel sooner rather than later?<br/>
I should like to amplify the points that have been made about fares. As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) said, the St. Clair is the Shetlanders' equivalent of a motorway. It is not much of a motorway, but it is pretty expensive. The Shetland Islands council deserves much credit for what it has done for fares and services on the inter-island ferries. I have travelled on quite a few of them. There seem to be practically no fares on some of them because it is recognised that they are part of the internal road system on the islands. One could argue that that link between Lerwick and Aberdeen is part of the vital linkage with the rest of the transport system of the United Kingdom. We recognise the complication of straight, crude road equivalent tariff for the Shetlands because they are so far away, but there is a serious problem. The islanders have a handicap about which people on the mainland should be concerned. Politicians of various colours, including the Government, have made promises over the years. The people of the islands are entitled to hear something definitive, and to know when the road equivalent tariff or a necessary variation of it will be introduced for the benefit of the Shetland islanders.</p>

<p>We have had a useful short debate. It is perhaps ironic that a greater welcome was given to my


announcement by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), whose constituents will benefit from it, than by other hon. Members from the central belt who did not have such a strong and close interest in it.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) said that he thought that there was a lack of public information on the cost to P and O of providing the service. Full information on costs is available to the Government. In our view, the return is not unreasonable. If the hon. Member looks at clause 13 of the draft undertaking, he will see that it ensures that the Secretary of State can obtain the information that he requires. Public disclosure is a matter for the company. The hon. Gentleman must agree that there is no sign of great public concern about the matter.<br/>
The hon. Member also asked about consultation on refurbishment. Essentially, this is a matter of commercial judgment for the company. It must decide on the scale of refurbishment, but the Government are satisfied that the works are appropriate, and that is borne out by the general welcome given to the proposals by the people of Shetland.<br/>
A number of hon. Members asked about road equivalent tariff, a question that arose this afternoon during Scottish Question Time. They will recall that I said then that the Government were studying the whole system of subsidies, particularly in the light of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report on CalMac. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will, I hope soon, be making a statement on this, and it would be improper for me to go into any further detail at this stage.<br/>
Some hon. Members continue to suggest that in some way the Government have been dilatory in looking after the interests of the islanders. I have already pointed to the way in which we have considerably increased the subsidies paid to the islands in both cash and real terms. That suggestion comes badly from the mouths of Labour Members, because I understand that during their time in office there were decreases in real terms in the amount of subsidy paid. Even if they are not prepared to recognise that, I am sure that the islanders will.<br/>
The hon. Member for Maryhill asked why the Government did not help P and O to buy a new ship for the route. A thorough technical inspection by independent engineers has shown the St. Clair to be in good condition. In P and O's commercial judgment, the most cost effective means of providing an adequate service lay in the refurbishment programme that is now proposed.<br/>
Although this is the best solution for the moment, P and O has said that it will take all practicable steps to ensure a replacement vessel when it is considered to be needed. In all these circumstances, the course now proposed by P and O, with the assistance of the Government, is the correct one. That is also P and O's commercial judgment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland mentioned the 7&#x00BD; per cent. rise in charges. That increase in fares took place on 1 January. As he will know, the subsidy increased at the same time to take account of the new fare levels. As the hon. Member for Maryhill said, these are not subsidies to the company, but subsidies that are passed on to those who use the service. I hope that will reassure the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland.<br/>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland also asked about the Government's scrutiny of P and O's financial position in relation to these services. The company has

given specific assurances that grants from the Secretary of State will not be included in the company's capital for which its commercial rate of return has been set.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Lambie) also asked about financial information. If he looks at the terms of the undertaking he will see that the information available to the Secretary of State is all that could be required in the circumstances. On the basis of what is in the undertaking, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that his worry is covered.<br/>
The hon. Member asked whether an overhaul was enough. As I said earlier, we decided to take independent professional advice on the condition of the ship. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman's Select Committee was unable to take account of that. The advice was clearly that the ship could continue for five to 10 years, depending on certain work being done. Our economic appraisal of alternative options showed that the refit was the best option. Work on the ballast tanks has already been carried out by the company, and that will not be grant-aided.<br/>
I hope that the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) will forgive me, but I have answered hon. Members at length on so many points that his comments have already been covered.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cunninghame, South asked whether the St. Clair is ending her useful life, which is the most important question. That was the view of the Select Committee. The subsequent technical appraisal, which was carried out by independent experts, showed that the life of the vessel could be extended by at least five and probably 10 years. The ship offers a good service to the Shetlands. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland was right to welcome the undertaking. It fulfils, yet again, the Government's commitment to help improve the quality of life on the islands by transport subsidy. That factor has always been part of the Government's policy.<br/>
I hope that the House will support the undertaking.</p>

<p>While I wholly support the petition that I have just presented, the serious problem of the conservation of swans causes great anxiety to my constituents and to many other people throughout the country.<br/>
I have five objectives in raising this subject. The first is to alert the House, and through it the Government, to the current dramatic decline in the number of swans on the rivers of Britain. Secondly, I wish to make a plea to anglers to try the new non-toxic products that are available and to try to phase out the use of lead weights. Thirdly, I want to alert people throughout the country, especially the young, about what they can do to help when they see a swan in distress. I also make a plea for financial support for organisations that are doing much to help swans recover, such as the swan rescue service of the Save Our Swans charity.<br/>
Fourthly, I want to know whether the Minister is aware of the concern of his predecessor in 1978, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Howell), about the state of the swans, who ordered an immediate inquiry, which culminated in the Nature Conservancy Council's report to the Government on lead poisoning in swans at the end of 1981.<br/>
Fifthly, I wish to ask the Minister for clarification on a point of law.<br/>
The number of swans in parts of Britain has declined seriously. It was noticed during the 1970s that flocks in many parts of the country were diminishing and by 1978 the famous flock of swans upon the Avon at Stratford had disappeared. Numbers on the Thames have declined dramatically. During the 1956 annual swan-upping there were found to be 1,311 swans and cygnets on the Thames. Between Putney and Henley in 1982 the figure had dropped to 255. Last year, there were 179.<br/>
The swan is the symbol of the Thames valley and of Buckinghamshire, the county of my birth. It is also on the coat of arms of my constituency borough of Richmond upon Thames and holds the proud position at the top of the civic crest.<br/>
Last year, only two swans were seen to be regularly resident on the Thames at Richmond. If the crest were being designed today, I wonder whether the swan would be considered. In ancient days there were hundreds of swans throughout England. It was a popular dish for the tables of kings. Even Mr. Drew Smith, the editor of the 1984 edition of the <i>Good Food Guide</i>, suggests that to improve banquets at Buckingham palace roast swan should be served to avoid a fruitless death in the annual cull. He also says that it would excite those who dine at the palace. I have bad news for Mr. Smith, a man whose culinary opinions, apart from this one, I always trust. The cull of swans has never been anything but the limiting of the number of eggs in swans' nests. It has never involved the killing of live swans. Not even a cull of eggs has taken place for over 15 years because of the serious decline in swan numbers.<br/>
I should hate to assess the state of Britain's diplomatic relations with our many allies throughout the world if,

after serving roast swan at Buckingham palace to the heads of state and leaders of Government, we laid them waste through a severe dose of lead poisoning.<br/>
Lead weights are not only the most common but the most avoidable cause of death among swans. I recognise that there are other causes of death. The serious dispersal problem has added to the decline of swans in certain places because of increasing boating habits. With boating comes dredging and the food source for swans disappears, forcing them to leave their familiar habitats and move to other sites such as reservoirs and lakes. Boating also disturbs the river bed, preventing weed growth. The influx of Canada geese has also caused a decline in swan numbers in some areas. I have also heard of how the herbicides and insecticides used by modern farmers cause death among swans that wander from the river bank.<br/>
I have figures for the Thames, following counts for the dyers and vintners companies and the Keeper of the Queen's Swans in 1953. Then there were well over 1,000 swans. In 1983 there were well under 200 swans on the main part of the Thames. Of the 19 swans that underwent a post-mortem in 1983, particularly from the Kingston-Richmond stretch, 17 died as a direct result of lead poisoning. Both Mr. Cobb of the dyers and vintners companies and Captain John Turk, the Keeper of the Queen's Swans, agree that the main cause of the swan decline is lead poisoning. I stress that it is not the only cause by any means.<br/>
One reason is the swans' feeding behaviour. There natural food is submerged aquatic vegetation which they find on the river banks. When swans up-end they can reach with their long white necks to depths of up to 1 metre. Swans are unlike mammals in that they do not have teeth. They grind their food by the use of a muscular organ called the gizzard. They take in about an eggcup-full of grit each day. This is held in the gizzard and used for grinding. Unfortunately, swans grovel around for their grit and are likely to pick up anglers' weights. These also are held in the gizzard. Because lead is soft, it is quickly ground to a size that can be absorbed into the blood system. The lead is carried about the body where it causes damage to various organs and body processes. If I am upsetting hon. Members, I can assure them that it upsets the swans more.<br/>
The symptons of lead poisoning are characteristic. One characteristic is paralysis. This results in the impaction of food in the swan's gullet. The gizzard ceases to grind and the food cannot be moved along, but the swan continues to feed. As a result food becomes blocked, sometimes all the way from the gizzard to the head. That gives the swan a thick-necked appearance which is depressing to see. I shall not go into the other symptoms.<br/>
Externally the swan's neck appears short and kinked. Due to paralysis, it is unable to hold its head upright in the position for which it is so well known. Instead it rests the lower part of its neck on its back. The swan gradually becomes more lethargic and gradually stops eating and swimming. The condition declines until death occurs. That can be as little as two weeks after the onset of symptoms. An acutely lethal dose of lead is estimated to be only eight lead pellets.<br/>
The symptoms of lead poisoning are seen not only in the white swans over one year old but in the cygnets of only a few weeks. The birds in the city flocks are most prone to picking up weights. These birds are important


because they are the next generation of breeding adult birds. Their deaths represent the loss of potential offspring.<br/>
The Edward Grey institute of field ornithology at Oxford university has carried out detailed research into the cause of death of swans in the past few years, and I pay tribute to its careful research, which has added scientific truth to what has long been suspected. The institute's research has been in two areas, one the post mortem analysis of swans found dead along rivers and the other the analysis of blood samples in living swans.<br/>
Between October 1979 and October 1981, of 94 swans given a post mortem, it was found that 54 had died as a direct result of lead poisoning, that three had been killed by fishing tackle, 16 by power cables, four as a result of disease, that five had been shot&#x2014;some by arrows and some by guns &#x2014; and the cause of death of 12 was unknown. In other words, nearly 60 per cent. had died because of lead weights. That is, however, 60 per cent. of the swans found and given a post mortem. In each period since then it has been confirmed that between 60 per cent. and 66 per cent. of swans are consistently killed by lead poisoning.<br/>
These figures are taken from the Thames as a whole, but the percentage of lead poisoning deaths rises dramatically the nearer to my constituency one goes down river. For instance, in the upper Thames and its tributaries, 19 per cent. of swans die from lead poisoning; around Oxford and Abingdon, 57 per cent.; around Reading and Henley, 80 per cent.; and around Windsor and Richmond, 85 per cent. Regular searches for lead weights are carried out in Richmond and between February and August 1983, a monthly average of 167 weights per 10 sq m patch of bank were found there, enough to kill 21 swans.<br/>
I want also to beg anglers to try out new weights, such as stainless steel, putty or tungsten shot, and I congratulate anglers on what they have done already. I, too, have spent hundreds of hours happily fishing, mostly on the sea, but my father was, and my elder son is, a keen river and lake angler. The angler holds an appropriate place on our British river bank, which he shares with the swan. I want to help them to live together longer. Indeed, I sometimes wonder which came first.<br/>
I congratulate the fishermen, who have tried to be careful with their lead shot, and I praise the initiative shown by the Angling Trades Association in issuing spillproof dispensers. I congratulate match fishermen on having given a helping hand in the development of "Anglers Weight", one of the new non-toxic products that came on the market this year. I congratulate all those anglers who are aware that lead shot is one of the causes of the decline of swans. I merely ask that they try a little harder before it is too late. Fishing is the most popular sport in Britain and I want it to remain so, but I also want one of our most popular birds to survive on the Thames.<br/>
My third plea is to young and old people to recognise the sagging neck of a swan that is suffering from lead poisoning. <i>The Standard</i>, "John Craven's Newsround", <i>The Sunday Times</i> through its "Watch" column and the RSPCA have all tried to make people aware of that so that they can tell the RSPCA or the swan rescue service of "Save Our Swans" so that suffering swans can be picked up and cured, as many of them are.<br/>
I also make a plea to those who feel able to give support to the swan rescue service with funds. Dr. Steven and Mrs. Zyllah Cooke have done much to save swans once they

have been found to be ill, but it is an expensive process and they are desperately short of money. Other organisations, such as the Barnes wildlife and animal welfare group, of which I am proud to be a member, have done excellent work and have been pointing out for over 10 years the dangers of swan decline.<br/>
My fourth objective in raising this debate is to ask the Minister whether he is aware of the concern shown by his predecessor in 1978. The report that was made as a result of the action of his predecessor involving the Nature Conservancy Council investigating the lead poisoning of swans was produced at the end of 1981. It recommended that lead weights should be phased out of use by 1986, and there was a pledge at that time that another look would be taken at the problem in 1984. We are there now, and I believe that the Minister recently received a report from the Nature Conservancy Council. May we know its contents? Local fishing groups are helping tremendously with the agreement to try to end the use of lead shot, so long as alternative products are available.<br/>
My fifth point is about the law. The Thames water authority is unsure whether Schedule 3(21) to the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975, which allows water authorities to specify the equipment that can be used for fishing, applies to the conservation of swans and other wildlife or merely to fish stocks. It says, when specifying the purposes for which byelaws can be made:
<q>Specifying the nets and other instruments (not being fixed engine) which may be used for taking salmon, trout, freshwater fish and eels and imposing requirements as to their construction, use, design, material and dimensions, including in the case of nets the size of mesh.</q>
They would like to know whether that may be used in cases where swan stocks are dangerously low, to restrict the use of lead weights, for a time anyway, so that stocks can be built up again.<br/>
The riparian councils, which already own some of the river, do, from time to time, regulate the use of angling rights, and Reading council carried out an excellent experiment recently to see whether a short ban, with the complete co-operation of the angling organisations, would help the swans, as it did.<br/>
It used to be said that if the ravens left the tower of London, the tower would fall. A similar tragedy would be felt by all if those majestic and once proud birds, the swans, should ever leave the river Thames.</p>

<p>I pay tribute to the well-researched and eloquent speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). If he makes speeches about conservation as good as that, he will be a welcome support to any hon. Member who holds my office. I am only sorry that there was nobody on the Labour or Liberal Benches to hear that speech, and particularly that there is nobody on the Liberal Benches. I not only sought the advice of my Department and the Nature Conservancy Council for my answer to the debate, but also that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mr. Rhodes James), without whom it is unwise to move in such matters. He was able to tell me of an occasion when Mr. Disraeli first met Gladstone, a Liberal Member at that time, at dinner, and swan was on the menu. Although this may be a poor story to tell on an evening such as this, Mr. Disraeli recorded in his diary that it was the "best company there".<br/>
The subject that my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes has brought up is a serious and a sad one. As he said, lead poisoning of swans is a serious problem, which causes acute concern to all of us who care for our wildlife, and these particularly beautiful creatures. My hon. Friend has already given most of the background details, but I hope that he will not mind if I run over some of the ground again, with a few additional facts.<br/>
The problem of the poisoning of swans by lead was brought to the attention of Government in 1979, when it was discovered that the number of swans on the river Avon at Stratford-upon-Avon had declined dramatically. My hon. Friend was right to pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Howell), who was the Minister responsible then, and to his initiative in this matter. The right hon. Gentleman asked the NCC for a report on the reasons for the decline in the number of swans on the Avon and to make recommendations to correct the problem.<br/>
Following an initial consultation with angling bodies and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the NCC advised the Minister that the marked decline was probably due to a number of factors including lead poisoning, industrial pollution, increased disturbance from boating and dredging, and a reduction in riverside and aquatic vegetation. The Minister subsequently asked the NCC to set up a working group to carry out a comprehensive review of lead poisoning of mute swans and to make recommendations for remedial action.<br/>
The working group, which included representatives of angling bodies, produced a detailed report, which was published in December 1981. The report concluded that mute swans were dying on the Avon and elsewhere as a result of lead poisoning caused by ingestion of fishing weights, especially split lead shot.<br/>
My hon. Friend has covered much of this ground, but I shall explain to hon. Members how the swans become poisoned. Lead poisoning occurs because, to break down and digest vegetation, a swan ingests large quantities of grit and gravel, which are retained in the gizzard. There was much muttering about the similarity between this mechanism and my hon. Friends who work for the Patronage Secretary. I did not hear all that. Swans, unfortunately, are unable to distinguish between grit and lead shot and inevitably ingest quantities of discarded shot when feeding. I am advised by the NCC that ingested lead affects the neuro-muscular system and that nerves and muscles cease to function. Eventually the swan dies of starvation, even though its gut is full of food &#x2014; a horrible and sad death.<br/>
I add for completeness that the report noted also that the incidence of swan deaths appeared to be greater on waters that were poor in aquatic plant life. That suggested to the working group a possible correlation with boating since aquatic plants do not thrive in waters where there is heavy boat traffic.<br/>
The working group report recommended a number of courses of action, the most important of which were: first, that the code of practice for anglers, developed by the National Anglers Council should be given maximum publicity; secondly, that the use of split-lead shot by anglers should be phased out within five years; thirdly, that research and development of acceptable non-toxic alternatives to lead should be pursued vigorously; and,

fourthly, that the Nature Conservancy Council should review the position in 1984 to establish how far the programme for action had met with success.<br/>
My colleague and predecessor in this responsibility, in a written reply to Sir Frederick Burden on 10 December 1981, welcomed the report on behalf of the Government and concluded with these words:
<q>I hope that all bodies who have a concern in these matters will use their best endeavours to implement the report's recommendations and combine to alleviate the suffering of our swan population and to eradicate its causes." &#x2014; <i>[Official Report</i>, 10 December 1981; Vol. 14, c. 487.]</q>
More recently, in April last year, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, in its report on lead in the environment agreed with the NCC report. The Royal Commission recommended:
<q>Urgent efforts should be made to develop alternatives to &#x2026; lead fishing weights</q>
<q>As soon as these alternatives are available, the Government should legislate to ban any further use of lead shot and fishing weights &#x2026; where they are irretrievably dispersed in the environment.</q>
The Government have made the following response to the Royal Commission's report:
<q>The Government strongly support the recommendations of the Nature Conservancy Council report on lead poisoning of swans: that urgent efforts should be made to develop alternatives to anglers' lead weights, and that efforts should be directed to the phasing out of lead in angling within 5 years (from 1981). Research into suitable alternatives is well advanced and the Department of the Environment will continue to monitor progress towards the substitution of lead within the timescale suggested by the NCC. The Government hope that a withdrawal of lead can be achieved by voluntary means, but legislation will be considered if necessary.</q>
That is still the Government's position. It shows our resolve to remove the major cause of suffering to these beautiful birds.<br/>
Returning to the original recommendations of the NCC report, I shall outline to the House the progress that is being made. First, the code of practice for anglers, drawn up by the National Anglers Council, was published early in 1982 and was given wide publicity with the assistance of the angling press, the tackle trade, angling clubs and water authorities. I pay tribute, as did my hon. Friend, to the full co-operation of the responsible people involved in angling. That was the first significant step towards a wider understanding among anglers of the indirect effects of their activities. I record my appreciation of the positive way in which all these organisations have responded to the problem. Not only have they speedily published the code of practice but I thank them for their contribution to the original working group and subsequent discussions with conservation bodies.<br/>
Secondly, significant progress has been made also towards the development of alternatives to lead. My hon. Friend made that point. Lead has several properties&#x2014;density, malleability, insolubility and tenstile strength&#x2014;which joined to its relative cheapness have made it the universal choice of fishermen for weighting their lines.<br/>
The development of a suitable alternative has, therefore, posed great technical difficulties, but I am happy to report that various commercial interests have risen to the challenge and independently produced at least two different materials composed of non-toxic substances that might be used as a substitute for lead. As my hon. Friend said, one of these firms has already launched its lead-free product and another hopes to be able to make its lead-free substitute available at retail outlets before the start of the next coarse fishing season in June. It remains


to be seen how far these alternatives will be adopted by fishermen as entirely satisfactory alternatives. I hope that the House will agree that this is satisfactory news.<br/>
Meanwhile, other measures are being taken within the trade. It has been recognised for some time that significant quantities of split-lead shot which become dispersed along river banks are accidentally spilled from the containers in which they are sold. Therefore, the Angling Foundation and the Angling Trades Association have developed a spill-proof dispenser which should already be widely in use. It is expected that nearly all, if not all, anglers' lead shot will be marketed in these spill-proof dispensers by the start of the forthcoming coarse fishing season. That development should immediately reduce the amount of lead shot which is dispersed and I regard it as a useful interim measure.<br/>
Another of the report's recommendations was that the use of lead should be phased out within five years. I have already said that the Government fully support that timetable which gives a clear deadline of December 1986 and hope that this will be achieved by voluntary means. I have also reported the significant progress which has been made in the development of alternatives. Much will depend on their suitability if voluntary withdrawal is to be achieved within the time scale.<br/>
The Nature Conservancy Council has been keeping in close contact with the angling associations and has recently agreed to meet them in February to discuss the mechanisms for implementing a voluntary ban when the results of field trials on the alternatives are expected to be available.<br/>
The NCC was also recommended in the report of the working group to review the overall situation in 1984. This it is undertaking and it is well aware of the need to advise my Department on the key question &#x2014; whether legislation will be needed &#x2014; when the review is completed. As my hon. Friends know, my Department is always reticent about bringing forward legislation.<br/>
I should now like to say something about swan populations, and especially to deal with circumstances on the Thames which is naturally of concern to my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes through whose constituency the river flows. Nevertheless, he is the trustee of many hon. Members on this matter.<br/>
I shall deal first with the national situation. At the time of the working group report the most recent information available was from a national census in 1978. It showed a total population of between 17,800 and 18,400 birds &#x2014; a decrease of between 8 and 15 per cent. since a similar survey in 1955. However, comparison of the data from those two surveys showed important regional differences in the swan population. They showed that increases had occurred in the northern half of Scotland, north Wales, and parts of eastern and southern England. Marked declines were noted in central and southern Scotland, north-west England, the midlands, south Wales and the lower Thames.<br/>
At the time it was concluded that nationally the population of mute swans was not seriously threatened but that there was a prospect of a continued slow decline. No more recent data are yet available but a national swan census was carried out by the Wildfowl Trust and the

British Trust for Ornithology in 1983. The information is currently being collated and analysed and will be available later this year.<br/>
As I have already said, the lower Thames is one of the areas which has long been identified as a black spot. Indeed, my hon. Friend has mentioned a quite alarming situation in the Richmond area, where ony two Swans have been sighted recently. My hon. Friend gave the information provided by the annual swan-upping counts. I confirm what he said and shall not repeat it. Much of that decline can be attributed to the effect of lead poisoning.<br/>
My hon. Friend also gave records of post mortems, which I can also confirm. Post mortems on 19 birds collected between Kingston and Putney which were examined in 1983 by the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, which was named after my mother's godfather who was a Foreign Secretary and a famous ornithologist at Oxford, showed that 17 had died from lead posioning caused by ingested fishing weights. Like my hon. Friend, I pay tribute to the institute for collecting and analysing swan data from the Thames, and to the Ministry of Agriculture veterinary investigation laboratory at Sutton Bonnington, which assists in the work of the Institute by carrying out analyses of tissue and blood lead levels and has carried out post mortems on many birds from other parts of the country for many years. That work has added considerably to knowledge of the problem.<br/>
My hon. Friend is quite rightly horrified by the scale of the problem in his constituency which appears to be just about the most inhospitable habitat for swans in the whole country. As I have said, however, action to eradicate the problem is being taken and will continue to be taken.<br/>
My hon. Friend asked about the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 and whether the powers of water authorities to make byelaws under that Act can be used to restrict or ban the use of lead shot. The present advice is that water authorities probably could use such powers to that end, provided that they had reasonable grounds for imposing such restrictions. That might be important.<br/>
Although the great majority of anglers, as my hon. Friend said, are co-operative, sensible and perfectly justified in their use of the rivers and towpaths, there is one other measure that may have some deterrent effect on the small minority of irresponsible people involved. That is the Litter Act 1983, which makes it an offence to deposit litter in public places. This can, of course, include the discarding of anglers' lead shot. I hope that mention of this legislation will remind all fishermen, in particular that irresponsible minority, that, by carelessly discarding lead shot, not only are they endangering the swans but they are technically breaking the law.<br/>
In conclusion, therefore, I can do no more than repeat the Government's firm commitment to the phasing out of anglers' lead and to confirm that we will not hesitate to legislate if it proves necessary. Nevertheless, I am sure that we all hope that the cessation of the use of lead shot in angling can be achieved voluntarily.<br/>
I pay tribute once again to my hon. Friend for bringing up a subject that is important and about which the Government are greatly concerned.</p>
