	<p pid=".1161.5/1">UK forces in Multi-National Division (South-East) worked with the Iraqi security forces to provide a safe security environment for the elections. On election day, the Iraqi police provided inner-ring security at the polling stations, with the Iraqi national guard in support. UK forces provided back-up as required.</p>
	<p pid=".1161.5/2">The whole House will wish to join me in taking this opportunity to recognise the hard work of all UK troops deployed in Iraq, which helped create the environment for the successful Iraqi elections. The day was tragically marred by the crash of the Hercules and the death of 10 service personnel. I pay tribute to those men. Investigations into the cause of the crash are continuing and the repatriation of their bodies is planned to take place tomorrow at RAF Lyneham.</p>

	<p pid=".1161.6/1">Whatever one's views on the conflict in Iraq, no one in the House would fail to pay tribute to the servicemen and women who lost their lives&mdash;and, indeed, to the courage of all those who work in Iraq. Neither would anyone fail to welcome the fact that it was possible to hold democratic elections in a significant part of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".1161.6/2">I understand that the Czech Republic has now decided to keep troops in Iraq for the foreseeable future, but that other coalition partners are likely to withdraw their present contingents. Under those circumstances, what are the right hon. Gentleman's expectations in respect of increased demands on British troops in Iraq, and when does he expect British troops to be withdrawn?</p>

	<p pid=".1161.7/1">The issue is not so much the withdrawal of other members of the coalition at the end of their planned tours of duty in Iraq, as the speed at which the Iraqi security forces can assume responsibility, particularly in the UK's areas of operations. As I have told the House previously, I do not anticipate any significant adjustment in the size of British forces for the moment, though I hope that, as and when the Iraqi security forces become available to take responsibility, any such adjustments will be reductions. That, for want of a better expression, is our exit strategy. It is part of a process of restoring responsibility increasingly across the board. The elections are part of that process, as is the training of Iraqi security forces, and we anticipate it continuing. It is proving successful and I hope to be able to report to the House, in due course, that certain discrete parts of our area of responsibility have been restored to Iraqi responsibility.</p>

	<p pid=".1162.0/1">I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend would pass on my thanks for what I saw happening in Iraq on election day. I saw British troops working discreetly in the background&mdash; I could catch a glimpse of them from the rooftops&mdash;and the whole process was well managed both by coalition troops and by the Iraqi police, who must be commended for their excellent job on election day. I also want to mention the people of Basra, where several hon. Friends and I were present during the election. It is estimated that 80 per cent. of the people there turned out to vote&mdash;a figure that puts some of us in well-established democracies to shame.</p>

	<p pid=".1162.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her observations and I shall certainly ensure that they are passed on to those responsible. In turn, I would like to thank her, two other MPs and two MEPs who were in Britain's area of responsibility on election day. As reported to me by the commanding officer of Britain's armed forces, there was a tremendous response from the people of southern Iraq&mdash;predominantly Shia, but also Sunni&mdash;who turned out to vote in an atmosphere that was positive and encouraging for the future of the whole of Iraq. If I may add to my hon. Friend's observations, a significant degree of courage was displayed in some parts of Iraq&mdash;Falluja, for example&mdash;when people turned out to vote, despite the intimidation of the recent past. The response of the Iraqi people, it seems to me, provides real encouragement for the future of the country.</p>

	<p pid=".1162.2/1">My constituents in and around RAF Lyneham will greatly welcome the Secretary of State's tribute to the men who gave their lives. They will also welcome the announcement that their bodies will be repatriated there tomorrow. Will the Secretary of State join me in expressing some disquiet about the national press&mdash;the local press have, in contrast, been very good&mdash;which has been extremely intrusive in its activities in and around Lyneham? Will he join me in calling on the national press to leave the bereaved alone to suffer in peace and quiet?</p>

	<p pid=".1162.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his substantive observation and for the specific point that he made. I visited RAF Lyneham on Thursday afternoon and the same point was put to me on a number of different occasions in different parts of the base both by the families of the deceased and by serving members of the Royal Air Force, who were extremely concerned about journalists going to their children's schools, posing as florists or using a range of deceptions in order to gain access to the bereaved families. I echo the hon. Gentleman's observation that this is not an appropriate time for that sort of intrusion.</p>

	<p pid=".1163.2/1">The five most recent Chiefs of the Defence Staff are among the many experts who have roundly condemned Labour's proposed defence cuts.

	<p pid=".1163.3/1">First, I must put the hon. Gentleman straight. This Government are spending more money on defence than his Government ever did. Perhaps he would like me to reflect on the size of the British Army in April 1997, when it was 101,360, compared with today, when it is 103,780. It is clear which party is more interested in getting more people into the British Army.</p>

	<p pid=".1163.4/1">My hon. Friend finds it easy to bat these silly questions away, but the changes in technology have meant that we have to change and reshape our forces. What is he doing to meet the shortfall in engineering and logistics, especially as such skills are very saleable in a buoyant economy? If he cannot answer that now, will he place his answer in the Library, showing the exact makeup of the Army, the shortfall and the pressures faced?</p>

	<p pid=".1163.5/1">My hon. Friend has raised an important point. One of the reasons for the changes that were announced on 16 December is to provide the necessary expertise in the right areas&mdash;the so-called pinch points&mdash;at the right time. My hon. Friend has asked for a more detailed reply and I will be happy to write to him with that information.</p>

	<p pid=".1163.6/1">The Minister will know that it is not a question of just replacing infantry with logisticians, because the British Army needs both. The Minister mentioned pinch points, so let us look at one. Can he confirm that last week 120 infantry officers received what was in effect a redundancy letter? How does that square with his Department's claim to have a duty of care to its military personnel? What effect will that have on the morale of infantry officers in Iraq, some of whom presumably received that redundancy letter? That is a pinch point all right.</p>

	<p pid=".1164.4/1">While it is easy to make political points about how Governments have spent more or less on defence than others and while we all accept that we need modern and well-equipped armed forces, is not the reality a balance between modern technology and boots on the ground? Given the wise words of Lords Guthrie, Bramall and Boyce in the other place on 17 January, would it not now be a good idea for the Secretary of State and his colleagues to review what is going on? We understand that we need new technology, but we are also seeing more troops being sent to Iraq and we have in Northern Ireland a situation that, sadly, is not as good as it was a few months ago. Is it not time for the Government to scrap the cutting of the infantry units?</p>

	<p pid=".1164.5/1">The ending of the arms plot, which has been widely welcomed in this House&mdash;I thought that all parties agreed with it&mdash;will make the Army more efficient, because more infantry will be available for deployment. That is not the case today when regiments are moved around the country solely for the purposes of the arms plot. By 2008, that will not be the case and more regiments will be available for deployment. That seems to me to be a modern, practical way forward for the British Army.</p>

The mission of the Iraqi national guard is to conduct internal security operations, including support to Ministry of Interior forces and constabulary duties. The training process comprises three weeks' basic training for the individual, followed by four weeks' collective training.

As I have said several times before, our aim is to ensure that the Iraqi security forces are capable of taking responsibility for their own security. The sooner they are trained and assuming that responsibility, the sooner the security environment will improve and the sooner our troops will be able to come home.</p>

I recognise that we still have some way to go, for example, in ensuring that there are properly trained officers. I am pleased that NATO has undertaken that particular responsibility, but we have to make progress, not only in training individuals, but in ensuring that collectively they have the ability to take action.</p>

The Navy will get eight, instead of 12, Type 45s as well as a reduced number of submarines, and the MOD has quietly cancelled the future surface combatant project.

That is the problem with the 2000 Act. On 20 January, the Minister said: &quot;Things are not nearly as bad as they seem.&quot; Actually, approximately two thirds, or possibly three quarters of the British armed forces and their spouses are disenfranchised. We have heard that the website is four years out of date and that people are threatened with &pound;1,000 fines. When will the Minister take action to give every potential service voter and their spouse a form to ensure that they are all registered in time for the impending general election?</p>

	<p pid=".1174.3/1">The Government have been and remain fully engaged in bilateral and multilateral discussions in support of the common aim to establish a more effective and competitive European defence equipment market. Those discussions involve member states of the European Union, the recently created European defence agency, the European Commission and industry and have included discussions on the European Commission's Green Paper on defence procurement. However, policy for defence equipment procurement rests nationally with individual member states, with any contribution from the Commission's being in support of initiatives developed by national Governments.</p>

	<p pid=".1174.4/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for his comprehensive response. The Commission's current proposal is obviously for a European defence agency, which would be responsible for, for example, defence capabilities, research, acquisition and armaments. Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is vital to establish discussion on the European defence equipment market with a view to securing openness and transparency in the market's allocation of defence projects and strengthening its competitiveness when it comes about?</p>

	<p pid=".1174.5/1">My hon. Friend has alighted on an important subject. We have to tackle the structure of the European defence market. We must consider how to improve it and make it more responsive to capability needs. As he said, a European defence agency deals with precisely that, and examines the key matters that must be tackled. We are at the beginning of the upward curve and we must first analyse and ascertain where we are and examine the way forward to ensure that we have that capable European defence market. We have given it impetus and the European Commission's Green Paper is an added spur to all that progress.</p>

	<p pid=".1175.0/1">We are addressing precisely those parameters. This is about the opening up and the transparency of the European market, as the hon. Lady knows only too well. We have an open market here, and we believe that that has benefited our defence budget. We get not only value for money but quality, and we hope that, in future, deliveries will also be made on time, although historically the industry has not been good at that. We have to take all those factors into consideration, and there are signs of growing awareness of this issue. This is about lifting the capabilities of our European allies as well as our own, and ensuring that the potential exists in the manufacturing sector to deal with the changes that have taken place. Great opportunities will come out of this for the UK and European defence industries.</p>

He is right to highlight the great success in achieving the US101 contract, which will give that aircraft much greater export potential. It is undoubtedly a success. We have procured from AgustaWestland the Merlin mark 3 for &pound;750 million, and the Apache in a &pound;4.1 billion project. We are therefore giving our support, but the important aspect of this is to ensure that we understand precisely what we need for our future capabilities. Therefore, rather than rushing into decisions, we must ensure that the &pound;3 billion that we have allocated for rotorcraft capability is wisely spent in a way that will have the maximum impact, one hopes in the UK sector.</p>

That debate was useful, in that it put on record the Government's overall response to Lord Lloyd's inquiry. I must say that his four recommendations were disappointing. I did, in fact, respond to one of them on 29 November, during Defence questions.</p>

It is now called the King's Lancashire Border regiment but the three regiments recommended that it be called the Royal Lancashire regiment; it is a true county regiment and covers the old county palatine.

	<p pid=".1179.0/1">Many current serving officers welcome the changes that were announced on 16 December. I do not think that there is much doubt about that. Indeed, many people may wish that they had made the changes in the past. For example, ending the arms plot was first raised at the Army Board in 1962. It has taken over 40 years but this Army Board, together with this Government, have finally ended it.</p>

That surely is the key point. Could the Minister look at the matter again to see whether we can return to the old regime, especially as the number registering has catastrophically fallen?</p>

	Five-year Asylum Strategy

	<p pid=".1181.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the five-year strategy that I am publishing today to take forward our reforms to the immigration and asylum system.</p>
	<p pid=".1181.1/2">The Government's approach to this important subject begins with the recognition that migration is vital for our economy and society. Visitors sustain a tourist industry that is worth &pound;38 billion a year and employs more than 2 million people. Migrant workers, skilled and unskilled, do key jobs that cannot be filled from our domestic labour force. Overseas students make a major contribution, economic and intellectual, to our education institutions, and many as a result develop lifelong ties with this country. The positive effect of migrants is true throughout the United Kingdom. For example, in Scotland the declining population presents a particular challenge that Scottish Ministers are addressing through their fresh talent policy to attract and integrate bright, talented people. We will continue to support measures of this kind.</p>
	<p pid=".1181.1/3">Moreover this country has always been among those first in the world to recognise our moral and legal duty to offer protection to those genuinely fleeing death or persecution at home. It is a fact that those who have migrated to this country over centuries have made, and continue to make, a major contribution to all aspects of our national life. But I think that the House will agree that it is essential to enforce our rules rigorously and fairly to ensure that we admit only those who bring this country the benefits or meet the moral obligations that I have described.</p>
	<p pid=".1181.1/4">The proposals that I am publishing today are intended to build upon the major progress that we have made in recent years. We have strengthened our borders by operating our own controls in northern France and Belgium, supported by sophisticated new technology to detect illegal immigrants in freight vehicles. This has substantially cut illegal entry through the Channel tunnel and Calais and other ports. We have tightened the asylum system against abuse, reducing applications by 67 per cent. from their peak. Since 1997, we have doubled the number of removals of those not entitled to be here. We have made our legal routes for migration much more robust against abuse.</p>
	<p pid=".1181.1/5">We must do more, however, to clarify the basis on which we admit people to the UK, whether temporarily or permanently, and we must do more to ensure that we operate an effective control to prevent those who do not meet our criteria from getting here, and to ensure that they leave when they are no longer entitled to be in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1181.1/6">Lack of confidence in our systems of control can foster bigotry of whatever kind, and it is our responsibility&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid=".1181.2/1">Order. Members often ask me to bring Ministers before the House to make a statement. The Secretary of State is making a statement and it should be treated with courtesy.

	<p pid=".1182.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/2">The strategy that I am setting out today comprises a major programme of measures to build confidence. We will continue to welcome genuine economic migration within strict criteria. The current system works well but is complex and difficult to understand. Therefore, we will bring all our current schemes for work and student migrants into one simple points-based system. That will ensure that we only take migrants for jobs that cannot be filled from our own work force and that we focus on the skilled workers that we need most. We believe that the labour available from European Union member states&mdash;old and new&mdash;should over time meet our national needs for low-skilled work. Therefore, in consultation with the industries and over time, we intend to phase out the current low-skilled quota schemes. We will of course review with the sectors how to fill any gaps that still remain, but any new schemes will be, as now, quota-based, temporary and tightly managed to ensure that people return home at the end of their stay. They will only be open to nationals of countries who agree to take back their citizens when they are no longer entitled to remain in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/3">That points system will be supported by new measures to ensure that it is not abused. Workers and students will be required to have sponsors such as employers or educational institutions who will share the responsibility of ensuring that they leave at the end of their time in the UK. The cost of running the visa system will be recovered from those who benefit&mdash;I am answering a written statement on that today. Where there has been clear evidence of abuse, we are ready to introduce financial bonds to guarantee that migrants return home when they should.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/4">We will set up an independent skills advisory body to advise us on labour market needs and skills shortages. The Government believe that a modern market-based economy such as ours requires a system that is flexible and employer-led, rather than some kind of centrally determined, rigid and arbitrary quota.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/5">We will continue to welcome genuine refugees. Like all other developed countries and the rest of the 145 nations that are now signatories, we will honour our obligations under the 1951 Geneva convention. It is part of the international legal and ethical framework that enshrines basic principles of human decency. The Government reject the idea of a fixed and arbitrary quota of refugees and withdrawal from the convention as unworkable, unjust, counter-productive and immoral. Withdrawal would deny to us the international co-operation that we need to deal with the real problems that cause asylum such as resolving conflict, combating immigration crime and returning failed asylum seekers to their own countries.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/6">We will continue to root out abuse by implementing rigorously the measures that we have taken to identify genuine refugees, by further strengthening our borders and by removing those whose claims fail. We will rationalise the appeals system to improve access to justice. From April, we will implement the new streamlined single tier of appeal. We will abolish the right of appeal against refusal of leave to enter the UK for work or study, and we will tighten up the operation of family visit appeals. We will continue to allow permanent settlement in this country where there is clear economic benefit and where migrants wish to integrate socially. We will tighten our conditions of settlement to reflect that by requiring those who want to settle to pass tests on English language and knowledge of the UK, by restricting settlement for economic migrants to skilled workers only, and by extending the period for which they need to have been here to five years before they get settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/7">We will in future grant genuine refugees temporary status once their asylum claim has been granted, as happens in many comparable European countries. We will encourage them to work and participate in local communities, we will keep the situation in their home country under review and, if there has been significant improvement, we will expect them to return. If there has been no improvement after five years, they will be permitted to settle in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/8">Over the next five years, we will transform our immigration control. Using new technology, we will develop an integrated system dealing with people before they enter the UK, at our borders and while they are in the country. We will fingerprint everyone when they apply for a visa. Those fingerprints and other personal travel information will be checked against our own watch lists of those who present an immigration or security threat. Airlines will not have the authority to carry people until that check has been made.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/9">Identity cards will provide a simple and secure way of verifying identity, helping us to tackle illegal working, organised crime, terrorist activity, identity theft and fraudulent access to public services. The new borders technology will record people's departure from the country, which will help us to target our immigration checks, and we will back that up with fines for employers who take on illegal labour.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/10">We will continue to crack down hard on organised immigration crime, which targets the most vulnerable, the poorest and the young. We have introduced tough new penalties, gone after criminal assets and established the multi-agency Reflex task force to co-ordinate law enforcement and intelligence activity. That will be a major priority for the new Serious Organised Crime Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/11">Swift removal of those not entitled to be in this country is central to the credibility of the whole system. Although we have removed many more failed asylum seekers and other immigration offenders than ever before, we intend substantially to increase the number in future. We will introduce a new and faster process for asylum applications, detain more people and use other means of contact like tagging to prevent people absconding when they are ready to be removed.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/12">We will take new measures to prevent people from concealing their identity by destroying their documents and thus making it much harder to get their own countries to take them back. We have already made it a criminal offence to arrive in the UK undocumented without good reason, and we are asking airlines to copy travel documents on certain routes.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/13">It will be most important to secure more effective returns arrangements with the countries from which most of our failed asylum seekers come. We will place migration at the centre of our relationship with those countries. We will give support to help with the reintegration of failed asylum seekers, if they need it, but we will also make it clear to the relevant countries that failure to agree such a joint approach will have implications for our wider relationship, including access to some migration schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/14">Migration is a consequence of the increasingly global world economy, and asylum is an international issue. We will best address and make progress on those issues through effective international co-operation, not through some kind of fortress Britain splendid isolation. The fact is that partnerships with other countries, the European Union and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are essential to delivering our objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".1182.0/15">Taken together, this is a major programme to build on the foundations that we have laid by creating a system which will be, and which will be seen to be, transparent and fair to all. It is a practical and systematic response to the real problems of asylum and immigration. It will provide a simple and robust system for economic migration. It will tighten our rules for permanent settlement to ensure that those who stay bring benefit to the UK. It represents real determination to eliminate illegal entry, illegal working, asylum abuse and people-trafficking gangs, who, through their heinous crimes, gain most from the failures of our system. I commend the strategy to the House.</p>

	<p pid=".1184.0/1">As usual, I am grateful to the Home Secretary for generously allowing me advance sight of his statement. I am particularly pleased to tell the House that today's statement accurately reflects the newspaper reports over the weekend.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/2">Eight years ago, the Labour party manifesto stated:</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/3" class="indent">&quot;every country should have firm control over immigration and Britain is no exception&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/4">The Prime Minister promised to clamp down on the thousands of people who settle in Britain illegally. Four years later, the manifesto promised:</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/5" class="indent">&quot;asylum seekers and their dependants whose claims are rejected will be removed from Britain with the aim of more than 30,000 in 2003&ndash;04&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/6">Instead of the clear, firm and fair asylum and immigration system that we were promised, we have a system that is confused, weak and chaotic. The latest published figures show that asylum applications are 67 per cent. higher than they were in 1996. Only one in five failed asylum seekers is currently removed from Britain. There are now more than 250,000 failed asylum seekers in this country who should have been removed.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/7">Net immigration has tripled under this Government. The legal aid budget for asylum and immigration has increased sevenfold since 1997. Despite obvious abuse of the system there have been far too few people convicted of employing illegal immigrants.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/8">It comes as no surprise that on his first day in the job, the current Home Secretary said that he believed that the immigration asylum system needed &quot;urgent reform&quot;. The right hon. Gentleman is right: it desperately needs reform. That is reform of the mess that the Government have created over the eight years that they have been in power.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/9">The Home Secretary has, today, set out plans to bring the system back under control&mdash;a rather different perspective. In November 2003, the previous Home Secretary described the Asylum and Immigration Bill as the &quot;final phase&quot; of reform.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/10">As I first called for an Australian points system about nine months ago, it would be unfair of me not to welcome that system in today's plan. There is a clear economic case for limited migration of skilled people coming into and out of Britain, and a points system will allow us to manage this more effectively. However, will the Home Secretary explain to the House why the Government decided to do this only now? Is it because last year more than 200,000 people came to Britain, entering under various schemes for employment purposes? Migration is, of course, part of a competitive, dynamic economy. However, the issue is not only about the economy. It is also about pressure on public services such as housing, schools and hospitals. So we must decide how many people we can take. For that reason alone we need a clear limit on numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/11">The Government's plan to introduce a points system will not necessarily reduce the number of immigrants coming into Britain unless a limit is introduced. In 2003, the former Home Secretary said that he believed that there is</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/12" class="indent">&quot;no obvious upper limit to legal immigration&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/13">Does the current Home Secretary agree?</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/14">The Government failed to foresee the implications of European Union enlargement. Today's announcement discusses but does not really deal with the EU accession states, whose 75 million population have an average wage half that of Britain's minimum wage and are registering at a rate of well over 100,000 a year, not the 13,000 originally claimed by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/15">Given what the Home Secretary has said, is he, effectively, going to set a zero, zero quota for unskilled immigrants from outside the EU and the succession states? Will he explain why, last year, the Government increased the numbers under temporary labour schemes but did not implement departure controls? Does he know how many people remain in Britain having completed their employment under these schemes or, indeed, came to the country under any temporary visa and stayed here illegally?</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/16">We know from leaked Home Office documents that most major countries have good methods of estimating numbers of illegal immigrants but that this Government decided not to do so because it was embarrassing. Will the Home Secretary now publish the estimated number of illegal immigrants in this country?</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/17">The five-year plan proposes to reintroduce embarkation controls. Again, we welcome this because it is also familiar from nine months ago. However, the electronic system that is being proposed today has yet to complete its pilot stage. It will be yet another very complex computer project for the Home Office to get wrong and to overrun on cost and time, and time matters on an issue of such fundamental importance to national security.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/18">The National Audit Office estimated that the cost of reintroducing embarkation controls will be about &pound;26 million, or a little more, per year. Does the Home Secretary not think that this will be a far more cost-effective way of controlling entry and one that could be introduced relatively quickly&mdash;not the three-year timetable that he currently has, I think?</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/19">Finally, we learn that the Government are going to restrict the right to permanent settlement. It will not surprise the House to learn that this is also familiar from nine months ago. The number of people granted settlement in the UK between 1997 and 2003 more than doubled, the figure having been almost static between 1993 and 1997. Will the Home Secretary explain precisely when this measure will come into effect?</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/20">The Home Secretary proposes today to speed up the removal of failed asylum seekers&mdash;a measure that he describes as key to the credibility of the whole policy. I am afraid that we have heard this all before and frankly, the Government's record to date on this issue is abysmal. Targets have been constantly missed and dropped, and then missed again. This is not the first time that the Home Office has talked tough on removing failed asylum seekers. In 2001, the Government announced a target of 30,000 removals, against a background of the then current average of 8,000. That Government promise was simply dishonest; they knew when they made it that they could not achieve it.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/21">I sometimes illustrate our immigration debates with leaked documents. This time, evidence of the Government's dishonesty is hidden in plain sight&mdash;in a document that is technically in the public domain&mdash;albeit buried in the middle of a 459-page report on the fire at the Yarl's Wood removal centre. The report quotes a deputy director of the immigration and nationality directorate, who said that</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/22" class="indent">&quot;the 30,000 target had been met with shrieks of hollow laughter&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/23">at an immigration service conference. According to the director of detention at the immigration and nationality directorate, the culture inside the Home Office was such that despite the target's being&mdash;the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration will like this phrase&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/24" class="indent">&quot;some kind of fantasy, you had to publicly acknowledge&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/25">it, and if you did not,</p>

	<p pid=".1184.0/27">Disturbingly, the director of detention said that reasoned debate was forbidden.</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/28">The previous Home Secretary was told immediately after the 2001 general election that his target was unachievable. It was reported that he felt &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with the news. So he should, as the Government plainly knew that their campaign promise was incapable of being achieved before they made that promise. The question that the current Home Secretary should perhaps ask himself is this: given that history of deception by this Government on this subject, why should anyone believe them now?</p>
	<p pid=".1184.0/29">It has taken the Government eight years to come up with a five-year plan&mdash;a plan that is a series of half steps towards a proper solution. It goes no way towards sorting out an asylum and immigration system that is a total shambles. It might surprise the House to learn that I feel some sympathy for the Home Secretary and the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration. Both inherited a complete disaster. We have had eight years of incompetence, cover up, deceit, missed targets and unmet promises. This is the latest headline-grabbing initiative from a panic stricken Government in the run-up to a general election. We have heard it all before; why should we believe any of it now? Frankly, we do not, and nor will the people of this country, who have now completely lost trust in a completely discredited Home Office.</p>

	<p pid=".1187.0/1">Well, that rant&mdash;that is the only word that I can use&mdash;was notable for its lack of comment on our detailed proposals, and for the right hon. Gentleman's reiteration of two fundamental weaknesses in his policy. First, he reiterated the official Opposition's commitment to quotas. I want to make it absolutely clear&mdash;in a way that the whole House, including Conservative Members, will understand&mdash;that the Tory quotas would damage our economy and our world-class education system and remove existing fundamental human rights under international law. It is an arbitrary, populist and impractical assertion that can achieve nothing, and I was disappointed at the right hon. Gentleman committing himself to it yet again.</p>
	<p pid=".1187.0/2">Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman rightly referred to the border controls that we rigorously establish in this document. They will enable us for the first time fully to understand exactly the movement of people into and out of this country, which was never done under the Conservatives or previously under this Government. I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman affirmed that he supported it in principle, but I am disappointed that he did not take the opportunity to renounce the cuts that the James proposals suggest for the Conservatives, which would remove the resources necessary to make our borders strong and robust at home and abroad. That is the second big weakness.</p>
	<p pid=".1187.0/3">Thirdly, I am not surprised that the right hon. Gentleman made no mention of his intention to leave the Geneva convention on refugees, which would destroy the very international co-operation that is essential to solve the challenges that we face on immigration and asylum. The fact remains that we are putting forward today a clear, coherent and practical set of propositions as against the false rhetoric of the official Opposition. I believe that the Conservatives will show that they have mistrusted the whole country in that regard.</p>

	<p pid=".1187.1/1">I thank the Home Secretary for advance notice of his statement. While there are many issues on which we disagree in this debate, we welcome at least his attempts to highlight the positive economic case for immigration. Included in the proposals that the Home Secretary has announced today is the suggestion for an independent economic review to assess how many jobs are needed. We have argued for that proposition since last summer, but will he consider our further suggestion that he should use the findings of the review to set an annual economic quota so that the public can see that it is being done independently rather than by politicians?</p>
	<p pid=".1187.1/2">Will the Home Secretary also confirm that he has no plans to end the right to settlement after four years? Does he accept that workers who have been in this country with their families for four years have put down roots in the community, making it wholly wrong for them to lose that right? Furthermore, will he confirm that his proposals will apply to all immigrants, including those from America, Canada and Australia?</p>
	<p pid=".1187.1/3">On asylum, I am glad that the Home Secretary rejected the totally unacceptable proposals for a quota that the Conservatives are advocating, but will he give a firm guarantee that the Government have no targets in mind for the number of asylum seekers coming into this country? Will he confirm that, in the next five years, there will be no further plans to change the rights of asylum seekers on appeal, and what is he going to do to try to get the initial decisions right on more occasions, because far too many of them are wrong at the moment? We welcome the plans further to speed up the removal of failed asylum seekers. In the past, the Government have set targets, but failed. Are there any targets in place now for the number that they intend to remove?</p>
	<p pid=".1187.1/4">Finally, does the Home Secretary share my frustration that there is now a bidding war taking place on immigration and asylum between the Government and the official Opposition? Is it not important to speak up for the positive role that migrants play and to defend at all costs the principle that, in this country, we welcome refugees?</p>

	<p pid=".1188.0/1">Let me begin with the hon. Gentleman's final point. I do not believe that there is a bidding war of any sort whatever and it is quite wrong of him to say that there is. What is critical is to ensure that our migration regime allows our businesses, public services and universities to flourish while maintaining our responsibility to ensure that everyone who has the right to claim asylum is able to do so and encouraging visitors to this country for a variety of purposes. I believe that it is ludicrous to impose some sort of economic quota in that context. It will be factors in different areas of the marketplace that determine the position&mdash;and quite rightly so. The position is simple. The hon. Gentleman is right to welcome the advisory body, which will ensure that we properly&mdash;and, independently, by the way&mdash;understand exactly where the pressures in the system are, how to carry the necessary measures through and how to build on our sector skills council approach. That is a sound approach to the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1188.0/2">We are not setting specific targets on the number of applications, removals or other particular aspects. We do believe that we can move forward in the directions that we suggested, including establishing settlement at five years, rather than four years. To answer another of the hon. Gentleman's questions, we believe that the proposals should apply to everyone, rather than to any particular groups. We will try to make the initial decisions more effective, and we believe that the accelerated asylum system will mean that better decisions can be taken more rapidly than in the past. My final appeal to the Liberal Democrats would be not to play a game of party politics, but properly to consider the merit of the proposals and decide accordingly.</p>

	<p pid=".1188.1/1">I welcome my right hon. Friend's statement. Anybody with half an ounce of grey matter between their ears knows that economic migrants are a good and necessary thing for this country.

	<p pid=".1189.0/1">My hon. Friend is correct and I shall be unequivocal in my response. We welcome migration for economic and educational reasons and we understand and meet our international obligations. However, the determination at the core of the document is to reduce and minimise the number of people who evade the system through duplicity, organised crime or collusion between various forces. My hon. Friend's constituents, like many other people, are impatient when they see the system bypassed in that way. That is why, once we have clarified exactly what the basis for entry is, it is necessary to ensure that the system is rigorously policed, enforced and tightened up. I am glad that my hon. Friend has focused on that aspect of the proposals.</p>

	<p pid=".1189.1/1">The House has been unduly harsh on the Home Secretary and he should be congratulated on delivering his statement with a straight face. However, he should recognise that no one believes him on this issue. They do not believe his figures or his statement. When he talks about enforcing rules vigorously and strengthening our borders, very few constituents will believe those words for a moment. If he does know what the figures are, will he undertake to put them in the Library so that the allegations that he made in his statement can be sustained by the actual facts?</p>

	<p pid=".1189.2/1">The reason I try to make my statement and give my responses with a straight face is that this is a serious issue which needs to be seriously addressed. It is true that there is room for party political badinage, but the people of this country are fed up with that aspect and seriously concerned about what needs to be done in practice. My challenge for the other parties is to put forward serious, considered and practical proposals, as we have sought to do, based on the facts of the situation as they are properly understood. That is what the document seeks to do, and I invite the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats to do that also. That is the basis on which we should have the national debate.</p>

	<p pid=".1189.3/1">I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary accepts that if someone is given refugee status, which is not very easy to get, it implies that we accept that they would be in real danger if they returned. Can he confirm whether people who are given refugee status in the future will retain the right to family reunion while they have the temporary status that he proposes? If so, we will be leaving people in limbo for up to five years while their families start to put down roots. What will happen at the end of the five years if we then attempt to send those people back? We will certainly see those people in our surgeries if that happens.</p>

	<p pid=".1189.4/1">I pay tribute to the work done by my hon. Friend on this issue over a period of time. The important point to acknowledge&mdash;as many other European countries do&mdash;is that refugee status becoming settlement is a privilege, rather than a right. We need to acknowledge that some applications for refugee status are temporary in character. The most recent example is Kosovo, but there are others. In such cases, one may reasonably anticipate that by seeking to end conflict in various parts of the world, we can address some of the genuine issues that give rise to applications for refugee status in the first place. That is why we say that it is necessary to keep the situation under review. If the cause has not changed after five years&mdash;and in many cases it will not have done so&mdash;we will, as now, grant indefinite leave to remain as a permanent status. However, it is reasonable that after refugee status is granted, it should be kept under review in the light of changing circumstances for each individual.</p>

	<p pid=".1190.0/1">In August 1997, I&mdash;and, to be fair, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1173" name="Gwyn Prosser">the hon.

No action was taken by the Home Office and the floodgates opened. In 1996, approximately 50 applications for asylum were made in Kent. Can the Home Secretary say how many asylum seekers are currently resident in Kent and what in his statement today will prevent the many asylum seekers who are now illegally on the electoral register from voting in the election?</p>

	<p pid=".1190.1/1">I cannot give the figures for Kent, but I can draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to figure 5 on page 17 of the document that we published today, which clearly shows that, according to the latest estimate, the number of asylum applications in 2004&mdash;the most recent year&mdash;was about the same as it was in 1996&ndash;97. I can also say that when Labour entered office in 1997, we found no serious preparation by the Government then leaving office to deal with the terrible crime of people trafficking, which was the core of the system. The Labour Government have put that at the top of the agenda and established approaches to deal with it. That is to the credit of our Government and to the discredit of the Government that he supported.</p>

	<p pid=".1191.2/1">The short answer to that question is yes. The question illustrates extremely clearly the fact that in the modern world, in large part, the need for asylum arises from conflicts in various parts of the world&mdash;Africa, east Africa, the middle east and elsewhere.

We have reached, or nearly so, the anniversary of the shocking events in Morecambe bay, over which the Labour Government presided, and as a Norfolk MP he is aware of the intolerable abuse suffered by some migrant workers at the hands of some unscrupulous employers in East Anglia. The reason for that abuse is that such people are invisible. His predecessor memorably said that he had not a clue how many migrant workers there were in Britain, either legally or illegally. Will one of the results of today's announcement be that in future the Government will know and, as a consequence, will be able to accord to those forgotten and neglected people the protection that the Morecambe bay workers so spectacularly did not have?</p>

The imposition of the border control systems that I have set out today will allow this or any Government to have the information that she rightly identified as necessary. She is right, too, about the impact of illegal working and people trafficking on our economies. She will be aware that an individual who ran a huge people-trafficking business in East Anglia was found guilty last week, and was brought to justice as a result of measures that we introduced.

Friend that swathes of those services, especially in London, could not function without migrant and refugee labour? I, for one, pay tribute to those people. Is my right hon. Friend aware that in opinion polls the British public regularly overestimate the size of the migrant and refugee population, and assume that between one quarter and one third of the entire population are first-generation migrants. Last week, however, the House of Commons Library advised me that the figure was nearer 4 per cent.

A vital number of key services and businesses depend entirely on that migration, so I was accurate in describing the Opposition's proposals for a quota as economically illiterate and destructive, as they would wipe out much of that key support. As for responsibility in the debate, it is legitimate to debate these questions, but every party to the debate, political or otherwise, should be required to introduce a balanced set of practical propositions. That is the nature of our proposals, and I very much regret that the official Opposition have not introduced proposals that are even remotely practical, as that can foster fear and uncertainty.</p>

Does he not agree that if he is going to charge higher fees at the immigration and nationality directorate, then the services that it provides must be much better; and that we must get a grip on that system?</p>

	<p pid=".1193.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. I intend to retain the right of appeal in family visitor cases, as I have made clear. However, that should be done on the basis of papers rather than oral hearings, and I have said in terms that we will consult on the question of a charging regime, precisely because, as my hon. Friend argued, it is important that any charges be considered alongside the efficiency of the service that is provided. I therefore accept the general thrust of what he said.</p>

	<p pid=".1193.1/1">I for one on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcome much of what the Home Secretary said today. When he spoke about removals, he did not emphasise what the problems had been and why we had not been able to remove so many people. Why should people be confident that the Government now have a plan that will get it right, when they failed so badly in the past, with tens of thousands of people who have been refused permission to stay remaining in the country?</p>

	<p pid=".1193.2/1">There are three key things that we must do in connection with removals. First, we must identify countries that are not ready to accept removals in the way that they need to. I set out a coherent cross-Government strategy for doing that in a way that has not been done before. Secondly, we must ensure that everybody is identified consistently. Though we have some good record on this, we do not have a good enough record, and we must make technology work for us in that regard. Thirdly, we have recently legislated to make it a criminal offence to destroy documents upon entry to the country. That is only a recent development, but we need to take it still further. All three steps are part of our removals approach. Putting all three into effect will build on the record that we already have for the highest number of removals the country has ever had.</p>

	<p pid=".1193.3/1">Is the Home Secretary not concerned that the debate is being increasingly conducted in a shrill atmosphere of dealing from the lowest card in the deck? We are going to the lowest common denominator in the debate. Will he reflect on the plight that many asylum seekers face in this country? They come from war-torn communities, having suffered personal and systematic abuse, often live in great poverty in this country because they are unrepresented through the asylum system, and are then threatened with removal to countries such as the Congo, which are extremely unstable. Will he not instead raise the debate to the level of serious concern about human rights for people all around the world, as we want for ourselves, rather than indulging in a debate with the Opposition about who can be toughest on immigration and toughest on asylum?</p>

	<p pid=".1193.4/1">I am very disappointed that my hon. Friend takes the view that that is what I have been doing. I do not consider that I have been shrill or that I have adopted a lowest common denominator approach. I have tried, in a way that has not always been part of the debate, first, to assert the absolute importance of migration to this country for work and study, for visitors and for our economic necessity, and not to confuse that with other aspects; and secondly, to assert our absolute determination to honour our membership of the Geneva convention on refuges, precisely to protect people in the position that my hon. Friend described. I consider that a positive way to look at the debate, and the document is a positive way to set it out. I do not know whether my hon. Friend agrees, but I think it is reasonable to debate these matters, rather than not. We should discuss them, and the document is a serious effort to provide a basis for doing that.</p>

Will he accept the invitation offered by the leader of Bedfordshire county council, Angela Roberts, last week for him to come to Bedfordshire to explain why the Prison Service ombudsman held the failures of Home Office policy to be responsible for the Yarl's Wood fire incident, and at the same time explain to my constituents why they should have any more faith in the current five-year plan than those many thousands who suffered from the fiasco of the past five years should have in that?</p>

	<p pid=".1194.3/1">I am grateful for that Question. My hon. Friend is right. It is important that the approach should go right across Government. For example, we intend to work with our colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure that the law is enforced strongly and coherently in relation to employing people who are in the country illegally. We intend to work with our colleagues in the Treasury and elsewhere on establishing a border regime that works extremely carefully. We intend to work with the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills to ensure that we have a proper regime for the recruitment of people coming into the country. In relation to housing, it is particularly important that we have that dialogue with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. So we are working right across the range and will continue to do so.</p>

Also&mdash;and this is a really important point in light of the preceding question&mdash;they all told me, when I met them at the beginning of January, that there had been major improvements in the previous six to nine months, during which things had moved forward. They felt&mdash;and it was they, not me or even my hon. Friend who said this&mdash;that there had been major progress.

Gentleman, takes the Stalinist view that the best way to proceed is for the Government to decide exactly how many people will work in each sector of the economy, how many students will come to the country and how many visitors we will have. That is a very silly way to proceed. What has to happen&mdash;perhaps, I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman, in a more free market way&mdash;is that companies and organisations in each sector of the economy, universities that recruit students from south-east Asia, or whatever it might be, should come to their views about what is the right thing to do. Our system would then facilitate that. I think that that is a good way to proceed.</p>

	<p pid=".1196.0/1">The Home Secretary rightly paid tribute to the role of migrants in recent decades&mdash;and, indeed, over the centuries. Does he accept that people from migrant and non-migrant families would agree with him that those who abuse our visa regimes and our refugee processes should be quickly removed from these shores? Does he also accept that one of the issues that he has to deal with in the Home Office is the slow rate of processing of those claims? That is imperative. Many people retain their long-term relationships with family and friends outside our shores. Does he join me in accepting that the need for family visits, and a proper, effective and fair system whereby people can visit these islands of ours, is imperative if we are to be seen to be taking the racism out of this debate? I know that that is what my right hon. Friend wants to do.</p>

	<p pid=".1196.1/1">I am very glad that my hon. Friend raised that point. The fact is that the time for processing an asylum application is now two months for an initial decision in 80 per cent. of cases, against an average of 22 months&mdash;11 times as long&mdash;in 1997, when the previous Government left office. That is a significant process of achievement, as I know that my hon. Friend will agree; but, yes, we have to do far more in that regard.</p>
	<p pid=".1196.1/2">I particularly appreciated my hon. Friend's first point&mdash;that people who live in this country, whatever their origin and history, all agree that we need to address the issue of people who try to bypass the system, and to get it right. That is what we are trying to do. Anyone who suggests that the set of measures is for one community or against another is simply wrong. I assert that strongly and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me the chance to make that clear.</p>

	<p pid=".1196.2/1">Given the Government's past woeful achievement on the matter and the Secretary of State's admission that most of what he has announced will not require primary legislation, when will anything happen? For example, when will he introduce embarkation controls? When will the points system come in? When will he introduce the temporary status for asylum seekers?

	<p pid=".1196.3/1">Some of the proposals will be delivered with immediate effect and others will take more time. The hon. Gentleman's first point was about embarkation controls. We cannot establish that system until the technology and regime are in place to make it work. We have taken the first steps but the process must be completed. We anticipate that the full fingerprinting system for visas will be complete by 2008. On the other hand, it is possible to set in motion the process for the points system almost immediately, after we have held a proper consultation about what the points regime should be. There is therefore a different answer for each part of the proposals. However, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that, as of today, we will move forward on implementing the whole document.</p>

If he has had the opportunity to read last year's Home Affairs Committee report on those matters, he will have found a more measured discussion of them than has been apparent in much of the past fortnight. The report recognised the considerable improvements that the Government made in reducing the time taken to process applications and in the reduction of failed asylum applications. However, it highlighted the need for radical change in the approach to the return of asylum seekers, for embarkation controls and for making asylum issues central to this country's foreign policy.

	<p pid=".1199.1/1">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Ideally, I would have liked to raise this point of order a couple of weeks ago, but I have been away with the Select Committee on International Development and this is the first opportunity that I have had.</p>
	<p pid=".1199.1/2">One of the most contentious issues in my constituency is the Government's proposal for an &quot;accommodation centre for asylum seekers&quot;&mdash;the phrase used by the Government&mdash;at Bicester. I was somewhat surprised, on 20 January, to be told by the regional media that, according to a Government website, leaflets were being distributed in my constituency by the Home Office. I knew nothing of that. I obtained a copy of the leaflet and was even more surprised to see that it contained this announcement by Ministers:</p>
	<p pid=".1199.1/3" class="indent">&quot;A community liaison group will shortly be set up which will play an important role in shaping the relationship between the centre and the local community. This will also be the forum for raising local concerns on matters associated with the centre . . . Membership of this group will be made up of a variety of key people from the local community, including local service providers, residents, voluntary organisations and clergy, amongst others.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1199.1/4">Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no reference in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to community liaison groups, so this is an extra-statutory provision. At no time did the Minister concerned either make a written statement to the House on this matter or have the courtesy to write to me as the local Member of Parliament. So far, this is the only accommodation centre in the country being proposed, so it is not as though there is a huge number of us to write to. I find that contemptuous of us as Members of Parliament. If our constituents feel that Ministers are being contemptuous of us, they will also conclude that they are being contemptuous of Parliament as a whole. That substantially undermines our ability to provide leadership in the community and to represent our constituents. I therefore urge you to urge Ministers not to make policy announcements of this kind by shoving leaflets through our constituents' letterboxes, but to have the courtesy to inform the House first.</p>

	<p pid=".1200.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me notice of his point of order. I hope that the Ministers concerned will take careful notice of what he said.

	<p pid=".1201.6/1">This is an extraordinarily important debate for many of our constituents. I say that knowing that it will be examined carefully by people of all faiths and of none because they are keen for us to get this right. To an extent, the issue has overshadowed the rest of what is a complex and important Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1201.6/2">The Bill contains a great number of provisions, but at times it has seemed as though it were the incitement to religious hatred Bill. I am going to suggest what I hope will be a positive direction for the debate that has engaged us both in Committee and outside the House. I want to underline what I believe is a strong consensus in the House. That consensus is in two parts. First, I do not believe that any Member does not deplore and abhor incitement to religious hatred, especially when it is used so often as a proxy or cipher for incitement to racial hatred as a way of subverting the present laws.</p>
	<p pid=".1201.6/3">Along with my party and, I know, all other Members, I want our law to be as comprehensive as possible in bearing down on crimes of either racial or religious hatred and I want to find ways of expressing our law in an appropriate way. It is not because we do not deplore incitement to religious hatred that we seek to amend the Government's proposals. Quite the reverse: many of us have argued, in the context of the plethora of Home Office Bills with which we have dealt over the years, that there is already a crying need for the recognition of crimes with a religious connection. Obviously that applies particularly to the Muslim and Hindu faiths, but it applies to many others as well. We argued&mdash;successfully, as it turns out&mdash;for the introduction of an aggravating factor in such crimes. It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to see that the sector in which aggravating offences are committed has been increasing in recent years as, it would seem, we have become a more intolerant society.</p>
	<p pid=".1201.6/4">There is an argument that the current racial hatred provisions cover, by almost an accident of interpretation, those who are Sikhs and those who are Jews. That is true. We should not be content with the fact that some sections of the community are covered by law and others are not. I recognise why we need to address the issue and why people&mdash;especially, but not exclusively, in the Muslim community&mdash;feel strongly that they do not have the protection that is afforded to others.</p>
	<p pid=".1201.6/5">I hope that there is another, secondary consensus, in the House and shared outside it, though perhaps not universally. That consensus is based on another principle of a liberal democracy: that we believe people should have no bar to either believing in or pronouncing on their own faith. There should be no bar to them proselytising their faith without fear of intimidation or persecution. There should be the capacity within our laws to engage in discourse&mdash;sometimes vigorous discourse&mdash;about the merits not only of one's faith but of other faiths. It is necessarily the case that, if one believes in one faith, one does not hold to another and one believes that criticisms are inherent in the faith held by another. Therefore, criticisms of belief systems and of the usage of other faiths should not be matters in which the law intervenes.</p>
	<p pid=".1201.6/6">We believe in the House in the right of free speech, which enables us to criticise, sometimes to deplore and even to hate the beliefs that some people hold. There is a difference between hating the belief and hating the believer, which I shall return to in a moment. Furthermore, there is in a liberal democracy a right to lampoon, to ridicule, to tell jokes that will touch on sensitivities&mdash;a lot of humour is based on touching on the sensitivities of one person or another&mdash;and to depict the practices of a religious faith in books, plays and other works of fiction. Again, it is important to preserve that right. Lastly, I believe that it is right that one should be allowed to say words that will have the effect of forming an adverse opinion in the minds of others on occasions, not to the point where one is inciting hatred, but to the point where one can simply say, &quot;I believe that this person is wrong and that their activities are hateful&quot;, without running the risk of prosecution.</p>

	<p pid=".1203.0/1">Before my hon. Friend comes to the issue of the offence, does he accept that there is one other consensus: those of us in all parties who have a strong faith&mdash;we are of many different faiths&mdash;believe that our faith is strong enough to resist and to be able to defend itself? It does not need the law to defend it. It stands by its own merit. That is the nature of faith. Therefore, the law should not be required to give it that extra protection. It manages that by itself intrinsically without legal support.</p>

	<p pid=".1203.1/1">I agree. The point that my hon. Friend makes is relevant to the debate that we may have on the amendment on the present blasphemy law. I personally believe that the Christian faith is capable of standing up for itself without the protection of the law. That law is not extended to others, so there is a further anomaly.</p>
	<p pid=".1203.1/2">There is a critical difference between race and religion because a person cannot choose the race to which they belong but they can choose their religion. Belief systems are mutable. Beliefs are mutable. Therefore, in the case of religion, there is not the clear definition that is affordable in the field of race. That has the potential to give difficulties in definition&mdash;no more than that, but there is that potential.</p>

	<p pid=".1203.2/1">The hon. Gentleman referred to the right to criticise religion. Of course, I would not in any way disagree with that, but is he aware that some of his arguments, which touch on free speech and the right of free expression, which we are all in favour of, were used in the 1960s against provisions on the incitement of race hatred? I remember the debates in the House of Commons. Those who argued against any such provisions said that they totally opposed and deplored racism but did not believe that infringement of free speech should be allowed in law. I hope that the Gentleman will bear it in mind that some of his arguments border on what I have just said.</p>

	<p pid=".1203.3/1">I will treat the hon. Gentleman's intervention in the most benign way. I hope that he is not suggesting that I would argue in that way, but I accept that there is a balance to be struck. I accept that free speech has its limitations, and we have accepted that in the context of what already exists. The question is whether the law that the Government propose puts the balance in the right place and that is the only matter under debate&mdash;how best we achieve the objectives that we share in providing protection for those religious groups that may be the subject of incitement to hatred on the basis of their religion, which, as I said earlier, is used as a cipher or a proxy for their race.</p>
	<p pid=".1203.3/2">The hon. Gentleman's argument is relevant in another way, because if we are to extend this to religion, why not other systems of belief? What is the difference between incitement to religious hatred intrinsically and incitement to hatred on the basis of political belief, for instance? I am against hatred. I believe that he is against hatred and incitement to hatred against any group of individuals on an arbitrary basis. But there is clearly a spectrum that we have to consider when we are dealing with such offences.</p>

	<p pid=".1204.1/1">Certainly not. I make it clear that I am trying to achieve a satisfactory law that deals with the problem that the Government have identified. Let no one be under any illusions about that. We are all, I hope, trying to provide satisfactory law that does not have some of the potential pitfalls of this legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1204.1/2">Let me deal with what the Government propose, because it is important and, although it may seem odd in the context, I want to defend what they are doing. I know exactly their intention. We have discussed it away from the Chamber and we know where they are coming from and they know, if they are honest with us and with the House, where we are coming from as well.</p>
	<p pid=".1204.1/3">First, the Government say that the law is framed in incitement to hatred and that hatred in itself is a high threshold, and I agree. It is a difficult thing to define, but it is not a light consideration for the courts. Incitement to hatred is a relatively high threshold. The second and much more important point is that the Government have framed their proposition in the context of hatred against a group of people defined by religion, rather than the religion itself, or any of the practices of that religion. That is an important point that people have failed to understand in some of the debate on the matter. I was brought up as a west country Liberal nonconformist and was always taught to love the sinner and hate the sin. That is the distinction that the Government have rightly identified in the framing of their proposal&mdash;that it is the hatred against the &quot;sinner&quot; that is deprecated, not their belief system. The third part of the Government's contention is that the Attorney-General, as a lock on proceedings, prevents the inappropriate suit from being put.</p>
	<p pid=".1204.1/4">Let me put, I hope soberly and sensibly, the alternative view about why the measure will not work as the Government intend at the moment. First, there are difficulties of definition. They are not, I say straight away, completely avoided by the alternative formulation that I and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" name="Evan Harris">my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> propose today. There is a particular issue in the fact that the Government's present proposition goes with either intention, which we all understand, or likelihood, rather than recklessness or anything of that kind. Likelihood, on an objective test, is difficult to assess, as it can only be taken in the context in which the remarks are made. That is potentially difficult. We must recognise that we already have laws against incitement to crimes&mdash;that poses no difficulty. The difficulty is posed only when the subject of incitement is hatred without a crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1204.1/5">Secondly, there is a question of trust. It is not a strong point, but it is one that I need to put, as it is held by many people outside the House. They understand that the Attorney-General will make the decision about whether a prosecution should be mounted, but they say, &quot;Who is the Attorney-General? The Attorney-General is a Minister of the Crown, a politician, and irrespective of his legal merits, somebody who can be tested by public opinion.&quot; That is a matter of concern to them.</p>

	<p pid=".1205.0/1">On the agreement of the Attorney-General being a lock on the legislation, those of us who remember the furore over &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; recall that persons who were upset because a criminal case was not taken against Salman Rushdie went to court to try to overturn the Attorney-General's ruling. The idea of the Attorney-General's lock will not avoid vexatious litigation.</p>

	<p pid=".1205.2/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the fears that some people had put to him about the nature of the Attorney-General as a Member of Parliament and a politician. I dare say that he will have explained to them that, in that role, the Attorney-General forswears all political allegiance and does not allow himself to be influenced either by Government policy or public opinion of a political nature. He is concerned about ensuring that the law is properly applied.</p>

	<p pid=".1205.5/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes a valid point from a sedentary position.</p>
	<p pid=".1205.5/2">Thirdly, on the human rights position, the Joint Committee on Human Rights has produced a report that is critical of this part of the Bill and raises reservations about it. I know that the Government have answered that, and I will not therefore rehearse the Government's answer but simply say in passing that there are genuine concerns about the compatibility of what is proposed with human rights legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1205.5/3">My biggest concern is the huge burden of expectation put on this clause. Many people in this country have argued cogently and coherently that all faith groups, particularly their own, should be protected from what is, in any normal sense of the term, incitement to racial hatred expressed through religious means. They have been led to believe that not only will this proposition from the Government deal with that mischief, but that it will effectively provide them with a blasphemy law of their own&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;No.&quot;] Hon. Gentlemen can say no, but that is what people believe is being proposed in the House today&mdash;not only do they believe it but they expect it from the House.</p>

	<p pid=".1206.0/1">I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. The point made to me again and again has been the expectation that prosecutions would be brought in such circumstances. As we have plainly seen, for instance, in the case of the gurdwara in Birmingham, there was never any prospect of a prosecution being brought against that theatrical performance, even though, under the current state of the law, it could have happened.</p>

	<p pid=".1206.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right about the incident in Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid=".1206.1/2">Part of the confusion has arisen as a direct result of what the Home Office has said. At one stage, the previous Home Secretary found it difficult to identify exactly what the new law would catch, but the statement that he eventually produced included this suggestion:</p>
	<p pid=".1206.1/3" class="indent">&quot;an extreme racist organisation widely distributing materials setting out a range of insulting and highly inflammatory reasons for hating Islam&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1206.1/4">Note the use of, &quot;Islam&quot;, as a faith, rather than &quot;people who are Muslim&quot;, which is the sort of thing that creates confusion in the minds of those who are listening.</p>
	<p pid=".1206.1/5">I would not suggest that the highly respected chairman of the Muslim Council of Britain, Iqbal Sacranie, is confused. On the Radio 4 programme, &quot;The Moral Maze&quot; on 14 July 2004, however, he said that, under the new law, any &quot;insult&quot; or &quot;outrageous comments&quot; about Islam or the Muslim community would be illegal, as would any</p>
	<p pid=".1206.1/6" class="indent">&quot;defamation in the character of the Prophet Mohammed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1206.1/7">The Minister has said that that is not what the proposal will do, but that is what people believe that it will do.</p>

	<p pid=".1206.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that there is confusion, and new clause 4, which would abolish the law of blasphemy so far as Christianity is concerned, is one way in which to dispel it, because it would mean that people could not urge a counterpart offence.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1206.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1206"  time="16:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-14.htm#50207-14_spnew2">
	<p pid=".1206.3/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman may have an opportunity to discuss the proposal to remove the outdated law of blasphemy and blasphemous libel later.</p>
	<p pid=".1206.3/2">My great concern is how the law will operate in practice. The Attorney-General will not bring people to court, other than in a few cases in which prosecutions should clearly be brought. However, there will be a huge number of complaints that people have, in exercising their proper right to criticise or to speak freely, contravened the law in some way. Every one of those complaints will require investigation by the police and consideration by the Crown Prosecution Service of whether to pass it to the Attorney-General for a decision on prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".1206.3/3">We will find ourselves in a dangerous situation in which people expect court action to proceed, but it will not, which will have two effects. First, large sections of the community who believe that they have been given protection will be greatly disappointed. Secondly, many organisations' activities will be impeded. Some of those organisations will consist of evangelical Christians, who are concerned about the new law, and some of them will consist of those who take an interest in arguing the relative merits of different faiths. For example, I have received valuable briefing material from the Barnabas Trust.</p>
	<p pid=".1206.3/4">I suspect that the major group who will be disadvantaged by the legislation includes the people who think that they will obtain the greatest benefit from it, namely the Muslim community. Some hon. Members may be aware of the Victorian state law, and the experience in Australia allows us to know what will happen. Amir Butler, the executive director of the Australian Muslim Public Affairs Committee, was one of the main advocates of an analogous law in the Victorian state legislature, but he is now against it because he says:</p>
	<p pid=".1206.3/5" class="indent">&quot;At every major Islamic lecture I have attended since litigation began there have been small groups of evangelical Christians, with notepads and pens, jotting down any comment that might later be used as evidence in the present case or presumably future cases.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1206.3/6">I fear that this will have an enormously divisive effect unless we are extremely careful.</p>

	<p pid=".1207.1/1">I hope that the hon. Lady can make that distinction&mdash;I believe that she can and that the Government can&mdash;between hatred of the individual and hatred of the faith. However, I fear that there are many people who will not make that distinction and see any criticism of their faith system as criticism of themselves, and any incitement in others to consider as less valuable the belief system of another to be incitement to hatred of themselves. That is the difficulty in which the Government find themselves with this proposal.</p>

	<p pid=".1207.2/1">Is this not the problem that the hon. Gentleman is trying to get at: under the terms of what the Government are proposing, an imam in my constituency could open himself to prosecution merely by quoting verses from a religious text? That is possible, whereas under the terms of the hon. Gentleman's excellent amendment, it would not.</p>

	<p pid=".1207.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that the whole House is seriously engaged, including those Government Members who have been kind enough to support the amendment, in trying to find a satisfactory conclusion to a difficult problem that we want solved. We want to ensure that evil racist people are prevented from spreading their hatred. At the same time, we want to be absolutely clear that professing one's faith, even if that faith involves, as many faiths do, criticism of other faiths&mdash;it is inherent in a faith system that it excludes as well as includes&mdash;is not an incitement to hatred but exercising the rights to religious freedoms that we have long held dear.</p>
	<p pid=".1207.3/2">I know that other Members wish to speak, so I shall conclude. I believe that our formulation satisfies the needs of the communities that feel under threat without creating new difficulties for both themselves and others and raising expectations. If the Government are not prepared to accept that, they should seriously consider something alone the lines of amendment No. 182, which stands in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" name="Evan Harris">my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase>, and which provides clear exceptions. It reads:</p>
	<p pid=".1207.3/3" class="indent">&quot;Nothing in this Part applies to activity which consists of&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1207.3/4">(a)</p>
	<p pid=".1207.3/5" class="indent">criticising beliefs, teachings or practices of a religion or its followers . . . that . . . are false or harmful . . . proselytising one's . . . religion . . . expressing irreverent comedic comments . . . or expressing antipathy towards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1207.3/6">Again, that would put the proposal clearly in context.</p>
	<p pid=".1207.3/7">I wish that we had the opportunity&mdash;it is not open to us because of the construction of the Bill&mdash;to debate the other new clauses that we have tabled, which would have introduced proper legislation for discrimination on religious grounds. That would have an enormously greater effect on the day-to-day activities of people in the faith communities. I would have liked to debate the prospect of an harassment clause. Again, that would have had a much greater effect on the day-to-day activities of those in the faith communities.</p>
	<p pid=".1207.3/8">We do not have the opportunity to do that. Instead, we have a Government proposal that I believe is flawed but not of bad intent. I want to support what the Government are doing but I want also to find a way of expressing that which, I believe, will achieve their intent and not the opposite.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1208.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/856" speakername="Frank Dobson" colnum="1208"  time="17:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-14.htm#50207-14_spnew7">
	<p pid=".1208.0/1">I believe that all of us are entitled to the quiet enjoyment of our homes and to feel safe, and be safe, on the streets where we live and work and find our pleasure, and so are all our children. The general law tries to protect us all. However, some of our fellow citizens are subject to additional hazards, and in those instances we must take special measures to protect them against those hazards. In the past, and even now, some people have been attacked because of their race and colour. In the 1980s, to help protect people against that additional hazard, this Parliament decided to make incitement to racial hatred an offence. These days some of our fellow citizens&mdash;women, children and men, particularly Muslims&mdash;are subject to abuse and assault because of their religion. That is why I have been pressing for some years for us to legislate to outlaw inciting hatred on religious grounds. I therefore welcome what the Government are doing, because such incitement is a cause not of all, but of some, of the assaults and abuse suffered by our Muslim fellow citizens, and by others from other religious groups.</p>
	<p pid=".1208.0/2">I emphasise that the Government are simply trying to outlaw incitement to such hatred, and their amendment No. 106, which does not outlaw criticism, offensive remarks or jokes, brings that about. Who needs the freedom of speech to incite hatred of anyone for any reason? I should also emphasise that the amendment is not an extension of the outdated and ridiculous blasphemy law&mdash;which, contrary to popular belief, protects only the Church of England and not any other Christian grouping. I have long advocated the abolition of that law, and it logically follows that if we are to outlaw incitement to hatred on the ground of religion, we should get rid of it. I hope that the Government will agree to doing so, even if they will not so agree today.</p>
	<p pid=".1208.0/3">I recognise that there are concerns about possible limitations on freedom of speech. There is also a possibility&mdash;when the law first comes into operation, at least&mdash;of tit-for-tat complaints by various religious groups against others, or of accusations that the Attorney-General, in deciding to proceed or not to proceed with a particular case, is subject to religious prejudice. Even those in favour of this change in the law must recognise that there are reservations and disadvantages, but none of those outweighs our duty to provide special protection for our especially vulnerable fellow citizens. This proposal does that, so I hope that it will be adopted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1209.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="1209"  time="17:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-15.htm#50207-15_spnew0">
	<p pid=".1209.0/1">New clause 3, to which my name and those of some of my colleagues have been added, follows closely an amendment that I tabled in Committee that sought to achieve the same ends. I therefore have no hesitation in welcoming the intention behind <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the proposal that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> has put to the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1209.0/2">This is a very difficult issue, and I am the first to accept the good intention behind the Government's proposals. It is of course important that we all seek to express ourselves moderately in society. Those who seek to do so immoderately, and certainly those who seek to inspire hatred of other people, should do so with great caution. In many cases, of course, they will transgress existing criminal law.</p>
	<p pid=".1209.0/3">However, we must face the fact that there are occasions when we do express, and try to inspire, intense dislike of others. Members of this House do so regularly&mdash;and in my view not improperly&mdash;when, for instance, dealing with and expressing hatred of members of the British National party. Indeed, we take steps at all manner of levels to discriminate against them&mdash;for example, by barring them from holding meetings in public rooms. To say that there is never a time when it is legitimate to express intense dislike of others appears to me to miss the point.</p>
	<p pid=".1209.0/4">This law will not apply, as the Government propose, just to mainstream religions but to every religious sect that worships a deity, be it God or the devil. I am bound to say that if the provision goes through, and if I were a member of the British National party, I would be thinking rapidly about worshipping Wotan as a devotee, thereby gaining the protection of the Bill. The House has to face up to the fact that if we pass such legislation, that could happen all too readily, however far-fetched it sounds. The law does not discriminate in any way between what constitutes a good or a bad religion.</p>
	<p pid=".1209.0/5">In that light, I have to tell the Minister that, while I fully understand the sentiments that have inspired the Government and those who back the Bill, particularly within the Muslim community&mdash;they may understandably have wanted to quieten the tone of the discourse&mdash;we will be making a grave and serious error if we proceed with the Bill in its current form. It will raise expectations at every level, which will, in fact, never be fulfilled. I have no doubt that although the number of prosecutions per annum will be minute, the number of times that prosecution is demanded will be massive, as each group seeks to use the legislation as a weapon with which to get at another group.</p>

	<p pid=".1210.1/1">I do agree, and that example suggests another real risk. That is why I ask the Government to listen carefully to what is said on both sides of the House this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid=".1210.1/2">The problem remains that as we become an increasingly pluralistic society, that requires greater degrees of tolerance from us. The House should be sending out a message that tolerance of the expression of others' views, so long as it does not offend the criminal law, is something that we all have to put up with. Let me provide another example, in the form of a recent book called &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. I have not had the chance to read the whole book, but I have looked at parts of it and I have to say that it is a blasphemous work. There cannot be the slightest doubt about that in respect of the theological principles on which it is based. I have not wasted one second in sleepless nights over this work, but I suspect that if similar theological mumbo-jumbo were written about other faiths, the demands for the prosecution of the author and the banning of the work would be considerable.</p>
	<p pid=".1210.1/3">It is for that sort of reason that I cannot support the Government, and I urge them to accept the amending provisions that have been suggested. I fully acknowledge that new clause 3 may not be perfect, but it is designed to provide a balance that offers a degree of extra statutory protection, by building on existing case law, for those affected when people seek to use religion to incite hatred against racial groups.</p>

It would also protect people against the consequence of hatred&mdash;attack&mdash;and would do so gradually, which should deal with the problem without unintended extra consequences.</p>

	<p pid=".1211.3/1">Is my hon.

	<p pid=".1211.4/1">My right hon. Friend is right. The broad expression of views, including those of secularists, people in the theatrical world and those with strong religious beliefs, suggests that the Government's proposals are seriously flawed. The Government should take that into account, and I hope that they will change their mind.</p>
	<p pid=".1211.4/2">The Conservative position is that any vote on the blasphemy laws would be a free vote. My view as a lawyer has always been that the blasphemy laws are, if not obsolete, certainly obsolescent, and most unlikely ever to be used to bring a prosecution. Hon. Members can make up their own minds whether they wish those laws to be preserved.</p>
	<p pid=".1211.4/3">On the main point, I encourage all hon. Members on both sides of the House to give new clause 3 serious consideration, because it is the best way forward. Despite their good intentions, the Government have made a great mistake in this aspect of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".1211.5/1">This matter has caused a good deal of concern, and the dilemma is whether it is right to go ahead with it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/856" name="Frank Dobson">My right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)</phrase> made a strong case, with which I largely concur. I understand the concern that expectations will be raised, and the feeling that religions are being protected, which in many respects is undesirable.</p>
	<p pid=".1211.5/2">On the radio today I heard Rowan Atkinson, who, like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, made a reasoned case. I listened carefully to Mr. Atkinson and he accepted that in practice there are unlikely to be many prosecutions, but he went on to say that the pressure on the Attorney-General would be very great indeed. We must wait and see&mdash;if the provision is introduced.</p>

	<p pid=".1212.0/1">A further point that Rowan Atkinson makes is that while the Attorney-General may rule out prosecution of comedians, he would do so after a complaint, after questioning, perhaps after an arrest and perhaps even after a charge. Why should people have to go through all those stages, in the climate they are likely to produce, before the Attorney-General's protection is invoked?</p>

	<p pid=".1212.1/1">I hope that that is unlikely to occur in practice, but because I have reservations, I accept the possibility.</p>
	<p pid=".1212.1/2">As I said during an earlier intervention, we may compare the objections that are now being made with the objections that were made to the provision that outlawed incitement to race hatred, which is now accepted. Hardly anyone would say that that law should be changed, but nearly 35 years ago, almost to the week, Lord Deedes&mdash;he obviously was not in the House of Lords at the time&mdash;argued that that section of the Race Relations Act 1965 should be repealed. He said that he was totally opposed to racism, but that the provision was an infringement of free speech.</p>
	<p pid=".1212.1/3">Those of us who took a different view put our case, and because there was a Labour majority in February 1970, we won the day&mdash;but it is interesting to look at the Division list for Lord Deedes' ten-minute Bill: almost every Conservative Back Bencher voted for the repeal of that section, which is now accepted.</p>
	<p pid=".1212.1/4">It is also now fully accepted that Jews and Sikhs should be protected in law. Despite my reservations and the fears that have been expressed, I must ask myself this question: if Jews and Sikhs are protected in law, why not Muslims? If Muslims are not protected, as they clearly are not under present law, and if they are subject to a great deal of abuse&mdash;the sort of abuse that every Member of this House opposes&mdash;as we know they are, the question inevitably arises: are the Government right in doing as they are? I believe that they are right&mdash;despite all the drawbacks, the reservations and the possibility that things will go wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".1212.1/5">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome quoted a Muslim spokesman in Australia. It is interesting to see that in the letter sent to us by the Muslim Council of Britain, which argues in favour of the Government's proposal, under the heading &quot;Could the proposed new law raise unrealistic expectations?&quot;, the secretary-general says:</p>
	<p pid=".1212.1/6" class="indent">&quot;It is sometimes argued that certain people, for example people in Muslim communities, believe that the proposed amendment to the Public Order Act will protect them against being offended. But since the prevention of offence is not the purpose of the amendment, such people will be disappointed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1212.1/7">Therefore, although expectations will be raised and demands will be made of the Attorney-General, whether by Muslims or by Sikhs&mdash;the latter are protected by existing law to some extent, but some demonstrated in Birmingham&mdash;it does not follow that those who take the view that their religion will be protected will ultimately find that it is. We are dealing with a wholly different issue. We are dealing with abuse&mdash;the sort of abuse that we acted against in the racial sphere 40 years ago.</p>

	<p pid=".1213.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept my assurance, as one who has a strong commitment to one faith but who does not think that it should have particular protection, that I would not support the new clause if I did not think it would give my Muslim constituents the same protection as my Sikh constituents and my Jewish constituents have and deserve? I want them to have equality, which is why the new clause is the best way forward.</p>

	<p pid=".1213.1/1">I accept entirely the hon. Gentleman's sincerity. Not wishing to be patronising, I accept that he wants to protect his Muslim constituents, as he does others. I do not question that, but I believe that Government amendment No. 106 makes a substantial improvement on the wording by replacing &quot;RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS HATRED&quot; with &quot;HATRED AGAINST PERSONS ON RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS GROUNDS&quot;. I cannot see why that should be unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".1213.1/2">I realise that the Government's proposal might face difficulties in the other place and might not come into law before the general election. None the less, despite my reservations and my desire to protect free speech&mdash;which I hope that we succeeded in protecting when my Labour colleagues and I supported the law on incitement to racial violence; I am not aware that our country is less free as a result of what we did 35 or 40 years ago&mdash;I believe that, on balance, the Government are right to try to protect those who are not currently protected by the Race Relations Act 1976, and I shall vote accordingly.</p>

	<p pid=".1213.2/1">We are discussing a delicate but crucial difference. I hope that the whole House recognises that we are trying to achieve the same end and that the argument is about how to achieve it effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".1213.2/2">The new clause is designed not to remove the protection that Jews and Sikhs have, but to extend as far as is proper that protection to other religions without getting into the position in which, in trying to close a manifest gap, we create serious problems&mdash;first, of over-expectation, and then of people using the law for nefarious reasons such as their own aggrandisement or for the harassment of others, and without the disadvantage of recognising that religious views are held with considerable strength, that in stating belief it is difficult not to cast doubt on the claims of others, and that some religions, by their nature, are more sensitive about such things than others.</p>
	<p pid=".1213.2/3">As someone who has experienced a different point of view as a convert, even within the Christian Church, I know that people can be extremely offensive. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1151" name="Ian Paisley">The hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)</phrase> is certainly robust in his opposition to the Catholic Church. Sometimes he crosses the line, and has been found to go beyond what can reasonably be done under the present law. I have witnessed occasions on which he has caused considerable pain, and has sought to heap ridicule, contempt and, frankly, hatred on the faith that I hold. However painful and hurtful, we have to accept such behaviour in a free society. We may have to seek to ask people to be more reticent in a tolerant society, and it is perfectly reasonable to argue that it would be better not to show &quot;Popetown&quot;. However&mdash;this is an important difference&mdash;we are saying that it should not be banned.</p>
	<p pid=".1213.2/4">Some religions have more difficulty with that than others, especially when challenged by people within as well as outside their faith. I shall choose my words carefully, because I do not wish to cause any offence. One of the advantages of the free society in which we live is that some faiths can open themselves up. That is more difficult in countries where a faith is entrenched, and many of us have seen various instances of that. With reference not only to the Muslim faith but to the recent argument over a theatrical performance written by someone of the Sikh faith, I believe that some faiths will benefit enormously from a lively and virile discussion within those faiths.</p>

	<p pid=".1214.0/1">Is not the right hon. Gentleman reassured, as I am, by Government amendment No. 106, which makes it clear that the proposals on religious incitement are designed not to protect religions from criticism, but to protect people from the activities of extremist organisations that wish to stir up hatred against them? He cited the Sikh play &quot;Behzti&quot;. The law already prevents incitement of hatred against Sikhs, but it did not result in any prosecution involving that play.</p>

	<p pid=".1214.1/1">I am reassured that it is better this way than it was before. As the Government have found it difficult to get the balance right, I urge the House to go a stage further and introduce a better formulation that meets the need more effectively. Expectations are crucial.</p>
	<p pid=".1214.1/2">I have heard programmes in which Members of Parliament have explained what they hope that this change will mean. In their minds it means, for example, the opportunity to prosecute the author of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. They may now recognise that the Government are not prepared to go that far, but that shows the nature of the demand.</p>
	<p pid=".1214.1/3">Many others wish to speak, so I shall say only one more thing. For those of us whose faith is the most important thing in our lives&mdash;that is true of members of a range of faiths in the House&mdash;there is little more painful than hearing the founder of one's religion, whom one believes to be divine, blasphemed. But I do not believe that in a secular society people should be prevented from doing that. Similarly, if I feel, as I do, that the claims of Islam are based upon facts that I dispute, I hope that I would say so in a polite and proper way&mdash;but I must not feel in any way inhibited from expressing that, because it is too important for its expression to be restrained.</p>
	<p pid=".1214.1/4">That is why this matter is so crucial. I do not treat my faith, or other faiths, lightly&mdash;precisely the opposite. Because faith is the most important thing in life, it should be able to stand on its own feet and be looked at properly, and be able to live in an increasingly, and properly, much more various world.</p>

	<p pid=".1215.0/1">Surely what my right hon. Friend is describing is the importance of tolerance. Does he recall saying on 28 November 1997, in a different context but very validly, that tolerance is not about putting up with things about which one does not greatly care one way or another, but about putting up with and allowing to continue statements and activities of which one personally profoundly disapproves?</p>

	<p pid=".1215.1/1">I am immensely flattered by my hon. Friend's memory of such a thing. I hope the fact that that was said about something wholly different will underline the strength of my feeling on the present issue. No man is tolerant if he is not prepared to tolerate the deepest, toughest criticism of that which he believes most strongly. That criticism cannot easily be distinguished from incitement to hatred in the terms of the Government's clause and amendment. That is why I commend the alternative reading to the House.</p>

Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche)</phrase> questioned him on the protection afforded to the Jewish and the Sikh communities. The hon.

I am sure that he, just as much as I, would deprecate any attempt to prevent the free expression of opinion. He is right that there are already laws that inhibit free speech, because incitement to racial hatred is a criminal offence.</p>

	<p pid=".1219.0/1">I declare an interest as the vice-president of the National Secular Society. For those of us who believe that religion is the backward march of history and the enemy of rational discourse, the greater is the need to support the free speech of those who wish to expose the metaphysical nonsense in which the adherents of religion indulge.</p>
	<p pid=".1219.0/2">Even before I became a cantankerous and cynical politician, I could not stand the actions of religious bigots and fanatics on the prowl, looking for converts and trying to proselytise even though that meant ending up with murderous crusades and aeroplanes being flown into occupied buildings. It is unbelievable that we meet here today at the invitation of a Home Secretary who asks us to respond with repressive legislation, which is calculated if not designed to protect those same people and their faiths from being subjected to hatred, ridicule and contempt. That may not be the Home Secretary's intention, but it will surely be a consequence of following that tortuous, contradictory and oxymoronic road.</p>
	<p pid=".1219.0/3">I want to be nice to the Home Secretary because I read in the paper today that he has upset the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and we all want to do that. However, I cannot help seeing the Home Secretary as a big baby. Why cannot he grow tall like the great figures of history? Let us take Byron. When on his deathbed, he was asked to return to God and he replied, &quot;Let's not be silly at this late stage.&quot; When Voltaire was asked the similar question, &quot;Will you renounce the devil and all his works?&quot;, he replied &quot;This is surely no time to be making powerful enemies.&quot; Why cannot the Home Secretary say no in a similar fashion to those mullahs and priests about the proposed changes in the law?</p>
	<p pid=".1219.0/4">Let us consider the problem in another way and eschew satire and ridicule for enlightenment, reason and fact. What would happen under the Bill? Let us suppose that the Vicar of Christ, the Pope, died, and amid the orations, oratorios and requiem masses, someone went on television and said, &quot;Come on, let's admit that the Pope was a bad man. He knowingly let the bodies in the killing fields of Africa multiply because of his insistence that condoms should not be used to protect against AIDS. He recently beatified Charles I, Emperor of Austria from 1914&ndash;18, saying that he was 'a model for us all', passing lightly over the fact that he presided over mass killings through the use of poison gas by his troops. Let us admit that he cared more for the souls of the cells of an embryo in a Petri dish than he did for the souls of the afflicted, the poor and the dispossessed among the living.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1219.0/5">Hon. Members might not agree with that, but if I or anyone else were to say such a thing on the day on which the Pope died&mdash;remember, context is everything&mdash;they could be sure that the massed ranks of Opus Dei would rise up as one and demand that every piece of punitive legislation be used against the person who had said it. That is always assuming that they had not stoned him to death straight away. The people of Opus Dei would claim that that person had stirred up hatred against the Catholic people and against a whole class of religious people. They would argue in the courts&mdash;as happened in a case in Australia&mdash;that neither the person's intentions, nor the truth of what he said, was relevant. What would matter would be the effect of the words on such dear, sensitive souls as themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".1219.0/6">Then along would come the Home Secretary with the reply that the Attorney-General would not allow the prosecution to go ahead. However, the Attorney-General is a political figure who may decide for emotive or political reasons that a trial would be no bad thing, and that it might cool the anger of Opus Dei. Certainly, an Attorney-General who could authorise Christian soldiers to fight and kill in an unlawful war in Iraq might do that. In short, we should live to regret this legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1219.0/7">I have spent a lot of my lifetime trying to be charged with blasphemy. However, even when we invited the police along and blasphemed, blasphemed and blasphemed again, no charges were ever brought. All that the police have ever done on these occasions is to protect us&mdash;the blasphemers, the law-breakers&mdash;from being attacked by crazy Christians foaming at the mouth who were seemingly, and I hope temporarily, possessed of devils. The Home Secretary wants to keep this law. It is pathetic. I support new clauses 3 and 4.</p>

	<p pid=".1220.0/1">I understand that we have very little time left in this debate. I want to speak to new clause 4, which has been tabled in my name and those of other distinguished hon. Members on both sides not only of the House but of the argument on the main question of incitement to religious hatred. I see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/856" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)</phrase> nodding at that. I note that the Conservatives have a free vote on this question, and I commend them for that. They will obviously note that their admirable defence of freedom of expression on new clause 3 might not be entirely consistent with voting against new clause 4, but that is a matter for each individual.</p>
	<p pid=".1220.0/2">There are all sorts of reasons for seeking to repeal the blasphemy law, not least that it is practically obsolete and that it has not been used since 1972. It is also wrong in principle, and it has had very few friends since the Law Commission argued strongly back in 1985 that it should be repealed. Secular people, of whom I am one, do not feel that they should be constrained by the criminal law, because they believe that it is acceptable, on occasion, to say vicious things about other's religious beliefs. Indeed, sometimes, in today's world, it is necessary to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1220.0/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/929" name="John Gummer">the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase> so eloquently said, religious people also believe that such a law is unnecessary. It is patronising to their God, their almighty, to suggest that he needs an obsolete and dubious piece of criminal law to protect his position.</p>

	<p pid=".1221.1/1">I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/982" name="Simon Hughes">my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> shares that view entirely. It has been clearly established that the blasphemy law is not compliant with the European convention on human rights. In so far as it is not obsolete, it is restrictive and lacks the certainty in criminal law that people need so that they know when they are going to offend. It is discriminatory, as was argued very clearly by the House of Lords Religious Offences Committee, which otherwise recommended very little that was specific following its deliberations.</p>
	<p pid=".1221.1/2">The main point, however, is that the blasphemy law is confusing. The fact that we have such a law leads people to believe that their beliefs will be protected under the new law, and, for that reason, it has to go. What are the Government up to, in not taking this opportunity to send a message in support of their own measure by repealing it? In answer to a parliamentary question they said that they</p>
	<p pid=".1221.1/3" class="indent">&quot;have no immediate plans to amend the laws on blasphemy. We acknowledge that there was a wide variety of views on whether the blasphemy laws should be retained, repealed or . . . &quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> 31 January 2005; Vol. 430, c. 685W]</p>
	<p pid=".1221.1/4">even &quot;extended&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1221.1/5">I question whether that is really what is behind the Government's move. I intend to test the opinion of the House on this matter. The blasphemy law is obsolete, friendless, discriminatory, censoring, non-human-rights-compliant, and confusing. There is not much in its favour and it should be put out of its misery this evening.</p>

	<p pid=".1221.2/1">In the few minutes available, I want to try to deal with the issues that hon. Members have raised. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> was right to say that this is an important debate. We had a very good and lengthy debate in Committee on these issues, and many of the same points have been raised today by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is a degree of consensus between us on what we are trying to achieve, but there are also significant differences, which we explored in Committee. It is clear from new clause 3, and from the fact that the Conservatives support it, that there is a desire that, where religion is used as a pretext or a cipher for racial hatred, such a situation should be covered. It is a matter of common agreement between us that there is mischief going on in this country, and that people are being attacked. Sometimes, those attacks are expressed in religious terms, but they are often connected to racial discrimination, and we all agree that that should not happen.</p>
	<p pid=".1221.2/2">Many of the provisions in new clause 3 are, however, already covered by the existing law. If hon. Members look carefully at the law, they will see that the words used in insulting, threatening or abusive behaviour do not have to be racist words; they can also be religious words. Because Jews and Sikhs are protected as racial groups, they are protected from religious discrimination and hatred, as well as from racial hatred. The new clause would create a bigger gap, because people who were not part of a specific racial group would not have the protection of the law. We believe that there should be a level playing field for people in this country. Even under new clause 3, there would continue to be a gap. For example, Muslims, who do not form part of a specific racial group, would not have the protection of the law. They would not be protected from having hatred stirred up against them on the ground of their religion.</p>

	<p pid=".1223.1/1">I am dealing with a substantive point: the difference between Labour and the Liberal Democrat Opposition. In Committee, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said:</p>
	<p pid=".1223.1/2" class="indent">&quot;We decided that if the law went any wider than dealing with the problem as attacks on Muslims as a proxy for racial attacks it would pose too great a problem for freedom of speech to make it worthwhile.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D, </i>20 January 2005, c. 430.]</p>

	<p pid=".1223.2/1">Will my hon.

	<p pid=".1223.3/1">Let me say to my hon. Friend, who welcomed amendment No 106, that we have sought to make clear that this is about protecting groups of people against whom hatred is incited, not the beliefs themselves. Many Members have said that religion should be strong enough to defend itself, and does not need the protection of the law. Indeed, that is the purpose of new clause 4, tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. This is about protecting people. It is not about the ability to criticise, ridicule or lampoon, or to have fundamental disagreements about the beliefs themselves. It is absolutely right, in a modern democracy, for people to be able to engage in robust and vigorous debate. The Government do not seek to outlaw that.</p>

	<p pid=".1224.0/1">I think that that is very different from inciting hatred against people and all that flows from that&mdash;the extremist material that we have seen that is capable of inciting such hatred. I think it perfectly permissible to express those views, although I would not necessarily want to do it myself, but I do not think that it is right for us to be able to incite hatred against individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".1224.0/2">People have talked about unrealistic expectations. They have said that we shall see a huge range of vexatious and litigious activity. Safeguards already exist. I do not just mean the reference to the Attorney-General, although he will have to consider the public interest. Guidance will be issued by the Crown Prosecution Service, which will be followed by guidance from the Home Office itself. I want to make absolutely sure that there is no misunderstanding in any group about how the legislation might be used.</p>
	<p pid=".1224.0/3">Let me say this to the Liberal Democrats. It is important for people not to misunderstand what this law is about. I am sure that the Liberal Democrats would acknowledge that Iqbal Sacranie, in particular, has now clarified comments made before the Bill was published in July last year. He is now perfectly clear about the fact that this is about protecting people, not beliefs. It is vital for that to be understood.</p>
	<p pid=".1224.0/4">I think that amendment No. 106 makes the position much clearer. I oppose amendments Nos. 11 and 12. I also oppose new clause 3, because it takes us no further than the law as it stands, and new clause 4, because I do not think that this is the right time for us to repeal the blasphemy laws. We have said that we will keep the matter under review. There is no consensus in the country on the issue. I believe that 48 per cent. of people polled thought that the blasphemy laws should be repealed, while 38 per cent. thought they should remain or be extended. I do not think that a condition of passing this legislation should be the repeal of the blasphemy laws, although it is right for us to examine the issue regularly.</p>
	<p pid=".1224.0/5">There is a difference between us and the Opposition. We feel that it is wrong to stir up hatred against people on the grounds of their religion. Clearly Opposition Members do not feel that that is wrong, and simply want to limit it to racial hatred. We do not think that that goes far enough. I ask the House to resist the new clause and amendments, and to support amendment No. 106.</p>

	<p pid=".1232.1/1">The purpose of the new clause, which is in my name, those of my hon. Friends, and that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, who leads for the Liberal party on this Bill, is to abolish the restriction on the use of intercept evidence in the criminal courts. My right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition announced last week that we would move the new clause today. Of course, it has a wider application than just this Bill, and might help to bring back within the criminal justice system those currently outside it, which would be greatly welcomed.</p>
	<p pid=".1232.1/2">We argue that the present restriction is anachronistic and illogical, and its abolition has been recommended repeatedly to the Government in recent years. Our amendment does not alter the circumstances in which an interception warrant can be issued or renewed under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Britain finds itself isolated, since with the exception of Ireland intercept evidence may be used to support criminal prosecutions in every other major country. The Government's argument that the use of intercept evidence could undermine the public interest by revealing to terrorists and organised criminals vital operational details deployed by the police and intelligence service, is, I submit, complete nonsense, since a well established and refined system already operates in the criminal courts to ensure the withholding of operational details in circumstances in which disclosure would be detrimental to the public interest.</p>

	<p pid=".1232.2/1">That is a powerful argument against the Government's position, but there is a yet more powerful argument: it is for the Crown Prosecution Service, taking the advice of the Attorney-General where necessary, to decide whether to proceed with the prosecution. If the class of evidence is such as to be prejudicial in the matter outlined, it would not be adduced.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1232.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="1232"  time="18:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-21.htm#50207-21_spnew3">
	<p pid=".1232.3/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right. I will come to that point in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".1232.3/2">At this early stage in the debate, it is important to point out that the new clause does not require the prosecution to use intercept evidence during a criminal trial. Instead, the new clause is permissive, in the sense that it would afford the prosecution the opportunity to adduce intercept evidence in a case in which the prosecution lawyers believe that it is appropriate to do so. At present, apart from in a small number of eclectic and in some cases random exceptions, that course of action is not open to them.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1232.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="1232"  time="18:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-21.htm#50207-21_spnew4">
	<p pid=".1232.4/1">The hon. Gentleman says that the clause is permissive, but in truth it would not be, because the defence would be entitled, in our adversarial system, to raise the query, &quot;Was there any phone tapping?&quot; It therefore becomes incumbent on the prosecution, whenever it has occurred, once it is lawful, to disclose that it has occurred.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1232.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="1232"  time="18:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-21.htm#50207-21_spnew5">
	<p pid=".1232.5/1">Yes, I will come to that point , too.</p>
	<p pid=".1232.5/2">Shutting out telephone tapping evidence is contrary, as I understand it, to the basic principles of evidence&mdash;if it is relevant, it is admissible. Therefore its inadmissibility, in my view, is a carbuncle on the face of the law of evidence. The consequences of the Government's unbending refusal to contemplate the use of intercept evidence in a criminal court led them to propose two weeks ago a course of action which many argue is inimical to the rule of law in this country. The merits of the Government's proposals to introduce detention through a control order&mdash;less euphemistically known as house arrest&mdash;will be debated at another time in the near future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1233.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1105" speakername="Brian Mawhinney" colnum="1233"  time="18:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-21.htm#50207-21_spnew6">
	<p pid=".1233.0/1">Before my hon. Friend leaves his first point, may I declare a history as one of the five Members of the House who served on the Privy Councillor committee that reviewed the terrorism legislation? Two of my distinguished colleagues from both sides of the House are also currently present. We were led to believe without equivocation that this was an anachronism&mdash; cannot, for reasons that the House will understand, reveal what was said to us. We were unanimous in our view that if the Americans can use intercept evidence from this country and we can use French intercept evidence in this country, and if we now know that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is in favour of using intercept evidence, the argument has moved on. As gently as possible, I hope that he will help the Government to understand that, for the sake of the security of the nation, this new clause ought to be adopted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1233.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="1233"  time="18:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-21.htm#50207-21_spnew7">
	<p pid=".1233.1/1">I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend. He did indeed serve on that committee, and I will refer to some of the conclusions that it reached.</p>
	<p pid=".1233.1/2">For the purposes of this debate, however, the argument that the proposals represent a disproportionate derogation from the liberty of the individual enshrined in article 5 of the European convention on human rights is wrong. This derogation would not be necessary were the Government to yield to the overwhelming merits of using intercept evidence in a criminal trial. In the view of the proponents of this argument, the long-term interests of this country's citizens are better served by the use of intercept evidence in terrorist trials than by the indefinite perpetuation of a system of house arrest. The European Court of Human Rights has long recognised that the use of intercept evidence in a criminal trial is compatible with the provisions of the European convention on human rights, while house arrest is not.</p>
	<p pid=".1233.1/3">The recent House of Lords ruling against the Government concerning the Belmarsh detainees, which has left the Government's domestic policy on handling terrorist suspects in tatters, compels the Government to make changes in the law. By repealing sections 17 and 18 of RIPA, one very sensible change would lead to more terrorist cases being brought to court.</p>

Indeed, the Government's written ministerial statement made that very point last week. The attraction of new clause 6 is that it is simple and easy to understand. It permits intercept evidence to be used in a case brought by the new Serious Organised Crime Agency and affords this House an opportunity to demonstrate to SOCA at the first opportunity that it supports SOCA's important work and is willing to put weapons into its armoury to enable SOCA effectively to fight organised criminals.</p>

	<p pid=".1234.6/1">Yes; I accept the right hon. Gentleman's point about how such evidence is gathered.</p>
	<p pid=".1234.6/2">Turning to how intercept evidence is used in other countries throughout the world, hon. Members will appreciate that it is routinely deployed by prosecuting authorities in the United States and European countries with the exception, as I have already mentioned, of ourselves and southern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".1234.6/3">As I said in Committee, Lord Lloyd of Berwick explained foreign countries' position on the use of intercept evidence in his inquiry into anti-terrorism legislation, which was published in 1996:</p>
	<p pid=".1234.6/4" class="indent">&quot;The first and most obvious argument is that evidence of intercepted material is admissible to prove guilt in each of the countries which I have visited, and in every other country of which I have knowledge. The United Kingdom stands alone in excluding such material. Thus in the United States the use of intercept material in evidence is regarded as essential. In many instances, including high-profile cases involving the New York Mafia, convictions otherwise unobtainable have been secured by the use of intercept material. I put to officers of the FBI the suggestion that they were having second thoughts about the use of intercept material. I could find no support for this suggestion.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1235.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is quoting Lord Lloyd's report from 1996. The then Home Secretary, who is currently Leader of the Opposition, decided that Lord Lloyd's recommendation on intercept evidence should not be taken forward without a wider review. What has changed since then?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1235.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="1235"  time="18:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-22.htm#50207-22_spnew2">
	<p pid=".1235.1/1">At least my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition responded, which is more than the Government have done. The Government took more than a year to respond to the publication of three separate reports.</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/2">I shall continue with the quotation from Lord Lloyd:</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/3" class="indent">&quot;In France I was told that intercept material has proved very valuable in terrorist cases. Thus, some 80 per cent. of the evidence against those suspected of involvement in the 1995 bombings is derived from intercept. Similarly, in Australia interception is regarded as an 'extremely valuable aid to criminal prosecution' . . . 664 prosecutions for offences ranging from murder to serious fraud were based on intercepted material, nearly 500 of those prosecutions being for drug offences. Convictions were obtained in 87 per cent. of the cases. Often, when presented with the evidence of an intercept, the defendant pleads guilty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/4">That is Lord Lloyd's considered opinion.</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/5">In Canada, the use of lawful interception evidence in court has been highly successful, with a conviction rate of more than 90 per cent. In 2001, lawful interception access helped to arrest approximately 100 organised criminals and solved 13 murder cases involving those individuals. In 2000, lawful interception access resulted in the seizure of more than $100 million in drugs and the conviction of several criminals for importing or producing drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/6">In America, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act in 1968. Title 3 of that Act contained the first comprehensive federal legislative framework governing electronic surveillance for use in criminal investigations. Between 1987 and 1997, electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to title 3 assisted in the conviction of more than 21,000 criminals. In evidence to the Federal Communications Committee in Washington in 1999, Louis Freeh, director general of the FBI from 1993 to 2001, said:</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/7" class="indent">&quot;As demonstrated by the lives saved and the important investigations and prosecutions successfully completed, the use of electronic surveillance has served the public extremely well . . . Indeed, law enforcement agencies at all levels of government have uniformly found electronic surveillance to be one the most    important&mdash;if not the most important&mdash;sophisticated investigative tools available to them in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of many types of serious crimes. This tool has been critical in fighting terrorism, organised crime, kidnapping, drug trafficking, public corruption, fraud, and violent crime, and in saving numerous innocent lives. In many of those cases, the criminal activity under investigation could never have been detected, prevented, investigated, or successfully prosecuted without the use of evidence derived from court-authorised electronic surveillance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/8">In Britain, a chorus of heavyweight, authoritative and expert opinion&mdash;most recently, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair&mdash;favours lifting that ban. As I have said, Lord Lloyd recommended lifting the ban on the use of intercept evidence in his review of anti-terrorist legislation in 1996. The recommendation was made again in the debate on the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, section 17 of which maintains the ban on the use of intercept evidence in court that was previously contained in the Interception of Communications Act 1985.</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/9">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1105" name="Brian Mawhinney">my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir Brian Mawhinney)</phrase> has said, most recently the Newton committee, which was composed of senior Privy Councillors led by Lord Newton, published a report into the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 on 18 December 2003. That report recommended that the blanket ban on the use of intercepted communications in court should be relaxed. Lord Newton and his highly experienced colleagues concluded:</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/10" class="indent">&quot;In our view, one way of making it possible to prosecute in more cases would be to remove the UK's self-imposed blanket ban on the use of intercepted communications in court. This was also the view reached by Lord Lloyd . . . to which we have seen no convincing response and by Lord Carlile when giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee on his review of the Operation of Part 4 (of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001).&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/11">The Government did not accept the case for removing the ban on the use of intercepted communications as evidence when the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 replaced the Interception of Communications Act 1985. The reasons given were, essentially, that allowing the use of intercepted communications as evidence would reveal the authorities' capabilities, prompting criminals to take more effective evasive action.</p>
	<p pid=".1235.1/12">The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 forbids the use of domestic intercepts in UK court proceedings, but no such bar exists to the use of foreign intercepts obtained in accordance with foreign laws. Bugged, as opposed to intercepted, communications or the products of surveillance or eavesdropping are also not barred, even if they were not authorised and were an interference with privacy. There is no bar on foreign courts using British intercept evidence, if the intelligence and security services are prepared to provide it.</p>

	<p pid=".1236.0/1">My hon. Friend has made the point that one of the Government's positions is a fear that the use of intercept evidence will persuade prospective terrorists not to use particular methods of communication. However, mast evidence&mdash;where a mobile telephone was receiving&mdash;is used in many criminal cases, but that has not persuaded criminals to desist from using mobile phones. Offenders go on using mobile phones, although mast evidence has proved critical in many cases.</p>

	<p pid=".1237.0/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is right, and I shall come to the confusion about general intercepts of mobile phones in a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/2">I want briefly to discuss the compatibility between the use of intercept evidence and the European convention on human rights, which I mentioned earlier. Intercept evidence does not infringe the ECHR, whereas house arrest does. The ECHR is clear: intercepted communications do not infringe human rights and liberties provided that they are used proportionately. In other words, intercepted communications must serve a pressing need and be utilised in accordance with the law and in pursuit of one of the legitimate objectives spelled out in article 8(2). Article 8(2) refers to acting</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/3" class="indent">&quot;in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/4">In respect of article 6, the Khan <i>v</i>. United Kingdom case clarified the legitimacy of using intercept-type surveillance evidence. In respect of article 8, the case which was listed in the court report of <i>The Times</i> on 27 May 2004 verified the fact that the use of intercept communications complies with UK law and is compatible with the article.</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/5">There has been overwhelming support for a change in the prohibition on using intercept evidence from all quarters of society. Commentating on the Home Secretary's statement in response to the House of Lords's decision on the Belmarsh detainees, the director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, said as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The Home Secretary is right to show respect for the House of Lords damning ruling. However, temporary restrictions upon a suspect's liberty are only legitimate as long as a criminal charge and trial are in prospect. We urge the removal of the legal bar on intercepted material being used in trials. Adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse. The Government should not swap one human rights 'opt out' for another.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/7">Why are the Government so set against the use of intercept evidence in court? That is the next question that we must consider. The Government's argument for non-disclosure of this evidence has been based on the following rationale: first and foremost, technology is changing so fast that any regime put in place would soon be outdated; secondly, the fear that allowing intercept evidence heard in court could compromise national security, damage relationships with foreign powers or the intelligence services, or threaten the lives of sources; thirdly, they are also of the opinion that there is a widespread misconception that the making of intercept evidence admissible would increase the chances of convicting detainees; fourthly, the final argument is that once intercept evidence has been disclosed there may be a requirement to disclose the whole of the tapped conversation. That could be a passage of 10 minutes but one that had been tapped for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/8">These arguments have not persuaded many. Justice, the all-party law reform group, has also addressed the arguments advanced by the Government. It states:</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/9" class="indent">&quot;If the intelligence services of the United States, France, Israel, Canada and Australia can survive the use of such evidence in their courts, then British spies are surely equal to the challenge.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/10">The Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, has made it clear that he backed the idea, and anti-terrorist sources stated that MI5 and MI6 have no objection in principle to such a move, but that the time and resources required to allow the product of telephone taps to be used as evidence in court would far outweigh the potential disadvantages.</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/11">What is the problem? The Government did not accept the case for removing the ban on the use of intercepted communications as evidence when the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 was before the House, which replaced the Interception of Communications Act 1985. That was because they felt that allowing the use of intercepted communications as evidence would expose the authorities' capabilities, allowing criminals to take more effective evasive action. That, with the greatest respect, is complete nonsense. To begin with, it is not the impression that one gains from reading Lord Lloyd's recommendations on the matter. It also assumes that British serious criminals are a peculiarly insular lot whose information gathering does not penetrate far overseas.</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/12">In international operations, such as those against al-Qaeda, the US has published details of its intercept capacity in respect of landlines, mobile phones, satellite phones, diplomatic correspondence and satellite intercept of foreign communications. While the concerns of the intelligence and security services are understandable, it is clear that a balance needs to be struck between the public interest in prosecuting cases and the public interest in maintaining the effectiveness of intelligence-gathering procedures and capabilities. By excluding the use of potentially critical intercept evidence in the courts, this balance has not been struck.</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/13">Lord Newton's report put it very well:</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/14" class="indent">&quot;We understand the concerns of the intelligence and security services, which include not only the protection of sources and methods but also the need to ensure that interception for intelligence purposes is not impeded by the imposition of complex procedures to meet evidential requirements. We recognise that a balance has to be struck between the public interest in prosecuting particular cases and the public interest in maintaining the effectiveness of intelligence gathering techniques and capabilities. We consider, however, that the balance has not been struck in the right place if intercepted communications can never be used evidentially.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/15">I remind the House that, under the new clause, relaxing the ban would not place an obligation on the prosecution to use intercept evidence. It would simply allow the submission of intercept evidence in court and stand on a par with what is available to other agencies dealing with serious crime and terrorism. What is more, there are already eclectic and disparate cases in which intercept evidence is used in criminal courts, albeit as an exception to the general rule, and there has not been any damage to police or intelligence service operational capabilities and methodology. I submit that these experiences puncture the Government's objections to the use of intercept evidence and render the present state of the law in this area quite ludicrous.</p>
	<p pid=".1237.0/16">I turn to some examples of why the present law on the non-disclosure of intercepts is ridiculous&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".1239.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. It is outrageous that the Government have curtailed this debate to half an hour. The fault rests exclusively with the Government. I will give way to any Member who wishes to intervene on me apart from the Minister, who is responsible for the guillotine.</p>
	<p pid=".1239.1/2">As things stand, a taped phone conversation between a suspect and a third party on a landline or a mobile phone, as part of a public network, is inadmissible. It can be used only for intelligence purposes. That contrasts significantly with intercept evidence that is obtained using other methods. Telephone conversations on an internal network can be used, and so can material where one of the people on the line is an undercover officer. There is no prohibition on the use in a criminal court of interceptions that have occurred within an internal network. Equally, if a listening device is placed in a person's house and a conversation is tape recorded or transmitted by a wireless device somewhere else and recorded at that location, that intercepted conversation provides admissible evidence in a court of law. Individuals can be wired up with recording devices attached to their body. Again, the conversations that they have with other people are admissible.</p>
	<p pid=".1239.1/3">Taps from conventional bugs not attached to phones can also be used in court. A decision in 2004 by the courts held that a recording of what a person said on a telephone picked up by a surveillance device placed in his car, which did not record any speech by the other party, was not an interception of a communication in the course of its transmission. The recording was made at the same time as being transmitted, but the transmission was not recorded. There was just the voice from the sound waves in the car. Accordingly, evidence from the tap could be used in court. The case clearly highlights the absurdity of the current law.</p>
	<p pid=".1239.1/4">These examples, and there are many others&mdash;the case of Ian Huntley comes to mind&mdash;show what a mess the law is on the admissibility of intercept evidence. In any event, the exceptional categories in section 18 of RIPA show that intercept evidence can be introduced in a criminal trial by the prosecution in cases involving what is currently defined as a relevant offence, which includes not only offences under RIPA&mdash;for example, making an unauthorised disclosure where an intercept warrant has been issued or renewed under the Official Secrets Act 1911&mdash;but cases that are before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission and the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission.</p>

	<p pid=".1239.2/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have some sympathy with his argument because I served on the Committee that considered the admissibility of &quot;white evidence&quot;.

	<p pid=".1240.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. In Committee, I was seeking to take a narrow view and test the opinion of the Committee. Since then I have talked to right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House and to lawyers outside the House. I have decided that a more permissive amendment would be appropriate. That is why I am speaking to the amendment.</p>
	<p pid=".1240.0/2">I was explaining that proper procedures and safeguards for non-disclosure are already in place. The House will know that, as a general rule, the prosecution has to disclose all material that it possesses&mdash;for and against its case. However, under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, applications can be made to the court when there is a dispute about whether the prosecution should disclose certain material in the public interest. When the prosecution prepares its list of materials to hand over to the defence, it can indicate which material it considers it need not disclose because of public interest immunity. It must also consider the relevance of the material. Where vast quantities of intercept are not relevant to any issue relating to the case, the disclosure rules do not require that this material be disclosed, irrespective of any question of public interest immunity.</p>
	<p pid=".1240.0/3">To protect against any compromise in national security or to protect sources' lives, the prosecution's duty to disclose evidence is limited, so it need not disclose material where the public interest so dictates. In some cases, the prosecution will take the view that the material should be withheld&mdash;for example, where it so sensitive that it is subject to public interest immunity. The prosecution must have genuine arguments for not disclosing material on public interest immunity grounds, which provide added protection for the defendant.</p>
	<p pid=".1240.0/4">Public interest immunity also helps the UK to co-operate with other countries, because it allows the police and other prosecuting bodies to keep out of court sensitive material that other countries do not want published. So contrary to the Government's claim, the use of intercept material would not have a negative effect on the relationship between British and foreign security agencies.</p>

Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly)</phrase>, who asked why the hon. Gentleman decided to extend the new clause to cover a wider range of offences, was a relevant one. But surely the answer is that there is no logic in restricting such a provision to terrorist offences, as the hon. Gentleman did in Committee&mdash;indeed, originally I shared his view&mdash;if one has the twin locks of the warrant concerning the acquisition of such information, and immunity from disclosure on public interest grounds?</p>

	<p pid=".1240.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very fair point.</p>
	<p pid=".1240.2/2">The withholding of sensitive information is an uncontroversial and unexceptional daily occurrence in the criminal courts. There is a clear public interest in preserving the anonymity of informers; of the identity of a person who has allowed his premises to be used for surveillance, and of anything that would reveal his identity or the location of his premises; of other police observation techniques; and of police and intelligence service reports, manuals and methods. The police order manual, for example, is protected from disclosure. Techniques relating to intercept systems, procedures, technology and methodology fall into the same category.</p>

	<p pid=".1241.0/1">As a member of Lord Newton's Privy Counsellor review committee, I should tell the hon. Gentleman that, with great respect, I believe that he has not got this new clause completely right and I shall not support it in the Division Lobby. However, many Labour Members are concerned about this issue and hope that the Home Secretary will give it very careful consideration in the coming months. Anything that gives us an alternative to the draconian method of locking people up without proper trial and charge&mdash;be it in Belmarsh or in their own home&mdash;is devoutly to be desired.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1241.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="1241"  time="19:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-23.htm#50207-23_spnew7">
	<p pid=".1241.1/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention in support of my case. I understand why he feels unable to join us in the Lobby tonight, but that is a pity, because he would have brought with him a very large number of his Labour colleagues who agree with the case that I am putting.</p>
	<p pid=".1241.1/2">To summarise my case, almost every other country, including the US, allows the use of intercept evidence in court. Such evidence is deployed in those countries with significant success in cases involving organised crime and terrorism. Independent reports by Lords Lloyd and Newton, and 1999's consultation paper on the intercept of communications, recommended the use of intercept material as evidence. The use of such evidence is consistent with the principles of the European convention on human rights, and the law already permits its use.</p>

	<p pid=".1241.2/1">There have been five Home Office reviews of this issue, some of which were overseen by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Home Secretary, and if we felt that there was an easy answer to it, we would want to pursue it. All of us want measures that enable us to convict criminals. We have offered the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Liberal Democrats, under Privy Council rules, the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister to discuss these issues. The fact is that we already use intercept evidence to convict criminals, and without prejudicing the close relationship between our intelligence services and the police. Indeed, no other country has such a close relationship, and not all countries make use of the European convention on human rights&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".1245.0/1">On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Have not the last 35 minutes clearly demonstrated that we are in danger of destroying the rights of the House of Commons, since a matter of considerable importance&mdash;intercepting material in cases of terrorism&mdash;has simply not been debated? Although one Conservative Member referred to the issue, not a single other Member from any party was able to participate in the debate. Is it not time that we reconsidered our views about the brutal guillotining of legislation?</p>

	<p pid=".1245.1/1">Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I strongly agree with what the hon. Lady has just said. This is an extremely important and topical issue and a matter of great concern to the legal profession and all who care about civil liberties and civil rights. As a result of the draconian programme motion that the Government put before the House last Thursday, we have been deprived of the opportunity to debate these crucial matters. The blame rests squarely on the Government who tabled that programme motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1248.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/889" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="1248"  time="19:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-26.htm#50207-26_spnew0">
	<p pid=".1248.0/1">As with the previous group of amendments, we had extensive discussions in Committee on animal rights extremists and I said that the Government would table amendments on Report to tackle more effectively unlawful campaigns by animal rights extremists that are aimed at causing economic damage to organisations involved in animal research through pressure on third parties to break commercial or other links. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will recognise that these amendments fulfil that commitment. I have met Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen to discuss them in more detail.</p>
	<p pid=".1248.0/2">We believe that properly regulated research on animals is essential to make progress in treating disease&mdash;for example, Alzheimer's disease, which affects more than half of those aged over 85. The abnormalities of Alzheimer's disease have been shown in primates and certain strains of mice, and animal studies provide opportunities for understanding Alzheimer's disease and studying potential new treatments. We need animal research if we are ever to discover a cure for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
	<p pid=".1248.0/3">We have perhaps the most rigorous system of regulation of animal experiments of any country. Licences may be granted only when experts in the animals scientific procedures inspectorate are persuaded that the likely benefits of an experiment outweigh the likely harm to the animals concerned and that no alternatives can replace the use of animals, reduce the number of animals used or refine the procedures to minimise suffering.</p>
	<p pid=".1248.0/4">Many people believe that animals should not be used for research and I respect that view. They have every right to express it and the great majority of them do so wholly peacefully and properly to try to persuade people to change their minds and to change the law. However, some of those who are opposed to research on animals have not used lawful methods of persuasion. They have sought to impose their views on others through harassment, threats and physical attacks. The purpose of the Government amendments is to tackle those campaigns.</p>
	<p pid=".1248.0/5">The amendments introduce five new clauses which create two new offences. New clause 10 creates a new offence of a criminal or tortious act against a person that causes loss or damage with the intention of harming an animal research organisation, when the act is likely or intended to cause the person not to perform a contract or similar arrangement, to end a contract or not enter into one.</p>

	<p pid=".1249.2/1">I would like to associate myself and my hon. Friends with the hon. Lady's comments.</p>
	<p pid=".1249.2/2">We broadly welcome the new clauses, but new clause 10(3)(a) contains the slightly curious phrase &quot;amounting to a criminal offence&quot;, instead of an act which is a criminal offence. There is no such qualification in paragraph (b) in which a tortious act is apparently self-explanatory. Why was that form of words used in paragraph (a)?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1249.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/889" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="1249"  time="19:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-26.htm#50207-26_spnew4">
	<p pid=".1249.3/1">One of the areas that we have tried to cover is when there is a criminal or tortious act. A tortious act is one against civil law. Usually, the remedy for a victim of a tort is to sue the alleged perpetrator in the civil courts. We are considering how to extend that so that an offence that could amount to a criminal offence can be covered by this clause in the criminal courts. We are including tortious acts that cause loss or damage because we believe that people who suffer nuisance campaigns designed to disturb or frighten them should be able to look to law enforcement to pursue their case. A court would have to be convinced that a tort had caused or, if threatened, would cause loss or damage for an offence to be committed. However, I will consider what the hon. Gentleman said and return to the matter a little later.</p>
	<p pid=".1249.3/2">New clause 10 creates a new offence of committing a criminal or tortious act against a person which causes loss or damage. The offence is committed when the intention is to harm an animal research organisation and that includes those who breed animals for research. That is to ensure that it effectively tackles the evolving extremist tactic of targeting people who supply goods or services, such as courier companies, insurance companies and so on, making it increasingly difficult for an animal research organisation to function as its commercial partners are frightened off.</p>
	<p pid=".1249.3/3">Turning to Opposition amendment (b) to new clause 10, I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/854" name="Jonathan Djanogly">the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly)</phrase> that the provision should catch cases when the criminal or tortious act is done to pressurise a supplier to or customer of an animal research organisation to end their dealings with the organisation. I assure him that the provision already has that effect. He wants to add the words &quot;animal research organisation or&quot; before &quot;a third person&quot;, but third person already covers every person or body other than the person doing the criminal or tortious act and the person they are pressurising. We believe that it covers animal research organisations extensively and, therefore, that the amendment is unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid=".1249.3/4">New clause 11 creates a second offence of threatening someone with an unlawful act because they are connected to an animal research organisation, whether as a supplier, customer or other associate, at up to two, and in some cases more, removes. That is aimed at giving prosecutors an effective tool for prosecuting threats made against people because of their direct or indirect connection with an animal research activity. In Committee, we heard various examples of how wide a net animal rights extremists throw to attack indirectly the organisation that is the source of its protest and concern.</p>
	<p pid=".1249.3/5">Hon. Members will see that both offences can be committed as the result of the commission of a tortious act as well as a criminal act. That is an important aspect of our proposals. We all know that animal rights extremists have used a range of tactics that have caused real loss and damage to their victims. Some have been tortious rather than criminal&mdash;for example, fly-posting leaflets on lamp posts in a neighbourhood that falsely assert that a victim is a paedophile is libellous. As a result, it has been for the affected individual to seek redress for the damage caused, but we believe that the state should be able to come to the help of victims of a campaign of unlawful acts aimed at intimidating or coercing them.</p>
	<p pid=".1249.3/6">Amendments (a) to new clauses 10 and 11 are concerned with that issue, but I do not believe that introducing a test of significance to the loss or harm required to be caused by a relevant tortious act would be sensible in relation to either offence. It would make the scope of the offences entirely uncertain. With our formulation, any tortious act causing loss or damage can form the basis of an offence with the seriousness of the loss or damage forming part of the court's consideration of a penalty in the event of a conviction.</p>

	<p pid=".1251.0/1">I hope that the Minister understands that both amendments (a) are probing amendments. There could be concern that the provisions are widely drafted, in that nuisance and trespass are tortious acts. Is it her intention that the provision should catch people who are, for example, demonstrating by handing out leaflets outside an organisation? That could be considered a nuisance and might involve a trespass without significant loss or damage and might be seen to be part of what we would encourage as lawful protest.</p>

	<p pid=".1251.1/1">To capture legitimate protests is not the purpose of our new clauses: an unlawful act has to be committed to trigger an offence under the provisions. We do not intend to make leafleting against an organisation unlawful. However, the example I gave was of leaflets alleging that someone is a paedophile being distributed around a neighbourhood as a means of intimidation and of getting that person to stop supplying a company that is involved in animal research. We do not intend those who legitimately leaflet against an organisation or the use of animals in experiments to be caught under the new offence.</p>

	<p pid=".1251.2/1">Although I am conscious of the time, this is our only opportunity to debate these new clauses. I accept that the Minister's intention is to catch the serious defamation that she described, not lawful protest. My question is whether the wording provides for that distinction.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.2/2">Also, the Minister did not answer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> about why the words &quot;an act amounting to&quot; precede &quot;a criminal offence&quot; in new clause 10(3)(a) and new clause 11(5)(a).</p>

	<p pid=".1251.3/1">I said that I would come back to the point raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, and I shall.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/2">If leaflets contain material deemed threatening or offensive, the threatening limb of the intimidation offence may be engaged, but most people involved in peaceful legitimate protest make their argument against an activity without threatening or intimidating the people involved. I hope that that clarifies the provision.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/3">Opposition amendment (b) to new clause 11 proposes to extend the offence in the new clause. The amendment would not extend the offence significantly, since the words it inserts would still be governed by the preamble to subsection (1), namely</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/4" class="indent">&quot;with the intention of causing a second person (B) to abstain from doing something which B is entitled to do (or to do something which B is entitled to abstain from doing)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/5">The amendment would expressly catch a case where an unlawful act was accompanied by the threat of further unlawful acts unless the victim yielded. That situation is more than adequately covered by new clause 11. Furthermore, our definition of a person with a financial interest for the purpose of new clause 11 is simple and straightforward and I am not convinced that it needs to be changed as proposed in amendment (c).</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/6">New clause 12 proposes a maximum five year sentence for both the offences. We do not propose such a long maximum sentence lightly. We do so because we think that the campaigns of the extremists are very serious and designed to disturb peoples' peace of mind and coerce them. New clause 13 defines an animal research organisation for the purposes of the amendment. It includes the employers of those who hold individual or project licences for research under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 or are specified in certificates issued in respect of places that may be used for breeding and supplying animals for research, and the owners or lessors of the places where they work.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/7">We believe that the tactics being used by animal rights extremists are so serious that tough new measures are needed to address them. There is a pattern of behaviour and an organised network of people carrying out well planned unlawful acts. That is why we are restricting the scope of the clause to persons connected to animal research organisations. Various views on that were expressed during our debate in Standing Committee. We recognise that, in future, there might be other, similar campaigns by extremists affecting organisations working in other fields. New clause 14 therefore proposes that the offences be capable of extension by means of an order subject to the affirmative procedure, if it can be shown that there has been a series of incidents that would have been offences under the new provisions had they been committed against someone connected to an animal experimenting company. We believe that that will provide adequate safeguards to ensure that the new offences are extended only where necessary and appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/8">We are mindful that the provisions of the new clauses are historic in that they tackle certain types of protest. We realise that many people outside the House are concerned that they will affect peaceful and legitimate debate and protest. I hope that they will accept my assurances that the provisions will not do so. We are responding to a specific problem that has emerged: we are faced with a group of people who have developed cowardly tactics of attacking vulnerable third parties to put pressure on organisations carrying out research involving animals. Our new clauses are a targeted and proportionate response to their campaign. The penalties provided reflect the appalling consequences of the campaign on the commercial partners, customers and suppliers of animal research organisations, and the relatives and friends of those associated with research organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/9">Government amendments Nos. 99, 100 and 110 are consequential on new clauses 10 to 14.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/10">I fully understand the concern and thinking that lie behind new clause 5 and I am sympathetic to them. The new clause is clearly designed to protect any company or other undertaking that is the target of harassment, violence or criminal damage that then results in it being caused financial damage. However, we have a major concern about the new clause: it is clear that it would be triggered only when financial damage had actually been suffered. The offences in our own new clauses are triggered by threats to take unlawful action&mdash;that is a crime or a tort causing damage&mdash;aimed at specified persons connected with an animal research organisation; there is therefore no requirement for the person to have suffered damage. We are trying to prevent the damage taking hold. The measure that we propose does not rest, as new clause 5 does, upon being able to show that damage has been caused.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/11">In addition, I am not convinced that the list of connected persons set out in new clause 5 is comprehensive enough. We are concerned that it could be exploited by those seeking to target particular companies. I therefore oppose new clause 5 and amendment No. 8, which would amend the long title of the Bill. I am sympathetic to the thinking that lies behind the proposals, which is why the Government have introduced their own measures to protect companies. I hope that hon. Members will discern the similarities between new clause 5 and Government new clause 10.</p>
	<p pid=".1251.3/12">The Government new clauses will provide significant additional protection for animal research organisations so that they can continue their vital service to the health of the nation. I hope that they will have the full support of the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1253.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/854" speakername="Jonathan Djanogly" colnum="1253"  time="19:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-27.htm#50207-27_spnew4">
	<p pid=".1253.0/1">I welcome the progress made both during and after the Committee stage on issues relating to animal rights extremism. We will now have in the Bill provisions that, if it is enacted, should provide extra assistance in protecting the public from the campaigns of violence and intimidation being waged by animal rights extremists. The measures will make it an offence to harass two or more people on separate occasions; they should also help to prevent the harassment of a person in his home, although the Bill as it stands does not extend that protection to a person's workplace, where many such incidents occur.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/2">I thank the Minister for having taken the time to meet me last week to discuss the new clauses that the Government have now tabled. In normal circumstances, we would have hoped for a far more substantial period of consultation&mdash;not least to consider the legal language and concepts in the new clauses, which are both novel and complicated. None the less, my hon. Friends and I welcome the Government's decision to table the additional measures to combat animal rights terrorism. They seem finally to have realised the need to tackle a disturbing trend in the activities of animal rights terrorists.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/3">I know from my constituency and elsewhere that the last few years have brought increasing numbers of attacks on so-called secondary and tertiary targets. Primary targets&mdash;the animal research organisations themselves, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences&mdash;have been able to make progress, albeit at great cost, in the fight against the criminals. By increasing the use of injunctions against known terror groups, they have been able significantly to reduce the incidence of attacks on their facilities and their staff.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/4">However, the result of those successes has been a switch in the tactics used by those desperate groups and individuals. Before, they attacked the animal researchers in their laboratories; now, the easier option for the terrorists, which enables them to avoid the injunctions, is to unleash violence and intimidation on people away from their place of business&mdash;for instance, in their homes, furtively and in the middle of night&mdash; or against anyone seen to be in any way connected to the research organisations. Such secondary targets could include a building contractor working on the primary research facility. Even more tenuously, a tertiary target could be as distant as a fund manager maintaining a shareholding in that building company, or even, as was the case in Staffordshire, a pub frequented by workers at the secondary target.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/5">I was recently made aware of an example involving Fidelity, one of the world's largest fund management companies. In the UK, Fidelity was targeted by animal rights extremists who disrupted a key part of its business activities&mdash;a roadshow event, in which it marketed its products to independent financial advisers. The so-called justification for that action was Fidelity's investment activity. It was enough that it had invested in BOC, which in turn had a business relationship with Huntingdon Life Sciences. BOC, of course, has since withdrawn its custom from HLC. Unsurprisingly, individuals and businesses in that chain are struggling to cope with the barrage of violence that is unleashed against them because they are perceived to be connected with the main target. As I pointed out on Second Reading, many targeted companies have agreed to sever their links with animal research organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/6">Few organisations can afford the effort and the tens of thousands of pounds required to obtain injunctions. Indeed, many companies that could afford injunctions are reluctant to obtain them as they regard it as the role of the state to defend them and their employees. Accordingly, many companies have been forced, often with great reluctance, to abandon perfectly legal business operations&mdash;out of necessity, they believe&mdash;so that they can safeguard their employees and their premises. Along with a number of individuals and groups I have, for a number of years, highlighted the urgent need to extend the law to protect these wider victims of animal rights terrorism. Groups representing city institutions, such as the National Association of Pension Funds, are waiting to take their lead from Government, so naturally I am delighted that the Government have finally decided to heed the calls for action. To put it simply: better late than never.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/7">Government new clause 10, entitled &quot;Interference with contractual relationships so as to harm animal research organisation&quot;, would make it a criminal offence for someone to carry out or threaten to carry out a criminal or tortious act intended to cause, or likely to cause, the victim not to enter into a contract with a third party, or to breach an existing contract. A tortious act is a non-criminal act, for which damages are usually claimed in a civil court. For someone to be liable for the offence they must act with the intention of harming an animal research organisation. Harming in this context means causing any type of loss or damage to the    organisation or, alternatively, hindering that organisation in carrying out any of its activities. I am pleased that the Government have come round to the idea of introducing a measure to protect the economic interests of those affected by extremists. It is those very economic interests that animal rights terror groups unjustly seek to destroy.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/8">The clause clearly springs from the foundations provided by various people in recent months. The Minister mentioned new clause 5, which my hon. Friends and I tabled and which is in many respects similar to Government new clause 10. Overall, we support the Government new clause as well as the other Government new clauses, but there are a number of areas on which we would be grateful for clarification. First, can the Minister confirm that the definition of a person in Government new clauses 10 and 11 is intended to cover legal as well as natural persons&mdash;in other words, companies? If not, the Government will not have gone as far as I aimed to go in new clause 5, which would have provided protection for companies.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/9">On the other hand, if companies are covered, would the drafting of new clause 10 mean that the perpetrator of the offence, person A, could be a company or a non-registered group such as Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty&mdash;SHAC? That is important, because SHAC has often claimed that it cannot be prosecuted because it is not an organisation as such. We welcome the step-by-step requirements that apply to the offence in Government new clauses 10 and 11, including the carrying out or threatening of a wrongful act, the resulting damage to a contractual relationship or intended relationship, and the necessary intention on the part of the perpetrator.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/10">The need for all those requirements to be met should protect against wrongful convictions, but has the Minister considered the practical difficulties in establishing all those steps satisfactorily so that convictions can be secured? There is no point in having available new offences with which to charge people if it proves too difficult to secure convictions. I should be grateful for clarification about whom the new clause is intended to protect.</p>
	<p pid=".1253.0/11">The drafting of subsection (2) is entirely free of ambiguity&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".1255.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making the point, as he has done before, that it may be difficult to catch people under the provision because of the lack of police intelligence. There is a need to beef up police activity. The problem is not the width of the provision, although it is rather wide. &quot;Hinder&quot;, for example, is a wide term, and extends beyond harm.</p>

	<p pid=".1255.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, and I shall come on to deal with the width of the provision. None the less, it sets out a series of steps, and the Minister should consider whether the process will be satisfactory in securing convictions.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/2">Our amendment (b) aims to maximise the protection afforded by Government new clause 10. I accept what the Minister said, but the new clause may require further review. We will not, however, push the matter to a vote. In the scenario envisaged in subsection (2) the actions or threats of the perpetrator&mdash;person A&mdash;would have to damage the contractual arrangements between the victim, known as person B, and a third person known as person C. A tertiary target would appear to be covered by that drafting.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/3">Take, for example, a company supplying building materials to a building contractor working at an animal research facility. If the supplier were forced to terminate the contract to supply the builders, they would be protected as person B. What is the position of secondary targets? I cannot imagine that the Government have deliberately sought to exclude them, but the drafting may leave room for that possibility, because the term &quot;animal research organisation&quot; is specifically used in the provision. The question is whether those research organisations would fall within the definition of &quot;a third person&quot;. In my example, would the contractual relationship between the building contractor and the animal research facility be protected? We would be grateful if the Minister addressed that point.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/4">We have another query about Government new clauses 10 and 11. As an alternative to a criminal act, both clauses would allow for the offending act to be a tortious act that causes the victim to suffer loss or damage of any description. Could the Minister explain whether the intention is to catch the many and varied torts that exist under English law? Perhaps what was originally envisaged was trespass against the person, such as assault, or trespass on land. Defamation is also a tort&mdash;was the intention that threatening to libel someone would be enough to form the basis of the offence? The Minister gave the example of neighbours being wrongfully and shamefully informed by SHAC that a targeted individual was a paedophile. I will not go into any further legal details, but I would be grateful if the Minister addressed that issue.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/5">Liberal Democrat amendment (a) to Government new clause 10&mdash;the same wording is used in amendment (a) to new clause 11&mdash;aims to quantify loss or damage, presumably so that minor tortious acts are not caught. I sympathise with that approach, but it is rather a blunt instrument. I acknowledge, however, that the other place may wish to review the issue in greater detail. The offence created by Government new clause 11 would arise where person A intimidates person B because B is connected with an animal research organisation. A connected person would include employees and their family members, customers and suppliers. The intimidation would be a threat by person A that they, or someone else, would commit a criminal or tortious act causing loss or damage of some description. The perpetrator's intention must be to cause the victim to abstain from doing something that he is entitled to do, or to do something that he is entitled not to do.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/6">Will the Minister clarify the meaning of</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/7" class="indent">&quot;a person with a financial interest in an animal research organisation&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/8">in new clause 11? We took that to include shareholders. In amendment (c) to new clause 11, we propose the insertion of a new paragraph to ensure that the provision covers anyone who is undertaking any regulated activity or who is an authorised person under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, including fund managers. The Minister said that that was already covered, and I am grateful for her clarification.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/9">Amendment (b) would insert additional wording in subsection (l)(a) of Government new clause 11, and aims to equalise the protection offered by the two new clauses. It seems that in new clause 10, the carrying out of, as well as a threat to carry out, a criminal or tortious act would allow for conviction where contractual relationships were affected. Yet new clause 11 appears to contain a loophole, as it refers only to threatening, rather than carrying out, a criminal or tortious act. In theory, if an animal rights extremist carried out an act to intimidate someone, without having first threatened them, would they not be caught under the provision? If that were the case, some of the connected persons listed in new clause 11 might be protected by new clause 10. However, that would be the case only if they were involved in a contractual relationship that they had been forced to breach, abandon or not enter into as a result of intimidation. For other types of connected person, such as spouses or friends, new clause 10 with its focus on contracts would be of no use.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/10">In new clause 12, we welcome the proposed five-year maximum sentence for offences under new clauses 10 and 11. That rightly reflects the seriousness with which those activities should be treated. Similarly, we agree with the Government's proposal to require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions for proceedings to commence. That seems a sensible way to address the politically contentious nature of this matter, which requires a fair balance to be struck between the right to non-violent freedom of expression, the need to protect individuals and businesses from unacceptable criminality, and the need to achieve a degree of standardisation across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/11">Subject to the issues that I have raised, it will be clear to the House that on the whole, my hon. Friends and I support the Government's proposals. However, those proposals do not go far enough. In particular, without detracting in any way from the need to protect individuals, I argue that further protection for company activity is needed. In Committee I tabled a number of amendments that would have provided that, but they did not receive Government support. Confidentiality orders should extend beyond directors to prevent the identity of threatened company shareholders being made available to the public. The need for that cannot be better demonstrated than by citing the example of HLS, which was forced to undertake the burden of re-listing in Maryland in the USA, because that jurisdiction allowed shareholder details to be kept out of the public domain. Similarly, we sought to protect the identity of lenders to companies, as their details allow them to be singled out as secondary targets.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/12">Most significantly, by tabling new clause 5 on Report we sought to introduce an offence of causing economic damage to companies. For the first time, that would have specifically protected all companies and connected persons from the financial damage resulting from harassment, violence and damage to the property. In new clause 14 the Government propose that their new offences could be extended by way of delegated legislation to organisations involved in areas other than animal research. Although we accept that the Government are taking legislation further down the road, we do not believe that this piecemeal approach goes far enough. There are already industries other than animal research that are suffering at the hands of extremists. Where animal research organisations are suffering today, other industries will follow. Road builders and leather manufacturers are just two examples that spring to mind.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/13">I was recently updated about the continuing economic sabotage faced by companies in the agricultural biotechnology industry. The Government require full testing of genetically modified crops, yet with the difficulties in providing continuous security there seem to be few means of protecting their destruction by activists. Furthermore, companies and their staff have been targeted by means of the same tactics as those employed by animal rights groups. I was told that links have been uncovered between the targeting of the GM and the animal research industries by the same people. By limiting their new clause to animal research, the Government have failed to appreciate the pressing issues arising in other areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/14">However, the introduction of new legislation by the Government is a positive step, and we will support the economic damage provisions. Accordingly, I shall not press our alternative new clause 5 to a Division, although in recognition of the lack of consultation and the drafting amendments required to new clause 11, I shall press amendment (b) to that new clause, keeping in mind the need for the other place to consult on those provisions during the passage of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/15">Finally, new laws are far from the whole answer. A much wider range of tactics must be adopted if we are to become more effective at dealing with the threats from economic extremists. A code for protesters similar to the existing picketing code could allow for legitimate protest, while freeing police and court resources. Judges and the police should have best practice guidance to ensure that there is a consistent approach to arrest, conviction and sentencing, not least in relation to new clauses 10 and 11. Two terrorists were jailed after orchestrating a campaign of thousands of telephone calls to research companies to block their lines. Imagine the industry's horror when those criminals' sentences were recently slashed on appeal.</p>
	<p pid=".1255.1/16">Police forces must have adequate funding and training to make use of existing legislation, and any new measures that make it on to the statute book will need to be properly funded. Overstretched local Crown Prosecution Service lawyers can be left vulnerable in the face of experienced lawyers acting, often pro bono, on behalf of accused protesters. Almost a year ago the Government promised a team of specialist central prosecutors to deal with this issue. Where are they? I do not see them. We do not believe that the national extremism tactical co-ordination unit receives nearly enough resources to allow it to deal with such matters effectively. I do not want to state in public the number of people involved with the unit or the time that they spend on their work, but the Minister knows what those numbers are and how inadequate the situation is. All these examples are aspects that must be addressed. The actions of a tiny minority must not be allowed to continue to blight the lives of individuals and the workings of companies. Leadership and further action from the Government are called for without delay.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1259.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1259"  time="19:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-29.htm#50207-29_spnew0">
	<p pid=".1259.0/1">I welcome the Government's engagement with the issue. We have made progress, and careful consideration has been given to points made in Committee by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" name="Evan Harris">my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> and myself, among others. We all want to ensure that the law is adequate to provide protection for people going about their proper business. At the same time we want to ensure that the proper ability to protest is not curtailed. There is a world of difference between somebody who is protesting in a proper way about something that they feel strongly about, and somebody who is engaged in criminal activity in order to intimidate others into doing things that they would not otherwise do.</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/2">We welcome the provisions of the new clauses, but because they were not tabled in Committee&mdash;this is not a criticism&mdash;we must now ask some of the questions that we would otherwise have asked at an earlier stage. I want some small clarifications of the drafting. That will be relevant when the matter is discussed in another place, where I am sure it will be examined more carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/3">In new clause 10(1) there is a slightly novel approach in the reference to an act or threat that is</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/4" class="indent">&quot;intended or likely to cause a second person (B) to take any of the steps in subsection (2).&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/5">The mens rea is deferred, so to speak. Somebody has committed what is considered to be a criminal offence or a tortious act, but they may not have the intention ascribed to the initiator, nor may the person who initiated the act, in the case of another person. There is a slight legal quandary there which needs further explanation and exploration.</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/6">I queried the difference in subsection (3)(a) and (b) between</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/7" class="indent">&quot;an act amounting to a criminal offence&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/8">and</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/9" class="indent">&quot;a tortious act&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/10">which is not described as an act amounting to a tortious act. We have not received an answer to that, but we will get one in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/11">I am worried about the rather wide definition of a tortious act and what is included in it. When the Minister was trying to explain, she mentioned a serious libel&mdash;in fact I think it was a criminal libel, but I am not enough of a lawyer to remember which categories constitute criminal libel. I thought that accusing someone of an indictable offence was one of those categories. Clearly, the provision will catch simple defamation. Perhaps the hon. Lady will confirm that. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon made the point that tort could include simple trespass, which would be unlikely to cause significant loss or damage. Hence our probing amendment to establish w otherwise hat was intended to fall into that category.</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/12">Subsection (5)(b) contains a very wide definition:</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/13" class="indent">&quot;to prevent or hinder the carrying out by the organisation of any of its activities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/14">I want the measure to be an effective tool to fight a particular abuse. I do not want it to be infinitely extendable to inappropriate purposes. Preventing or hindering the carrying out of any activity is an extremely wide provision, and I expect those in another place to examine it closely.</p>
	<p pid=".1259.0/15">I shall close now because, sadly, we are running out of time, as has been the case during all our debates today, which I regret. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/854" name="Jonathan Djanogly">The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly)</phrase> said that he would press his amendment (b) to new clause 11 to a Division. My understanding is that he intends to ensure that it is an offence under new clause 11 for a tortious act to be committed&mdash;in other words, one of the two categories, but not that which amounts to a criminal offence, because it clearly is a criminal offence by definition&mdash;rather than threatened. Will the Minister explain whether she believes that that is covered elsewhere, and if so, how? Otherwise, I shall support the hon. Gentleman's amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1260.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/889" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="1260"  time="20:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-29.htm#50207-29_spnew1">
	<p pid=".1260.0/1">We have had a useful debate exploring the nature of people engaged in acts against those working directly for animal research organisations and those associated with them. There is common agreement that we have got to the point where we have to do something about that issue.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/2">I remind the House that during the past year there has been a step change in how the police, the prosecution services and others have been working together to deal with one of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/854" name="Jonathan Djanogly">the points raised by the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly)</phrase>, which is that we can have the laws, but we also have to have enforcement. When we are dealing with people who come in the dead of night to vandalise other people's property and throw acid on their cars, trying to build the evidence base to bring successful prosecutions to court is not easy. It has been particularly difficult when they have taken action against people in supply companies in different parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/3">We have made huge progress in this area with the establishment of the national extremist tactical unit in Cambridge, which is not considering the issue piecemeal, but is connecting the intelligence from a variety of activities and actions involving those people throughout the country. That is why we are starting to see better use of court time to prosecute. There has also been the use of antisocial behaviour orders by communities to see what justice they can get. Let us not forget that other measures were agreed in Committee to tackle harassment and protests outside people's homes, which should be seen as part of the package. I wanted to say that because I did not think it was right to let it pass, considering some of the comments about inactivity.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/4">I shall try to deal with some of the points that have been made. In the short time I have, I shall probably not do them justice, but I am sure the issue will come back in another place. I am happy to continue to discuss matters with Opposition spokespeople afterwards as well. I was asked whether building contractors working for animal research organisations would be caught, and the answer is yes. The issue was raised as to whether new clause 11 covers unlawful acts or only threats of them. The proposal is specifically aimed at tackling intimidation, but we shall further consider the points made this evening to ensure that we have got that right.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/5">I was also asked what the term &quot;person&quot; covers. It refers to any person who can be identified in law, including companies, other corporate bodies and unincorporated associations. It should be remembered that some crimes and torts can be committed only by real people.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/6">A question was raised as to whether the Government intend to catch all tortious acts. The answer is no, only tortious acts that cause loss or damage. As was mentioned, some torts such as trespass may or may not result in loss or damage. We have tried to confine what can be a broad area of actions in terms of law.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/7">The term,</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/8" class="indent">&quot;a person with a financial interest&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/9">which appears in new clause 11, means anyone with a financial interest, including an owner, a shareholder, a bond holder and so on. I hope that clarifies the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> asked about the wording of new clause 10, which refers to</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/11" class="indent">&quot;an act amounting to a criminal offence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/12">The words have been chosen to make the language precise, because the provisions refer to &quot;a relevant act&quot;; we wanted to give some more detail on that. The definition is of a relevant act, so both subsections 3(a) and 3(b) refer to an act that amounts to a criminal offence and a tortious act. There is nothing unusual in that wording, which is intended to make the clause more precise.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/13">The hon. Gentleman also asked whether &quot;tortious act&quot; catches defamation. It does, provided that loss or damage has been caused. That is the key issue. He asked another question on the same point: what amounts to a criminal offence? It means doing something in circumstances that make it a criminal offence&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/14" class="italic">It being three and a half hours after the commencement of proceedings on consideration of the Bill, Madam Deputy Speaker, pursuant to Order [3 February], put forthwith the question already proposed from the Chair.</p>
	<p pid=".1260.0/15" class="italic">Question agreed to.</p>

	<p pid=".1270.0/1">The purpose of the amendments is to create a category of front-line officers of SOCA, classed as police members. Under our new clause and amendments, police members would have the powers that police officers, Revenue officers, Customs officers and immigration officers currently exercise. The amendments would remove the confusion that the mix-and-match designations of part 1, chapter 2 anticipate.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/2">The amendments revert to issues that my hon. Friends and I raised in Standing Committee on 11 January. We listened carefully to the Under-Secretary's response to those amendments. We took her comments into account and our amendments are now a little different from those that we tabled previously. We were encouraged when she told us on Second Reading and in Committee that she would consider drafting amendments on training.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/3">Some of the Under-Secretary's comments in Committee seemed to us to arise from a misapprehension about the intent and effect of our amendments, and I therefore wish to deal with that misconception at the outset. I believe that the Under-Secretary may have understood our amendments to have the effect that all SOCA staff would have to be police constables. That was a misunderstanding on her part.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/4">SOCA will have many members of staff, including accountants, forensic scientists and staff who have come from the Crown Prosecution Service. Some staff will come from Customs. Others might come from the Financial Services Authority. No doubt there will be lawyers&mdash;probably many lawyers. There will be support staff&mdash;secretaries, chiefs of staff and so on. Nobody in their right mind would suggest that they should all be required to hold the post of constable.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/5">The debate deals with front-line staff. By that I mean those who will exercise powers of entry, investigation, seizure and arrest. The thrust of our amendments is that those front-line staff should hold the office of constable. We do not mean the tea boy, the backroom staff or the lawyers, but those who exercise police powers. They should be constables.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/6">Lying behind those amendments are some points of fundamental difference between us and the Government. The Under-Secretary said in Committee:</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/7" class="indent">&quot;SOCA will not be a police force and, consequently, should not be staffed by police officers.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 11 January 2005; c. 38.]</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/8">She also said:</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/9" class="indent">&quot;I strongly refute the argument that only police officers can be entrusted with police powers.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 11 January 2005; c. 37.]</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/10">We disagree with both assertions.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/11">Let me deal with two crucial matters that need to be understood and fully appreciated before our amendments can be considered. The first is the historical significance and importance of the office of constable. The second is an understanding of the way in which the Bill, as presented, proposes to give what might broadly be described as &quot;police powers&quot; to SOCA staff.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/12">Although today's police forces are the creation of statute and the police have numerous statutory powers and duties, from a legal point of view, a police force is essentially neither more nor less than several individual constables, whose status derives from the common law. The office of constable dates back to the parish constable, who, by the beginning of the 17th century, was responsible for the preservation of the peace in his bailiwick and for the execution of the orders and warrants of the justices of the peace. The constable's oath and close relationship with the justices of the peace characterised him as a ministerial officer of the Crown, like a sheriff or the JPs themselves, rather than as a local administrative officer. In short, constables have never been civil servants.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/13">Various enactments were passed in the 19th and 20th centuries, providing for the establishment of police forces. Powers were not conferred on members of police forces as such, but a member of a police force on appointment had to be attested as a constable by making a declaration. A member of a police force now has all the powers and privileges of a constable throughout England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/14">The hallmark of the present day constable therefore remains, as it was in the 17th century, his attestation. Until so attested, constables have neither the authority nor the status of a constable. Once attested, the constable holds that office. That applies equally to members of police forces, special constables, and, of special note, the director general and police members of the National Crime Intelligence Service and the National Crime Squad.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/15">I draw attention to the fact that, when Parliament created NCIS and the NCS, it wisely saw fit to maintain the significance of the office of constable by creating a category of police members of those organisations. The Bill will abolish NCIS and the NCS and absorb those organisations into SOCA. What, then, is the precise status of a police constable?</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/16">When carrying out his duties as a constable, a member of a police force&mdash;of whatever rank&mdash;acts as an officer of the Crown and a public servant. Constables' powers are exercised by virtue of their office, and unless they are executing a warrant, the powers can be exercised only on their own responsibility. A police constable who deliberately fails to carry out his duties by wilfully omitting to take steps to preserve the Queen's peace or to protect a person under attack commits a criminal offence&mdash;the common law offence of misconduct of an officer of justice.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/17">The Crown is not liable for the wrongful acts of a member of a police force. Although a constable is an officer of the Crown and a public servant, his or her relationship with the Crown is not that of master and servant, nor that of principal and agent. He or she is a servant of the Crown only in the sense that any holder of a public office may be called a servant of the Crown or the state.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/18">Why does that matter in 2005? The answer is that it has important consequences for the nature of policing and the independence of our police force. Police officers cannot be dismissed on notice; they cannot take industrial action; they have a duty to act and report both on and off duty; and they are completely politically impartial. Those have all been characteristics of our police for at least the past 175 years. They derive from the office of constable. That is of great importance to the nature of policing in Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/19">Many years ago, it was simple to become a constable. All one had to do was go before a magistrate and take an oath. Today, however, those who exercise police powers undergo extensive training. On being recruited to a police force, constables are appointed on a two-year probationary period. It allows a mix of intensive training at residential centres and training on the beat with a tutor constable. Every new recruit goes through exactly the same basic training programme, which lasts 15 weeks at a national police training centre, followed by further training on the job. Recruits are then on probation for two years before they become fully fledged police officers.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/20">Training is in four stages. Recruits spend two weeks at their local force training centre familiarising themselves with police procedures and with the law. They then receive their uniform and make an official declaration as a police constable before a local magistrate. There then follows a 15-week intensive residential course, with continuous assessment and exams, strenuous physical activity, self-defence training and teaching of the law. Trainees are taught how to understand the criminal mind, and how to treat people fairly; that is all part of the course. After this, they return to their home force and are allocated an experienced tutor constable who guides them through the routines of police work. Trainees are then considered suitable for independent control, and progress to more advanced training. After two years' probation, they are required to attend further training locally before being appointed to the rank of constable.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/21">Is that training appropriate? We think that it is. Is it necessary? We think so. However, the Minister seems to think that it is unnecessary. The Bill, as it stands, will allow the director general of SOCA to confer police powers on someone who is not a constable, and who has had none of the training that I have just described. Hon. Members might find that scarcely credible.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/22">Let me turn to my second point. How does the Bill propose to grant SOCA staff police and other powers? Once we understand the present proposals for equipping SOCA staff with police powers, we immediately see that the Bill will create a deeply unsatisfactory regime, and that a radical rethink is clearly required.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/23">Clause 41 gives the director general the power to designate a member of staff as a person with the powers of a constable, a customs officer or an immigration officer. Who can be designated in such a way? A safeguard that the person should already have been trained and be qualified to exercise those powers would provide at least some comfort. However, the clause expressly provides that any member of SOCA's staff can be given any, or all, of those powers, whether or not he is already qualified to exercise them. That will be rather like a sheriff in the wild west riding into town and shelling out badges willy-nilly to the locals, regardless of their training.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/24">Let us look more closely at the process of designating a member of the staff of SOCA as a person having the powers of a constable. In the case of a designated constable, there is no requirement for this second-class constable to take an oath of attestation. He will have the powers of the constable, but not, it seems, their duties and responsibilities. The effect of clause 41(5) will be that, if an employee of SOCA was a constable before he became designated by the director general, his tenure of the office of constable will be suspended. So these second-class constables would be able, it seems, to take industrial action, just as customs and immigration officers can do at present.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/25">It might appear from clause 44 that a designation as constable brings with it all the powers and privileges of that office, but that is not so. In fact, the designation made by the director general can be made subject to limitations as to the powers exercisable, or as to the purposes for which the powers are exercised. So there will be second-class constables with second-class powers. As I said in Committee, lawyers will have a field day trying to work out whether, in any particular case, the powers exercised by a constable designate were within his authorisation or were exercised for an authorised purpose. This will certainly not help to combat serious or organised crime. Worse still, persons can be designated as constables for a fixed period under clause 41(2)(b), and the designation, even if originally given without a time limit, can always be withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/26">The Police Federation reports that a straw poll of NCS officers shows that an overwhelming 95 per cent. of serving NCS officers stated that they were unwilling to transfer to SOCA. That is hardly surprising. Quite apart from the wholly unsatisfactory nature of the arrangements, from the point of view of those unfortunate enough to be designated as temporary, second-class, limited-power constables, what is the position for those over whom these constables designate seek to exercise their powers? When someone is challenged by a police officer, they are surely entitled to know what the powers of that constable are. Improper exercise of police powers is rare, and the fact that anyone can discover, if they wish to, what powers a police officer has, by virtue of his or her office, is a useful way of maintaining that state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/27">What will be the position if someone is challenged by a constable designate? How are they to know whether the designation is still in force, and more importantly, how are they to know whether the powers that the constable designate seeks to exercise have in fact been granted to him? Should constables designate carry round with them a list of the powers that the director general has decided to grant them, together with a list of those that they have not been granted? Of course, they will also need to demonstrate not only that they have the powers, but that they are exercising them for one of the purposes for which they have been authorised. There must be a better way to equip front-line SOCA staff with the powers that they will need.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/28">I have explained, by way of background, what it means to be a police constable, and described the proposals in the Bill for creating pale imitations to deal with serious and organised crime. Having also painted a picture of the risks inherent in the mix-and-match scheme proposed in clause 41(2), I shall now turn to our amendments. Instead of the second-class constables designate proposed in the Bill, we propose to create a single category of front-line SOCA staff, to be known as police members of SOCA. To become a police member of SOCA, a person must be a constable, and have the powers and duties of a constable.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/29">So this is, in a sense, an all-or-nothing situation. It is simple. In Committee, the Minister said that that was a disadvantage in our proposals, and that SOCA needed flexibility. To an extent, that is right. That is why we no longer propose that all SOCA police members should have all the rights of police officers, customs officers and immigration officers. However, we do not agree that it is sensible to create half-baked policemen and women, especially for SOCA. That might indeed be flexible, but it would be most unwise.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/30">First, such a move would lead to a bureaucratic nightmare in which everyone had a different suite of mix-and-match powers, limited as to time and purpose, and constrained as to extent. Secondly, it would lead to a defence lawyers' field day. When the bust took place, they would ask, who exactly exercised which powers? Were the relevant individuals properly authorised? Who exactly seized which evidence? Which specific powers did that person have?</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/31">Thirdly, such a measure would massively overcomplicate the training requirements. It is surely much simpler to say that, if a person is to exercise police powers, they must have had police training. As has been said, that training programme is well established. It is tried and tested, and has proved to provide a coherent approach to the training that is necessary before the powers of a constable can be exercised. Let me make the same point in another way. Our proposal avoids the need for SOCA to reinvent the wheel in terms of police training. We agree that there should be provision for front-line SOCA officers to be able to exercise customs or immigration-officer powers and we propose to enable such powers to be added to the armoury of police members of SOCA.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/32">The powers of customs and immigration officers are not as extensive as the powers of a police officer, and that is reflected in the training requirements. Immigration officers receive five weeks' training in the case of passport control officers and eight weeks' training in the case of immigration enforcement officers. All entrants then serve a probationary period of one year. Customs officers have a structured, in-house, six-week pre-entry training programme that combines on-the-job training with residential courses. Following a six-week period, they are placed with a mentor for the first month of the job.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/33">Under our proposals, a police member of SOCA may exercise the powers of an immigration officer or customs officer, but that is subject to a proviso. The proviso is, in either case, that the person has exercised those powers before or has undergone such training as would otherwise entitle him to exercise them. The advantage is, again, that it avoids the need to reinvent the wheel in terms of devising appropriate training.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/34">Let me say something about our core proposals. Amendment No. 38 aims to provide a new definition of &quot;police members of SOCA&quot;. I repeat that it refers to front-line staff. These men and women should be constables. There are other consequential amendments, but the gist is in that one. Under new clause 7, a police member of SOCA will have the powers of a constable. To those powers may be added the powers of a customs officer or immigration officer, provided that the person concerned has been appropriately trained or has exercised the powers before.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/35">Let me try to put these important proposals in context. The whole purpose of SOCA, as we understand it, is to strengthen the powers available for the prevention and detection of serious organised crime. Essentially, those are policing functions, and the last thing that is required is for the SOCA front line to be staffed by second-rate policemen and policewomen. It seems to us that all front-line SOCA staff who exercise powers of investigation and arrest, and who exercise warrants and so on, ought to have the full range of powers of a police constable and be subject to the same duties. Our new clause and amendments allow those powers to be bolstered by the addition of powers that can be exercised by customs and by immigration powers, but they build in the necessary safeguards involving training or prior experience of exercising those powers.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/36">Our proposals have the great merit of simplicity. The Government's proposals are too complex, and will lead to confusion. They will require the director general of SOCA to devise a complex bureaucracy for handing out and monitoring mix-and-match powers. They will require him to devise a series of training schemes. They will require him to start from scratch rather than building on available structures and experience. The Government say that that has the merit of flexibility; we think that a fairer description of their proposals is &quot;a recipe for confusion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1270.0/37">Bold action is needed if SOCA is to have a realistic prospect of achieving its aims. Serious and organised crime calls for investigation and prevention by officers with serious and properly organised powers, and our new clause and amendments achieve that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1276.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1276"  time="20:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-34.htm#50207-34_spnew0">
	<p pid=".1276.0/1">I do not want to spend too much time on the detail of my amendments. I want to deal with the wider issue of the office of constable, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" name="Andrew Mitchell">the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> has done. First, however, let me record my appreciation of Government amendment No. 67, which strengthens the provisions by making it absolutely clear that a person designated under clause 41 must have not just the appropriate background and expertise but the necessary training.</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/2">In Committee, one of the matters that concerned me was the application of the agency to Scotland. Officers designated to work there would work under an entirely different jurisdiction and legal system. They would have to develop very different relationships with, for instance, the procurator fiscal. They would have to understand how the system worked, and to understand that the provisions were different from those in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. I am satisfied that the Government have at least gone some way towards satisfying my concerns in that area.</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/3">If one is not careful, it is quite easy to slip into pomposity when talking about the office of constable but it is an important issue that matters to the men and women who serve in our police forces. I have never had any doubts about that in my fairly long connection with the police service. People who are sworn in as constables recognise that that is an important, significant and historic role that carries with it not only duties and responsibilities, but protections, which are not to be lightly ignored, including protection from undue influence. They are not civil servants. They are not at the beck and call of a Minister of the Crown. They are officers of the Crown in their own right, capable of making their own decisions and not to be persuaded inappropriately against their instincts to take a wrong action.</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/4">Our police officers are extremely concerned about the Government's attitude to the definition of what constitutes a constable and an officer of the Crown. It seems to them that a top-level agency is to deal with high-level crime without anyone in it who is a constable, other than under temporary designation. They look at the role of community support officers. I support such officers, but I have concerns, which are shared widely, that a creep in their powers and responsibilities will take them more and more into normal municipal policing for many areas, and that that will not only prevent them from doing the job that they were originally intended to do but reduce the scope for police constables.</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/5">Provisions later in the Bill, which I suspect we may not have an opportunity to debate later, deal with the removal of the custody sergeant, a key element in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, a key protection not only for the police officer but for the public and for those who are arrested. Police officers see that role being passed over to civilian officers, which is not, I understand, a particularly popular move. This week, the new Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, told <i>Police Review</i> that he was</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/6" class="indent">&quot;waiting to be given a very persuasive argument&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/7">over the switch</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/8" class="indent">&quot;and at the moment I have not heard one&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/9">That is a fairly damning assessment. A similar view was expressed by West Yorkshire police, so there are doubts even at senior levels about that change. The Government's proposals have yet to allay those concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/10">Most of all, the police fear that the important role that has been assigned to them as constables is being squeezed from below and above until, if we are not careful, we will have a police service that is a gendarmerie dealing with disturbance at a major level, but not with major crime, petty misdemeanours, low-level crime, or antisocial behaviour. That is not a future that they look at with any equanimity. They are concerned that the proposals do not recognise the important role that they play.</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/11">The main thrust of the Minister's argument in Committee&mdash;I hope that I am not unfairly summarising&mdash;was that SOCA is a brand new entity, it incorporates elements from different strands of interdiction and that, therefore, it would not be appropriate for it to be a police agency, any more than it would be appropriate for it to be a Customs agency or a security service agency. In Committee on 11 January the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/12" class="indent">&quot;SOCA's staff will be every bit as professional and independent as police officers, but I strongly refute the argument that only police officers can be entrusted with police powers. We have long since moved away from such a position.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 11 January 2005; c. 37.]</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/13">That is the concern in a nutshell of police officers&mdash;that it is the Government's view that police powers can be operated by a wide range of individuals who need not be police constables. That begs the question why we have the sworn constable any more.</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/14">I want to make it absolutely plain&mdash;again, we do not have long to debate this serious issue&mdash;that I stand four square behind the office of constable, which has served us well. It has ensured that our police service has been able to resist the blandishments of politicians or the baying of the mob, and that is right and proper. Whatever the Government say, SOCA is effectively a policing agency. It will be dealing with serious crime, it will have police officers in its ranks, it will be inspected by Her Majesty's chief inspector of constabulary, and I see no reason to divorce it from its predecessors. The National Criminal Intelligence Service, with which I had a long connection, was a hybrid organisation that successfully melded the constables within its ranks with members of other professions and none who served effectively within that organisation. I see no argument that suggests that that could not work equally well, as the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield says in the new clause, in the new organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".1276.0/15">Therefore, I shall support new clause 7 and recommend my right hon. and hon. Friends to do so too, but most of all I shall be supporting the principle that policing in this country is not a matter for paid officials of the Government, but for officers of the Crown, sworn constables, and that is something that we lose at our peril.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1277.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/889" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="1277"  time="20:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-34.htm#50207-34_spnew1">
	<p pid=".1277.0/1">The creation of SOCA has not happened overnight; it was the result of considerable consultation, not least the White Paper produced last year, but also of considerable discussion before that between SOCA's constituent parts&mdash;the National Crime Squad, NCIS, the drug investigation side of Customs and Excise and the immigration crime side of the Home Office. For a number of years now, as we discussed in Committee, there has been a recognition that in dealing with serious organised crime, whether in terms of drugs or immigration, there have been closer working relationships between people in those four organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/2">In many respects, the development of SOCA was a result of that closer working, and the recognition that, while there has been effective partnership&mdash;and full credit to all those involved&mdash;some convincing and positive prosecutions of criminals resulting in their being brought to justice, not enough positive progress was being made. It was also recognised that, in dealing with organised crime in the 21st century, the creation of the agency and the expanded powers in the Bill on Queen's evidence and disclosure powers, will give us greater strength to deal with the serious problems in this area, which may have an impact nationally and internationally, but which, at the end of the day, also have an impact regionally and locally in our communities on the streets.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" name="Andrew Mitchell">The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> says that his new clause and amendments are different from those tabled in Committee or that I did not understand him in Committee, but his explanation today is largely consistent with what was said in Committee. In effect, he is still calling for a national police agency. Clearly he, like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, is inspired by a sincere wish to preserve the position of constables, which he somehow sees as under threat as a result of the creation of SOCA. I have made it clear and will say again that that is absolutely not the case. It is the case, however, that many of the people whom we have consulted in relation to creating SOCA have said that change is needed. For example, the Association of Chief Police Officers has said:</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The new agency requires flexible and effective skills in its staff. ACPO does not believe that they have to be police officers and strongly supports the approach detailed in the SOCA Bill for agency officers to be designated with powers aligned to their particular investigative needs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/5">I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome about my additional amendment to the Bill in relation to training. An important point was raised. In drawing people to apply for jobs in SOCA, it is important that the director general is able to be mindful of their experience, as they will include those who have worked for police forces up and down the country, those who have worked in Customs and Excise, and others who may have skills and expertise in IT and intelligence and who might need limited designation of powers to be an effective part of a team.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/6">Much has been said this evening about the interference of politics in this area. In terms of the operational front line, this is all about making sure that the director general of SOCA is given powers that can be flexibly applied to people as he sees fit, while taking into account whether extensive training is necessary for those with previous experience. That is the situation, and it is a bone of contention between us and the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/7">SOCA will be a national law enforcement agency dedicated to fighting serious organised crime. Its staff will be highly regarded and respected in their own right as our excellent police forces currently are around the world. They are not in competition with those police forces, however. This is not about creating an elite of police officers, which we could accuse the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield of wanting to do with his amendments.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/8">Under the amendments, the police agency would be distorted by a view that those people best placed to serve it are police members, being individuals who were attested or sworn as constables or were members of police or special police forces. Were the amendments passed, those members of the agency who come in as customs officers and immigration officers would be seen as second-class. We do not want to be responsible for that. That would be a lost opportunity to bring together under one roof the operational experience and expertise of customs and immigration officers with that of the police agencies of the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the National Crime Squad, to create an agency that would be more than the sum of its parts.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/9">No doubt the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield will say, as he has pointed out, that the amendments provide that police members may exercise the powers of a customs or immigration officer together with those of a constable if they have the training or have held them before, even if, as I suspect, few will be in that last category. I am glad that, seemingly, we agree on one thing&mdash;that an individual can in principle have and exercise the powers of a constable, customs officer and immigration officer all at the same time. I am left wondering, however, why only a police member can potentially exercise the powers of all three, but not a customs or immigration officer, or even better, as we would have it, an employee of SOCA, free from his previous institution's baggage yet with all the experience and knowledge. The hon. Gentleman wants to have his cake and eat it on this issue, and he is fundamentally misunderstanding the aims of establishing SOCA and what we hope that it will achieve in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/10">I am almost left wondering whether the hon. Gentleman has thought of the impact of his amendments. I have already said that they would effectively create a super-police force. That would leave SOCA in, arguably, a worse position than the National Crime Squad, as under his approach, it has all the powers or none. Under the Police Reform Act 2002, however, the director general of NCS could designate staff as investigating officers with a limited array of police powers. Under his proposal, I suggest that that flexibility could be lost to SOCA. I have already mentioned the risk of creating an elitist culture and the potential for real or perceived inequality is obvious.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/11">The Bill is not about SOCA creaming off the brightest and the best from local police forces. It is about creating a new organisation to tackle certain problems. New clause 7 takes the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield to a place that he does not want to go.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/12">The Bill enshrines the point that SOCA's staff will be every bit as professional and independent as police officers. I strongly refute the argument that only police officers can be entrusted with police powers, and we have moved away from that position.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/13">I take the point raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that the perception that we do not value the role of the constable is a concern. We value that role, but we also recognise&mdash;as he acknowledged earlier&mdash;that other people, who may not have the full powers of a constable, can make a contribution to law enforcement.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/14">All the people who participate in protecting our communities&mdash;customs officers, immigration officers, community support officers, prison officers and investigating officers&mdash;discharge their duties. We value the office of constable and sworn police officers, which have their place as part of the police service. I emphasise that SOCA will not be a police force and should therefore not be seen to be staffed by police members, but it will be staffed by men and women who are every bit as professional, highly trained, dedicated and impartial in their work.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/15">I understand the hon. Gentleman's desire to ensure that the right people only have the powers of a constable and share his desire to ensure that the powers of constables, and indeed those of customs and immigration officer, are not distributed like confetti. Again, SOCA will take operational decisions on how it defines those people who should have different powers and on how it draws on the experience that people bring from different organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/16">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman that the director general of SOCA's carrying out of those functions will cause huge problems and that people who do not know their powers will cause huge legal problems down the line. In Committee, I said that it would be ridiculous for SOCA senior management to send people out on an investigation if those people were not aware of their powers and were therefore unable to bring successful prosecutions. It is ridiculous to suggest that that is a consequence of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/17">We have said that the delegation of those powers will be backed by training, a commitment underlined by Government amendment No. 67, which states that the director general must be satisfied that people have experience and training before he designates the relevant powers. The three conditions on the director general are listed in the Police Reform Act 2002 and concern the delegation of powers to police authority staff. Those conditions will apply, even if an individual has already held those powers, which will ensure that training is up to date.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/18">Government amendment No. 68 ties up some loose ends. As the Bill stands, the director general can delegate his power to designate powers. In effect, Government amendment No. 67 imposes a function on the director general, and Government amendment No. 68 simply ensures that that function can be delegated as part and parcel of the power to delegate the power to designate.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/19">I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield&mdash;I am not sure whether it will&mdash;that SOCA does not have to be created as a national police organisation to preserve the powers of a constable. I hope that he will withdraw new clause 7 and that the House will accept the two Government amendments.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/20">The amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) also appear to have been inspired by a wish to preserve the offices of those joining SOCA, including&mdash;it is notable that this is not exclusive, however&mdash;the office of constable. As I said in Committee, those police officers who wish to return to their police force after serving with SOCA will have had their position as constable suspended during that time. If someone wants to rejoin a police force, perhaps not even the one that they came from, that is one way in which their constable status could be revived.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/21">We are not convinced by the Liberal Democrat amendments, which might cause confusion. They would work if the person were to return to the service as the holder of their previous office, which would be treated as having been maintained by that person during their time in SOCA, but we would be none the wiser about the state of a person's office if they did not return to the service as a holder of that office.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/22">If the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome seeks simply to ensure that an office continues to be maintained while a person is an employee of SOCA, the amendments are unworkable. By virtue of their office while they were in SOCA, whether constable, immigration or customs, a person would be able to exercise the powers attached to that office. That would undermine any designations made by the director general on reasonable grounds in order to meet SOCA's operational priorities as the person would already start with that collection of powers, which he held by virtue of maintaining his existing office. The entire process of designation would be thrown into confusion. As has been said by the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield, the powers of constable are extensive and it is not the wish of SOCA that someone should come in with all those powers and be designated as appropriate to the work that that individual would be undertaking within SOCA.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/23">I will bring my remarks to an end. I have better manners than the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield who gave me no time to respond on the issue of intercept as evidence. However, there has been much comment&mdash;there has been some tonight&mdash;that somehow what we are doing is against the wishes of those who are involved in police organisations. I do not believe that that is true.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/24">I said in Committee and to representatives of the Police Federation that I do not believe that any member of the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service or, for that matter, anyone else, will sign up to the proposed organisation until they have seen the full terms and conditions, and that is absolutely appropriate. However, we know that there is real enthusiasm on the part of those working in those organisations for the direction that SOCA will take. It will make sense in terms of good partnership working. It will be a new organisation with a new direction and a new way of bringing people together with real skills. It will make a real difference to tackling organised crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1277.0/25">On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield will understand why creating SOCA is not only about creating another police force. It is about something that is entirely different. The effect of the agency will depend on how we organise it and on the people within it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause.</p>

	<p pid=".1282.0/1">I am cut to the quick by the hon. Lady's suggestion that I was being ill-mannered towards her earlier on. I wish to make it absolutely clear that Opposition Members hold her entirely unresponsible for the disgraceful timetabling motion that meant that we had only half an hour to discuss intercept evidence. She has always been extremely courteous to myself and to my colleagues. Let me set the record straight in that respect.</p>
	<p pid=".1282.0/2">I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady and I have been willing to be persuaded by her eloquent argument. Sadly, however, she has not brought me to that view. I listened to what she said about the National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service, and I am not sure that she made the right comparison. No doubt that matter will be dissected in the other place when it comes to consider this part of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1282.0/3">The hon. Lady seemed to suggest that Opposition Members were being highly theoretical. She teased the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and myself for taking such a response, but I do not think that that is true. If anyone's approach is theoretical, it is that of the Government. The hon. Gentleman and I are concerned with the practicalities of the approach that the hon. Lady has been taking.</p>
	<p pid=".1282.0/4">The hon. Lady says that she does not think that the Bill, as it stands, undermines the position of a constable. On that point, I and my colleagues, and I believe, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and his colleagues, take exception. It undermines the role of the constable in precisely the way in which I have described. Therefore, we wish to press the new clause to a Division. However, I thank the Minister for bringing forward her amendment on training, having listened carefully to what we said in Committee. We are most grateful to her in that respect. We wish to press that key new clause to a vote.</p>

	<p pid=".1287.2/1">These new clauses are a response to the Procedure Committee which, in its report on Sessional Orders and Resolutions, considered in detail the legislation governing protests and demonstrations in Parliament square, which have given rise to a great deal of discussion and concern among Members of the House, as well as staff.</p>
	<p pid=".1287.2/2">Following the concerns expressed in Committee about clause 128, particularly subsection (2)(c), the Home Secretary and I reconsidered how best to implement the Procedure Committee's report. We need specific legislation that recognises the unique position of Parliament and its surroundings. The Government recognise that existing legislation has not provided the police with all the powers they need to control all protests and demonstrations around Parliament. That was demonstrated clearly during our debate on the ways in which local authorities, the police and others have tried unsuccessfully to use the law to deal with particular problems.</p>
	<p pid=".1287.2/3">Government new clauses 18 to 22, which would replace clauses 128 and 129, require all demonstrations that are planned to take place in the designated area to be notified to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner six days in advance. That follows the requirement in the Public Order Act 1986 for all marches to be notified in advance. The precise area will be defined in secondary legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1287.2/4">Following our discussions in Committee, we decided that it was important to have a clear process in line with current precedent on processions to provide greater certainty on what we intend to achieve and greater consistency for people applying to hold demonstrations.</p>

	<p pid=".1288.0/1">Let me say at the outset that the Government's proposals this evening appear to be much better than those that we considered in Committee, but does the Minister understand that one of the anxieties that remain is the potential geographical scope of the order? I appreciate that it is to be dealt with by means of secondary legislation, but what we pass here becomes rather important. The Minister knows my view that 1 km is much too great a distance. Would it not be possible for her to give an assurance during the course of the debate that we can at least amend the provision in another place, so that the distance is restricted to no more than 200 m from Parliament square?</p>

	<p pid=".1288.2/1">My intervention is on the same subject. I, like many others I am sure, am concerned about restricting the right of free speech and demonstration.

The Minister should think carefully about removing rights that are enshrined in our history.</p>

	<p pid=".1291.2/1">No, I shall make progress and describe how we see the provision working in relation to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. When notice of a demonstration is given, the commissioner must authorise the demonstration. I emphasise that, in response to concerns about whether people would be allowed to make their protest and express their point of view. However, the commissioner may attach conditions for the purpose of preventing any of the following, which are listed in new clause 20: hindrance to any person wishing to enter or leave the Palace of Westminster; hindrance to the proper operation of Parliament; serious public disorder; serious damage to property; disruption to the life of the community; a security risk in any part of the designated area; or risk to the safety of members of the public, including those taking part in the demonstration.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.2/2">Those conditions are more helpful than the original provisions in the Bill. Hon. Members may not know that officers from Charing Cross police station currently make regular visits to the site in Parliament square to check behind paraphernalia for devices left not by the people who are protesting, but by people who might use the protest for their own motives to cause a security problem. Some of my hon. Friends laugh at that, but these issues are taken seriously by the police. There are questions about how much police time should be spent unnecessarily checking behind placards, fixed posters and so on. Conditions attached to authorised demonstrations would make matters much easier for the police.</p>

	<p pid=".1291.4/1">No, I shall make a little more progress.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/2">The current Sessional Order orders the commissioner to keep access to Parliament free when Parliament is sitting. Recent demonstrations, though not hindering access to Parliament, have disrupted its work. We propose that conditions can be placed on demonstrations so that they do not hinder access to or hinder the proper operation of Parliament. For example, the police could impose a direction on demonstrators to keep the demonstration away from Carriage Gates or to limit the number of demonstrators. The senior police officer at the scene of the demonstration would be able to impose additional conditions in order to secure these aims. It would be an offence to organise or carry on a demonstration that had not been authorised by the police, or to fail to comply with a direction imposed by the commissioner or the police officer at the scene.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/3">Someone could turn up and say that they did not know about the conditions. It would be up to the police officer at the scene to deal with that in the way he or she saw fit. The major difference between the original provisions of the Bill and what we are proposing in the new clauses relates to consistency. The first version of the Bill raised questions about the extent to which an individual officer would have to interpret what would be the appropriate conditions. The new clauses make it clear that the conditions would be provided in writing to the person who had asked to hold the protest, and they would be able to show that to a police officer at the scene if there was any question about whether they were abiding by the conditions set.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/4">It would be an offence to organise or carry on a demonstration that had not been authorised by the police, or to fail to comply with a direction imposed by the commissioner or the police officer at the scene. I must stress that there would be no power to ban any demonstration outright. It is for the police to decide what conditions to place on any demonstration. The police are best placed to decide what action is proportionate, taking into account human rights considerations. There are exemptions for trade union disputes and for public processions, which are subject to separate controls under sections 11 and 12 of the Public Order Act 1986. We believe that the new clauses will introduce consistency in imposing conditions on demonstrations around Parliament. It is open to all those who wish to demonstrate at short notice to do so, but away from the area around Parliament. That is what we are trying to protect.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/5">The subject of loudhailers has been raised in the debate. During the debate on the Sessional Order and resolutions, the Leader of the House announced that the Home Secretary would consider using the order-making powers in section 62 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 to ban the use of loudhailers in the area of Parliament square. At that time we considered in good faith that we could use the Act to achieve a ban, but I must apologise to the House. Further legal advice is that the powers in the Control of Pollution Act 1974 are not flexible enough for us to achieve a complete ban around Parliament. New clauses 23 and 24 follow the provisions of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, which ban the use of loudhailers in the streets at night. The new clauses ban the use of loudhailers in the vicinity of Parliament at any time, except for certain specified purposes, such as in an emergency.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/6">The Government agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/893" name="Eric Forth">the point raised by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase> in amendment No. 134: the police should be able to deal with those erecting or displaying material prejudicial to security or causing noise of an offensive or intrusive nature. That is why the commissioner can place conditions on an assembly to prevent hindrance to the operation of Parliament, disruption to the life of community, a security risk or a risk to the safety of members of the public.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/7">The Government also agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the point raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> in amendments Nos. 2 and 3: that imposing conditions on demonstrators on the ground that they spoil the visual aspect of the area is a difficult judgment for police officers to make. [Hon. Members: &quot;Bonkers.&quot;] As those on the Liberal Democrat Benches say, it is absolutely bonkers. I could say the same about them, but there we go.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/8">We thought about that issue after consideration in Committee, and about how a police officer could determine what is aesthetically pleasing, or challenging for that matter. That is why we felt it important that the new clauses deal with situations where placards or other paraphernalia could affect the conditions we have set, particularly those dealing with serious damage to property&mdash;that is an obvious one&mdash;but also disruption, security risks in any part of the designated area, or for that matter risks to the safety of members of the public. That point has been clarified, and I hope that it is helpful to our discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/9">Amendment No. 4 would ensure that the officer who gives a direction to a protestor must be at least of the rank of inspector. We believe that it would cause operational difficulties to the police if an inspector was not at the scene and they had to wait for one to impose a direction. As we said in Committee, Members of Parliament would be rather annoyed if their access was hindered and a police officer had to wait for an inspector to come to effect a direction.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/10">By ensuring that conditions are placed on a demonstrator before the start, the Metropolitan police will be able to consider more carefully the conditions to be imposed. I can assure hon. Members that the conditions set in advance will be agreed by an officer of at least the rank of inspector. We heard about that problem in Committee, and the advanced notice deals with some problems raised in Committee about the rank of the person deciding what conditions should be set. I hope that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome will not press his amendment.</p>
	<p pid=".1291.4/11">I can reassure hon. Members that the Government intend to lay an order specifying the precise area to be covered. We intend to consult the Metropolitan police so that it will cover the area where demonstrations take place that disrupt the work of Parliament, hinder access to the House and cause a security risk. We do not want to restrict unnecessarily the area that will be covered, and we want to ensure that all parliamentary and key Government buildings are covered. In Committee, we considered the distance of 200 m, or 200 yd, and there was a question whether the entrance to the House of Lords would be covered if we were to limit ourselves to such distances.</p>

	<p pid=".1294.2/1">I am trying to answer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1208" name="Alex Salmond">the question of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)</phrase>. He should remember that the Sessional Order covers an area from Vauxhall Bridge road in the west to Wellington street and Waterloo bridge in the east. The area that we are proposing&mdash;within a kilometre&mdash;is smaller than the current Sessional Order area.</p>
	<p pid=".1294.2/2">We are not enlarging the area to be covered; in fact, we are decreasing and restricting it. We will be clear on consulting on which buildings will be covered, but there are issues that we have to discuss with the police relating to where demonstrations would disrupt the work of Parliament. Of course, that work takes place not just in one building, but in several. We have to discuss issues of security risk as well. I make the point again: we are not banning demonstrations, but allowing them with conditions imposed on them.</p>

	<p pid=".1294.3/1">I am glad that the Minister said that the work of Parliament does not just occur in one building. It occurs not only here, in this main Chamber, but in Westminster Hall, which is extremely exposed to Parliament square. As one of those who, on behalf of Mr. Speaker, chairs sittings in Westminster Hall&mdash;our alternative Chamber&mdash;I know that there have been occasions when debates have been badly inconvenienced by the level of noise from Parliament square. The Minister is right to be flexible about the area in which the Bill will apply. She has the Procedure Committee's wholehearted support.</p>

	<p pid=".1294.4/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. We want some flexibility, but as I have said, the area that we have proposed to consult on, in terms of the buildings concerned, is actually smaller than that currently provided for under the Sessional Order.</p>

	<p pid=".1295.0/1">Let me just make this point. The clauses that we have framed show that we have listened to concerns expressed inside and outside the Committee, about what is appropriate and proportionate. I believe strongly that providing for advance notification means that we can have greater consistency in the process than if we just leave the matter to an individual police officer, because the person who gets the authority for the process will have it in writing and will be able to provide that if they are challenged by any police officer in the area around Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1295.0/2">There is a difficult balance to be struck. There is, and will continue to be, a longstanding tradition in this country that people are free to gather together to demonstrate their views, provided that they do so within the law.

	<p pid=".1295.2/1">I have taken several interventions and I am conscious of other people wanting to speak.</p>
	<p pid=".1295.2/2">Those who organise demonstrations around Parliament should notify the Metropolitan police in advance, and the police should impose conditions in advance depending on the circumstances of each demonstration. That is the most effective way of achieving what we want, and of resolving the problem that has emerged. The issue is not just about one individual; it is about the fact that the problems of the past few years could be taken on by other individuals as well, and we need to deal with that. I state again that everyone is entitled to their point of view, but sometimes there have to be conditions on how that point of view is put across.</p>

	<p pid=".1295.3/1">I am conscious of time, so I shall endeavour to be brief.</p>
	<p pid=".1295.3/2">The Minister is right when she says that what she has come up with this evening is much better than what was before the Committee. That was frankly dreadful and this is an improvement on it, but there are several issues that the House ought to consider. Conservative Members will have a free vote on the subject, as it is a matter for Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1295.3/3">My first point is that the system requiring authorisation for demonstration is one with which I do not disagree, but I am concerned that, under the provision, one should give not less than six clear days' notice. If that is the case, it means that any rapidly organised demonstration in response to a specific political event or situation will be impossible. If, for example, in response to an emergency, Parliament was about to vote to go to war, it would not be possible for demonstrators to stand in Parliament square to express their view. I simply cannot accept that it will require six days for the police to decide on such an authorisation. I hope that the Under-Secretary will assure us this evening that that matter will be revisited in the other place and that the period can be reduced substantially.</p>

	<p pid=".1296.5/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. When the measure was originally framed, I shared that view strongly. Speaking for myself, I could accept the idea of a regulatory framework to prevent excesses in Parliament square. I am focusing on my anxieties, which are about the commissioner, the ludicrous, unacceptable time for notification and the designated area, which I mentioned earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".1296.5/2">There is no need for a designated area of 1 km around Parliament square. I heartily agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/966" name="Kate Hoey">the comments of the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> that the distance should be expressed in miles or yards. Frankly, we do not need miles&mdash;yards are sufficient. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/893" name="Eric Forth">My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase> tabled an amendment that would provide for an area of 200 yd. That is eminently sensible.</p>
	<p pid=".1296.5/3">That brings me to my final point. All the amendments that hon. Members have tabled are redundant because the moment we vote on the clauses, all possibility of further amendment falls. That shows how ludicrous it is to consider those matters on Report. I require concrete assurances. I shall either abstain or vote against the new clauses. I shall abstain if I have a concrete assurance that the deficiencies will be adequately remedied. Otherwise, with regret, I shall have to vote against at least some of the new clauses.</p>

	<p pid=".1296.6/1">The process that we are going through tonight is absolutely shambolic. We have tabled amendments to what we thought were the proposals in the legislation, only to discover that the Secretary of State has signed our amendments&mdash;I thought that we had achieved a revolutionary position at one point&mdash;and other amendments have been tabled that are an absolute travesty. This is not just a question of not having time to debate these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".1296.6/2">The definition in the new clause of a &quot;public place&quot; is</p>
	<p pid=".1296.6/3" class="indent">&quot;any highway or any place to which at the material time the public or any section of the public has access, on payment or otherwise, as of right or by virtue of express or implied permission&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1296.6/4">That could include Methodist central hall, Westminster Abbey or Trafalgar square. Spontaneous demonstrations will no longer be possible. Worse, if I get permission to hold a demonstration, having given my six days' notice, and someone sees me demonstrating and thinks, &quot;That's a good idea. I'll go and join him&quot;, that person would be committing an offence. As the organiser of the demonstration, I would have a defence, but I might have committed the crime of incitement. So I could go down for 51 weeks or a year, not for organising the demonstration but for incitement. What is the definition of incitement?

	<p pid=".1297.1/1">So, by the sound of it, we can no longer have competing demonstrations to counterbalance each other. In addition, the powers that the measure gives to the commissioner are absolutely staggering, and there is no provision for them to be circumscribed in the future, or for setting guidelines on them. Is the commissioner really to have the opportunity to designate how many people can turn up to a demonstration, how many placards they can bring and what the design of the placards should be? Is that what we employ the Metropolitan Police Commissioner for? He is going to have a wonderful time choosing between the different designs on Brian Haw's placards.</p>

Then there is the worrying provision that any police officer, of any rank, can change the conditions at will at any time during a demonstration in Parliament square. Those powers are beyond those that the police officers themselves would wish to have. The designated area of 1 km will include vast tracts of traditional demonstrating areas. The Government will be passing power to one part of the state to control demonstrations in a way that we have never known before in the history of this country.</p>
	<p pid=".1297.3/3">Tonight, we are seeing a small but significant part of our democratic tradition being chiselled away. Why? Because one person out there has the moral authority, the guts, the tenacity and the courage to stand in Parliament square for several years telling us what we did wrong in this House by authorising a war. Part of the motivation behind this legislation is that some people cannot come to terms with the illegality and immorality of their actions in this place. We should be supporting that democratic voice out there, and the right of that individual to voice his concerns in this way&mdash;near to us.</p>

My amendment No. 1 is far from redundant&mdash;in fact, it has been signed by the Secretary of State. It seeks to remove the previous clause. As I said in Committee, that clause needed to be removed because it was &quot;bonkers&quot;. It gave the power to a police officer of no higher rank than that of constable to determine that the appearance of a person in Parliament square was to the visual detriment of the square&mdash;in other words, that he looked untidy or a bit scruffy, or looked as though he should not be there. On the basis of that decision, the police officer could apply an order to that person to leave not only Parliament square but an area of 1 km surrounding the square. That person would have no capacity to challenge that order and could be excluded from an area running from north of Trafalgar square down to Millbank&mdash;I do not know why anyone would want to demonstrate down there&mdash;and across to Buckingham palace or over to Waterloo station. If he had the misfortune to want to catch a train home from Waterloo International, Victoria or Charing Cross, he would be out of luck, because he would be excluded on the say-so of a single constable. If ever there was an overreaction to a minimal disruption, this was it. That is why the Government were entirely right to withdraw their amendment, but what they have put in its place is very little better.</p>

	<p pid=".1298.3/1">Apart from what my grandmother would have said about looking scruffy for a capital city, am I not right in saying that the most senior officer in law is the first police officer at the scene of a crime who decides to apply the law as he or she sees fit? Has that not always been the case? We should be careful about saying that someone's junior rank makes him or her, in a specific instance, not capable of using the judgment that we put every single bobby on the beat to use.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1298.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1298"  time="21:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-40.htm#50207-40_spnew6">
	<p pid=".1298.4/1">I do not think that Mr. Brian Haw suddenly appeared on the scene&mdash;he was there for some time. Yet the law, as it was suggested, would have allowed a police constable to wake up one morning and think, &quot;He looks a bit scruffy. We'll get rid of him.&quot; I do not think that that is the right approach.</p>
	<p pid=".1298.4/2">It is arguable that there was a nuisance. I do not happen to agree, and not just because I agree with the cause that Mr. Haw espouses. If there was a nuisance, however, the right remedy was a civil one, not the creation of a new criminal offence. The Government threw all that away, because they recognised that it was bonkers, and presented an alternative, but the alternative has some swivel-eyed aspects. It refers to &quot;a demonstration&quot;, but a demonstration can be a demonstration by one person. When is one person a demonstration? Presumably when he or she manifests some aspect of demonstration. Is that a leaflet? Is it a placard? Is it a double-decker bus? I do not know. One person becomes a demonstration and requires a permit but another person is simply someone standing in Parliament square. How does a police officer determine who is a demonstration and who is someone who simply does not like the look of the Government?</p>
	<p pid=".1298.4/3">The point about the removal of spontaneity in demonstrations has already been made. We are no longer allowed suddenly to feel that the Government are doing the country a grave injustice and protest about it. We must give six days' notice to the commissioner before we can mount our one-man demonstration with a leaflet outside the Houses of Parliament. What criteria is the commissioner allowed to take into consideration? Is it serious hindrance to the work of Parliament? Is it serious damage or disruption to the environment? No&mdash;it is simple disruption to the life of the community. How do we define disruption to the life of the community of Parliament square? I thought that the life of Parliament square was demonstrations. I thought that Parliament square was the centre where we expressed our political differences with the Government of the day.</p>

	<p pid=".1299.0/1">Is this not the natural and unavoidable consequence of framing a piece of legislation with the sole aim of preventing one man, Brian Haw, from demonstrating in this way? The unintended consequences for the other 60 million of us arise because the Government have not thought this through strategically and have brushed away the issue of principle that has already been raised.</p>

	<p pid=".1299.1/1">In fact, I do not think the Government have a clue what they are doing. They simply have a visceral dislike of someone disagreeing so obviously, and in such a prolonged way, on their doorstep. That is why we have what can only been described, although it is a clich&eacute;, as a sledgehammer to crack the proverbial nut. I do not believe that the Government should be making it a criminal offence for someone simply to express his view in Parliament square in a time-honoured way, and I do not think they should extend the area to 1 km. I find it alarming enough that the Minister has changed the Government's position since she said in Committee that the intention was to protect Parliament. Now it is Parliament and Government buildings, which is illustrative in itself.</p>
	<p pid=".1299.1/2">I believe that the Government have got this wrong and I urge my colleagues to oppose their measure.</p>

	<p pid=".1299.2/3">Are we seriously saying that, because one person, Brian Haw, has been outside for three years, we will sweep away the right that has existed for centuries for people to come to the House, without seeking permission from anyone, to express their view? If these amendments are passed, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner will decide who is fit to demonstrate and who is not. It puts a great burden on him and it will make it impossible for any person to come here in an act of spontaneity to demonstrate against a decision that the Government or House are about to take.</p>

	<p pid=".1300.1/1">The Metropolitan Police Commissioner will be deciding what they can say, who they are, what they can carry, how long they can be there and how many people are involved. It will be police control of demonstrations outside our Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1300.1/2">This is a very serious matter. I urge hon. Members to think very carefully of their privileges to speak, to vote and to talk before denying that right to others who wish to come to the House and make life uncomfortable for us. In a democracy, there is nothing wrong with people making life uncomfortable for elected politicians.</p>
	<p pid=".1300.1/3">I personally admire Brian Haw but that is not the point. As I said when I gave evidence to the Procedure Committee, what he is demonstrating about is not the point. It is about his right or that of anyone else to come here and express their view, however welcome or unwelcome it is for us. That is what democracy is about.</p>

	<p pid=".1300.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> speaks with great eloquence and fervour. I do not think that any individual has the right indefinitely to deface the centre of a great capital city, which is what we have seen over the past three years with Mr. Haw. Obviously, the hon. Gentleman sympathises with him and I do not sympathise with the cause that Mr. Haw is seeking to espouse, but that is not the point. What the Government are seeking to do is, basically, in line with the Procedure Committee's recommendations and it is right.</p>
	<p pid=".1300.2/2">I hope that the Minister will think again about both the time and the distance. I also hope that she will think very carefully about Trafalgar square. As one who stood shoulder to shoulder with Michael Foot protesting on the subject of Bosnia&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/966" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> was there with us, too&mdash;I know the value of protests in Trafalgar square. I have spoken at a number of protests on the release of Soviet Jews, Bosnia and other causes, some of which would not endear themselves to the hon. Gentleman. Some might. Again, that is wholly irrelevant.</p>
	<p pid=".1300.2/3">Trafalgar square is a time-honoured place where people can and should be able to demonstrate. It is very important that Trafalgar square be exempted from such regulation. It is important that the time is brought down to 48 hours from six days. That is entirely reasonable. It is important that we have English miles in the Bill and not kilometres and that we have English yards because, in that way, we will get a sensible solution that I hope most people could, perhaps with a degree of reluctance, support.</p>
	<p pid=".1300.2/4">It is a pity that we have come to this pass but, Mr. Speaker, you know as well as anyone in the Chamber how disrupted the life of Parliament square has been over the past two years and how it has been defaced. The Government have taken a proper step in the right direction. They still need to correct themselves to a degree. I would like the Minister to respond briefly and to assure us that she will listen very carefully on those points about time and distance in particular.</p>

Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> spoke of the defacing of Parliament square. I have heard people say that no such demonstrations as we have seen for the past three years should be allowed in Parliament square because it is a world heritage site. It is a world heritage site not because of that rather scruffy square of grass or the statues at its corners, and it is certainly not surrounded by buildings of overwhelming architectural excellence, with the exception possibly of Westminster abbey. It is a centre that the whole world comes to visit because of what has happened in this Parliament, and certainly what happened in Westminster abbey.</p>

	<p pid=".1301.1/1">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, the amendments that we are being asked to vote on are unusual. I am speaking from the Government Benches, because the amendments stand in the names of both Mr. Secretary Clarke and Opposition Members. The Government's last-minute changes to the legislation have coincided with Opposition amendments. In the case of amendment No. 178, for example, the Government's headlong retreat from aggravated trespass in Scotland has coincided with an amendment designed to remove powers from the Government. My point of order is simple: given the nature of the amendments, which indicates the last-minute, spatchcocked nature of the legislation, is there anything in your powers to prevent last-minute amendments making it impossible for hon. Members to submit amendments to legislation? The Government's programme motion makes it impossible for those matters even to be debated. Do you have the discretion to stop that abuse of legislation, which we are seeing this evening?</p>

	<p pid=".1302.0/1">I am not used to seeing the hon. Gentleman on the Government Benches. He has raised the question of the programme motion, which is a matter for the House and not for the Speaker. My clear understanding of the rules is that any hon. Member can put his name to an amendment. If that is a Minister of the Crown, the amendment becomes a Government amendment. It is just like the trade union movement&mdash;there is such a thing as custom and practice, which we are dealing with here.</p>

	<p pid=".1309.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid=".1309.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">It is a great privilege to move Third Reading, and I thank all hon. Members who served on the Committee. There was much general agreement on many of the measures that the Bill is designed to address and I am grateful to hon. Members on both sides of the House for the constructive approach that they adopted both in Committee and today on Report.</p>
	<p pid=".1309.0/3">For our part, I hope that many people will acknowledge that we have responded positively to many of the points raised by Opposition Members, and I trust that the House will agree that the Bill that we are now sending to the other place has been much improved by the scrutiny process. I welcome the broad measure of cross-party support for the provisions. Indeed, on Second Reading <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> said that of the Bill's 220 pages, he could &quot;broadly support&quot; all but two, which has to be regarded as an achievement.</p>
	<p pid=".1309.0/4">The Bill includes a cross-section of measures to tackle crime at all levels, from fighting organised criminal gangs at the top end of the spectrum to combating the scourge of antisocial behaviour at the other end. At the heart of the Bill is a raft of proposals designed to make the United Kingdom the least attractive country for organised criminals to operate in. Organised crime costs the country a minimum of &pound;20 billion a year, but the social and economic cost cannot be measured in monetary terms alone, as the impact of this sordid business is felt in many communities. We all know from our constituents of lives ruined or tragically lost as a result of a drugs overdose, gun crime or sex slavery. Behind each of those tragedies is the network of criminals who supply the drugs, the guns and the migrants.</p>
	<p pid=".1309.0/5">The National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the investigation arms of Customs and Excise and the immigration service have all achieved notable successes. I pay due respect to all the people in those organisations, but the reality is that the challenges posed by organised crime are such that we need to move up a gear. The Serious Organised Crime Agency will not just bring together those four constituent organisations, but it will adopt a wholly new approach by having as its core objective the reduction of harm caused by organised crime. That will involve traditional investigations and prosecutions, including use of the new compulsory investigative powers in part 2 of the Bill, but SOCA will also use all other methods at its disposal to disrupt, dissipate and destroy organised criminal gangs.</p>
	<p pid=".1309.0/6">In establishing SOCA, we do not seek to disown what has gone before. I have already paid tribute to the four precursor organisations, but a new approach to meeting the challenges posed by organised crime requires a new organisation with its own culture and ways of working. If we are to mesh together successfully the police officers, customs officers and immigration officers transferring to the new agency, we cannot fashion it in the image of a police force. That is accepted and supported by the NCS, NCIS, Customs and Excise, the immigration service, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the director general designate, Bill Hughes, the chairman designate, Sir Stephen Lander, and many others. I invite Opposition Members to embrace that shared vision for the new agency and to work with us to make it a success.</p>
	<p pid=".1309.0/7">This is not the occasion to run through the whole of the Bill, but I want to take this opportunity to touch on the issue of incitement, which has at times dominated the debate. A little over a week ago, the nation marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz at a ceremony in Westminster Hall. If the Holocaust teaches us anything, it should teach us to be acutely aware of where hatred of a religious or racial group can lead.</p>
	<p pid=".1309.0/8">Hon. Members who oppose this provision have failed to address two fundamental points. First, how do they respond to their Christian, Muslim or Hindu constituents when they ask, &quot;How can it be right that Jews and Sikhs are protected by the criminal law against those who would incite hatred against them, but we are not?&quot;? The second point that hon. Members have failed to address is the fact that we know that far right groups, and others, use religion as a surrogate for race. Those who would seek to whip up hatred against minority ethnic communities are familiar with the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986 and are sufficiently astute to peddle their vitriol with carefully chosen words. As colleagues have rightly pointed out, religion and race are not always intermixed, and we want to protect those people for whom the issue is not their race but their beliefs. I put it to the House that it is equally right that there should be an equivalent offence of inciting hatred against religious groups, to provide protection for faith groups that do not have an association with a particular race. The targets are often&mdash;but not always&mdash;the same, and the effects are equally damaging to community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid=".1309.0/9">The Government's view is shared by the broad swathe of faith groups. The new offence is supported by the Church of England, the Catholic Church, the Free Churches, the Muslim Council of Britain, the Hindu Council UK, the Network of Sikh Organisations, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Buddhist Society, the Network of Buddhist Organisations, Jain Samaj Europe, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United Kingdom, and the Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe. Support comes not just from faith groups but from the Association of Chief Police Officers, Justice, the Commission for Racial Equality, the Law Society and the Attorney-General.</p>

	<p pid=".1310.1/2">There is, therefore, a wide body of support for the new offence that cannot be ignored. Furthermore, we have seen from a recent poll in <i>The Guardian</i> that there is also strong public support. I put it to the House that there is a compelling case for the provision, and I invite hon. Members who have expressed concerns about it to think again.</p>
	<p pid=".1310.1/3">Under this Government, crime has fallen by 30 per cent. We all accept that we cannot be complacent, because there is much more to do to make our communities and neighbourhoods safe and secure. The other measures in the Bill, including those on antisocial behaviour, police powers and the seizure of cars that are uninsured and unlicensed will contribute significantly to making our communities safer and ensuring that those who do not abide by the law are brought to justice.</p>

	<p pid=".1311.0/1">I do not know whether the Minister intends to refer to the debate we had only half an hour ago about the restrictions on people's right to demonstrate. I counsel her to recognise that although she has successfully marshalled the Bill through the House, she needs to give careful consideration to the dangers that we highlighted. She may be in government now, but that will not always be the case, and the restrictions on demonstrations may one day restrict her opportunity to protest against a future Government.</p>

	<p pid=".1311.1/1">I believe that the measures concerning demonstrations in the area around Parliament would allow me to demonstrate in the future on any issue. The only constraint would be that I would need the foresight to seek authorisation and be willing to accept conditions. I do not have a problem with that. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner will not say whether people may or may not protest: people may protest, but conditions might be attached. We have outlined the conditions that may apply in the Bill, and they include hindering the operations of Parliament as well as the safety and security of the environment around Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1311.1/2">The Bill will contribute significantly to the achievement of our goal of making our communities safer. I am proud to have played a part in the often exciting and constructive discussions of it in Committee. Many of the measures in the Bill will give us more tools with which to fight organised crime, as well as crime within our communities. I hope that we can all contribute to making our communities safer by ensuring that the Bill has a safe passage and becomes the legislation that we need, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1311.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="1311"  time="22:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-44.htm#50207-44_spnew3">
	<p pid=".1311.2/1">We have reached the end of at least the first stage of Parliament's proceedings on the Bill&mdash;its passage through this place. As the Minister rightly said, there are aspects of the Bill with which we strongly agree. However, one of the problems is that it has become something of a Christmas tree to which many things have been added, and as it goes down the Corridor to the other place, she may well have to trim the tree if the Bill is to become law before the general election.</p>
	<p pid=".1311.2/2">The passage of the Bill falls into two parts. Committee stage was extremely constructive: we managed to raise and debate a large number of very important issues. Report stage, however, was subject to the outrageous guillotine that the Government imposed on the House of Commons. In my view, it is an insult to every Member of this House, on whatever side they sit, that the programme order has curtailed our discussion on Report as it has. In Committee, the usual channels did an excellent job&mdash;I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/806" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/957" name="John Heppell">the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell)</phrase> on the way in which our debates were ordered in the old-fashioned way, without any form of knife being necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".1311.2/3">In Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, the shadow Attorney-General, who is a distinguished lawyer, enlivened our debates and brought his tremendous legal training to bear. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/854" name="Jonathan Djanogly">My hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly)</phrase>, who has great specialist knowledge not only as a constituency Member of Parliament but as a shadow Minister on the important subject of animal rights terrorism, genuinely managed to influence the Minister to make several changes and amendments, for which we are extremely grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/797" name="James Clappison">her. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)</phrase>, who serves on the Home Affairs Committee, also helped our consideration a great deal. It has been a great pleasure to debate the Bill, both in Committee and on Report, with the Under-Secretary of State for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/889" name="Caroline Flint">the Home Department, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1311.2/4">In Committee, we discussed community support officers and antisocial behaviour in a highly constructive way. There is now a large degree of agreement on the right way forward, although we continue to have reservations about the extra CSOs that are to be provided without a proper independent evaluation. We hope that the Minister will provide us with one in due course. Although, we recognise that, in terms of visibility, CSOs are a plus, not a minus, there should be no confusion about the fact that they are not proper coppers; they are not trained in the way that policemen and women are. We also discussed matters relating to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and disclosure notices, which were very much the Cinderella issues of the Bill. I am concerned that, under this legislation, everyone will be able to arrest everyone else. Such matters will be returned to when the Bill moves to the other place.</p>
	<p pid=".1311.2/5">The key part of the Bill is the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which the Conservatives strongly support. None the less, we are anxious to ensure that its place in the hierarchy of the police family is understood. We are concerned about some aspects of its financing&mdash;a subject that we raised frequently in Committee&mdash;and about the powers of the Home Secretary, which must be proportionate. If the agency is to be the diamond in the crown of our anti-crime initiatives and to make a real contribution to crime fighting as all hon. Members want, it is extremely important that it is properly established and organised.</p>
	<p pid=".1311.2/6">I think that all of the issues that we have discussed today were debated, at least briefly, in Committee. Religious hatred has dominated our debate today, and I am not satisfied that the Government have got the provisions right, which is why I voted against them. I have no doubt that it will prove to be one of the most contentious issues in the other place.</p>

	<p pid=".1313.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that when the House of Lords looks at the provision, it will consider whether we have had an adequate discussion? The fact that the provision was subject to such an unreasonable timetable will give the Lords the impression that we did not get to the bottom of the issues, and make it much more likely that they will ask us, quite rightly, to think again.</p>

	<p pid=".1313.1/1">Although the hon. Gentleman is a Liberal Democrat, he is quite right. It was a disgracefully tight timetable and it had precisely the impact that he described. Even worse, I am sure he would agree, was the fact that intercepts, which are not part of the Bill, were not properly discussed today. We had only half an hour on the issue, which meant that I alone could made a speech when moving new clause 7. It is an extremely important issue, and it should have received far more discussion. I acquit the Minister of any blame&mdash;it rests exclusively with the Government Whips Office, as it did not give us enough time to discuss the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".1313.1/2">As for protection against animal rights extremists, the Government and the Minister have listened to my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon and without doubt the Bill has been improved as a result. Toge<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">ther with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, with whom I have been in almost complete agreement throughout proceedings on the Bill&mdash;that is a little worrying, but it is true nevertheless&mdash;I raised the issue of police powers. The Government must think carefully about whether they have dealt with the issue satisfactorily.</p>
	<p pid=".1313.1/3">Finally, my party had a free vote on the issue of demonstrations in Parliament square. I did not decide how to vote until I listened to the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. The Minister was extremely persuasive, which is why I joined her in the Lobby at the end of the debate. I am concerned, however, that Parliament is abrogating its responsibility for making those decisions to the police, given the operational process to which we agreed tonight. Despite that reservation, however, I found the Minister's argument persuasive on the whole. I very much hope that the key parts of the Bill will become law.</p>

	<p pid=".1313.2/1">I have listened to my hon. Friend with rapt attention and a certain amount of awe at the way in which he has put Demosthenes to shame. Before he concludes an oration of the most remarkable quality, I hope that he will see fit to expatiate on the quantity of the Bill's provisions and their rather worrying implications for secondary legislation. His speech so far, although fine, has been very short&mdash;I am sure that he will want to lengthen it.</p>

	<p pid=".1313.3/1">Even at my hon. Friend's behest, I hesitate to expatiate at the Dispatch Box on secondary legislation at this late hour. However, the extremely important matters that he raised will be dealt with in the other place, where they will occupy the Government a great deal.</p>
	<p pid=".1313.3/2">As I was saying before my hon. Friend intervened to compare me with Demosthenes, I wish the Bill well. I very much hope that its key provisions will become law before the general election. However, we do not agree with some parts of it, and there are some provisions that the Government have fully to explore before they are passed into law. On that basis, I am content not to vote against the Bill on Third Reading.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1314.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/887" speakername="Lorna Fitzsimons" colnum="1314"  time="22:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-45.htm#50207-45_spnew1">
	<p pid=".1314.0/1">It is a great privilege to speak in favour of the Bill. Nearly 20,000 of my constituents belong to the Muslim faith, and there are many more from Christian denominations. I am therefore happy to back a law that, for the first time, provides parity for Christians and Muslims, so that they can join Jewish, Sikh and other faiths, and will not fall prey to the most pernicious form of hatred because of their belief. We should not underestimate the years of quiet, unnoticed suffering endured with noble fortitude by many thousands of the people whom we represent, because they did not have one of the most basic rights that most of us take for granted in this country and in this place&mdash;the right to practise their chosen faith quietly and individually with their family, friends and community.</p>
	<p pid=".1314.0/2">In the 18th century, Rochdale was the town where the greatest number of religions were practised. Fewer religions are probably practised now in Rochdale, but it is of great importance to my constituents that we passed a law today that gives them parity to practise their chosen faith freely, without fear of hatred. They know, as does nearly every law-abiding citizen of any faith or no faith, that nearly every good book says, &quot;Do as you would be done by&quot;. They do not expect favours or protection for inciting another person to hate somebody because of their faith or belief. All they want is for the hatred that has been directed against them to be made illegal once and for all.</p>
	<p pid=".1314.0/3">I have heard many arguments in this place and in my constituency that worry me greatly. There are few perfect laws&mdash;that is why there are so many rich lawyers. Parliamentarians have claimed that the new law will create unrealistic expectations, but which law has not done that? Each of us has had in our surgeries people who believed that a law stated something specific, and then realised that it was a matter of what one could prove, the evidence that a court needed, the difficulties presented by the Crown Prosecution Service, and many other factors. It is incumbent on us to realise that we need parity written into the law. What we are doing today is therefore very important.</p>
	<p pid=".1314.0/4">Members of the Muslim community in my constituency are prey to people in their own community who prey on their fears. The vast majority of law-abiding Muslims want nothing to do with such people, but there is no law to make it clear to those people that what they are saying and doing in the name of the community is wrong, and that when the same thing is done to their own community, they think it is wrong, so they should not do it unto others.</p>
	<p pid=".1314.0/5">The issue goes wider than that. In this country we have a strong tradition of freedom of speech, and it is wrong for politicians to go around saying that if passed, the law would curtail freedom of speech. That is dangerous and needs to be clarified in the Chamber. I challenge those on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench to do that. I have had the opportunity to share a platform with several leading Liberal Democrats in my constituency&mdash;Members of the European Parliament&mdash;who try to portray the Bill as dangerous to the Muslim community, saying that it would be used to witch-hunt people with strong voices who want to stand out, oppose various parts of the law and practise their own freedom of speech. I hope Liberal Democrats will join me in nailing that lie.</p>
	<p pid=".1314.0/6">The Bill is designed to protect individuals, not religions, institutions, deities or theologies. Over 50 years in my constituency, there has not been protection in law for my law-abiding citizens when they have been prey to the most pernicious hatred because of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">their religion. I hope the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, whom I know to be an honourable Gentleman, will distance himself from people seeking to sow seeds of fear and confusion. After 50 years of campaigning, we have reached the milestone&mdash;under my Government, I am proud to say&mdash;of protecting in law 20,000 of my constituents, and many more of the Christian faith. I am afraid that there are not many Hindus in my constituency, but those I have will be protected. Some people come along and say, &quot;This law is to get you.&quot; I hope that the hon. Gentleman will nail that lie.</p>
	<p pid=".1314.0/7">This measure is about protecting everybody in law, which is why I am proud to stand here as a person who does not practise any faith, apart from my political beliefs, which are my faith. When I was a lot younger, I was taught a lesson. I railed against people who believed in Catholicism and what the Pope and the Vatican had done. A very wise person listened to me for a very long time as I hanged myself with a long piece of rope and said, &quot;My, Lorna, that sounds pretty much like a belief to me.&quot; I learned the hard way that if I expect people to tolerate my beliefs, there needs to be a tolerance in the other direction.</p>
	<p pid=".1314.0/8">There is a difference between enjoying something like &quot;Life of Brian&quot; and saying that a person has the right to incite somebody to hate another individual because of their belief. Therefore, I am very proud to support the Third Reading of a Bill that has been a long time coming.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1315.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1315"  time="22:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-45.htm#50207-45_spnew2">
	<p pid=".1315.0/1">On the whole, this is a good Bill. It contains an awful lot of things that&mdash;we agree with the Government&mdash;needed doing. I found consideration in Committee, and even today's debate, despite the inadequacies of the timetable, usually a good experience of dialogue rather than simple confrontation. For that, I pay tribute to the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety and the Under-Secretary of State for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/889" name="Caroline Flint">the Home Department, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, both of whom are sitting on the Treasury Bench, and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" name="Andrew Mitchell">the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" name="Evan Harris">my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase>, as well as those who served on the Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".1315.0/2">Having been involved with umpteen Home Office and Department for Constitutional Affairs Bills, I do not always feel that my arguments have been listened to, but in this instance there have been several changes to the Bill as a result of suggestions made from the Liberal Democrat Benches. We are grateful, because that indicates that we were having a constructive argument rather than a simple confrontation.</p>
	<p pid=".1315.0/3">I have made it plain all along the line that we strongly support the Serious Organised Crime Agency. We want it to succeed and we think that there is a desperate need to confront organised crime effectively. We believe that such an agency is a step forward in providing the country with the mechanisms it needs to fight crime effectively, although we may quibble about some details, as we have today and no doubt will as the Bill proceeds in another place.</p>
	<p pid=".1315.0/4">We have considered the issues of investigatory powers, financial reporting and witness protection. I am enormously grateful that the Under-Secretary recognised the deficiency in the provisions for witness protection for those who are connected but not in a familial relationship. I thank her for changing the Bill, apparently.</p>
	<p pid=".1315.0/5">We have not yet reached agreement on the subject of custody sergeants; we did not have a chance to debate that today. I have no doubt whatever that it will be explored at length in another place.</p>
	<p pid=".1315.0/6">We have made significant progress on animal rights extremism and the measures to be put in place, although I do not think that the clauses we have agreed today are the last word on the subject. There is still a case for further revision, but we are, nevertheless, finally setting up the legislative framework necessary to combat a particularly unpleasant form of bullying that can have vile or tragic results.</p>
	<p pid=".1315.0/7">I do not agree with the Government about Parliament square, although I am glad that they have removed the two absurd proposals in the Bill. We simply disagree with other aspects of the legislation, but these were two bits of nonsense: the original proposals for Parliament square and the unlimited power of arrest for the citizen&mdash;citizen's arrest for any offence so that Mr. Jobsworth could arrest his next door neighbour and hold him until a police officer arrived, simply for having a defective brake light. That cannot be right, but the provision has been removed and I am pleased about that. I am particularly pleased that the Minister accepted my proposal for the power of seizure of vehicles without licence or insurance, which will be incorporated in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1315.0/8">The one difficult area is that to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/887" name="Lorna Fitzsimons">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mrs. Fitzsimons)</phrase> referred&mdash;incitement to religious hatred. Let me be absolutely clear&mdash;I said it at the beginning of my remarks and I shall say it again&mdash;that there is no difference between us and Labour Members in terms of the result that we wish for. We want a new offence that deals effectively with the pernicious acts of hatred that the hon. Lady described. Our argument concerns how that can be framed in the most effective way. We had that debate today, and it was entered into by Members on both sides of the Chamber. Indeed, many Labour Members joined us in the Lobby to say that there is at least one better way&mdash;probably many better ways&mdash;of framing the provisions so as to provide the effective protection against wicked and evil incitement to hatred that the hon. Lady and I want for the minority communities in our constituencies and around the country. We also want to ensure that the provisions work most effectively for all communities in achieving the parity to which the hon. Lady referred.</p>
	<p pid=".1315.0/9">That is the argument that we take to the other place. I remain hopeful that we will resolve those issues and, as a result, secure a piece of legislation that we can wholeheartedly support throughout. We are not quite there yet, but I have not the slightest intention of voting against the Bill, which achieves much that is desirable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1317.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1211" speakername="Mohammad Sarwar" colnum="1317"  time="23:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-46.htm#50207-46_spnew0">
	<p pid=".1317.0/1">Outlawing incitement to religious hatred is long overdue. It is imperative that we extend protection to prevent hatred being stirred up against people on the basis of their religious beliefs, or lack of religious beliefs, as well as their race. An extension of the law is needed to tackle the activities of extremists who have targeted people because of their religious beliefs.</p>
	<p pid=".1317.0/2">The Bill will close the unacceptable loophole whereby mono-ethnic faith groups such as Jews or Sikhs have legal redress against those who stir up religious hatred against them, but multi-ethnic faith groups such as Muslims, Christians and Hindus do not. That loophole has been exploited by far-right groups, who use religious terms to target victims whom they previously targeted using racial terms. The new provision allows the authorities to take action against such racist extremists, who have distributed material listing a range of insulting and highly inflammatory reasons for hating Muslims. For example, it was suggested that Muslims are a threat to the British people and liable to molest women, and should therefore be made to leave the UK. If those statements are not an incitement to hate Muslims, then what is?</p>
	<p pid=".1317.0/3">I am pleased that the new law will allow the authorities to pursue extremists in faith groups who make repeated threatening statements stirring followers to look for ways to make trouble for unbelievers. Extremist British Muslim groups who incite religious hatred against other groups will face justice, as they should. Extremists are few in number and completely unrepresentative of the communities whom they claim to represent. The majority of the British people, including British Muslims, are peaceful and law abiding, and would not stir up hatred against others because they do not share their religious beliefs.</p>
	<p pid=".1317.0/4">Critics of the provision argue that it seeks to protect people's beliefs and to restrict freedom of speech. That is simply not the case. It does not limit the freedom to criticise religious beliefs and practices or to engage in robust argument about those or to tell jokes. The new law is consistent with, and will operate in the light of, the guarantees afforded by the European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998. The convention clearly establishes the need to balance the right to freedom of speech with respect for the rights and freedoms of others. The protection of free speech afforded by the convention is an adequate safeguard over and above the tests that any action under the new law will have to fulfil.</p>
	<p pid=".1317.0/5">There is a further safeguard, in that the Attorney-General's consent will be required for all prosecutions to protect against frivolous or vexatious actions. Furthermore, the proposed and existing offences carry a high threshold to protect freedom of speech. Words, behaviour or material must be threatening, abusive or insulting and intended or likely to stir up hatred. The hatred has to be targeted at a group, not at beliefs or ideologies. Hatred goes beyond ridicule, prejudice, dislike, contempt, anger or offence.</p>
	<p pid=".1317.0/6">The proposal has the support of eminent equality and human rights lawyers such as Geoffrey Bindman and Robin Alien QC. It is also supported by the Law Society, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>
	<p pid=".1317.0/7">One of the most fundamental freedoms for all of us must be&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".1319.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce a subject that is of deep concern to my constituents and others who use the major train stations of Maidenhead and Twyford and the branch line stations of Cookham, Furze Platt and Wargrave in my constituency. I said that it was a matter of great concern to my constituents but it also causes them considerable disquiet and&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;distress because of the impact that the introduction of the new timetable in December 2004 has had on the services and their lives. I shall explain that to the Minister shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/2">It is sad to have to introduce this subject. For many years, my constituents and others who use the stations have benefited from a good rail service. Many fast and semi-fast services to and from Paddington were, by and large, reliable. I shall not pretend that they were perfect. At times, passengers experienced delays and frustrations. However, the rail service was good, yet, in the past couple of months, it has deteriorated significantly. The previous service was run by Thames Trains, which was, paradoxically, one of the few train operating companies that did not require a public subsidy. First Great Western is in a rather different position.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/3">A year ago, there was a good service. Today, the picture is different: significant delays, longer journeys, fewer trains, fewer fast and semi-fast services, fewer carriages and significant, if not dangerous overcrowding in peak hours. That applies not only to my constituents who travel from Maidenhead and Twyford to Paddington, or, indeed, Reading, but to those who travel from London to Maidenhead to work. It is not only my constituents who suffer. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/999" name="Boris Johnson">The subject also exercises my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)</phrase> and, as I know from an earlier conversation with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1084" name="Fiona Mactaggart">her, the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase>. There are fewer services to Slough and the journeys are taking longer. I understand that, when the hon. Member for Slough was at the station this morning, commuters were keen to make their points to her about the serious problems that they were suffering. I had the same experience at stations in my constituency. Commuters were angry, frustrated and wanted to ensure that their view was being presented because of the sharp deterioration in the service that they have suffered in recent months.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/4">I shall not read out all of the nearly 700 e-mails that I have received about the train services to Maidenhead and Twyford, but I shall quote just a few, to show the Minister the strength of feeling on this issue. Anu Shama wrote in an e-mail to First Great Western:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/5" class="indent">&quot;The bottom line is, we are suffering every day . . . our previous Thames Trains service was extremely reliable and I had no issues with them for the last 6&ndash;7 years. Your management team has ruined a perfectly run train service&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/6">Mark Knight wrote:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/7" class="indent">&quot;I have lived in Maidenhead for 20 years and this is the worst service I can remember in all that time.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/8">Julian Thurston, from Twyford, wrote:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/9" class="indent">&quot;The service now is without a shadow of doubt many times worse than any previous service since I started commuting 20 years ago.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/10">Sue Cox commented:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/11" class="indent">&quot;I used to enjoy travelling to London from Maidenhead on the train, but not any more&mdash; what happened? First Great Western took over the franchise!&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/12">I mentioned overcrowding. In an e-mail to First Great Western, Sylvie Nobes describes how, on 3 February, there was</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/13" class="indent">&quot;standing room only on leaving Maidenhead, cattle-truck conditions from Slough onwards. Desperate customers fight to board train at Southall. I remain bitterly disappointed and stressed at the current level of service you are offering customers from Maidenhead and Slough.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/14">Nicholas Edwards has commented:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/15" class="indent">&quot;It simply cannot be right that so many people are expected to stand on these trains. It cannot be safe.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/16">The train delays and the new timetable are having a real impact on people's lives. They find that they are constantly late for work, for example. My constituent, Thalia Kenton, has described the problems of those who are trying to deal with child care and suffering from the train services at the same time. She explained:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/17" class="indent">&quot;I am a working mother who rushes daily to work from 09.15&ndash;16.30 in London and my timings are key as my children are in nursery and cannot be dropped any earlier than 08.00 or fetched any later than 18.00.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/18">She talked about having to catch the 08.39 train, which gets in 15 minutes later than the previous train used to:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/19" class="indent">&quot;Fifteen minutes is an age in the life of any commuter, but for one in my position, working set, reduced hours who has no option to stay later or come in later it is nothing short of a disaster.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/20">It is not only individuals who are suffering. Businesses are suffering, too. Macrovision, a business in my constituency, wrote to First Great Western to say:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/21" class="indent">&quot;I do not believe that First Great Western Link has adequately considered the impact of this timetable change, as it is hugely important for the economy of Maidenhead and to the people who live and work there.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/22">Hutchison 3G, which now employs some 1,400 people on its site in Maidenhead, deliberately sited its building close to the railway station so that it could support the sustainability agenda by encouraging people to use public transport. It says:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/23" class="indent">&quot;One of the key factors in locating our offices in Maidenhead were the excellent train links that this provided for our employees, many of whom live in London, and for our business associates who regularly travel to Maidenhead for meetings . . . The effects of this change will make retention of our London based employees more difficult and increase the amount of time taken for our employees and business associates to travel to and from meetings and their homes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/24">Thames Valley chamber of commerce describes</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/25" class="indent">&quot;the slow stopping train, akin to the milk train service, creating the image of a sleepy backwater town&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/26">and says that</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/27" class="indent">&quot;the effect on Maidenhead's economy, and that of the Thames Valley, will be weakened by new businesses thinking twice of relocating due to its worsening rail links in and out of London.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/28">Why has all this come about? It cannot be that very few people use these services. Indeed, in response to a question that I put to the Minister of State, Department for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1082" name="Tony McNulty">the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)</phrase>, he replied on 19 January that, in the nine months from April to December last year, there were more than 2,300,000 passenger journeys to and from Maidenhead, and more than 760,000 passenger journeys to and from Twyford. No, the Strategic Rail Authority made a decision to merge the franchises of First Great Western and Thames Trains into a single franchise, to put the emphasis on increasing the punctuality of long-distance services, and to move the commuter services from Maidenhead and Twyford from the fast line to the slow line. This has resulted in the creation of a timetable that has reduced the number of fast and semi-fast services to and from Paddington, and many journeys are now significantly slower than they used to be.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/29">First Great Western Link, in its response to many people on this issue, is very clear about the role of the Strategic Rail Authority in this decision. It stated that any train operator bidding for the franchise would have had to deliver the same objectives. These included:</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/30" class="indent">&quot;To implement a timetable that would address overcrowding issues&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/31">something of an irony, given that the overcrowding has now increased as a result of the timetable changes&mdash;and</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/32" class="indent">&quot;To reduce the number of services running in this area, (although at the same time increasing capacity on the remaining services). This is in line with the Strategic Rail Authority's view that less trains on this congested network would increase punctuality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/33">I have to tell the Minister that having fewer trains on this network has not increased punctuality; it has severely reduced punctuality. There are significant delays for passengers, and, moreover, longer journey times have been created. The Strategic Rail Authority's decision has not had the impact that it was intended to have.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/34">First Great Western and, at the time when it announced the timetable changes, the Strategic Rail Authority, seem to have had a rather different opinion. It is very galling for my constituents to suffer such a deterioration in rail service while hearing on local radio, and seeing in advertisements and flyers from First Great Western, that the service is of benefit to customers and has improved. In December 2003, when the Strategic Rail Authority announced the timetable changes, it headed the announcement &quot;Franchise Decision Means Big Improvements&quot;. It then listed a number of improvements that were all to services for Reading and the west.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/35">Right at the end, the announcement said</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/36" class="indent">&quot;The new timetable means some increases in peak journey times on trains between London and Slough, Maidenhead and Twyford&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/37">Some increases in peak journey times, indeed. It means that the service is now not providing those semi-fast services through to Paddington, but is causing considerable difficulty to commuters who&mdash;as I said earlier&mdash;are late for appointments and meetings, unable to juggle their child-care arrangements with their travelling arrangements, and suffering not only a severely reduced service but a very unpleasant experience on many trains owing to the present overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/38">Sadly, the Government have also taken the view that there is overall benefit in the new timetable. When I asked the Minister of State what response the Department for Transport had made to representations regarding the timetable changes, he replied</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/39" class="indent">&quot;The Department's response to representations related to the December 2004 timetable changes is that they deliver wider benefits through improvements to punctuality across the First Great Western and First Great Western Link franchises.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 January 2005; Vol. 430, c. 37W.]</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/40">I reiterate to the Minister that that is not what is happening to my constituents and those who travel to my constituency from elsewhere. They are not seeing benefits and improvements; all they are seeing is a reduced and deteriorating service.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/41">Where can we go from here? I urge the Minister to consider three stages&mdash;three sets of decisions that can be made. First, I hope that First Great Western will continue to look at the timetable, make immediate further changes to the timetable that is currently operating, and increase the number of carriages on some of the trains, not just so that services can be improved in terms of time but so that the dangerous levels of overcrowding from which many are suffering can be reduced. That is the immediate need.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/42">Secondly, the Minister will know that later this week Network Rail will hold its timetabling conference, which will set the timetable not for later in the summer but for 2006&mdash;that is, from December 2005 to December 2006. That timetable needs to make the changes that are needed to ensure that we return to the level of service that we experienced when Thames Trains was in charge. We certainly need services to be returned to the fast line rather than being shunted on to the slow line if we are to see the service that people need and deserve from an economically vibrant part of the country and an important economic hub in the south-east&mdash;namely an important part of the Thames valley.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/43">This is the third aspect that I want the Minister to consider. The current franchise runs out in April 2006. Later this year, decisions will be made about the franchisee for the 10-year period after that. There is a slight difficulty over that process. It is being started by the Strategic Rail Authority&mdash;which, of course, is being abolished by the Government&mdash;and will be finished by the Department for Transport. I urge the Department to ensure that the franchise specification for these services returns us to the level of service that was available to my constituents before First Great Western took over the merged franchise in April 2004. Only a return to that level of service will ensure that my constituents in Maidenhead, Twyford, Cookham, Wargrave and Furze Platt and others who use those services will be able to enjoy the sort of service that is needed. That will ensure not only that they can carry on with their lives working in London, Reading or round about, but that we can retain the economic vibrancy of that important part of the Thames valley.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/44">I urge the Minister to look seriously at the issues that I have raised. This is not simply about one or two people grumbling that their trains are late. It is a significant issue for my constituents and others. They have seen a severe reduction in service.</p>
	<p pid=".1319.2/45">The Government want people to be able to enjoy a better work-life balance. They want sustainability and to encourage people on to public transport. All those agendas are being reversed through the action of the Strategic Rail Authority in merging the franchise, in requiring fewer trains to be put on and in putting trains for commuters on the slow lines. People are now getting into their cars rather than using the trains. That is not what the Government want. It is not what I want. I want a good level of rail service to Maidenhead, Twyford and the other stations in my constituency. I urge the Minister to look seriously at taking the action that is necessary through the agencies available to the Government to ensure that the timetable for 2006 is better and that the franchise arrangements return us to the level of service that Maidenhead, Twyford and the rest of my constituency not only need but deserve.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-07.1323.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/703" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="1323"  time="23:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050207/debtext/50207-47.htm#50207-47_spmin0">
	<p pid=".1323.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1106" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> on securing this debate and on providing an opportunity for the House to discuss rail services to Maidenhead and Twyford. There are regular direct rail services from both stations to London Paddington. A branch line to Marlow leaves the main line at Maidenhead and one to Henley-on-Thames leaves it at Twyford. Both branch lines have been proposed for designation as community railways under the strategy published by the Strategic Rail Authority in November 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1323.0/2">The new timetable introduced on 12 December 2004 is a fully integrated timetable covering both First Great Western and First Great Western Link. It is the most radical restructuring of services into London Paddington for more than a decade. The intended benefits of the new timetable include improved performance, increased capacity, reduced overcrowding and a clearer and more focused management approach to platform capacity at Paddington and Reading.</p>
	<p pid=".1323.0/3">Before the timetable change in December 2004, there were 12 services between Maidenhead and London Paddington between 7 am and 10 am. There are now 17. The number of weekday services from Twyford to London Paddington between 7 am and 10 am was 13, and that has increased under the December timetable to 18 direct services. From London Paddington to Twyford between 4 pm and 7 pm, there are now 15 direct services, and between London Paddington and Maidenhead, 17 direct services, compared with 13 and 15 respectively before the timetable changes.</p>
	<p pid=".1323.0/4">Both First Great Western Link and the Strategic Rail Authority are closely monitoring the performance of the new timetable to ensure that it meets its objectives, but it is too early yet to draw any meaningful conclusions.</p>
	<p pid=".1323.0/5">Commuter operators are required to carry out passenger counts to demonstrate that adequate capacity is provided to accommodate the passengers expected throughout the morning and evening peak periods. That ensures that franchise operators properly address the issue of capacity requirements in peak periods, while accepting the reality that this is a walk-on service and forecasting demand in advance is not an exact science. Train operators must agree with the SRA a timetable and train plan, showing the proposed allocation of rolling stock to services, as necessary to comply with a contractual limit on overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid=".1323.0/6">Train operators are subject to financial penalties if they provide less than the agreed capacity. There are specified levels of overcrowding in peak periods that train operators should not exceed. They are 4.5 per cent. above capacity for either peak in isolation, or 3 per cent. for both peaks combined. Figures for First Great Western Link for the count in October 2004 were 2.5 per cent. in the morning peak, 1.5 per cent. in the evening peak, and 2.1 per cent. for both peaks combined. This is an average for all trains in the peak period. Where an operator of London commuter services exceeds levels of train crowding specified in the franchise contract, the SRA can, but is not obliged to, require the train operator to produce an action plan for providing more capacity and alleviating overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid=".1323.0/7">It is an inescapable fact that the more heavily laden the train, the greater the number of passengers who are likely to be at risk in the event of an accident. Nevertheless, there is no evidence at present to suggest that overcrowding is, in itself, dangerous or actually causes accidents. All rolling stock is designed to run safely even when fully loaded, so the number of passengers does not affect a train's operating performance or its structural integrity.</p>
	<p pid=".1323.0/8">The Rail Safety and Standards Board is currently researching the health and safety effects of crowding on passengers. First phase results are due to be published shortly. The aim of the work is to establish an understanding of the health and safety issues that may arise as a result of crowding on mainline and underground railways. The research seeks to identify all those situations in which crowding could lead directly to injury or make an accident worse.</p>
	<p pid=".1323.0/9">Furthermore, the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 places a general duty on employers to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that workers and others, including passengers, are not exposed to health and safety risks. On the railways, that duty falls largely on train operating companies and on Network Rail, the infrastructure controller, to manage overcrowding on a day-to-day basis.</p>
	<p pid=".1323.0/10">First Great Western Link ran 82.4 per cent. of its trains to time in the year to 30 September 2004, compared with 74.7 per cent. in the previous 12 months. The average figures for all London area commuter train operators were 84.4 per cent. and 79.7 per cent. respectively. The early weeks of a new timetable often see punctuality slip as the new arrangements become established. However, there is evidence that the new timetable is proving fairly robust. Both First Great Western Link and the SRA are monitoring punctuality and overcrowding. Changes have been incorporated thanks to experience already gained from the new timetable. For example, the 7.27 am service from Twyford is now running more reliably than it did when the timetable was first introduced in December and has been lengthened to 10 coaches.</p>

	<p pid=".1324.0/1">I am grateful to First Great Western Link for having doubled the number of coaches on the 7.27 am Adelante, following considerable pressure from me and the passengers to do something about that service. I am listening very carefully to the Minister's response. She quoted an increase in the number of services to Maidenhead and Twyford, but does she accept that the key issue of concern to my constituents is the length of journey time? That means that many of them are now crowding on to a smaller number of services because many of the services that have been introduced, to which the Minister refers, are now slower services stopping at every station. It is the length of journey time that is crucial. My constituents want it at 20 to 25 minutes, not at the 35 to 40 minutes that some of those other services take.</p>

	<p pid=".1325.0/1">I appreciate the concerns of the hon. Lady's constituents, and I am sure that those representations will have been taken up by the operators and will be looked at in the context of the complaints that they have received. However, the Department has so far received very few representations from the hon. Lady's constituents, although obviously she has made representations on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".1325.0/2">An Oxford to London Paddington service at around 8.15 is calling additionally at Maidenhead to help with overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid=".1325.0/3">Regional planning assessments will form the basis for planning the development of the railway over the next five to 20 years. Those will consider the function of the railway within current and future land use and transport systems, and its role in supporting the economic and wider development objectives of local, regional, devolved and central Government. A key objective of the RPAs will be to maximise value for money in pursuit of the Government's objectives for the environment, safety, economy, accessibility and integration. The RPA for the south-west is due to be published in winter 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1325.0/4">The SRA's forthcoming great western main line route utilisation strategy was published for consultation in January and will examine service patterns on all train services using the London Paddington corridor, including consideration of the practicality and value of providing or changing commuter services to Maidenhead and Twyford.</p>
	<p pid=".1325.0/5">Maidenhead and Twyford are well used stations with substantial numbers of commuters, making reliable, punctual services absolutely vital. The future of rail services from both towns is secure and the SRA will be working with First Great Western Link to improve the performance and quality of the services to and from them.</p>
	<p pid=".1325.0/6">Today, we have had an opportunity to consider the services and for the right hon. Lady to make her points clearly. I am sure that those issues will be noted and taken up by my hon. Friend the Minister of State.</p>
