<p>Is the Minister aware that this year the funding of Merseyside TEC was 7&#x00B7;5 per cent. down in real terms, and that the 231,000 training weeks for which it contracted this year represented a 20 per cent. reduction compared with last year? What sort of Government talk about recovery but are prepared to pay more than treble the amount that they pay out to Merseyside TEC to keep unemployed people idle on Merseyside? Does the Minister appreciate the fact that I represent one of the worst unemployment zones in the country and that when people there hear the Prime Minister talk about recovery they laugh, and laugh and laugh. I cannot wish my constituents a prosperous new year, because the Government will have to go before they can have one.</p>

<p>If anybody laughs, it must be at the hon. Gentleman's whingeing. One must look at what has happened in his constituency. In July 1986, unemployment was 9,472; in October 1992, it was 6,394&#x2014;down by 33 per cent. I hope that even the hon. Gentleman could welcome that.</p>

<p>Will the Minister reflect on the fact that many hundreds of people will be disappointed by his reply, bearing in mind that they have suffered unfair and arbitrary dismissal and have no remedy because they have been employed for less than two years, and many part-time workers, particularly women, have to be employed for five years before they have a remedy? Many people who are rich and powerful obtain substantial sums in compensation, but ordinary workers have no remedy.

<p>At a time of high unemployment we must be wary about making changes that would make recruitment of people more difficult or less likely. But perhaps I can reassure the hon. Gentleman in at least one respect. We plan to extend the rights that people enjoy

<p>Certainly not. We have a higher proportion of women and part-time workers in our work force than do many of our European partners.

<p>Yes. We have always made it clear that TECs will be adequately resourced for that purpose. In the five months since June, 99,000 young people in England have entered youth training. Estimates from TECs last week suggest that of all those young people who left school this summer, about 19,000 have yet to take up a training place. I have written today to the Chairman of the Select Committee on Employment with full details of how TECs are meeting that guarantee and I am taking a close TEC-by-TEC interest to ensure that that guarantee is met.</p>

<p>What would the Secretary of State say to the organisation in my constituency called

Mustard Seed which must fold at the end of the month because it does not have the money to keep going and because the TEC does not have enough money? Mustard Seed deals with the back-end&#x2014;with the young people leaving school who cannot get jobs or apprenticeships. What advice does the Secretary of State have for organisations such as those run by the Church who are trying to keep those kids off the streets and off the dole, but which are folding because of a lack of money? What guarantee does the right hon. Lady have for them?</p>

<p>I thank my right hon. Friend for the statement that she made in reply to the previous question, but is she aware that 1,000 young people in Hampshire still have not been able to get training places?

<p>I can certainly explain with pleasure to my hon. Friend that close attention is being paid to Hampshire TEC's particular problems with meeting the guarantee. As I said, all TECs have the resources required to meet it. In fact, we have provided for 244,000 places for young people in the current year and the number required is only 216,000. There is no problem with resources, but there may be a problem with Hampshire TEC&#x2014;as there are with some others&#x2014;in finding employer placements. Each and every TEC&#x2014;few now are finding difficulty&#x2014;will be helped to meet the guarantee by the end of this month.</p>

<p>How can the Secretary of State say that the guarantee is being met when she has just heard that 1,000 young people in Hampshire have no training places? A similar survey in Fife also found a large shortfall. Is not the reason that the right hon. Lady's budget for this year is &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;5 billion, when, in 1987, in real terms, it was &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;1 billion? In other words, the Secretary of State has only two thirds of the amount that was available in 1987, but unemployment is roughly at the same level. Is not the right hon. Lady abdicating her responsibilities to those who are unemployed and seeking training?</p>

<p>Unlike the hon. Gentleman, we welcome the fact that more young people are staying on at school. That results, perforce, in fewer young people coming forward for a training place. As I said, some TECs have found it difficult this year to find employer placements. There is of course always a surge of demand when young people make up their minds to choose youth


training in the autumn. I repeat that there need be no problem of inadequate resources preventing TECs and LECs from meeting the guarantee.</p>

It will start from April 1993 as part of a new range of measures that together will provide 500,000 more opportunities to help unemployed people back to work&#x2014;resulting in 1&#x00B7;5 million available places.</p>

<p>I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply. The whole House will recognise the priority that the Government place on training for people of 16 and 17, and we welcome the remarks that my right hon. Friend made earlier today. However, is she aware that in our constituencies people are concerned about the plight of people over 18, and over 21, who face unemployment in this dreadful and prolonged recession? That concern is especially marked among those who have retired from work. Will my right hon. Friend redouble her efforts to provide retraining and suitable employment advice for the people whom I have mentioned, and make efforts to bring the below-average TECs up to the standard of the best? Will she also tell me what role she envisages for job clubs?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend may be reassured about the performance of TECs by the knowledge that a larger proportion of their funding will be output related. In other words, the money that they receive for training will be related to the output of jobs and qualifications. We now have a big package of measures which should meet the needs of all those who need to be retrained, reskilled and helped back into work, and we have a vastly increased number of places in job clubs, which have an excellent record in helping people back to work.</p>

<p>That is a selective response from the Minister. Why will workers in the United Kingdom be denied the protection under the social chapter that will be given to their fellow workers in other EC countries when the Maastricht agreement comes into force? Workers in the United Kingdom have poorer working conditions, including hours of work, and are denied collective bargaining rights.

On my hon.

The instruction has not been selected, nor has new clause 22, which deals with the same subject&#x2014;to empower the House to hold a referendum in Scotland to bring Scotland in line with the principle of subsidiarity.<br/>
Can you explain, how the House can meaningfully debate the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, which is based on the principle of subsidiarity, when excluded from such consideration is the only means available to apply subsidiarity to Scotland? Do you agree that the real world should, at least at times, impinge on our discussions in this place, especially as everybody in Europe knows that we cannot have European union without subsidiarity at every level, including in relation to Scotland?

The matter of the government of Scotland, a subject of great importance not only to the hon.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to specify the procedures to be followed when the closure of a coal mine is proposed; to require assessments of efficiency, profitability. contribution to import substitution, competitiveness with other fuels and related matters; to set criteria for the approval or disapproval of a proposed closure; and for connected purposes.</q>
I wish to introduce the Bill to try to prevent any repetition of the disgraceful scenario following the announcement by the President of the Board of Trade during the recess which led to the infamous 13 October statement. I believe that such a Bill is long overdue.<br/>
The country was told in 1984, when the modified colliery review procedure was placed before the deputies' union, NACODS, that the procedure would be sacrosanct. Unlike certain Ministers and many hon. Members, on the Opposition Benches, I understand what "sacrosanct" means. It does not mean that, when things turn a little nasty, the procedure is totally ignored. The procedure has now fallen into disrepute, and I would like to see something replacing it on a statutory basis.<br/>
It was all very well for Lady Thatcher and the then Energy Minister, Mr. Peter Walker, to assure the House that the review procedure would be followed. As time went on, they went missing from the House. Statute law does not go missing; it continues.<br/>
Two issues make me certain beyond doubt that we need to take this matter out of the hands of the Department of Trade and Industry. On 12 October I wrote to the President of the Board of Trade, asking for some borehole information on the coal measures off the Northumberland and Durham coast, information going back to the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Today I have been informed by the Energy Minister that the Department of Trade and Industry has no such information and that if I require it I must approach the National Geological Survey or British Coal. This leads me to believe that the disgusting decision taken in the recess was taken without proper knowledge of the subject.<br/>
What makes me even more convinced that that is the fact that in answer to a question from me in the House the President of the Board of Trade stated that he could not understand why people were buying nuclear or gas-generated power if it was more expensive than coal. If that is his understanding of the subject, we badly need a review and we badly need to take it out of the House, the Department and the Ministry.<br/>
All I ask is quite simply that we go back to what we were promised by the Government in 1984. If that comes about, we will never again have the stupid and ridiculous state of affairs in which a Minister has to come to this House and state quite categorically that he needs three months' breathing space.<br/>
I say again to the President of the Board of Trade that the miners and those who support them have not been fooled by what has been said. We know that the decision to be announced in January or February will be based upon what public pressure can be brought to bear rather than upon the facts of the matter. It is no use Ministers coming to the House and asking for time if they do not intend to do something tangible in that time. Nothing leads me to believe that it was anything other than that.<br/>
I went to Wearmouth colliery last week. Perhaps one or two Conservatives know where that is, but I will tell those who do not. It is in the county of Tyne and Wear, formerly County Durham, and it is in Sunderland&#x2014;not particularly noted for having a good football club, but a place that will be known to most people. I went down the mine at Wearmouth colliery to see a new face which it has cost &#x00A3;20 million to get to over many years. The face is in some of the best conditions that anyone, including me, will have seen in this country. It is in a seam of coal in undisturbed geological strata more than 8 ft thick. Yet that colliery, according to the President of the Board of Trade, was to be mothballed. I was supposed to be thankful for that. It meant that, out of the 21 collieries proposed for closure, it was somewhere between numbers one and four in the rating, so there were at least 17, and possibly 20, behind it. I am not satisfied with that, and there are many other people who are not satisfied with it. That is why I am asking the House to support the Bill.<br/>
I should like to pay a tribute here&#x2014;I have not had an opportunity to do so before&#x2014;to hon. Members on the Government Benches who supported the miners and those who support them by voting with the Opposition to ensure that a proper review was carried out. We shall be eternally grateful to that handful of Members. One of them has certainly suffered, and it may well be that others will do so, but they have our gratitude. Many hon. Members stated that they were voting only for the review and that their final vote would be based upon what was proposed by the President of the Board of Trade as and when the review was completed. We hope that those hon. Members will join us should we not get the result that we wish to get.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. May I express the thanks of those of us concerned about the Bill for the preparations that you have made, which I hope will mean that we do not have a repetition of what happened in 1972&#x2014;[Horn. MEMBERS: "Why not?"] We had 15 hours of points of order until 7 am.<br/>
The first three amendments on the Order Paper, Nos. 73 to 75 in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore), some hon. Friends and myself, have not, according to the provisional selection of amendments, been selected for debate by you, Mr. Morris. However, I wish to put to you in as simple language as I can, some of the reasons why I hope that you will consider the matter before we debate the amendments that you have selected and will reinstate those amendments.<br/>
The European union created by the treaty has two components. First, the novel titles, I, V, VI and VII, which create a new entity known as European union, which is contained in articles A to F and title I; title V on foreign and defence, articles J to J(II); title VI on justice and home affairs, articles K to K(9); and title VII, the final provisions L to S. The second component already partially exists&#x2014;the treaties of Rome, Paris and Brussels relating to the coal and steel and Euratom treaties. They are in place now and are not new. The treaty will amend, update and strengthen those with various matters relating to subsidiarity, the European Parliament and economic and monetary union.<br/>
In the Bill, the Government have been remarkably economic with the words and those matters, which are contained in at least 238 articles in the treaty of Rome, are subsumed only under titles II, III and IV, despite the fact that the Bill provides for the whole treaty, which is particularly on European union&#x2014;that is the long title. The items that I have specified appear only in subsection (k), which we are adding to the European Communities Bill. The Bill does not provide for consideration of titles I, III and V, which are important to the House in terms of something new in the treaty.<br/>
Therefore, we must ask by what method the House can ratify those important new elements of the treaty. According to the Foreign Secretary, who is not here&#x2014;the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Watford (Mr. Garel-Jones) is present&#x2014;those matters are an intergovernmental "outer building" and do not involve too much the Community's existing institutions. Indeed, under article C they are required to be a single institutional framework and at least 40 references are made to the Commission, the Council, the court or the Parliament in those new parts of the treaty, so we cannot separate them quite as much as the Minister of State and the Foreign Secretary decide.<br/>
In selecting the amendment of the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown)&#x2014;one of his hon. Friends will no doubt move it&#x2014;and the other amendments in the group, all relating to title I, articles A to F, you may allow

us, Mr. Morris, at least to debate title II. Debates about foreign affairs, security, justice and home affairs may follow later.<br/>
But, Mr. Morris, you have selected the amendments on line 9 of sub-paragraph (k), which is the pipeline to the European Communities Act. That simply adds those matters to the automatic or near automatic obligation of the House and the United Kingdom to the obligations contained in the original treaty. It in no way allows us to deal separately with the major items that I have outlined. Even if they are debated, as they may well be, whether or not they go into sub-paragraph (k) or are left out, that is no way to find out whether the House approves them. All we are doing is making them automatically effective.<br/>
Therefore, I submit that if we are to ratify, which is surely what this is all about, the matters relating to European union and its foreign policy, justice and home provisions, which are important to everyone, we must have some free standing amendments.<br/>
The amendments in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney propose that we would give a specific debate to each of the titles and have a vote on them, just as we would on a statutory instrument, and approve them or not, as the case may be, to enable the Government to ratify the treaty. But at the moment we do not have that opportunity under the Bill or under the amendments.<br/>
There will not be a specific debate on those matters as there would be on a statutory instrument on, for instance, dog licences. The House would be able to decide yes or no on such a statutory instrument, but not yes or no to ratification of those important titles of the treaty.<br/>
There is an even greater reason why we must have separate debates on those matters away from subparagraph (k). Foreign affairs and security are matters for the royal prerogative. Having made inquiries, I understand that the Government do not necessarily require the Bill to ratify the European union articles of the treaty.<br/>
Under the treaty, all that the Minister has to do is to send a certificate of ratification to the Italian President. Therefore, we are not in a position to say yes or no despite the fact that we shall be handing over to other bodies the power of the royal prerogative itself.<br/>
Unless the three amendments in the name of my right hon. Friend, or something similar, are selected, perhaps at a later stage, the House will be deprived of debating the specific importance of the articles, of the surrounding edifice of the European union, in a manner which is less specific than would be the case under a statutory instrument for domestic legislation for a dog licence.<br/>
Unless we can do so, the process of ratification by our own constitutional requirements which the treaty provides will not have been followed because we shall not have the opportunity specifically to discuss and vote on those important matters relating to European union.</p>

The hon. Gentleman makes his point of order with his usual thoroughness and conviction and puts it in Memberconstituency


succinct a form as he was able, even though it was pretty long. I can provide him with an answer, but it will be rather short.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 73 to 75 provide that certain parts of the treaty are to be ratified only when the House has agreed to ratification. This is not a Bill to ratify the treaty. I repeat that: this is not a Bill to ratify the treaty. Therefore, amendments to put a limitation on ratification are beyond the scope of the Bill. Nevertheless, I may say, in respect of the hon. Gentleman's concluding words, that although I cannot anticipate amendments that may be tabled in future, of course I will consider any such amendments&#x2014;but I am not promising anything at this stage.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. I have three brief, genuine points of order. <i>[Laughter.]</i> I can assure right hon. and hon. Members who are laughing that nothing has made me more sick than sitting through all those European debates when Governments of both parties have deliberately restricted discussion. Why cannot we debate a referendum clause? Right hon. and hon. Members have made several attempts. I tabled such an amendment and I see no reason why you, Mr. Morris, as the Chairman of Ways and Means and being responsible to the British people and to right hon. and hon. Members who want to express a view, cannot give approval to debating amendment No. 70, for example, which does not involve any expenditure. It is just a means of giving everyone an opportunity, whether or not they want to take it, to express an opinion on a referendum.<br/>
Your Clerks, Mr. Morris, have been more than helpful, but is it the case&#x2014;as I fear&#x2014;that the Bill has been drafted in such a way as to prevent right hon. and hon. Members from expressing a view on whether there should be a referendum? Despite the restrictions imposed by not having a money resolution, would it not be possible to have a vote on amendment No. 70, which would give right hon. and hon. Members the right, not to express a view, as some of them want, but to say yes or no to whether the people of this country should have some say in handing over their freedoms and liberty without their specific permission? Could we not have a debate, on any clause or amendment, on whether or not there should be a referendum?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. I draw your attention to clause 3 and to the proposed amendments to that clause, none of which has been selected. The list of selected amendments refers to a "provisional selection", and the remarks that you made a few moments ago, Mr. Morris, were very helpful.<br/>
When I saw the helpful Clerks in the Table Office after tabling amendment No. 89, I was informed that the fact that there was not a money resolution in the Bill did not debar an amendment such as mine making provision for a referendum. In the terms of that amendment, a money resolution is not necessary&#x2014;but before the amendment could be implemented, the Government would have to table a Ways and Means resolution.<br/>
Have amendment No. 89 and the others on clause 3 been rejected, or will the published provisional selection be supplemented by further examination of amendments that have not been considered so far&#x2014;including amendment No. 89? Or was your reply, Mr. Morris, to the hon. Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) an intimation that my amendment is debarred because of the absence of a money resolution?<br/>
When I saw the Clerks, I was informed that my amendment was perfectly in order for selection and debate, even though the mechanism for implementing it was not available in the Bill. I share the view of the hon. Member for Southend, East that the House should have an opportunity to debate the question of a referendum&#x2014;and if that proposal were carried, it would be up to the Government to provide the machinery and the Ways and Means resolution to put it into operation.<br/>
It would be an important denial of the debating powers of the House if such an amendment were not selected and considered. If the amendment is defective, clearly we shall have to devise one which is not, but when I submitted my amendment I was told that it would stand, and that it could be debated. My information was that the House could consider a referendum. If it does not do so, millions of people will question the validity of the House in ignoring that possibility.</p>

<p>Order. May I rule on the point of order that has already been raised? I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) for raising it, but I am afraid that the information that he was given on amendment No. 89 was not correct. The amendment is out of order as it stands. I re-emphasise to the hon. Gentleman and to all hon. Members that the list is a provisional selection of amendments. We are starting on clause 1; the hon.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. May I make a general point about the difficulties involved in interpreting the meaning of the treaty? As you know, with domestic legislation the words that a Minister uses in advancing his argument about the meaning of a clause have now become


more important and binding, because, following a recent decision of the House of Lords, the Minister's words may be considered when the wording of the legislation is being construed. Furthermore, if by chance the House of Lords, or even the Court of Appeal, gives the words of a statute a meaning that was not anticipated, it is relatively easy&#x2014;I do not pretend that it is very easy&#x2014;for the Government to introduce amending legislation, and sometimes even to rectify with retrospective legislation any injustice which may have been done because of the misunderstanding about the wording.<br/>
Here we have an entirely different situation. We are not dealing with domestic legislation which will be interpreted by the House of Lords, and which is subject to possible amendment by a sovereign Parliament. If the treaty is ratified, it will be interpreted first by the Commission, which has the right of initiative, and secondly by the European Court.<br/>
It is important to understand that the Government have already made some extremely wide assertions about what the treaty does not do. At the Conservative party conference, the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Morris. You have enormous power and influence over these proceedings, and as we struggle to understand the meaning of the treaty, the very raising&#x2014;or even the half raising&#x2014;of your eyebrow will cause the Government to jitter with fear. If you were to say that you thought that an external objective explanation of what the treaty meant would assist the House, I expect that thet Government would immediately accede to your suggestion.<br/>
I shall explain briefly why I think that that is necessary. For instance, at the Conservative party conference, the Prime Minister made five points about the treaty which I, as a pompous lawyer&#x2014;[HoN. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] If my right hon. Friend had made those assertions before any judge who happened to be even half awake, they would have been described as very brave.<br/>
My right hon. Friend was brave enough to say, for example, that the treaty had nothing to do with immigration. I invite the Committee to look at the treaty. The Committee will see that it deals specifically with immigration. After my right hon. Friend's splendid and brave speech, which was so well received by the Tory party conference, all of whose members had read the details of the treaty with great care, no doubt&#x2014;</p>

<p>Further to the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) and by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer). As we are beginning our deliberations in Committee today&#x2014;we know why we are beginning them&#x2014;it is important to realise that the Bill is the most crucial legislation that could come before the House. I am sure that you take the point, Mr. Morris.<br/>
If the Bill is passed, the constitutional arrangement of the United Kingdom&#x2014;we will argue this when we come to the details&#x2014;will undoubtedly be changed. Many of us believe that the change will be for the worse, although I realise that that is not a matter for the Chair, but a matter for debate.<br/>
I cannot conceive of any other measure that will come before us for many years which could have such a crucial bearing on the future of this country. That is true whether one takes a critical view, as I do, or whether one takes the view that we should go down the federal road, which I believe to be the whole purpose of the treaty. I ask you simply this, Mr. Morris: what opportunity can we be given to say, either as a House of Commons or as a Committee, that the people of our country should be consulted?<br/>
You, Mr. Morris, have said that the selection of amendments is provisional. Those who have a view different from the view of those of us who are critical may share the belief that the British people should be consulted. If that is not the case, and if we are to debate measures that, in so many ways, will change the constitutional arrangement of our country and which will take substantial powers away from the House of Commons&#x2014;there is no doubt that that will happen if the treaty comes into effect&#x2014;what opportunity will the British people have to express their views?<br/>
The British people may come to the view that the treaty is right we do not know. In the 1975 referendum, the British people voted in the way that I did not want, but at least they were consulted. I choose my words carefully and I make no criticism of you, Mr. Morris. It will be a tragedy both for the House and for our country if we pass into legislation the provisions of the treaty concerning the United Kingdom without being able to say to the British people, "Here is your opportunity to speak."</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. There is something very sinister about this affair. I listened very carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), who kicked off with his point of order regarding certain amendments. I listened to a couple of other hon. Members talking about the need for a referendum. I also read the papers this morning. For the first time on this issue I was able to read briefings in almost every so-called quality newspaper about how the Chairman of Ways and Means would deal with hon. Members who happen to have an alternative view to that of the two Front Benches on the common market and on Maastricht. That is sinister.<br/>
You should understand, Mr. Morris, that you are sitting in that chair because of the democracy that is practised in this country. Under the treaty, in some circumstances it is likely that some of those powers will be eroded, yet those briefings suggest that the Chairman of Ways and Means is going to take action to stop Members of Parliament representing their constituents, 68 per cent. of whom in many of the surveys that have been conducted want to get out of the Maastricht treaty and do not want anything to do with it. However, when my hon. Friends and others try to call for a referendum, we are steamrollered because of the briefings that we have already read.<br/>
I regard that as a distasteful development and it should be stopped. It is high time that we stood up for the people of Britain, the majority of whom want to say no to Maastricht. The House of Commons, on occasions, is supposed to represent the views of the British people. I get the clear impression that, generally speaking, when the two Front Benches are in agreement, the Chair goes along with it. I am waiting for an answer in the negative to that.<br/>
I have been a Member for a considerable time, and it has always been the case that, when the two Front Benches agree, and we have the Liberal Democrats throwing their weight behind them, Back-Benchers' views are treated with disdain, even though we represent a massive majority of the people outside. I believe that we should discuss that amendment on a referendum, and I do not&#x2014;</p>

I regard that as chicanery. It is high time that the Chair and the House of Commons, irrespective of the two Front Benches, understood that those of us who have a different view from that of the Front Bench, and believe

that the common market has been an unmitigated disaster from beginning to end, are fed up with British families having to pay &#x00A3;18 every week to bail out that tinpot club.

Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), escaped the difficulties that are inherent in the requirement for a money resolution. However, there were one or two small errors that needed to be corrected. As I understand it, it was for that reason that the new clause could not at that time, this morning, be included in the provisional list of amendments. Given the fact that suitable adjustments will be made, am I correct in thinking that we are getting close to the target and that the new clause, which I have retabled, is likely to be selected?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. You very kindly invited some people to your room yesterday in order to avoid a frustrating points of order session, but this is not just a point of order. What we are discussing is the relationship between different parts of the constitution. You pointed out that the House has no power to ratify or not to ratify the Maastricht treaty. That is correct, because the Queen has the power and the Prime Minister exercises it. So you reminded us of our inherent impotence.<br/>
You then told us, Mr. Morris, that you were prepared to consider, and you did not rule out, amendments on a referendum, and you advised us to try at different stages to see whether we could get past the Clerks. That is no way to treat our constituents. I was elected 42 years ago on Friday. I am not prepared to wait until later to find out whether the people of Chesterfield have any role in a treaty which, if implemented, would change fundamentally their relationship with the Executive. I am not prepared to do it.<br/>
If you say that there are certain ways in which this can be done and that the Clerks will be empowered to help us do it, that is one thing, but why should we play games with the Clerks&#x2014;"Line 2 is out of order and I cannot tell you why. Like Mr. Asquith, wait and see whether I select it." At the outset of consideration of the Bill, the British people are entitled to know whether they have any rights at all in determining whether the treaty goes through.<br/>
I first advocated a referendum in 1968. It took me about seven years to persuade the Labour party; my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition voted for a referendum. Now I am afraid there has been some slippage which will need to be dealt with again. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Of course it will be dealt with. Does anyone honestly think that the Labour party will unite with the Tory party on the one issue on which the British people have no rights? Is the House saying now that the British people have no rights?<br/>
Whether there is a referendum depends on what the House decides, but I beg you, Mr. Morris, not to appear to be leaving it open as if it was a game with "Erskine May". It is not a game with "Erskine May". A fundamental question is involved. The Government do not object to a referendum, so long as it is in Denmark. If there is a Danish referendum and the Danes say no again, the Maastricht treaty goes down the pan anyway. So my constituents are being told that their future will be decided by Crown prerogative here and by the Danish people there. Politically it is not on.<br/>
I launched a petition for a referendum, and I am getting thousands of letters. I have another petition to present tomorrow. People of all opinions from all over the country want to have their say on Maastricht. The Liberal party is for Maastricht and for a referendum, as will be made clear when we come to it.<br/>
It is essential, Mr. Morris, if I may put it to you in my last word, that you make it clear that it is possible to find a form of words which does not fall foul of a money resolution and which will allow the British people to have a say. I put that to you with great passion and fervour. It is not my rights which are at stake but the rights of the people who sent every hon. Member here.</p>

<p>I shall make two points. First, the Clerks are not empowered to make decisions. Secondly, I have had to make those decisions and they have had to be based on the rules of debate of the House. I have more constituents than the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) and they are just as important as everyone else's. I recognise the strength of feeling, but debates in the House have to be in order. I hope that we can find an amendment that is appropriate and in order. I am encouraging those people who have done a great deal of work on that to continue with that work, and to hone the amendment so that it is in order.</p>

<p>I seek your guidance on a narrow point of order, Mr. Morris. In the remarks that have been made so far it has been made clear that the Maastricht treaty is a legal document and it is therefore essential that the wording is precise in all its different forms. Before we debate clause 1, title I, might I draw your attention to page 88, article S of the treaty available in the House, which states:
<q>This Treaty, drawn up in a single original in the Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish languages, the texts in each of these languages being equally authentic".</q>
However, on page 7, in article B, I do not find the English translation that I expected but two untranslated French words, "acquis communautaire".</p>

<p>My hon. Friend suggests that they are untranslatable. For the purpose of clarity, I took the trouble to obtain a copy of Collins English-French dictionary, because the word "acquis" has a number of possible meanings. It could mean "experience", "gain", "achieve", "be sure of", or "take for granted"&#x2014;and those are just some of its meanings. A number of words of French origin are in common parlance in my constituency and in the House&#x2014;for example, "laissez faire". Cooks talk about something being "garni"; and we talk about omelettes. I have no doubt that hon. Members could think of other possibilities. But "acquis communautaire" is not in common parlance.<br/>
If we are to discuss title I and to accord it the detailed consideration required by a legal document which has to be precise, can you, Mr. Morris, with your sweep of foreign languages, immediately translate it for me, or will you invite someone else to do so, before we discuss the matter, because it is of some importance?</p>

<p>Are you aware, Mr. Morris&#x2014;as I hope you are&#x2014;that the House will support you entirely in condemning the outrageous allegations which were made against you and the Chair by the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner)? I have been here almost twice as long as the hon. Gentleman and I have never heard such allegations made; nor have I ever heard the Chair allow them to be made. Indeed, my experience has been exactly the opposite&#x2014;that we Back Benchers know the extraordinary lengths to which your predecessors and the other occupants of the Chair have gone to to ensure that we get proper treatment. I pay tribute to them for that.<br/>
I hope that, when the hon. Member for Bolsover calms down, he will withdraw his completely unjustifiable allegations against you as the Chair. You are in the Chair and we shall support you in your decisions on the choice of amendments down for discussion. Those hon. Members who want to use your decisions as a means to make their speeches are not justified in doing so in any way. Finally, it is obviously your responsibility as well as in your power to consider any amendments that are tabled, but I do not think that it is within the power of the Chair to suggest that it may be possible for amendments to be tabled which will meet the needs of individual Members, so we shall support you in making your decisions, and support you to the full.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. It seems to be one of those afternoons in which we are all making statements about sticking out for this or that group, and interpreting what the British people want. Perhaps I could simply chuck in my lot. I should like to stick out for the decisions of the Labour party conference, which were distinctly and overwhelmingly in favour of


Maastricht. I simply tell those who have talked a great deal about conference decisions in the past that they should face it that&#x2014;like it or not&#x2014;there were clear decisions at the Labour party conference in favour of Maastricht&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. M orris. My point of order is less controversial than the previous ones, but it is within your competence in the Chair to direct me on it. The great odyssey on which we have just launched ourselves will require Members of Parliament to have great sustenance during the many days ahead&#x2014;the sustenance of information rather than anything stronger, I hasten to add.<br/>
Clearly, the rules of debate in Committee are different from those that normally pertain to debates on the Floor of the House. We want you to rule on the matter of the provision of information to us. As ever, the Government are greatly assisted by the civil servants who sit in i he Box. They can pass pieces of paper and take writing material into the Box with them. That is in order.<br/>
Those of us who must battle against the serried ranks of the civil servants and Ministers can normally, in Committee, rely on our advisers sitting next to us to perform a similar function. However, when we are in the Chamber, our advisers sit under the Gallery. Normally, anyone who takes writing material into the Box or tries to write notes is quickly admonished. I wonder whether you could rule that it is in order for us to have our advisers under the Gallery and freely exchange written notes and material with them during the course of what I suspect will be an exceedingly long Committee.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. I wonder whether you could help the House and the people outside who are watching our affairs by explaining how you propose to proceed with the Committee. Several points of order have already been raised with you on the amendments that you have not selected. In my experience, the selection of amendments is

rightly left to you and the Clerks, under strictly understood rules and regulations, and questions to you regarding amendments that you have not selected are strictly out of order. Is that the procedure that you are going to adopt in Committee?<br/>
Would it therefore be out of order to raise issues about amendments that have not been selected? I think that the Committee would be grateful for your ruling on that, so that we can proceed in an orderly fashion and know exactly when we shall get down to matters of substance.</p>

Its monetarist economic framework will impose massive deflation and lead to mass unemployment and cuts in public spending.<br/>
I believe that if a leading amendment&#x2014;for example, amendment No. 36 on the European central bank&#x2014;is moved by my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition and voted on, the other amendments in the group do not necessarily have to be voted on.

<p>I am grateful to be called. On a point of order, Mr. Morris. Will you provide some guidance to the Committee? This is a three-clause Bill, and is very short. However, you have chosen to provide the Committee with a long series of grouped amendments on separate subjects, which is extremely helpful and will enable us to have a proper debate under clear subject headings. It will help the Committee and those people outside who are following the debate with great interest.<br/>
The House gave the Bill a thorough Second Reading and I believe&#x2014;I seek guidance on the matter&#x2014;that the measure has already spent more time on the Floor of the House than did the Single European Act during its passage through the House. Therefore, would it not be helpful if we made as rapid progress as possible through the various headings? It would be inappropriate to have further debates on amendments that you have not called, some of which&#x2014;such as those relating to a referendum&#x2014;many Conservative Members do not believe to be appropriate.<br/>
We believe that it is the duty of the House to scrutinise the Bill, and any further discussions on items such as


referendums will delay the Committee's ability to consider the helpful groups of amendments already tabled. Can we make progress?</p>

Members, which would bring in article F, deals with the raising of resources, the means necessary for the

Community to achieve its objectives. That seems to many of us to be quite clearly a question which relates to money that would be raised to pay for the objectives of the treaty. Therefore, we should like you to rule on whether that matter gives rise to a requirement for a money resolution if title I is accepted as part of the Bill.</p>

<p>This is my second very brief point of order and there is no question of my doing anything more than asking things that matter. You, Mr. Morris, have selected amendments in large groups; one of them has 27 separate amendments. I ask a general question: would it be your intention, as some of us believe these are rather important issues, that something should be said on each amendment if the hon. Member who has tabled it wishes to speak, before consideration is given to a motion for the closure? It would honestly be, although I appreciate the very good reasons&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. In your very generous selection of amendments&#x2014;and I commend you on how they have been done&#x2014;may I draw your attention to amendment No. 93 which is the leading amendment in the first grouping? In the debate on that amendment and on the others in that group shall we be able to raise the matters that are guaranteed for ever under the Act of Union between Scotland and England? Those are the words in the Act. I draw your attention to the fact that there are aspects of Scottish law&#x2014;a separate legal system and a separate educational system. I am sure you know that in Scotland the ancient universities are guaranteed in perpetuity.</p>

<p>I have two brief points of order to raise with you, Mr. Morris, because we all want to get on. First, you will be well aware that this is a real cruncher of a Bill. It is enormous, and vast numbers of amendments have been tabled. The amendments, as is traditional, have been set out and put down in sequence in the Bill, and they have numbers. The new clauses at the back are fairly easy to refer to, because they are in numerical order.<br/>
I have no doubt that during the Committee stage on the Floor of the House, hon. Members will from time to time, as is their wont, refer to various amendments. There are about 84 pages of amendments, and interested hon. Members wishing to follow the debate will be scrabbling through trying to find a particular amendment to which reference may just have been made.<br/>
I suggest that it would be helpful, if it were possible, for us to have two lists of amendments, the traditional one, which is right and proper, and a further list that would be


composed of the same amendments but in numerical order. That would be very helpful to us and I see no reason why that should not be done.<br/>
The second point that I wish to raise with you, Mr. Morris&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. One point at a time, please. What I have tried to do in the provisional selection of amendments is quite clear. It should be within the ability of hon. Members to find their way round eight amendments, and hopefully, hon. Members will have done just a little preparation before coming into the Chamber.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. In regard to the grouping of amendments., may I ask you to confirm that only the first of a group is moved but that there is no impediment or prohibition on any hon. Member speaking to other amendments in the group? May I further ask you to confirm that if, on other amendments in the group, an hon. Member wishes a separate vote to take place, he can ask for that to happen? My understanding of the general custom is that in most cases, such a separate vote is allowed.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. Almost the final words of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill are:
<q>The Bill will have no direct financial effect in the United Kingdom.</q>
I am confused, if only because of the cohesion fund in the treaty and the fact that the British Government are now engaged in budgetary explorations, as President of the Community. So I cannot reconcile an assertion of that nature with what is contained in the treaty and what we are about to be asked to legislate for in the Bill. What is the ruling on the basis of an assertion of that nature, when the nation and the House know full well that financial implications for the country and taxpayers arise as a result of the consequences of the Bill?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for raising that point, but I must tell him that the Chair is not responsible for what is in the Bill. I suspect that the hon. Member might catch my eye and be able to question the Government, who will, no doubt, wish to refer to the point.</p>

<p>I hope that you take seriously my points, Mr. Morris. I am not trying to delay or frustrate. Politically, the matter is important and I am trying to find a way round the difficulty.<br/>
As this is a provision for Community citizenship, why should not the Community pay the cost of the referendum, avoiding the problem of the money resolution? We are in entirely new territory now. Hitherto, there have never been resources to do anything in Britain, except from the British Government on the initiative of the Crown through the Treasury. Now we are in a new position and I am asking&#x2014;I am sure that you will consider my request carefully, Mr. Morris&#x2014;whether you will consider the possibility of an amendment being tabled saying that, before the Bill comes into effect, the Community shall be required to organise a referendum in this country at no direct cost to the taxpayer, because it would come out of the British contribution. I put that forward as a serious suggestion.</p>

<p>I raise my third&#x2014;again, a genuine&#x2014;point of order, Mr. Morris. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My other points of order were equally genuine, whatever some hon. Members may think.<br/>
We have found with other European treaties, and as a result of debates on European issues, a wide variation between what we thought we were voting for and what actually happened. That has not happened with normal domestic legislation. A good example of that was the merchant shipping legislation and its effect on Scottish fishermen.<br/>
Is it possible for you, Mr. Morris, as our chairman, to ask for written notes either from the Commission, which would seem the most appropriate, or from the European Court, for example, on issues that might show whether the United Kingdom would be under an obligation to join the ERM? I have read five different proposals and interpretations and I do not know which is right. The Government and Opposition do not know either, and we shall have to wait until we are told by the European Court. To save the time of the House and to prevent unnecessary and tedious debate, may I ask you to examine whether there is any procedure for you, as our Chairman, to ask for a ruling from the Commission or the European Court?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr Morris. I raise with you the question of the Queen's consent to the Bill. It is clear that the measure affects prerogative, and of course the Queen would be regarded as a citizen of the so-called union. In those circumstances, may I ask whether the Queen's consent has been obtained? I cannot recall that happening on Second Reading. I understand that in important or urgent circumstances, it may be given at any point during the proceedings.<br/>
Will you be good enough, Mr. Morris, to ensure that the Queen is not only asked, but is given an opportunity to be fully briefed on the implications of the legislation as respects her prerogative so that her consent may, if necessary, be given?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. I seek your guidance on a point that arises on the first grouping of amendments but which may also arise on later groups. We are dealing in the Bill with a brief piece of domestic legislation, but we are looking through the measure to substantive provisions in the treaty. That is evident in the first group of amendments.<br/>
The lead amendment, No. 93, proposes that title I be added to the Bill&#x2014;be included in the provisions that are incorporated in domestic law&#x2014;but all the subsequent amendments, with the exception of No. 108, suggest that we add title I minus one or other of the articles in title I. That means that, unlike the provisions of a clause in a domestic piece of legislation, we are required to vote on the wider provision before voting on amendments to that provision.<br/>
In other words, if title I were clause 1, we would move and debate and presumably then vote on a succession of amendments to clause 1. Only then, when we had established the shape of clause 1, would we vote on the broad question of "clause stand part". That is a sensible and logical way of proceeding. By virtue of the way in which this group of amendments is constructed, however, we are required to vote&#x2014;I assume, if the ordinary rules apply&#x2014;on amendment No. 93; that is, on the overall question whether title I should be added to the Bill.<br/>
What I want to know from you, Mr. Morris, is what would be the effect of a decision in either direction on our ability to vote on subsequent amendments. I take the point that you made in response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) a moment ago, but on the assumption that you were disposed to allow divisions on subsequent amendments, how would that be possible if we had voted either to add title I in its entirety or had voted not to add title I at all? What possibility would we have of voting on Amendments Nos 344, 345 and so on?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. Is it the intention that votes will be taken immediately after a particular group of amendments has been debated? Also, would it be the intention that each one of those amendments, although grouped together, could be voted on separately when the time came?</p>

<p>I should like your guidance on a similar point, Mr. Morris. I understand the necessity to group the large number of amendments under these headings, and in most cases I understand why one must wait until the amendment comes up, because often those amendments are somewhere later in the Bill. In the vast majority of cases now, however, the groups of amendments are at exactly the same place in the Bill as the one before, because of the narrow nature of the Bill. Will you therefore have discretion to call the amendments for a vote, if you accept them, in order, rather than wait for some subsequent time to vote on an amendment which is 10 or 13 amendments down the road, although they are all in the same place in the Bill? I understand why in normal Committee procedure one must wait: amendments grouped with others may come later in the Bill. In this case they are in identical positions, with all the amendments in the same spot.<br/>
For sheer simplicity and for the ease of understanding of hon. Members, is it in your discretion, if you accept amendments after the lead amendment and you allow us to have a vote on them, to call them straight away rather than wait for some esoteric moment?</p>

<p>Further to the point of order made by my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor). Perhaps I could make a suggestion on which you, Mr. Morris, may be able to act. It would seem that the European Court cannot give an advisory opinion on anything except a proposed treaty between the Community and some external body; it therefore seems unlikely that the court can give us an advisory opinion. It is also perhaps unwise to obtain an opinion from the Commission because it is such a political body.<br/>
I am informed, however, that the Council has some 2,000 employees and a substantial legal staff in its employ, and I understand that it would be able to give an advisory opinion, particularly since, at the present time, the British Government hold the presidency. So I hope that you, Mr. Morris, will perhaps offer some word of advice to the Government.<br/>

Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), you explained how extraneous material which was encompassed in the treaty could perhaps, possibly by a vote, come to be part of the Bill, which some of us might regard as a difficult concept but none the less an important one for the Committee to consider. You have been very helpful and there have been a number of significant clarifications, so I am not questioning in any way your decisions in the Chair, Mr. Morris.<br/>
I note, however, that for over one hour and 20 minutes we have had points of order of varying quality, substance and depth. As one who, reflecting other hon.

<p>I hope that it may be a new point of order, Mr. Morris. Having read all the amendments and new clauses, I find that no point has covered my concern about the definition of subsidiarity. As a new Member, I seek to know from you whether it is possible, even at this late stage, and having heard what other hon. M embers have said about the difficulty of getting anything through the Clerks, to table a new clause relating to the definition of subsidiarity, which might clarify article 3B, which does not define subsidiarity in a way that anyone has found useful and merely obfuscates rather than clarifies. Would it be possible to bring in a new clause?</p>

<p>I seek further clarification of the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd). I am not clear whether the Chair has the right to look at the question whether a Bill needs a money resolution. lf, as a matter of fact, further financial resources are committed by the British Government under the treaty of union, is it a matter for the Chair whether the Bill will be valid without a money resolution? If not, how do hon. Members

properly raise the issue in debate? It is critical for many reasons, not least because it is necessary to have a money resolution if some of the amendments are to be allowed.</p>

<p>You will know, Mr. Morris, that when an hon. Member who has no Government backing introduces a Bill. let us say, on a Friday, and manages to get it through Second Reading without a money resolution and, as a result of various changes in the course of proceedings, finally manages to get it through the House, there have been scores of occasions when the Government, because they have been satisfied with the nature of the Bill, have decided to allow a money resolution to be added. The Bill may not have started with one, but many times it has finished with one.<br/>
I suggest to you, Mr. Morris, that in this case any amendment which leads to the necessity for a money resolution could be treated in the same way as a private Member's Bill which starts off without Government backing. It is the same principle and it ought to be allowed on this occasion as well.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. A short while ago, in response to the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), you drew our attention to the Third Reading of the Bill, where Queen's Consent to the prerogative was mentioned. There have been many attempts, both in Select Committee and in questions, to get a Government view on whether the monarch, the Crown, with or without family, with or without taxes, will be a citizen of the European union. Article 8 of the treaty reads:
<q>Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights conferred by this Treaty and be subject to the duties imposed thereby.</q>
I infer that possibly the fact that the Queen's prerogative has been placed at the disposal of the House in this respect means that, if this treaty is indeed ratified and comes into effect, provided all nations concerned ratify it, the monarch, whoever that may be in the future, will be subject to the duties imposed thereby as a citizen of the union. The constitutional implications of that with regard to foreign affairs, security, the administration of justice and the courts' decisions are, as you will know, profound.<br/>
I do not necessarily expect you to answer immediately, Mr. Morris, but how can the House find out whether the monarch of the day will become a citizen of the union? If you cannot rule on that now, because you may not know yourself, can you indicate to the House how it can find out before we reach the debate on this most important matter?</p>

<p>So we have begun at last, Mr. Morris.<br/>
It is worth recalling to the House that when the Danish referendum took place there was, two days later, a meeting of the Council of Ministers in Oslo at which all member states, including the United Kingdom agreed to proceed with ratification forthwith&#x2014;something that we have notably failed thus far to do, although many other countries have so proceeded.<br/>
You said very early on in dealing with points of order, Mr. Morris, that this Bill is not about ratification. You emphasised that, and said that it is specifically not about ratification. In legal terms you are certainly right; I am the last person to argue with the Chair about that; but the consequence of not passing this Bill would be that the treaty would not be ratified, even if that is not in proper legal constitutional terms the real situation.<br/>
A limited number of amendments can be made without affecting the purity of the treaty. Many people have said that this short Bill can hardly be changed, and that, if it is, it will wreck the treaty and therefore Maastricht will fall.</p>

<p>What the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) regards as wonderful and what I regard as wonderful are wide apart.<br/>
It cannot be said, however, that, if amendment No. 93 is passed, it will break the treaty. It can be argued&#x2014;no doubt the Minister will do so&#x2014;that it affects British domestic legislation. That is a different question, and I shall consider it, but it is worth stressing that the insertion of the titles does not change or breach the treaty or nullify ratification.<br/>
Interestingly, the same applies to the opt-outs that the United Kingdom has entered into. I am not sure whether it is proper to raise a point of order in the middle of a speech, but if, for example, the Committee decided that it wished to reinsert the social chapter which the Government have opted out of, it would affect other member countries, because they each would have to introduce a new short protocol in their own Parliaments reversing the opt out that they had previously agreed. It would not, however, affect the integrity of the treaty. I think that I am right in saying that. That point was not made in the many points of order, but we shall have to consider it. It certainly does not apply to title I or titles V to VII, which may be inserted without affecting the treaty.<br/>
We contend that hon. Members should have the right not simply to debate the treaty but to approve the title. We are arguing about ratification a la carte, whereby the Government choose the bits that they want to ratify. I think that Britain is the only country to have excluded Parliament's right to express an opinion or accept a part of the treaty. Most other member states introduced a simple Bill, to which the treaty was attached. That is not how we are proceeding. perhaps because of the nature or our legislative practice and the fact that, unfortunately, we do not have a written constitution.<br/>
The Minister will argue that title I is declaratory and therefore has no sense in law and that, as the other titles are intergovernmental, Parliament has no role. Ratification is a well-established process in international law. The 19th-century dictionary of diplomacy by Baron de Cussy defines it as
<q>the act by which the sovereigns in whose name a treaty has been negotiated and concluded, approve the provisions cif this treaty and undertake to put it into effect.</q>
The point about the sovereign is raised often enough by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn). The days have long passed when, in reality, kings were sovereign in this respect.<br/>
Dicey, writing on the United Kingdom constitution, took the view

<q>that the sovereignty of Parliament is the dominant characteristic of our political institutions.</q>
On the subject of making treaties&#x2014;a power
<q>in the hands of the Crown and exercised in fact by the executive government"&#x2014;</q>
he took the view that this power is dependent on the will of Parliament, which may regulate it, abolish it or take a decision
<q>making the assent of the Houses of Parliament necessary to the validity of a treaty.</q>
That, essentially, is the argument that I am advancing. As long ago as Aristotle, it was argued that sovereignty in a democracy belonged to the citizens.<br/>
5.15 pm<br/>
Without wishing to enter into the arguments about a referendum, it must be noted that Ireland, Denmark and France held referendums on ratification&#x2014;referendums on the whole treaty. When pressed by Members who support referendums, among whom I do not number myself, the Prime Minister said:
<q>It has always been my view that these matters are best dealt with by the House because we are ultimately answerable to the electorate for the decisions we take.</q>&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 4 November 1992; Vol 213, c. 292.]<br/>
That is fair and I agree with it, but, if that is true, surely the House has a right to express its view on the whole treaty, not just part of it.<br/>
Amendments Nos 108, 313, and 344 to 348 are being taken with amendment No. 93. Those amendments accept the insertion of the title, with the exception of a particular article in it. Amendment No. 108 which stands in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, excludes article F, which deals with the European convention on human rights. The other amendments, which all stand in the name of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), who appears to have departed and is probably writing more amendments somewhere, deal with each of the various articles.<br/>
I should be interested to hear the argument advanced by Labour Front-Bench spokesmen, because there is some suggestion that, if the House passed title I, including article F, it might have the effect in law of Britain having ratified the convention on human rights, which we have not formally ratified although we shadow it, rather as we did the mark. I should have thought that it was desirable to ratify&#x2014;a point that was made in the Dimbleby lectures only a couple of nights back. I agree with that.</p>

Article A of the title establishes European union, with the United Kingdom as part of it. That is an important decision, and many hon. Members passionately oppose the idea. Under that article, the Government became very excited about the union being "federal", and fought ferociously to get the word excised. Ultimately, they succeeded, and instead we have a union in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen&#x2014;the famous word "subsidiarity", which appears in article B.<br/>
I should have thought that the establishment of European union is an extremely important matter and should not be slid round. In the Government booklet that


was produced miraculously in November to describe what they would do during their presidency in July, little reference is made to European union. It says a little on page 11 but is concerned mostly with the single market and says how exciting that all is.<br/>
The creation of European union is profound and exceedingly important, particularly as it is supposed to be organised to demonstrate consistency and solidarity in the future. I should have thought that the House should debate and decide on that issue.<br/>
Article B includes the first reference in the Maastricht treaty to issues such as promoting
<q>economic&#x2026;union, ultimately including a single currency".</q>
It also includes
<q>the eventual framing of a common defence policy</q>
and the "acquis communautaire", about which the hon. Member for New Forest (Sir P. McNair-Wilson) was so excited earlier. He is now bobbing up and down with even more excitement.</p>

The acquis communautaire, as the hon. Member for New Forest knows perfectly well, is the corpus&#x2014;another foreign word&#x2014;of Community law. It is the body of Community law, if the hon.

<p>The hon. Gentleman would find out from experts in the subject whether the matter might be worsened by devolution. Experts being experts, they would usually say that that was possible. The hon. Gentleman would then make a long speech demonstrating that it was probable.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman picks the Gulf war as a matter on which attitudes may go one way or the other if we had a common defence policy. I thought that the Gulf war was

necessary. If we had a common defence policy, I believe that we would have taken decisive action earlier in the former Yugoslavia, but that is a matter of opinion. One can never guarantee that structures, however more beneficial they are than existing ones, will necessarily produce the right political answers, although I hope that they would.<br/>
The essence of my argument is that matters as fundamentally important as article B, even if expressed in a declaratory fashion&#x2014;as they are&#x2014;should be emphasised in the House and made clear to the public at large, and Parliament should approve them specifically. If we declare that we wish to see the eventual framing of a common defence policy, the whole country is obliged to be committed to it through the treaty.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman argues for including article B in the original Act of Parliament. He will be aware that article B, in a declaratory form, includes the three pillars of the Maastricht treaty: bringing the original treaty up to date; the pillar on home affairs; and the pillar on foreign affairs and security. He will know that the Government chose that form to exclude home affairs, foreign affairs and security from the European Community's competence. Would the amendment, which would include that in the original Act of Parliament, bring home affairs, foreign affairs and security within the competence of the Commission?</p>

<p>I realise that the hon. Gentleman and I have both been in Paris this week&#x2014;perhaps he took an earlier flight than me&#x2014;but he misses the point. The Government are keen to exclude foreign affairs, security and home affairs from the European Commission's competence, which is why they chose the three-pillar approach in the Maastricht treaty. Would the hon. Gentleman's amendment to the original European Communities legislation bring foreign affairs and security and home affairs within the competence of the European Commission?</p>

<p>As far as I know, the answer is no&#x2014;not because I do not want them to be brought within the competence of the European Commission and institutions, because I do, in respect of both foreign affairs and defence. However, the inclusion of article B in the Bill would not have that effect, any more than it has by being in the treaty signed by the Government.</p>

<p>This may be a point for the Minister, but I understand that the Bill creates within the United Kingdom certain Community rights and obligations.

<p>For the very reason that I have already explained, but perhaps the right hon. Gentleman was dozing. As far as I know, the Parliament of every other

<p>If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, it is he who has been dozing. We are not talking about ratification. Ratification is for the Crown. The treaty can be ratified according to United Kingdom law. Other countries may ratify treaties differently. This Bill is not about ratification but about incorporating certain rights and obligations in the internal law of the United Kingdom so that courts can enforce them. I ask the hon.

<p>We had that argument at the beginning of my remarks. You, Mr. Morris, made it clear at the beginning, when dealing with various points of order, that the Bill does riot have the legislative effect of ratifying the treaty. The hon. Gentleman is correct:. I know all about that. It is also true that, if the Bill is rejected by the Committee, it will have the political effect of the treaty not being ratified.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman help us on one point? He is a fully declared federalist. He said so, and he would be in favour of the Bill including title I. Can he confirm again the view expressed so powerfully by the leader of his party, that the Liberal Democrats support the most federal development of Maastricht and, anyway, the Maastricht treaty as it is before us, and favour a referendum on the matter? There is all the difference in the world between people who favour a union but say that the public should have no say in the matter, and those who favour a union but say that they recognise its importance and think that the public should decide for themselves.</p>

<p>There are two different questions there. One is whether one approves of federation; the other is whether one approves of a referendum. I take the latter point first. The leader of the Liberal Democrats has frequently expressed his support for a referendum; he has for a long time been consistently on record in that regard. However, that is not the official past conference policy of the party, and there are others within the party, including myself, as I said about 10 mintues ago, who do not necessarily agree with him or with the right hon. Gentleman that referendums are necessarily the best way of making decisions.<br/>
When one considers the Danish referendum and the fact that opinion polls have demonstrated that some 20 per cent. of the Danish population who voted in the referendum did not know what Maastricht was two weeks before the vote took place, one sees that that is not the wisest way to take a complicated decision.<br/>
I know perfectly well that there are strong and consistent arguments in favour of referenda. There are hon. Members who regard referendums as a desirable general part of the constitution, rather as is the case in Switzerland, which is the one country which uses referendums as a regular form of making decisions. But there are others who, for more substantial reasons, believe that representative forms of government are a better way of reaching such a complicated decision.</p>

I have good news for the hon. Gentleman. Christmas has come early. He said that he would like the Community institutions to be involved in foreign and security policy, and probably home affairs and immigration. Article J.9 says:

<p>The initial provision in article A makes reference to the development of a union, yet the Liberal Democrats favour federalism. Are not the title's provisions a step towards a unitary system?

Are not the Liberal Democrats' principles being eroded by the title? Other right hon. and hon.

<p>Although the word "federal" was removed by the Government in negotiation, the way in which the majority of our Community partners view the nature of an evolving union and the notion of subsidiarity is significantly different from the way in which the British Government view them. Chancellor Kohl talks about subsidiarity and union in terms of federalism.lb/>
In that regard, I will quote from our debate last June, when the hon. Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) put the point extremely appositely:
<q>If we had a federal state in Europe today, we should have more sovereignty guaranteed for the House than we have at present."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 26 June 1991; Vol. 193, c. 1076.]</q>
The hon. Gentleman repeated himself in December, saying:
<q>our federal position would be a step ahead of what we have now. At least when a country is federal it knows what belongs to it and what belongs to others."&#x2014;<i>Official Report,</i> 18 December 1991; Vol. 201, c. 360.]</q>
I agree. I know that what was established at Maastricht is not yet a federal state, but I am convinced that it is moving in that direction.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows that the word "union" evokes strong responses from Ulstermen and a different response from Scotsmen. The meaning of subsidiarity to a German may mean devolution for Scotland, unwanted devolution for the regions of Britain, and an unwanted disassembly of the Union for the people of Ulster.<br/>
We are addressing a constitutional point, and the hon. Gentleman has a good record of examining such questions. He has been consistent with his party's policy on devolution, so does he believe that the objective&#x2014;to use his word&#x2014;is the German style of devolution/federalism/ subsidiarity, or the citizenship of a monolithic state? The hon. Gentleman is opening up a key question.</p>

<p>I believe that the Community could not hold together if it became a monolithic state, given the diversity of its peoples. Almost inevitably&#x2014;although perhaps more slowly than I would wish&#x2014;one will see the development of federal institutions. The Community is already a sort of incomplete federation.<br/>
As to the different meaning of words to different people, one Conservative Back Bencher sensibly turned to his dictionary. If one looks up the word "federalize" in the "Oxford English Dictionary" one finds the following explanation:
<q>unite in a federal union&#x2026;to decentralise; to take from the central authority and hand over to federal bodies in the state, or to federal states in a union.</q>
That is the OED definition, but the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs seems anxious to rewrite that excellent book.</p>

<q>The expression a European union is a term that was included in the preamble and which appears at a number of other places, but which in practice appears to signify little that would not have been indicated by the term federalism in this context.</q>


In other words, Mr. Taylor was saying that there is no distinction to be drawn between the arrangements provided by the treaty and a federal system.</p>

Friend, in his usual jocul ar manner, thinks that is wrong, but I look forward to hearing him explain&#x2014;which I do not think he will find it easy to do&#x2014;how the arrangements for which title I and the rest of the treaty provide&#x2014;particularly having regard to the central banking arrangements for the whole of Europe&#x2014;can easily be distinguished from a federal system.<br/>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will distinguish between the arrangements in this country&#x2014;with a central bank at the centre of gravity for Europe as a whole, with unelected, unaccountable bankers having the degree of power that they will&#x2014;and the word "federal".</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for quoting me as an authority, and I glad that he agrees with me. I was seeking to make the point that a federal state would be a fundamental advance on what we have now and on what is in the Maastricht treaty&#x2014;not the creation of a federal Europe in which they belong to something and we belong to something, but the creation of a unitary European union in which there would be central decision making and hardly anything guaranteed for national institutions.<br/>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that those of us who are inclined to support his common-sense amendment to allow Parliament to debate title I would not in any sense be supporting that title? We would simply be saying that such a provision should be discussed by right hon. and hon. Members and not be a device used by some&#x2014;perhaps erroneously&#x2014;to have the Bill presented in such a way that amendments are not selected and issues are not properly discussed?</p>

<p>Having heard the hon. Gentleman speak many times, I have a pretty clear idea of what he does and does not believe, so I do not accuse him as he suggests that other people may.<br/>
In my definition, subsidiarity is federalism, because it is written down, entrenched and guaranteed&#x2014;and the hon. Gentleman asked me whether an institutionalised federal state would represent an advance on Maastricht. Yes, of course it would. We have never said that we regard Maastricht as an end point&#x2014;far from it&#x2014;but in the present circumstances we consider that it represents a notable advance, and that its rejection would have a severe adverse effect on the political situation in the Community and beyond, in the eastern countries and in the European Free Trade Association.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Government's victory in negotiating the words "federal vocation" out of the treaty has made no difference to the meaning of the treaty?

<p>I could pretty nearly say yes&#x2014;but, among other things, the hon. Gentleman referred to the Government's "victory". I wish that Conservative Members&#x2014;and all hon. Members&#x2014;would stop using such warlike language about negotiations within the European Community. Every time a Minister returns from Brussels, we are told, "We defeated them," or, "We beat them," or, "We did them down." One sees the image of Spitfires whirling in salute above. That is not the way forward. Perhaps one of the reasons why the Government have not been so successful in many areas of negotiation is because they approach matters in too confrontational a way.<br/>
The hon. Member for Colchester, North said that I believed that the rest of Europe wishes to move the Community towards the creation of a federal Europe. That is not my idea alone; I am sure that many independent observers would accept it. I realise that the British Government do not wish to move in that direction. They have made that quite clear, so they are not deceiving anyone. What emerges will be the result of interplay between the various political forces. That will determine the outcome for us.<br/>
The Liberal Democrats' goal is a democratic, accountable, federal Europe, embracing all the countries that wish to join and respecting their national and cultural identities.</p>

<p>Mine is a more friendly intervention. I shall revert to the earlier argument, because I believe that my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) had a more correct assessment of what we are doing. Would the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) care to wade a little further into his pile of "acquis liberale" by telling me what will happen if we accept the amendment?<br/>
Paragraph 2 of article F of the treaty says:
<q>The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November 1950".</q>


If we incorporate title I, as the Liberal Democrats' amendment suggests, would the European convention on human rights be incorporated into British law, as many of us feel would be appropriate?</p>

<p>What is the point of what? I have already explained at length to the hon. Gentleman why I think that the title should be approved by Parliament&#x2014;because it contains a series of declarations of considerable seriousness, on which Parliament should have the right to express a view. That does not mean that the provision goes as far as I would wish. I should certainly favour our recognising the European convention on human rights.</p>

<p>As hon. Members who believe in open government and freedom of information, surely we must get the meaning of the word "federalism" correct, and understand what subsidiarity implies. Is it really being said that subsidiarity is a subterfuge being used to move us towards federalism? I stand for federalism, and I should like the Bill to provide for it, but that is not what we have been offered.<br/>
We are offered something else, which is described as subsidiarity, so subsidiarity must be clarified. If that cannot be done in such a way as to turn subsidiarity into federalism, subsidiarity should be recognised for what it is&#x2014;an attempt to persuade us to accept moves towards a unitary system, and a union.</p>

<p>I believe that the hon. Gentleman would agree that the Government have a record of centralising control within the United Kingdom. Does he also agree that, when they use the word "subsidiarity", they mean subsidiarity from Brussels to Whitehall? The Government want subsidiarity to stop at Whitehall. But my definition would mean subsidiarity from Brussels to Edinburgh and Liverpool, and to the various regions of England, Scotland and Wales. That is what we mean in connection with federalism, too.<br/>
Of course we know that the Government's definition of subsidiarity and their concept of decentralisation are different from mine&#x2014;and doubtless different from those of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes).</p>

<p>A democratic party must opt clearly for a principle by which the various positions begin to become clear. The word "subsidiarity" has never been used in legal or constitutional documents, nor to explain democratic positions. It was used in a papal encyclical, and operated within structures such as the Catholic Church. The word was applied to fascist Italy, to define the rights of the individual.<br/>
The document in question contains the mildest of trickle-down provisions; some things might be dealt with at a lower level, but most things would be done at the. centre. That is like someone going to the monarch, or to

the tsar, with icons, and hoping that he will not be killed. What comes down to the lower level is entirely dependent on the centre.</p>

<p>It is the long-standing policy of the Liberal Democrats to seek the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into our domestic law, and that policy has been openly supported by the Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham, in his annual address to the Bar Council, and&#x2014;as recently as last night&#x2014;by Lord Chief Justice Taylor, in his Dimbleby lecture.<br/>
Does my hon. Friend agree that, unfortunately, because the Government do not intend to include in the Bill matters which do not give rise to Community rights and obligations&#x2014;in particular, the provisions of article L of title 7&#x2014;which excludes from the consideration of the European Court of Justice all matters which do not directly arise from the original treaties of the European Community, even if we adopt title I into the Bill as the amendment proposes, we shall still not be able to incorporate the European convention into British law?

<p>The hon. Gentleman's advice on this issue will probably be very valuable and much more so than that of many other hon. Members.<br/>
It has been made clear to us that the Committee is not about ratifying the Bill: it is about incorporating parts of the treaty into United Kingdom legislation. In the amendment, the hon. Gentleman seeks also to incorporate title I into British legislation. I am tempted. I have a great deal of sympathy for what he is trying to achieve, and I may well support him in the Lobby later.<br/>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to advise the House. Let us suppose that we do not support his amendment. Let us suppose that even the Government oppose the amendment and it is defeated. Let us suppose that other amendments that seek to incorporate other parts of the treaty into British legislation at a later stage are also defeated. How, then, is the whole of the treaty ratified? Through this process, we are legislating only part of the treaty. How, therefore, is the rest of the treaty ratified?</p>

<p>The short answer is that, because the Chair very properly decided that the amendment should be selected&#x2014;the Chair has also selected other amendments concerning other missing titles&#x2014;the House has the opportunity to express an opinion on whether it wishes titles to be included or not. The opportunity exists. We know that, in strict terms, the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) is right. We are not ratifying; we are talking about the parts of the treaty which have a direct consequence on British law. As the hon. Gentleman well knows, the fact is that, if we defeat the


Bill, the effect will be that we do not ratify.I know that that is a paradox, but it is true, as the hon. Gentleman knows. I repeat that we should include title I of the treaty.</p>

If I am lucky enough to catch your eye later, Mr. Morris, I shall seek to respond to points made subsequently by the hon.

The House owes a debt to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber for tabling the amendment because it enables us to have a debate that is essentially about the structure of the treaty. It is important for us to have that debate and it is timely that the Committee should open with it.<br/>
I hope that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber will be persuaded by my remarks, and by what subsequently takes place in Committee, that the wisest course would be for him to withdraw the amendment.

<p>The hon. Gentleman, aided and abetted by the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), went to the heart of what, as I hope that hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber will accept after the debate, is the weakness of the argument.<br/>
There are two sides to the amendment. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber replied frankly when the hon. Member for Leicester, South said, rightly, that the purpose of the structure of the treaty&#x2014;this is at the centre of the Government's negotiating position and I believe that the Opposition are not unsupportive of that position&#x2014;is to separate out common foreign and security policy, and interior and justice policy, and to make them separate intergovernmental pillars and not part of the treaty of Rome. The hon. Member for Leicester, South asked whether that was not the purpose of the whole treaty.<br/>
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber replied, perfectly frankly&#x2014;this is the position of the Liberal Democrats and will come as no surprise to anyone&#x2014;that he indeed wanted to bring those areas of intergovernmental activity into the treaty of Rome. He wants a single structure&#x2014;what we here have come to call a federal state. I realise that in the course of the Committee we shall have some interesting debates about what the word "federal" means. It means different things in different countries. That is what the Liberal Democrats aspire to.<br/>
There is a certain amount of sense in what the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber seeks to do. I do not want Conservative or Opposition Members to be confused about the matter. In seeking to move title I on to the face of the treaty, one is taking a step towards a

single-structured treaty. That is what the hon. Gentleman wishes to see. I hope that none of my hon. Friends will be deceived by that.</p>

<p>I will give way, but I want first to complete this part of my argument so that the House well understands what we shall be asked to vote on when the Question is put.<br/>
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber and his party are clear about the matter. It must, therefore, have come as some surprise to the hon. Gentleman to find that the amendment enjoyed the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd). I will explain why I believe that my hon. Friend will give that support and why he will even gain support from my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) whose intentions on the Maastricht treaty and on the Bill are well known to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber and to the Committee. My hon. Friend's intentions are perfectly proper, but they are not the ones that the hon. Gentleman seeks.</p>

<p>Whether the amendment which seeks to incorporate title I is in the Bill or not&#x2014;that is all that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) proposes&#x2014;the Government intend to ratify title I. There is no objection to the words. It appears that the Government do not want too much of the attention of the House of Commons and of the country to be drawn to title I by incorporating it in the Bill&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Of course. If title I is in the Bill, everyone can see it.<br/>
People do not study treaties, including the aims and objectives. Acts of Parliament do not get studied very much, but at least they are looked at. Treaties are never looked at. I hope that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber will not be persuaded to withdraw the amendment. If he does withdraw it, the Government will go ahead and ratify the treaty.<br/>
The second point raises matters of tactics for the Edinburgh summit. What gain have the Government got from putting the Bill on today? When the Edinburgh summit meets next week, every other European Minister will see that the British Government do not want the objectives of the Maastricht treaty put before the British Parliament. That is what this is about&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Of course it is.<br/>
If the Minister had said that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber was right and that the Government would ratify the objectives, he could at least go to the summit as a "good European". However, in fact, the first thing that he will have to say to the others is, "You are ratifying and we are ratifying, but we did not want our Parliament to incorporate the objectives in the legislation." By moving the amendment, the hon. Gentleman has exposed the deception and the strategy of the Government in trying to deny to the British public the enormity of what they are doing. On a matter of language, I do not know what "la reine la vault" means, either, if the Bill has to receive Royal Assent in Norman French which, to the best of my knowledge, is no longer in the Oxford English dictionary.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East will contain himself for a few seconds, I will seek to do so.<br/>
The right hon Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) will be aware that the purpose of the Bill is to bring into British law those elements of the treaty of Maastricht that involve an amendment to the treaty of Rome, as amended by the Single European Act. Fortunately for the Committee and for its procedures, it is possible for us, in doing that, to have much wider debates and to debate those other elements of the treaty of Maastricht which do not necessitate a change or an amendment to the treaty of Rome as amended by the Single European Act, such as the intergovernmental activities of the union. There will be a number of debates&#x2014;I dare say that they will be very long and detailed&#x2014;when the Committee considers all those aspects of the Bill, too.</p>

<p>The point that I was going to make follows on from what was said by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn), with whom I wholly agree. Will my right hon. Friend please confirm that European law overrides British law when there is a conflict? In so far as title I has any legal validity in the courts of the land, it will be enforced by the courts of this land whether or not it is incorporated in the Bill. Therefore, what on earth is the point in preventing the Committee from debating the legal consequences of title I? What is the point of keeping it out of the Bill when the legal effect will be identical, whether it is in the Bill or whether it is enforced through European law?</p>

<p>If the Committee will allow me to make the remarks that I am about to make, I hope to be able to answer my hon. Friend. As a quick reply&#x2014;I hope that I am allowed to make a detailed explanation of the point&#x2014;may I say that my hon. Friend will see in the response that the Government have put to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that the common provisions of the treaty are not justiciable by the European Court of Justice by virtue of article L of the treaty. The common conditions that we are discussing are not justiciable under the European Court of Justice. I shall try to make progress, but I will, of course, take interventions.</p>

<p>Title I describes the objectives of the treaty. It places the treaty in context, both those aspects of the treaty that are amendments to the treaty of Rome and those aspects of the treaty that are not part of the treaty of Rome. I welcome the amendment because it goes to the heart of the structure of the treaty and the Bill. It is important that we understand that from the outset.</p>

<p>We all understand that title I is not justiciable by the European Court because it is not incorporated into the treaty of Rome.

If title I is a federal blueprint&#x2014;I do not know whether it is or not&#x2014;the British Government are ratifying a federal blueprint.</p>

It is important that we understand that the treaty structure&#x2014;this is the point that the hon. Member for Leicester, South put to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber&#x2014;was a significant negotiating success for the United Kingdom at Maastricht. It provides the separate intergovernmental pillars for co-operation on the common foreign and security policy and in home affairs outside the treaty of Rome. In those matters, the EC institutions will operate under different rules. For example, the Commission will not have the exclusive right of initiative. There were those&#x2014;the hon.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. We now have a difference of view on whether title I would be justiciable. It is a very important matter because, if we are to incorporate something into law which will be justiciable, and if that is therefore to be part of our constitution, now written as opposed to basically unwritten, we should not proceed with the discussion of the amendment, given that it now sets a precedent&#x2014;we should know the answer to this&#x2014;for the proposal by the Government to exclude whole chunks of the treaty from the Committee's consideration unless covered fortuitously by amendments that you accept.<br/>
This is not a spurious point of order. We really need to know before we proceed further whether, having passed article 1, whether we discuss it or not, a European Court judgment could give flesh, meaning or obligations to this Parliament arising from its approval.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Morris. The Minister of State has given an assurance&#x2014;of course, we have to accept in good faith that that is his interpretation&#x2014;but there are serious doubts whether article L insulates us from decisions by the European


Court which bind the House of Commons and bind us constitutionally and which can have a significant effect on the way in which we view citizenship in this country.<br/>
I put it to you again, Mr. Morris, that this is a very serious point. If we approve article 1 without that discussion and without a judgment from the Law Officers we may have future discussions on many other parts of the treaty, not knowing the constitutional basis on which they might be implemented in this country.</p>

<p>There are those in Europe who wish all co-operation between Governments and member states to fall under the treaty of Rome within the framework of

the existing Community rules and under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is in essence the position which the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber seeks to defend. I think that is why he has sought to incorporate title I into the provisions of the Bill. There is a reason why he should not do so, but that is a respectable reason, well understood by hon. Members.<br/>
There are also a number of people in Europe who share the federal views held by the Liberal party. That is why, in the course of the negotiations leading up to the treaty, the Dutch Government sought to introduce a unitary text that would indeed have made all these matters areas where the Commission had the sole right of initiative, and would have made all the areas that we will discuss in Committee justiciable by the European Court of Justice.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend has drawn the attention of the Committee to article L. He must give his full attention to what article L(a) says.

<p>Yes, Sir. The pillared structure that I was referring to represents a significant change of direction for the Community. For more than 30 years, since its foundation, the Community has developed in a centralising way, drawing more and more areas of policy and action under the central framework of Community institutions, operating under Community rules and enacting Community legislation. The introduction of the pillared structure of the treaty on European union represents moves away from that centralising trend and into more flexible forms of co-operation under the umbrella of European union. It is the distinction between co-operation in the Community and co-operation in the European union that lies at the heart of the treaty and therefore at the heart of the Bill.</p>

<p>Will the Minister point to anywhere in title I which makes those distinctions? is there anywhere in title I a reference to intergovernmental institutions? We read that the objective is the framing of a common defence policy, leading to common defence. That is not a pillared structure. Is there any reference in title I to a pillared structure and to the intergovernmental provisions of the treaty?</p>

Hon. Members will recall the debate about the treaty structure before Maastricht&#x2014;temples versus trees. That debate concerned whether Community rules in the treaty of Rome should apply in all areas of co-operation. Co-operation in separate intergovernmental pillars will not take place under the Community's normal rules. That is clear from article E. The Community institutions will operate according to the conditions laid down in the relevant sections of the treaty.

<p>Since I am about to embark on the answer, it shows remarkable anticipation by my hon. Friend to say that I am not answering the point; perhaps my hon. Friend will allow me to do that.<br/>
Title I, "Common provisions", and title VII, "Final provisions", apply to the treaty as a whole. Effectively they establish the treaty's structure. The structure of the treaty is reflected in the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to make effective as part of the corpus of the Community treaties in

the law of the United Kingdom those provisions of the Maastricht treaty which amend the European Community treaties previously enacted here by the European Communities Act 1972 and its successors.<br/>
We must give effect in our domestic legislation to the Maastricht treaty in such a way as to create a framework within our domestic law for recognising Community rights and obligations which arise from the treaty. We had to do the same with the treaty of Rome in 1972, and we did so by means of the European Communities Act. That is the framework of domestic law that we have followed ever since&#x2014;notably in 1986, when the 1972 Act was amended to incorporate the Single European Act.<br/>
6.30 pm<br/>
I fully understand the motives of the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, who moved amendment 93. As a European federalist, he wished to begin chipping away at the pillared structure of the union, which is what moving title I into the body of the Bill would do. If one is a European federalist, there is a point in that&#x2014;most of my hon. Friends are not. As I shall explain in detail later, the purpose of the Bill is to incorporate into British law those narrow amendments to the treaty of Rome that we need to operate in the House and to operate our legal system in Britain. The amendment has the disadvantage of creating an anomalous situation in United Kingdom domestic law.</p>

<p>In respect of title I, the Minister properly says that those are largely objectives and are not justiciable. The end of title I says that the union&#x2014;the new organism that we are setting up&#x2014;
<q>shall provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies.</q>
Those words can mean only one thing. We are setting up European union and&#x2014;with the assent of the Government when they ratify the treaty&#x2014;the European Community will have the right to do things to us and to other countries. It is no good saying it is not justiciable. If the instruments of union take on board that remit, the question is whether it is legal in Britain and what remedy we have got. By ratifying the treaty, the Government are giving birth to a new executive which is even more powerful than the Crown. I think that that requires a proper answer.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman repeated that title I establishes, describes and reflects the structure of the treaty.

<q>to assert its identity on the international scene, in particular through the implementation of a common foreign and security policy including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence".</q>

<p>Is my right hon.

The situation is therefore curious, as my hon. Friend invokes the provisions of article L, which will be dealt with exclusively by prerogative, to endorse his arguments for yet another prerogative power, when everyone knows that both provisions are international legal obligations, irrespective of whether they are in the treaty of Rome&#x2014;unless he wants to deny that they are obligations.

<p>Underpinning what my hon. Friend said was the belief&#x2014;I think well founded&#x2014;that a number of judgments that the European Court has made in the past 30 years tended, in their thrust, to be centripetal. One of the outcomes of the way in which not only the treaty but article 3(b)&#x2014;which the Committee will examine in some detail in due course&#x2014;has been structured is that the court's judgments will be influenced in the future. I am not alone in my belief that the court's judgments are likely to be more centrifugal during the next 30 years than they have been in the past.<br/>
I turn to the specific issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Sir N. Bonsor). As he will have observed, the wording that he referred to in article L is identical to the wording in article A of the common provisions. The European Court is able to act in those matters contained in the treaty of Rome, as amended by the treaty that we are discussing&#x2014;to quote from the Bill&#x2014;
<q>so far as they relate to those Titles.</q>

<p>I want to make a little more progress before I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow).<br/>
We need to legislate domestically to incorporate those EC treaty provisions which can have a direct effect in the United Kingdom on Acts under which provisions may be adopted, and we must be able to make subordinate legislation to give effect to EC obligations. That means predominantly and overwhelmingly the provisions of titles II, III and IV plus the protocols which will become an integral part of the EC treaty. That is why those three titles are referred to in clause I of the Bill.<br/>
The position on the preamble to title I, the common provisions, and the position on title VII, the final

provisions, are different. The titles do not give rise to Community rights and obligations, but the preamble in the common provisions may play a role in interpreting other provisions in titles II, III and IV under which rights and obligations can arise. Thus the obligations are created elsewhere in the treaty. However, the preamble to title I may relate to the relevant provisions in some way. Article B is a good example as it sets in context the operational provisions elsewhere in the treaty.<br/>
The final provisions in title VII confer no powers to adopt Community Acts, but they clearly have an effect on the way in which the Community will operate. After all, the provisions are in many respects the same as the final provisions in the treaty of Rome, suitably amended for incorporation in a treaty on union. The arrangements for enlargement, article N, or further treaty amendment, article O, clearly fall into the category of being related to the treaty of Rome.<br/>
To return to the issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster, article L clearly relates to the treaty of Rome since it delineates the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, including within that treaty. Therefore, the article needs to be within the scope of the Bill. By contrast, article D in the common provisions, which refers to the make-up of the European Council, does not. To a large extent, it reproduces the equivalent article in the Single European Act&#x2014;article 2 in title I&#x2014;which was not included within the scope of the Single European Act. There is no reason to depart from that precedent.</p>

<p>I want to make three points relating directly to the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster, and then I shall give way to my hon. Friends, starting with my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Northampton, North.<br/>
The Bill covers the common provisions, the preamble and titles I and VII, only as they relate to titles II, III and IV. Thus, the structure of the treaty is reflected in the Bill. To incorporate all the provisions from the intergovernmental pillars and the common provisions into the scope of the Bill&#x2014;which amendment No. 93 seeks to do&#x2014;would create a legal anomaly at the heart of the domestic legislation required to give effect to Community obligations.<br/>
To all intents and purposes, it would drive a coach and horses through the domestic legal framework that we have developed over the past 20 years for our Community membership. It would create confusion and is absolutely not necessary in terms of United Kingdom law. Indeed, it could be taken to mean that the intergovernmental agreements on, for example, asylum and immigration might have a direct effect in the United Kingdom, bypassing the House of Commons; it could be a first step in that direction.<br/>
Furthermore, it would give a false impression of the nature of the treaty provisions, suggesting that they are capable of having an effect that the terms of the treaty do not allow. It would mean that the United Kingdom moved in a more federal direction than the treaty of Maastricht seeks to do&#x2014;a matter of concern to some of my hon. Friends. It would ultimately ignore the treaty's structure&#x2014;with the clear differences between the treaty of Rome and intergovernmental provisions&#x2014;that the Community and the union reflect, as negotiated at Maastricht.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister, who is being generous in giving way. He said that, if title I were included, it would create an anomalous legal position, but he did not tell us in what way. The only example that he produced was something to do with immigration. Surely, if the position is as anomalous as he said&#x2014;he also said that it would "drive a coach and horses" through the provision&#x2014;he should be able to give umpteen examples. However, he has been somewhat delphic so far.</p>

<p>I shall try to be a little more helpful to the hon. Gentleman. As he will be aware, the Single European Act sought to amend the treaty of Rome where necessary so that legal decisions could be taken in the United Kingdom&#x2014;to give legal force in the United Kingdom to provisions of the Single European Act. That is how we have proceeded in the United Kingdom when faced with such treaties. We are seeking to incorporate into British law those aspects of the Maastricht treaty that require amendment to the European Communities Act 1972.<br/>
The amendment seeks to incorporate into the Bill&#x2014;and therefore directly into British law&#x2014;those elements of European activity that we have specifically sought to separate from the treaty of Rome to ensure that the Commission should not have the sole right of initiative and to ensure that such matters are not justiciable in the European Court of Justice. In one sense, the effect of the amendment would be that our domestic British law was more federal than the treaty of Maastricht.</p>

<p>I think that the Minister will agree that, although he may take a different view on the request that I made to the Chairman on a point of order, it is germane to what we are now discussing. The Minister is seeking to tell us that the writ of the European Court is excluded from his famous intergovernmental pillars. However, article L specifically gives three instances where the Court of Justice writ will run&#x2014;the foundation treaties under L(a), article K.3, 2(c) relating to possible conventions on justice and home affairs, and the final provisions of the treaty, L to S, which are intergovernmental.<br/>
We are discussing article E&#x2014;under title I&#x2014;which specifically mentions the Court of Justice. It states:
<q>the Court of Justice shall exercise &#x2026; powers &#x2026; on the one hand"&#x2014;</q>
the title then mentions the foundation treaties of Rome, Brussels and Paris&#x2014;
<q>and, on the other hand, by the other provisions of this Treaty".</q>
The other provisions must be outside the trunk, and be part of the intergovernmental section of which the Minister is so proud. Why is the second part of that section in article E? If the Court of Justice has nothing to do with title I, why is article L so phrased as to give it that power?</p>

<p>I believe&#x2014;no doubt the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that I answered the question on article L when I said that I recognised that there were a number of articles, such as articles O and N, that referred directly to the treaty of Rome. The common provisions and the provisions at the tailend of the treaty are, in one sense, hybrid because they refer to provisions within and without the treaty.</p>

<p>In his first comment on article L, my right hon. Friend said that title I would never be justiciable by the European Court. In a second comment, which he said that he had cleared with the Government's legal advisers, he said that in some circumstances title I might be justiciable by the European Court. My hon. Friend earlier spoke of incorporation in the corpus of the law of Europe. I appreciate entirely his willingness to help us in this interrogative process, but surely other Committees provide a precedent&#x2014;I turn to the Chairman for advice on the matter. I believe that in other Committees judgments of the Law Officer have been circulated. That would be particularly helpful, as it is the first time that the Committee has heard the interpretation on which hinges so much of our subsequent discussion. We are now at the heart of the issue of what is and is not to be justiciable in the treaty, whether through the Government's bilateral arrangements outside the treaty or within it.<br/>
The Committee is not entirely sure whether title I ever will be justiciable. There is a hint that it may be, and if it is so, other parts of the treaty may be affected. We should get this clear before we proceed, because so much of the Government's case has depended on it hitherto.</p>

<p>The Minister will appreciate that there is no filibustering going on; we are trying to explore a central question. What he is saying is that there are two sorts of law&#x2014;parliamentary law and a prerogative law. My understanding is that whatever the provision may be under which laws can be made in Britain is irrelevant. For example, if the country goes to war, it does so under the prerogative. It is no use saying that, it is not justiciable in domestic courts, that because we are at war and the courts will recognise it. If we sign a treaty, it is the law.<br/>
Surely the European Court is bound to take account of the fact that, with the solemnity of the royal prerogative, the Prime Minister has ratified, in the name of the Crown, title I. We cannot go to the European court and say, "I'm awfully sorry but that is not quite the sort of law you thought it was". Similarly, if there is any prerogative power in this country, that is also the case. We cannot question who the Archbishop of Canterbury is, because it has not been in legislation; it is a prerogative power of appointment.<br/>
Without meaning to&#x2014;that is why I desperately wish he would take our advice and have a Law Officer here&#x2014;the Minister is pretending to the House, quite innocently, that there are two sorts of law, one which is justiciable and the other which is not. In fact, all law is justiciable because we are bound by all law, by prerogative, by statute, by custom and practice, and by judge-made law. All are capable of interpretation and appeal to any court that has any r&#x00F4;le in the matter.</p>

<p>I appreciate that we must make progress, but perhaps before the Committee sits again tomorrow my right hon. Friend will make inquiries of the Law Officers about this because the European Court of Justice does interpret legislation differently from our own image. I do not know about Scottish courts but that certainly applies to English courts. In the English courts,

there is what is called the golden rule, whereby the judges can look only at the section itself, and interpret that, whereas in the European Court of Justice on numerous occasions, in interpreting a section, the judges have gone back to the preamble of the Bill to assist them in interpreting the section&#x2014;in other words, doing something which our own courts do not do.<br/>
Perhaps my right hon. Friend will ascertain whether he is absolutely right in what he has just told the Committee, because he may find that the advice he has received is mistaken and that what he says applies to the English courts but not to the European Court of Justice.</p>

<p>The advice I have received, of course, is from the Attorney-General himself, the legal adviser to the Government.

<p>I am perfectly happy to discuss the many questions which hon. Members will raise in the course of the debate arising out of the general structure of the treaty. That is the debate which the amendment has prompted. I am happy to discuss the issues which it raises so far as the distinction goes between the treaty and the union and the way it is reflected in the legislation. To the extent that the provisions of title I need to be incorporated in the Bill, they are so incorporated. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber will not press the amendment. If he does, I must invite the Committee to vote against it.</p>

<p>May I start, not by following the Minister's somewhat beleaguered speech but by making my own speech in which I shall try to look at the issue from a slightly different angle from that of the Minister. I may come to a similar conclusion, but I hope for different reasons.<br/>
I welcome the way in which the Chairman of Ways and Means has structured this debate, because it is very welcome. Once we are beyond this group of amendments it might be slightly more comprehensible to anybody who looks in from the outside world. We are also grateful for the split that took place to the proposed group of amendments on the general provisions which has allowed us to have this interesting and valuable debate on title I.<br/>
Opposition Members&#x2014;I am sure that this applies to most others&#x2014;want this debate on this lengthy Committee stage. I underline the fact that the length of Committee stage is determined by the Government and the Prime Minister's promise to the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Carttiss) and not by any intention by the Opposition or, indeed, by the other side of the House to prolong the debate beyond what is necessary.<br/>
The debate will be exhaustive, but so it should be. The provisions of this treaty are enormously important and penetrate into very intimate parts of British life. It is right that the House gives proper debate and scrutiny to what has been agreed on the country's behalf and to what, if the House so consents, will be incorporated into British law.<br/>
The Government will find the experience uncomfortable. The Minister, I think, has tasted only a sample of what is to come during the weeks and months ahead. I


have to say that, for some crime of which I have not yet discovered the nature, this is the second European Communities Amendment (Bill) on which I have been an Opposition spokesman. I can scarcely imagine what the crime was. It may have escaped my notice, but it must have been extremely serious for me to have to go through this again. As we went through the expressions that pass for English but sound very foreign, the expression "deja vu" came to my mind.<br/>
The amendment in the name of the leader of the Liberal Democratic party suggests that we should incorporate title I of the Maastricht treaty into the Bill. I judge it by a number of tests: why should we put it in? Is it necessary that we should put it in? Is there a benefit from putting it in today?<br/>
I have given considerable thought to the amendment, because I knew that it was likely to be the first one of the Committee stage; it was a laborious exercise, embarked on not easily, but by way of punishment.<br/>
There seemed to be immediate attractions to including title I in the Bill. One that struck me was the fact that the definition of "subsidiarity" in title I was better than the definition in article 3B, to which we shall come in due course. The subject of subsidiarity has been mentioned by a number of hon. Members. The subject is close to the hearts of those of us from north of the border, because the Government seem enthusiastic about subsidiarity in the European Community but reluctant and grudging towards subsidiarity and decentralisation in the United Kingdom.<br/>
Article 3B is indeed complex. I cannot see that it is constructed in such a way that subsidiarity will be real&#x2014;my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) makes the point endlessly&#x2014;because it refers to it purely in terms of the exclusive competencies of the Community. On the other hand, subsidiarity is dealt with differently in title I, which refers to decisions being taken "as closely as possible" to the citizen.<br/>
I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate, he will confirm that what we are discussing is a formulation on subsidiarity that is attractive to the British Government, and that when we come to consider article 3B, that might be taken as being a part of title I and will be considered relevant to the provisions of titles II, III and IV which will be incorporated in the Bill. As I say, that seemed an attractive aspect of title I which suggested that perhaps we should support the Liberal amendment.</p>

<p>I will not follow my hon. Friend into discussing the advantages or disadvantages of subsidiarity, which he rightly says applies only to outside exclusive competence. Has he realised that the amendment would move title I into line 9 on page 1 of the Bill? The Liberals are using the series of amendments to discuss the merits or demerits, and some of the content, of title I. Indeed, my hon. Friend is doing just that.<br/>
Does my hon. Friend not realise that the place in the Bill where the amendment would appear&#x2014;this was relevant to the point of order that I raised at the beginning of the proceedings&#x2014;would add the obligations, be they justiciable or not, of the European Communities Act 1972, but would not add them to the Bill in respect of ratification? So although it might be good to debate the subject, the consequences would probably not be all that great.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend anticipates me, because, perhaps laboriously, I was about to explain that while there seemed to be attractions to incorporating title I, we should not support the Liberal amendments, as those immediate attractions would not necessarily apply. In other words, I come to the same conclusion as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South but by a different route.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman be kind enough to have a crack at the point that I put to the Minister, who has not yet had time to answer it? Titles II and III will become part of British law, and we know that. Title I will not become part of British law and it will not be justiciable by the European Court.

<p>If the hon. Gentleman wants to have a crack at his right hon. Friend, he should not try to use me to do it. His right hon. Friend is paid much more and, being a Minister, has more expert advice than is available to me&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If not expert advice, the advice available to him is more extensive than that available to me.<br/>
I am sure that the Minister will eventually get round to answering the point that the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) put to him, and to all the other awkward questions that Conservative Members are raising. I am a mere humble toiler on the Opposition Benches, forced by the inadequacies of the Short money to work these matters out for myself. I am sharing with hon. Members in all parts of the House the results of my cogitations. I put them forward for their perusal, and I shall be interested to hear whether they agree with my conclusions.<br/>
The second superficial attraction of title I is the area to which an amendment of mine, No. 108, would apply&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am grateful for the help of Conservative Members, but I gather that I need not move that amendment. It seems that my information, about that and other matters, is superior to that of the Minister and his hon. Friends.<br/>
That amendment is concerned with article F of the European convention on human rights. There seems to be a superficial argument for saying that if we incorporated title I in the Bill, by the back door we should have achieved the legal implementation into this country of the European convention on human rigths. In an environment in which the Government are hostile to taking that course, there is a superficial argument for taking that step&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has referred to certain changes that may occur by the back door as a result of incorporating title I. Does he believe in Scottish devolution? There is an interpretation of subsidiarity that suggests that, if one takes decisions as closely as possible

<p>If applied, the principle of subsidiarity leads to decentralisation, in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe. I believe in decentralisation. I do not believe in a unitary state in Europe. Europe can develop properly according to a principle which happens to be called subsidiarity&#x2014;for the purposes of the treaty and the jargon of the moment&#x2014;but it is a healthy and efficient principle which we should apply in the European Community. Britain would also be the better for having that principle applied to the way in which we take decisions.<br/>
Are the superficial attractions of title I real? The Chairman of Ways and Means made it clear at the outset that we, in the Committee of the whole House, are not engaged in the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. That may be a difficult concept for people outside to appreciate, but it should be fully comprehensible to hon. Members. We do not ratify treaties. We apply to British law, by separate legislation, whatever is necessary to implement the treaties that have been signed by royal prerogative.<br/>
I have complained about that method of legislating over the years. In the 10 years that I have been a Labour spokesman on foreign affairs, the only opportunity that I have had to debate major treaties signed on behalf of this country in the sphere, say, of arms control, has been when a statutory instrument has occasionally trickled down to the House giving diplomatic immunity to inspectors appointed under those treaties.<br/>
I had been in the House for only a year when Labour was last in power, but I have always made the point that something should be done about the Ponsonby rules and the way in which the House deals with treaties. Some of my hon. Friends, and certainly some Conservative Members who have been in government, could have done something about that over the years. Perhaps this is not the time to start complaining about it. We are taking the Maastricht treaty and removing from it those elements that require legislation in this country. We should ensure that the minimum legislation necessary is put into effect in British law.<br/>
We should not be trying to put into effect in British domestic law more than is absolutely necessary under the terms of the treaty. What we are concerned with here are purely and simply the rights and obligations imposed upon this country by the treaty signed at Maastricht. That would appear to include titles II, III and IV, but not the other titles, except in respect of certain key areas some of which have come up already in the debate and others of which I hope will be fleshed out.</p>

<p>In a spirit of pure nostalgia, because we have gone through these debates so often, and since the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), known as "the loose change of European politics", is someone who cannot possibly allow a speech to go by without contributing to it, I will give way to him.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to answer my question in that case. Does he believe that

those parts of the treaty that are not included for the purposes of the Court of Justice are titles that give rise to international legal obligations? In other words, title I would give rise to international legal obligations. Is that right or not, because the hon. Gentleman is making quite a lot of play of this?</p>

<p>I am not making play of that at all. The Law Officers&#x2014;one floated into the Chamber a short while ago and floated out again&#x2014;who are paid large amounts of money, who have immense qualifications, who, it would appear from the bill they gave the Chancellor, charge rather a lot of money for them&#x2014;and who will no doubt give the Minister a bill tonight simply for floating through the Chamber, asking how he is getting on and telling him that their invoice will be in the post, so to speak&#x2014;can bend their minds to that question.<br/>
A real question has been posed this evening: what international legal obligations have been entered into under the Maastricht treaty? That, however, is not what we are principally involved in with this amendment. I am sure that the hon. Member for Stafford will be able to persuade his colleagues to give that clarification, even if they send him a bill for it.</p>

<p>If I understand the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) correctly, he is saying that we must not have too much unnecessary legislation, and that the Bill contains what is necessary for the adjustment of domestic law. In other words, he seems to be saying that, if title I is included, it will not make that much difference, whereas the Minister is saying that, if it is included, it will make an awful lot of difference. Which is right?</p>

<p>I will come to the next part of my argument. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) and I have shared so many debates that he thinks he can read my mind, but I am enunciating a principle that applies to this legislation and which I think is a good principle&#x2014;that from these treaties that the Government care to sign we should put the minimum legal requirement into the legislation and we should not enter into anything else that is not required. I will come to the point of title I and whether it breaches my principle and whether it might create even more serious problems for the objectives that I have set out. This is where I come to the issue of the pillar structure.<br/>
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber and his party did not agree with the pillar structure; they wanted the European tree, with all decisions to come through the one institutional structure, with the right of the Commission to be involved in it. But that is not what was eventually agreed at Maastricht. The structure agreed there was precisely what I and my party officially wanted&#x2014;that the elements within the treaty that require to be part of the European Community pillar, the EC pillar, should be that way, but that aspects such as foreign and security policy, with all its implications, and home affairs and justice should be separate, intergovernmental pillars.<br/>
Who knows what the future will bring about? Things may develop by way of negotiations, by way of the next intergovernmental conference, but we have to live with what we have now. I favour it; I think that it was the right outcome, and 12 Governments agreed that it was the best outcome in the circumstances.<br/>
In that respect, it is no different from the Single European Act that I and the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber sat through in 1986, because that created an institution called European political co-operation; it was not part of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill that we discussed at such length at that time, because it was decided that it would remain an embryonic intergovernmental process that might perhaps build up eventually to a common foreign policy machinery. It has become that, but, as yet, the Community governments have not agreed that it should still be part of the full pillar.<br/>
That is what we have at present: three major pillars that will co-exist. It appears that title I, if folded into the Bill, will complicate the structure that has been created. I disagree with the way in which the Minister seemed to suggest that title I was the pillar structure and that, by folding it in, we would complicate what was coming afterwards; that is the impression he gave. What title I does, especially in Article C, is to talk about a general principle that does not relate to two of the pillars and, in not relating to them, will complicate not European Community law, which can live with complications and blurred edges, but British domestic law, which works on the basis of minimum legislation where it is required by any external treaty such as the Maastricht treaty.<br/>
I worry, therefore, that it will complicate the situation and will in practice lead to something which I do not believe the Liberal party would consider healthy and which my own party certainly does not consider healthy; encroachment on the principle of automaticity. Over the years, I have listened to my right hon. Friends the Members for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) and for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore) going on about section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972. Section 2 is the one that they wanted suspended because it provides for the automatic implementation in Britain domestic law of European Community law as established through the principles of the EC treaty of 1972, subsequently amended by the Single European Act.<br/>
That automaticity is extremely important. It has given a status to European Community law in this country which is of great and sometimes controversial importance, as we found in the matter of the Spanish fishing boats. We choose; the Government in the first instance, when they sign the treaties, and eventually the House, when it considers the treaties in detail, make a conscious, precise and limited decision about what areas will be subject to the automaticity rule, because to do so is to give supreme importance to any law that is determined at European level in the British domestic context.</p>

<p>I have listened with great care to what my hon. Friend has said about section 2, but I hope that he has not missed the point, which is that laws that are brought into effect automatically under section 2 are laws assented to by the royal prerogative itself. The whole point about section 2 is that it has a domestic relevance quite apart from Europe; for the first time since 1649, a Minister can make a law that applies in Britain without the consent of Parliament. So it has changed the balance of power in Britain vis-a-vis Ministers, hon. Members, and electors. That is an issue which my hon. Friend should also address.</p>

<p>I was not around in 1642. Nor was I around in 1972, but my right hon. Friend the Member for

Chesterfield was. It is a long time since then and a lot of changes have taken place, but no change has taken place in the important principle that he has just enunciated. He is right to say that it is a very important principle. In some ways it has been unnoticed. He was in the Cabinet for many of those years and had the chance, if he wanted, to change it, if change was possible. Perhaps it was not possible because the decision had been taken in 1972 and subsequently endorsed by a referendum that my right hon. Friend invented for the British people.<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
I am making the point now that we want to be as sparing as possible about the areas in which that royal prerogative will be exercised. That is a principle with which I am sure my right hon. Friend would agree absolutely. If we are to be sparing we have to be careful about what might come out of an amendment such as amendment No. 93, putting title I into this Bill. We could be opening the door to automaticity of the law as determined at the European level in the other two pillars being put into British law.<br/>
The Minister made an attempt at an explanation, but was not allowed by his hon. Friends to finish it. It is possible that, under the intergovernmental pillar on home affairs and justice, a new law, perhaps on a common immigration and asylum policy, could be agreed by all 12 Governments in the Community. Under the pillar structure as it stands now, that would require separate legislation in each of the 12 countries before it could be implemented. If, however, it came under the single pillar of construction, the decision taken by Ministers sitting behind closed doors in the Council of Europe, perhaps by majority vote, would have automatic effect in British law.<br/>
I am not saying whether that is right or wrong. Some people would say that a common European immigration policy would be a good thing. I do not agree with that, but anyway it should not at this stage be susceptible to the possibility that it could automatically become British law.</p>

<p>I wonder if the hon. Member is right in his acceptance of the Government's view that these pillars are as separate as he makes out. It appears to me that under article C of title I, to which he referred, there are powers, exercisable by the Commission and indeed by the Council, which enable the institutions of the Community, as opposed to the union, to act in pursuance of the objectives described in title I but utilising the powers they enjoy under the treaty of Rome as amended in other articles. That appears to me to be the meaning of
<q>building upon the `acquis communautaire'".</q>
It also appears to be what is intended by the granting of power to the Commission to ensure consistency in respect of external relations. If the institutions of the Community, in exercise of these powers under title I, introduced regulations, directives, or whatever, would these not be self-executing in this country under the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972? And, if that is the case, why should not title I itself be incorporated in the Bill?</p>

<p>This is probably the only place where one can tangle with lawyers and not receive a bill. I am therefore grateful for the opportunity to cross my amateur sword with these great legal brains. But if the hon. Gentleman reads the last sentence of article C, he will see:
<q>They"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the Council and the Commission&#x2014;


<q>shall ensure the implementation of these policies, each in accordance with its respective powers.</q>
Of course, there are bloodings involved, quite deliberate bloodings, between the Council and Commission in relation to the pillars, but as they stand at the moment they are still discrete. The Council does not have the single and unique right of initiation when it comes to proposals, and the automaticity rule does not apply. Further and separate legislation would still be required in these areas so long as these pillars exist.<br/>
That might start not to be the case if title I were folded into the Bill and title IV, the pillar on home affairs and justice, were there. It is a door which is beginning to open and I do not believe that the Committee would want it to open at this stage, although certain hon. Members might want to go in that direction.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend not agree that the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) has a point, and it is the same point as my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) made in an intervention? It is arguable that, once title I is ratified under the prerogative, no internal legislation is needed. A court of England and Wales, and probably a court of Scotland as well, would enforce any directives coming under title I despite the fact that there is no legislation here, because, as a result of the prerogative, it is part of English law. That is the real worry and the real problem.</p>

<p>I know that my right hon. Friend is a Member of Parliament. We will wait and see whether the Law Officers of the Crown can give us absolute clarification, but, in terms of what I have been able to read and the information provided to me by the House of Commons Library, it seems that the interpretation that I place upon it is correct.<br/>
These common provisions, like the common provisions of the Single European Act, which were never included in their entirety in the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986, may well have some force in law, because they have a status; they have been ratified. But because they are not specifically inserted into United Kingdom law, they remain in a completely different situation from those aspects that would fall under section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972. The advice that I had from the House of Commons Library was:
<q>It would perhaps be inconsistent to include Title I in the EC (Amendment) Bill and not the CFSP"&#x2014;</q>
common foreign and security policy&#x2014;
<q>and Justice and Home Affairs Titles, V and VI, which also do not require UK legislation for implementation.</q>
Perhaps I am going on too long, and undoubtedly other hon. Members will do so, but it is an extremely important subject. I am trying to help my hon. Friends and hon. Gentlemen by developing a thought process which is of some significance, I believe, in interpreting what is happening.<br/>
I did not think that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, when he went down the road of

amendment No. 93&#x2014;all these amendments were tabled in June this year&#x2014;was likely to be enthralled with the idea of folding in title I as an absolute matter of principle. I simply suggest to him that perhaps it is opening doors that he does not want opened. It is taking the House and the country in a direction on which they have not yet made a decision. Therefore it might be appropriate for him to withdraw his amendment. If he chooses to press the amendment, the official Opposition will not vote for it.</p>

<p>We have had a long discussion about whether title I should be inserted in the Bill. I believe that we have covered most of the ground that needs to be covered on that point. It does not seem to me that it will make as much of a difference as the Government have implied, for this reason. It is an international legal obligation either way. The fact that it is not within the precincts, as it were, of the Court of Justice has certain consequences, but in terms of what is contained in title I, articles A to E, if one asks oneself how this will affect the daily lives of the people of the United Kingdom, the whole thing takes on a completely different dimension.<br/>
I am rather surprised that, so far, no discussion has taken place about what is contained in title I and the impact that it will have on our constituents. Whether it is to be justiciable under article L, which itself is a prerogative power, or whether it is to be under the Court of Justice in part, is a good esoteric argument and has certain quite important implications. This is not a game, but a provision in a legally binding treaty, which we have solemnly signed and which, under the Ponsonby rules, will be ratified by prerogative at the end of the Bill.<br/>
The Minister of State kindly wrote to me some months ago when I asked the same question about the Ponsonby rules as the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). The bottom line is that, if this is a prerogative treaty, it comes into effect but parts of it need to be enacted to fall within the provisions of the European Communities Act and the competence of the European Court. This is all very interesting stuff, but I am interested in what impact it will have on the British people.<br/>
I tabled a number of amendments to article A. I was extremely grateful to The Chairman for listening to my representations yesterday and for agreeing to select the amendments, which I hope will give an opportunity to explain to the people of this country and perhaps to some other people the real implications of the treaty. If amendment No. 93 were made, the courts would have an opportunity to consider some of the issues in due course, but judging from the way in which the argument has developed, there appears to be little prospect of that. The article is important; it will still affect people, it will still be binding on our Government and it will still be implemented. Therefore, it will have a direct effect on the daily lives of the people of this country.<br/>
There is little information on article A in the Government's pamphlet "Britain in Europe". I have read it pretty carefully, but it makes no reference to European union. That is the usual sleight of hand that we have become used to. There has been no White Paper, despite there having been one in 1970, or statement of Government policy on what the treaty involves. Article A says:
<q>By this Treaty, the High Contracting Parties establish among themselves a European Union, hereinafter called 'the Union'.</q>


That sets up a legal union that is binding upon the people of this country and, as I said in a book that I wrote recently entitled "Against a Federal Europe", is indistinguishable from a federation.</p>

<p>I am delighted to be able to respond not only to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) but to my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier). According to the Government, the original treaties aimed to achieve an
<q>ever closer union among the peoples of Europe";</q>
but, according to article A, "the High Contracting Parties" become ever closer and establish an actual European union.<br/>
The Government's position is based on the following proposition: whereas previously the peoples of Europe were engaged in trying to achieve an ever closer union among themselves, they now establish the European union itself. That clearly shows what is being done under these articles, yet, even though the European union is established by the first paragraph of article A, the second paragraph contradicts that assertion by stating that the
<q>Treaty marks a new stage in the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe.</q>
Logically, if the union had already been established, as article A, paragraph 1, says that it has, the process of creating an ever closer union is superfluous as one cannot get closer than union itself. The process has reached its conclusion with the establishment of the union, which means that the process has ceased, although the second paragraph suggests that there is some way still to go.<br/>
That raises the next question: is the European union of article A, paragraph 1, the
<q>ever closer union among the peoples of Europe</q>
aimed at under earlier treaties and continued by article A, paragraph 2 of the treaty? Apparently not. The ever closer union is to be a union among the peoples. That is established under paragraph 1, which states that it is to be a union among the "High Contracting Parties".</p>

<q>This Treaty marks a new stage in the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen.</q>
My hon. Friend did not read out the latter part of that paragraph, which suggests moving away from the centre. How does he deal with those two paragraphs set together?</p>

<p>They can be dealt with simply as follows. Paragraph 2 of article B deals with
<q>the establishment of economic and monetary union, ultimately including a single currency",</q>


which presupposes the central bank arrangements that follow later. For practical purposes, nothing is more centralising than a central bank. Furthermore, the implications of that are that decisions on economic and monetary affairs, made by unelected, unaccountable bankers, will be taken away from the citizen. Those are the bases upon which people enter polling booths and vote in general elections. <i>[Interruption.]</i><br/>
Therefore, if we are to set up a central bank under those arrangements, as part of economic and monetary union and a single currency, we shall take away from the citizen his most important right&#x2014;his right to vote. All decisions on economic and monetary affairs, which are currently the basis on which people vote in general elections, will be handed over to unelected, unaccountable bankers.</p>

<p>A further question arises under article C, which says:
<q>The Union shall be served by a single institutional framework which shall ensure the consistency and the continuity of the activities carried out in order to obtain its objectives".</q>
The creation of that single institutional framework is also part of the creation of that legal union, so we have central banking arrangement, which are about as centralising as anything can be and remove power from the citizen because decisions on economic and monetary affairs are taken by unelected bankers. That is clear to anyone who takes the faintest interest in the matter. We also have the creation, under article C, of a single institutional framework.<br/>
Clearly, a legal union being created. It is not simply a question of ever closer union, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough was trying to assert, but the creation of a union in itself.</p>

<p>Although I am opposed to the treaty, the more I hear the hon. Gentleman's arguments against it, the more I am tempted to support it.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is misleading the House by seeking to imply that institutions will be created in a way that gives increased competence to the Commission. The point of the institutional framework developed at Maastricht was to limit the Commission's competence specifically in home affairs and foreign and security policy. That being so, how can the hon. Gentleman square that circle with the arguments that he is now developing?</p>

<p>The Commission's powers are already set out under the treaty of Rome. Further competences are granted to the Commission under the Maastricht treaty. Indeed, some 64 new majority voting arrangements will be associated with the Commission. The idea that the Commission will not gain new powers under the treaty simply shows that the hon. Gentleman has not read the treaty carefully. Even within the so-called "separate pillars" of foreign and security policy, the treaty says that the Commission will be fully associated with those tasks.<br/>
Clearly, the Commission will have an enhanced role. It may not be the role that it originally wanted, but that is not the point. It will have an enhanced role both within the provisions relating to the treaty of Rome and with regard to the so-called "separate pillars".</p>

Within the two intergovernmental pillars, the Commission has a right to attend meetings of Ministers. That is fair, and limits the Commission's responsibility by making crystal clear the Commission's competence and Ministers' field of responsibility. The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the fact that Ministers at intergovernmental meetings have a right to call on the expertise of the Commission in seeking information that they may need to reach correct decisions.

<p>Yes, it does. My hon. Friend obviously has no understanding of the basis on which these things operate.<br/>
At the moment, the arrangements are not within the precise legal framework which is prescribed by title I; otherwise, there would be no need for the provisions in the first place. They are being incorporated in this way to give


them that status within the framework of the Maastricht treaty which they did not have beforehand. Surely that is the reason for doing it.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend, who is an expert in these matters, knows only too well that the European Council has given proper status in the Single European Act. If one goes further, the arrangements for foreign policy which took place as a result of the changes in the Single European Act took place in European political co-operation, in which the Commission was also intimately involved. It did not have the power of initiation. There is nothing more intergovernmental than the European Council which, by definition, is a meeting of the Heads of State and Prime Ministers. My hon. Friend voted for the Single European Act. Now what is he worried about?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="891110" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-01a.209.1" hansard_membership_id="2179" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2515" speakername="Mr. Cash" colnum="209" time="19:45:00">
<p>The short answer is that the Single European Act was a good Act, because it was based upon political co-operation. I voted for it because I believed that it was important to try to improve the quality of political co-operation within Europe, and because of its potential for increasing trade within Europe. Those were good reasons for voting for it. It is also true that it contained enhanced powers for the Commission. But the difference between the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty was that the former was primarily about co-operation and trading, whereas the latter is primarily about the manner in which we are governed. That is the fundamental difference between the two.<br/>
That is why I emphasised the centralising process of the central bank. It is that which transfers powers which at the moment belong to the British voter. It is important that people should bear that in mind when they are considering the assertions that the treaty is a decentralising process. It is not.</p>

<p>These are extremely important points. My hon. Friend, having voted for the Single European Act, needs carefully to consider his position. Under the Single European Act, the Commission's position was strengthened. The former Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, was keen that that should happen, knowing that, in order to achieve the objective which my hon. Friend supports, which is the opening up of the single market, it was important for the Commission to have strong powers of initiation.<br/>
The interesting thing is that, in many defined ways, the Bill tries to restrain and clarify the Commission's powers and, by injecting for the first time the concept of subsidiarity, redresses some of the balances which went wrong as a result of the Single European Act. If my hon. Friend supported the Single European Act during its passage here, it is puzzling to Conservative Members why he is not an enthusiastic supporter of the Bill.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend's argument is a little disingenuous on that point. He tries to make out that there is no difference in substance between the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty; that it is yet another gradual movement, a little canter down the road. It is nothing of the kind. There is a massive and complete difference between the two measures. The Single European Act was much maligned but necessary. The Bill deals with completely different subject matter, and greatly enhances the centralising tendencies of the Single European Act.<br/>
On 3 April 1992, speaking to the Berkemann forum, Chancellor Kohl said:
<q>In Maastricht we laid the foundation stone for the completion of the European Union. The European Union treaty introduces a new and decisive stage in the process of European union which, within a few years, will lead to the creation of what the founder fathers of modern Europe dreamed of following the last war&#x2014;a united states of Europe.</q>
The Government, in their booklet "Britain in Europe", say that they do not want and will not have a united states of Europe, but that is the objective to which the German Chancellor has been moving as expressed in that Berkemann forum speech. The problem is that on European union we are at loggerheads with the Germans, as we are with other member states.<br/>
If one travels around Europe as many of us do, and asks about the nature of the treaty in which we are involved&#x2014;I see the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) nodding his head, because he knows that it is true&#x2014;everywhere people say that this is a European union which they want and like, and that it is either a federal or unitary system depending on what language they care to use. But for practical purposes, this is a European union. That is what they want, and that is what Chancellor Kohl said when he spoke on 3 April 1992.<br/>
Someone is not coming entirely clean on this, because the bottom line is that we cannot have it both ways. The truth is either what Chancellor Kohl is saying or what is being presented to us. I look now at my hon. Friends the Members for Esher (Mr. Taylor) and for Harborough, who try to claim that this is not a European union. They say that it does not have the characteristics that I have attributed to it, a belief which is clearly shared by other member states.<br/>
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber knows that that is true. He wants a federal or unitary Europe. My right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) made a speech the other day when he came clean. He said that that is what he wants too. The plain fact is that that is what lies at the heart of the whole problem.</p>

It does not even refer to the fact that we are to be engaged in a European union.<br/>
As I have said repeatedly, we have not even had a White Paper. What on earth is going on? White Papers on important matters are pouring out of the Government all over the place. But when we come to something as massive as the change in the nature of British government on the scale that is envisaged and is carried out&#x2014;we are talking about a treaty which has already been signed by the Government&#x2014;there is no White Paper to explain the treaty to the British people.

<p>Not at all. The reason for confusion is that there is no White Paper stating precisely what the treaty is all about. I have been calling for one for several years. At the bottom line, if the public are to be asked to make a choice, and if right hon. and hon. Members are to be asked to vote on such a question, they should have enough information to know precisely what is the Government's policy&#x2014;not just the verbiage in the treaty, with which my right hon. Friend the Minister of State tried to deal earlier. There should be a declaration in a White Paper as to the treaty's objectives, policies and implications.<br/>
As to the type of union into which we are being taken, I invite the Committee to consider the provisions in the 1970 White Paper. That is another story, and is part of the process of disinformation, stealth, or whatever one likes to call it. Some would call it being more than economical with the actualit&#x00E9;.</p>

A recent issue of <i>Management Today</i> published the results of a poll to which 3,000 business men replied, and 68 per cent. of them said that they would vote against the treaty in a referendum. That was their verdict. Only two weeks ago, I attended a Confederation of British Industry meeting in my constituency at which another hon.

Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore) will remember that day in June 1991. He may have had a copy of that treaty as well, but very few people even knew that one had been deposited in the Library. We then began to realise that the intention was to take us clown a route exemplified by the Maastricht treaty.</p>

<p>We return to the question whether or not the preamble will be used in the courts to justify further decisions by the European Court. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore) referred to the Single European Act. Does the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) agree that similar sentiments were expressed in the original treaty of Rome, and that the European Court has been using them ever since? To give the Government their due&#x2014;although I am tired of doing so&#x2014;at least, by article VII, the Government are seeking to limit the European Court's future right to extend the European Commission's sphere of influence.</p>

<p>That returns us also to the question whether or not one interpretation is more valid than another. I do not happen to agree with the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall). He was keen to suggest that this was some kind of damage limitation exercise, but I view it as a deliberate attempt by other member states to centralise and therefore to accumulate more power at the centre of Europe. That case is easily made on the basis of the documents before us.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend seems to be saying that he prefers a vague undefined concept of European union, as in the Single European Act, to a definition that specifically separates out important areas of political endeavour and makes them intergovernmental. He was content to sign up to an undefined union, but now he finds a union defined in such a way as to reinforce intergovernmentalism unacceptable.</p>

<p>Even I am pretty surprised by that little intervention. The phrase "a European union" in the preamble meant nothing. Because it has no functions attached to it, it was completely different from the Maastricht treaty, which goes into the functions that are allocated between the member states. That is the fundamental question.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman not think it rather odd that the Minister should invoke article B of the Maastricht treaty to establish that we now have a union with defined parameters, yet that, at the same time, the

Government should try to obfuscate and generally mislead the British public, because they have not the guts to say what the treaty is?</p>

<p>I agree that there has been a good deal of obfuscation. I shall not go into the question whether there is a deliberate attempt to mislead, but in the 1970 White Paper to which I referred earlier, there was certainly a clear statement that the veto would continue, that the European Community would not develop into a federation and that we should retain our essential sovereignty. Some people may think that that was a long time ago&#x2014;but there has never been any denial of what was said then. In one of our more recent debates, I asked the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup whether, as he is now calling for federalism&#x2014;or a unitary system, or whatever&#x2014;he would repudiate the words in his White Paper. He gave me no reply, because clearly that White Paper was misleading, and it took in many people.<br/>
That is the basis on which the process has tended to move, and I believe that the same thing is happening with the present treaty, too. The British people are not being told the truth; they are not being told exactly what is involved.</p>

<p>In the past few minutes, we have heard much about the beauties of the Single European Act. Does my hon. Friend believe that the raft of directives and regulations might be in any way connected with the fact that Europe's present share of world trade is only 20 per cent., compared with 25&#x00B7;5 per cent. 10 years ago? In the light of those statistics, does my hon. Friend believe that the Single European Act has had all the effects that were expected when it was passed?</p>

<p>That is one reason why I hope that the Select Committee inquiry will iron out some of those questions and bring out the truth to the British people.<br/>
For example, we are constantly told that the fact that 50 per cent. or 55 per cent. of our exports go to Europe is a wonderful thing. But the trade deficit is &#x00A3;12 billion against us. Another dimension then arises. I believe that much of that disparity and that deficit has come about because of the abuses of the single market, which I hope that we can sort out. That does not necessarily mean that we should not trade with Europe. Europe needs to trade with us as much as we need to trade with Europe.</p>

<p>All right, even more&#x2014;I agree.<br/>
Also raised in connection with the Single European Act is the strange untenable proposition that, if we do not sign the Maastricht agreement, we shall be excluded from the Single European Act and the treaty of Rome. That is poppycock. Those are treaty obligations of the kind which we are now being asked to sign. They are binding upon the other member states and ourselves, just as the present treaty would be.<br/>
The Single European Act and the treaty of Rome are not options that can be tossed overboard if we decide to accept the threats about what will happen to us if we do not sign. Nor does the coercion effectively being imposed on Denmark mean that that country can be excluded from the Single European Act and the treaty of Rome. That cannot happen. If it did, the other member states would be in breach of their treaty obligations.<br/>
Those obligations are not like the title I obligations, which, as I have said, are of a prerogative nature. They are international legal obligations under the aegis of the Court of Justice and therefore they take on the character of being justiciable before that court. The other member states cannot simply turn round and say, "We do not like the way you behave. Although the unanimity rule under article 236 says that all member states have to complete their constitutional requirements and have to be unanimous, we shall fudge it all. We shall manage to make a new arrangement with Denmark, but we shall exclude you from the treaty of Rome and the Single European Act."</p>

<p>In that context, as we are the largest payer towards the European club&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] As we are the second largest payer, there can be no question of our being excluded. Until other people want to write cheques for the cost of the organisation, we are an essential part of it.</p>

<p>I am delighted that my hon. Friends have been dealing with the practical questions of the treaty's impact on the daily lives of our constituents. It is all very well to talk in esoteric terms about whether title I is in or out, and for what reason&#x2014;but the real point is that we are dealing with people's lives. The question arises: who governs? The basis of our democracy is affected. Those are the matters of concern to our constituents.<br/>
I shall take the exchange rate mechanism as an example. Economic and monetary union is referred to in article B of the treaty, which says:
<q>The Union shall set itself the following objectives to promote economic and social progress which is balanced and sustainable"&#x2014;</q>
I shall deal with that idea in a moment&#x2014;
<q>in particular through the creation of an area without internal frontiers, through the strengthening of economic and social cohesion"&#x2014;</q>
I thought that we Conservatives had done a little damage to that idea, but it does not seem to have escaped inclusion in article B. The passage continues:
<q>and through the establishment of economic and monetary union, ultimately including a single currency in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty'.</q>
We have seen what happened when, for reasons which escape me, people decided that it was a good idea, on a piece of paper, to attempt to make totally divergent economies converge. That was done&#x2014;on a piece of paper&#x2014;and it was called the exchange rate mechanism. When it started in 1979, it was a voluntary arrangement between the governors of the various banks throughout Europe. There may have been some spurious merit in attempting to secure some co-ordination and co-operation, to which I have no objection.<br/>
However, then along came Mr. Delors, and turned it into a plan for part of an economic and monetary union. When the ERM collapsed on black Wednesday in September, interest rates rocketed up and caused immense damage throughout the land. The system was based on an absurd dogma, which had created massive havoc, panic and fear throughout the country. None the less, we find that we are still expected to sign up to it, in the form of article B. I shall consider our opt-out in a moment.<br/>
The article says&#x2014;we are signing up to all this stuff and we are part of that union&#x2014;that the objective of the union

is the establishment of economic and monetary union, ultimately including the single currency. What is the connection between that and our so-called "opt-out"?<br/>
Let us consider the protocol, which clearly states that the process of stage 3, which is applicable to all member states including ourselves&#x2014;the protocol is immediately adjacent to our so-called opt-out&#x2014;is irreversible, irrevocable and comes into effect on 1 January 1999. I shall come on to stage 2 in a moment. The protocol says that we cannot exercise our veto in respect of any other member states.<br/>
It is said that we are to be at the heart of Europe and that it is better to influence from within than from without. If we connect that with the fact that we have also agreed that the process will be irreversible and irrevocable, and that we shall not veto it for the others, we are effectively saying that we have accepted the gravitational pull. The position is even worse than that. Under article 8 of the protocol of the European Monetary Institute under stage 2, our Governor of the Bank of England will join the EMI. He and the EMI members will not be allowed to take instructions from member states.</p>

My hon. Friend's problem, on which I should like him to comment, is that the outside world sees his position as strange. The Bill does not include title I, yet all six amendments that he has tabled seek to put title I into the Bill.

criticism of the Chair. The interesting point is that the amendments were selected by the Chair, for which. I am deeply grateful.<br/>
I will answer the question simply. If my hon. Friend looks at the amendments to which she has just referred, she will see that they say, "insert I"&#x2014;that is, title I&#x2014;and that it then says "except'. The exceptions are articles A, B, C, D and F. The object of the exercise is to demonstrate why I do not want the provisions in the Bill. The reason is precisely the devastating impact that I believe they will have on the people of this country and on my constituents.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend said earlier that he was really concerned about how Maastricht would have an impact on the man and woman in the street in Great Britain. I will quickly draw my hon. Friend's attention to what is actually in the Bill. Article 2 says:
<q>The Community shall have as its task, by establishing a common market and an economic and monetary union and by implementing the common policies or activities referred to in Articles 3 and 3a, to promote throughout the Community a harmonious and balanced development of economic activities, sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the environment, a high degree of convergence of economic performance, a high level of employment and of social protection, the raising of standards of living and the quality of life, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among Member States.</q>

<p>I will tell my hon. Friend quickly if I may, Dame Janet. The British people in a series of opinion polls have already made it abundantly clear that they do not want economic and monetary union. There is a massive majority of about 68 per cent. That is the basis on which my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) seeks to fillibuster. I am sorry to have to say that to him. What he has referred to comes under title II We are dealing with title I.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that one difference is that the people of Britain no longer want to be taken in by all this twaddle about all the wonderful things that are happening? They remember that previous Bills said that the ERM would bring growth and stability. It was said that the CAP would bring fair prices for the housewife. The British people will not be taken in by all this nonsense and twaddle, unlike the minority of our pro-European hon. Friends.</p>

<p>May I add to that point, Dame Janet? To come back to what the objectives of the union are supposed to be, article B says that one objective is
<q>to promote economic and social progress which is balanced and sustainable".</q>
What is balanced and sustainable about the ERM and the collapse of sterling? With the tremendous gravitational pull and with all the machinery that is being cranked up to the EMI, what will be the effect of taking the ERM into economic and monetary union and into the central banking arrangements that are at the heart of the treaty? When the ERM collapses&#x2014;all the Parliaments will have

committed voluntary euthanasia, as we are being asked to do now&#x2014;the whole damn thing will collapse. There will then be massive instability and there will no balance in Europe.<br/>
The EC may say, "We will compensate for such a collapse by the social cohesion contained in the articles"&#x2014;that is, the transfer of resources and the cohesion fund. Let us look at the Delors 2 package and the way in which our Government are now trying to wriggle out of the competencies that were granted under Maastricht and for which they now say that they will not pay. We then begin to realise that the proposal will ruin the trust between the peoples of Europe because the people of Spain, of Portugal and of other countries will have been led up the garden path&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "And the Irish."] The Irish have been led up the garden path with the &#x00A3;6 billion that they were supposed to get.<br/>
Those countries will find that Germany does not have the money to pay for the fund, because Germany is preoccupied with its own affairs. The people in other parts of Europe are equally strapped for cash. We are the second highest net contributor, yet we are now apparently a qualifier for the cohesion fund.<br/>
It is crazy. We are supposed to be going into a system of convergence&#x2014;the ERM&#x2014;which has already been
demonstrated to be completely incapable of working. Under our autumn statement, we do not have the faintest opportunity of being able to comply with the convergence conditions prescribed by Maastricht. That is compounded by the fact that convergence is also part of our "European policy" for the rest of Europe, so it cannot work. We qualify for the cohesion fund, yet we are net contributors. Now the Germans say that they will take away &#x00A3;2 billion of our rebate. That is an absolutely crazy situation.<br/>
The plain fact is that we are being asked to accept provisions that will create civil disorder in parts of Europe. With the budgetary arrangements proposed and with the monetary policies that the unelected, unaccountable bank will have the independence to be able to enforce, the poorer people in other parts of Europe will find that their public service sector and borrowing requirements will be slashed. Those countries will not have the slightest chance of being able to pay the fines that the Government propose should be imposed on them. As a result, the poor will get even poorer.<br/>
That is another of my fundamental objections. It does not apply only to Europe; it applies to the third world. The last line of the book that I recently wrote said:
<q>while the third world starves.</q></p>

<p>Going back to amendment No. 93, which is about whether title I should be part of the Bill, I am not sure whether my hon. Friend is speaking in favour of it or against it. I should like him to clarify that point. The treaty has written into it article 3B, which is the subject of the Bill, whereas title I is not part of the Bill. Why is my hon.<br/>

<p>The answer is simply that it is not in the treaty. We have only to look at the Government's own handouts to know that the declarations are not part of the treaty. I was at the assize last year, and I was darned glad that that matter will not be imposed upon us, because there was a vote after two days of idiotic discussion. People were brought from all over Europe at absolutely fantastic expense. Even my hon.

The assize passed 240 amendments to a treaty which nobody had been told was even going to be given to us, all in the space of about two hours, by pressing buttons.

Because it was not included by the Government, we had to include title I in order to be able to knock out all the noxious provisions. It is precisely for that reason that we are now considering the articles and demonstrating their inadequacy and the reasons why we do not want them. That is precisely what is going on. There is every conceivable reason for doing so. I understand that those on both Front Benches have already decided that they will not vote on this matter, or at any rate they will vote against the Liberal Democrats' amendment if they decide to press it to a vote.</p>

<p>With respect, I do not think that my hon. Friend has answered the question. If he is saying that he wants to move the articles into the Bill to provide a peg for a debate, I would understand that. If he said, "This is a probing amendment on which we can debate the various articles," I would understand that. But his amendment would not eliminate the articles; it would include them in the Bill. If it is not a probing amendment to stimulate debate, which, Dame Janet, you know is the practice in Committee, my hon. Friend should tell us why he wants to do what he purports to want to do in the amendments.</p>

<p>The amendment also gives us the advantage of being able to demonstrate why the articles should not be included. Furthermore, it is a matter of international legal obligation. I am continually trying to get out of the Minister of State whether he regards title I as an international legal obligation. So far, he has not been prepared to give me an answer. I should be glad if he would&#x2014;perhaps he will do so later. We are not discussing a casual piece of paper, and the Minister of State knows it.

It is the binding material for the treaty as a whole. That is the basis on which the matter is being considered. It is not being put in the Bill because the Government want to do it by prerogative. They are doing that by prerogative, but they are not coming clean.<br/>
8.45 pm<br/>
The provisions are fundamental to the Maastricht treaty. Whether they are justiciable under article L in certain respects is debatable. They are international legal obligations which are of profound importance. That is why it is important that these matters should be probed, discussed and considered in full depth. That is what we intend to do.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech. I am sure that he wishes to make further progress. Could he refer again to the business of convergence? Is my hon. Friend suprised not to have had an intervention saying that convergence policies are a good thing? Is that possibly because at the weekend we found that, in Ireland, mortgage rates have gone up to 18&#x00B7;5 per cent., it was suggested that, if the Germans do not drop their interest rates by 1 January, Irish interest rates will go up to 40 per cent., and that overnight money has gone to 100 per cent? Is it perhaps that these are not the right few days to suggest that convergence policies are bringing the stability that some of us are told is the effect of such policies?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) has hit the nail on the head&#x2014;that is true. Hon. Members do not want to raise that point. They started by talking of trying to turn the debate back to title I and trying to turn it into a technical debate. The one thing that they do not want in any circumstances is for the people of this country to know the practical implications of this matter. That is what they do not want, but they will get doses of it as we proceed.</p>

<p>I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has come back to that point. When he was talking about economic convergence, he put the classic monetarist argument that if convergence principles were implemented at the moment, they would lead to increased unemployment throughout Europe. That is why many Opposition Members are opposed to virtual convergence. What attracts me to article B is that, if one could have real economic growth throughout the Community, it would be much easier to reach the convergence principles, but that would be based upon growth and increased public expenditure.</p>

<p>I have much sympathy with the objective that the hon. Gentleman is seeking. We all want jobs and prosperity for the people of Europe. We do not want another war, and we do not want the difficulties that we experienced over 100 years. But the problem is that the treaty is completely out of date. The people who are advocating those policies are carrying the intellecutal baggage of the 1950s. Since the collapse of the Berlin wall, we have moved into a completely new Europe. Merely grafting on so-called new solutions to what appear to be old problems will create disunity in Europe and not the European union that some are claiming in the provisions that we are discussing. It will not be diversity; it will be disunity. The trust between the peoples of Europe will be ruined.<br/>
Also, there will not be an equal union; there will be an imbalance. We can only take German interest rates as an example and the way in which they have been manipulated to the disadvantage of the rest of Europe, on the one hand, and the way in which the French have behaved with regard to GATT and nearly destabilised and might yet destabilise world trade on the other hand.<br/>
The French may yet destabilise the whole of world trade. That is not communautaire. That is not operating on the basis of the provision to promote economic and social progress which is balanced and sustainable. That is pursuing nationalistic, not even national, policies which are unfortunately a very sad and tragic reflection on their internal political systems.<br/>
For us to be drawn into the chaos that that will induce will be bad for us. That is another reason why we should make sure that we do not accept the treaty. It would lead to political instability. Let us consider the landscape of Europe for a moment. There are problems in Yugoslavia. There are problems in eastern Europe where the Germans have taken up 85 per cent. of all foreign investment; they also own half the Russian debt. There are disturbances in Georgia, problems in Kosovo and problems in Macedonia.<br/>
In that maelstrom it is proposed to impose a system of convergence which everyone knows will not work. The Westminster Parliament will be emasculated and our constituents will lose the right to make choices in general elections. As a consequence of convergence, the Community will create the very instability which it claims that it is seeking to avoid. That is one of my most fundamental objections to the treaty.<br/>
Furthermore, all this raises the question of the rule of law in Europe. Some influential people, including Ministers, have suggested that the system of law may collapse. We are told, "You do not have to worry about all this, because for practical purposes it will all collapse anyway." That is a disreputable argument. If individual member states lose their freedom and rule of law by the creation of a union, and a new rule of law, imposed under the European Court of Justice and other international obligations, collapses, that will be an act of massive political irresponsibility.<br/>
If the whole thing collapses, what will we put in its place? There is no secession clause. There is no way out. Therefore, somebody will have to enforce the system. I should like to know who that person or persons will be. The system will have to be disciplinary. That could be the beginning of a new fascism&#x2014;something we should be fighting against.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is the core of the mistake? No one denies that those who are eager for European unification see tremendous economic benefits. There could be unification if Europe were achieving convergence. The idea that locking us into these structures will create convergence is nonsense. There are completely different levels of speed and development. When the whole thing does not start to work, the common defence policy will become the arm which imposes the order when the European Court finds that it cannot uphold decisions by the Council of Ministers that nations should cut their spending and their budgets. That is the danger.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Gentleman's analysis.<br/>
Another strange, mysterious theology developed since the 1940s and 1950s is that these provisions will contain Germany. They will not do anything of the kind. Just as we found with the exchange rate mechanism, the economic muscle of Germany will prevail. We only have to look at the trade balances of Germany and other member states.<br/>
What I am saying is in no sense anti-German. Many people in Germany have made a massive contribution to peace in Europe since the 1940s, but when a country has such economic muscle and is effectively banking many other countries, it will be the most powerful. We have heard that France is virtually on the point of surrendering to the deutschmark. If Germany has control over the institutions and majority voting&#x2014;other member states will be inclined to vote with Germany because effectively it controls their economy&#x2014;far from containing it, we will have handed power to Germany on a plate.<br/>
That is the one thing we must not do with Germany. We must contain Germany by a balance of power and not by a spurious, academic, theoretical, theological attempt to contain it by pieces of paper. I remember Munich&#x2014;at least I remember that it was the waving of a piece of paper&#x2014;</p>

A speech by Mr. Martin Bangemann, the Vice-President of the European Commission and a former German Cabinet Minister, was mentioned earlier. As it directly bears on the question of European union, it is worth reminding the House that he said:
<q>The inadequacies of European decision-making cannot be remedied by returning power to member states. The notion of subsidiarity presupposes the idea of a federal European state.</q>
That mirrors what Mr. Delors and everyone in Europe has said because their perception&#x2014;</p>

<p>As often appears to be the case, my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) is wrong. I merely mentioned Martin Bangemann before, whereas just now I quoted what he said. It is important that we make it clear that those people in Europe believe that they are creating a federal super-state. That is in direct contradiction to what the Prime Minister has been telling us we want for this country.<br/>
The press release from the German embassy on 13 April says:
<q>There are no differences of conviction between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Prime Minister.</q>
The second paragraph of the press release congratulates the Prime Minister on his election victory and says:
<q>This is a deserved accolade for you and a great encouragement for those of us who hold the same convictions.</q>
The press release is saying that the German Chancellor believes that the Prime Minister holds the same convictions as he does. Obviously, it is worrying to some of us if they share the same convictions on Maastricht, as Chancellor Kohl states that the treaty
<q>is a new and decisive stage in the process of European union, leading to a united states of Europe within a few years".</q>
That is directly contrary to what we heard at the Conservative party conference, and to the pamphlet "Britain in Europe", which unequivocally states that we are not on the slippery slope to federalism&#x2014;</p>

<p>My hon. Friend says that the Prime Minister and Chancellor Kohl appear to agree, which

<p>No, I do not believe that subsidiarity is worth the paper that it is written on. It is the biggest con trick of all time. It demonstrates the centralising features of the Community.

<p>Again, I am most grateful, Dame Janet.<br/>
The pamphlet purports to deal with a range of issues concerned with the European Community and the Maastricht treaty, so it is not surprising that I might wish to dip into it from time to time, because it contains so many inaccuracies and so much disinformation and so many half-baked statements. As it has been distributed to the people of this country as some sort of alternative White Paper, it is very important to point those out.<br/>
It is all very well for us to think that there can be a bit of banter in this Chamber, but some hon. Members, including those who have made deliberate interventions, are overlooking the fact that their constituents are affected by what is contained in the treaty. Many of their constituents might not be too happy if they knew what their views on the subject were. I intend, without tedious repetition, to set the truth of what is in the treaty before the British public. That is worth doing, because the Government will not publish a White Paper.<br/>
I refer to the next comment, rather than the previous one, of Martin Bangemann. On 3 November 1992, the Prime Minister said that Mr. Bangemann was wrong. The report in <i>The Times</i> says:
<q>The Commission had already made absolutely clear that these were personal remarks and did not reflect the views of the Commission. Nor, can I assure you, are they my views, the views of this Government or any mainstream Government in Europe.</q>
Judging from some of the speeches that I have heard in the past year, certainly since the Maastricht treaty was signed, there is a strong sign that the leaders of the other Member States&#x2014;Mitterrand, Kohl, Lubbers, and so on&#x2014;have a federal agenda on their minds; that is what they want. It would not surprise me to learn that Martin Bangemann made the statements, because they are merely a reflection of the attitude of other leaders in Europe.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Milligan) said, the establishment of the social cohesion fund is terrible. The bottom line is that the treaty called for


a new cohesion fund for the poorest members of the European Community&#x2014;Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the colour of the dress of my hon.

The worst aspect of any policy is to engage in breaking promises which may not be fulfilled. It is clear that the other leaders of the member states are seeking to transfer resources on that socialist engineering principle, which will not work.<br/>
We must try, somehow or other, to give genuine help through fair trade with the other member states. The problem is that not all the member states will subscribe to the cohesion fund. We have heard that the Delors 2 plan has been jettisoned, in part because there is no money to pay for the cohesion fund. The structural funds&#x2014;the regional funds&#x2014;which I have not dealt with at all, have been cut back. A range of other matters have been presented to us as part of the package, but they simply will not work.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Member not agree that, far from being a communist plot&#x2014;because that might change the opinions of some of my hon. Friends&#x2014;it is a great redistribution treaty? When we are talking about 2 per cent., or perhaps 3 per cent. at the most, of the European total GDP being under control, that does not provide those powers.

We have an opportunity in Committee to expose the inadequacies of the arguments and to be able to say that we are&#x2014;we hope&#x2014;rational people who will listen to the arguments and attempt to form a measured judgment.<br/>
I would not want to espouse Tory party policies if I did not think that they would work effectively. I have an instance in mind. I was delighted that the exchange rate mechanism collapsed&#x2014;some of us said that we thought that it would not work. As I said to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister during my speech in the recess, the measure was contained in our manifesto. It was not the Euro-realists&#x2014;I am not sure about the phrase "Eurosceptics" and prefer to use the phrase "Euro-realists"&#x2014;who destroyed it. We said that we did not think that the exchange rate mechanism would work; we thought that it would collapse, and it did. We did not tear up our

manifesto to get out of the ERM, we were driven out of it because the system was inadequate, insufficient, fatally flawed&#x2014;</p>

<p>I certainly shall, Dame Janet.<br/>
The citizenship of the union arises under article B, which clearly states:
<q>The Union shall set itself the following objectives &#x2026;to strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of the nationals of its Member States through the introduction of a citizenship of the Union".</q>
Some of the statements that I have heard in support of that have been disingenuous and less than candid. Unfortunately, what is not made clear is the fact that the union provides not only for rights to be given to its participants, but for the duties imposed thereby.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Minister of State may or may not recall that I raised the issue with him in a written question to which I received one of the most extraordinary


answers that I have ever received during my time in the House. He said&#x2014;I paraphrase&#x2014;that such duties as were referred to would be those that emerged as the European Community evolved. His reply was something along those lines and I am sure that he will correct me if I am wrong.<br/>
That is the sort of theme that was being pursued and there is very good reason for being vague in matters of this kind. I think that the Minister is very wise to be vague, because this is blank cheque territory.<br/>
What is the most important function, or certainly one of the prime functions, of a legal entity of the kind that this European union is to be? It is the call to arms. That is the direction in which this is going: to a common defence policy. What is the first requirement, the first duty to be imposed on citizens? It is that they may be conscripted. Labour Members may care to reflect on that, because a Franco-German army has been created and I believe that the Secretary of State for Defence was not even invited to some of the meetings because they were held in secret. They were obviously up to something or other and they did not seem to want to have him there. Be that as it may, one of the first duties of a citizen is the call to arms and I think that people ought to be reflecting hard on what that might involve.<br/>
9.15 pm<br/>
There is the further question of voting in elections. We have been told that the wording of the arrangements for voting for these new citizens will be confined to local and regional elections but that is not what it says. It says "municipal".<br/>
In English, according to "The Concise Oxford Dictionary" the word "municipal" would mean to do with a borough&#x2014;perhaps a rotten borough or whatever&#x2014;but the practicality of it is that it is to do with local government.<br/>
However, in the precedents of the Court of Justice there is a very important Italian case from a few years ago. Surprise, surprise&#x2014;the word "municipal" as already interpreted by the court means "national". Translate that in the citizenship provisions. Translate municipal to national, in line with the precedents of the Court of Justice, and we have a big question mark. I hope that the Attorney-General or someone will come and explain these complicated legal things that I do not understand.<br/>
I should like to know whether the word "municipal", meaning national in that context, would refer to what a Liberal right hon. Member did when he went to Rome to stand for election there. We might find other nationals coming over for a test case. Then it will go to the Court of Justice. We will sign the treaty and suddenly they will say, "You thought you knew what you were signing, but, as is so commonly the case with this treaty, you thought it meant so and so, but actually, bad luck, it means something else." The Court of Justice could easily substitute "national" for "municipal" and we could find ourselves in difficulty. I should like to know why that matter was not raised when the treaty was being negotiated. That Italian case is quite a well-known one.<br/>
As I see the Minister of State thumbing through some biographies down there, perhaps he would be good enough to tell me whether he will answer the question, which I might put to him rhetorically, as to whether municipal means national as expressed by the Court of Justice?</p>

Important questions lie at the heart of the citizenship issue because we are being told that what is being done will not affect our rights as British citizens. It is said that this is an add-on, a little extra, when in reality it is fundamental and goes back to the whole question of the union. The union is a legal framework, and whether it comes within the Court of Justice or is a legal international obligation, what is proposed will be binding on us. It should be struck out of the treaty because it goes to the heart of the way in which we run our democracy and the rights which we are used to exercising.</p>

<p>Will my hon.

The idea that, by some means, voting in municipal elections represents citizenship is a load of rubbish. Instead, every three years there will be a review to increase the duties.

While we are told that that is a separate pillar, those provisions will be binding on us. We are bound to compare what was said on immigration at the Conservative party conference with the substantive provisions in the treaty.<br/>
It is not even as simple as that. If the unanimity rule is dispensed with and a joint action plan for immigration is brought in, we shall face the prospect of another enabling provision designed to allow the Court of Justice to have jurisdiction over immigration policy.

<p>The hon. Gentleman is right to refer to that measure. Many of those who are responsible for putting the treaty together do not realise that people can read and do not necessarily believe what they are told. Indeed, the more incredibility that arises as the process goes forward, the more questions people want to be answered.<br/>
The British population is becoming increasingly concerned at the vast discrepancy between what they were led to believe and what is going on. As the currency of language is becoming more familiar to people, they are discovering that they do not like much of what they hear. That will cause greater difficulty for the advocates of the measure as time passes, for as the monetary system implodes, so the other provisions relating to justice and home affairs become clearer.<br/>
There are no doubt some admirable objectives, for example, in seeking to prevent drug abuse and the transfer of drugs across borders and so on, but is it necessary to have a Euro-poll? Where will the centre of power of that poll be, who will run it, what powers will they have and what effect will that have on the rights and duties of British citizens? Little information has been given on all those matters.</p>

<p>It is all quite disgraceful. It is not the slightest bit surprising, however, because many of these meetings take place in secret, as the Council of Ministers does. This is half the trouble: the European union will not be a new wonderland of democracy, anything but. It is my belief that the European Parliament cannot fill that void. If Westminster and other Parliaments are emasculated by the provisions of this treaty, we will have a democratic void and the power of government will grow greater.<br/>
In the July edition of a journal published by the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, the official think tank of the Christian Democrat Party, Chancellor Kohl's party, there was a very interesting statement&#x2014;that since the Danish referendum something very strange had been going on in Europe; voters were beginning to protest. It went on to say that this would make governing even more difficult than it had been in the past. This is the kind of language coming out of the Christian Democrat party. This is what was said by the editor of the official think tank journal.<br/>
Our Conservative MEPs&#x2014;and this relates directly to the questions on the European Parliament contained in article D&#x2014;have joined up with the European People's party, an exclusively federal organisation.

<p>As ever, the ingenuity and perception of my hon. Friend are quite magnificent. He has made his point. I have not the faintest idea how it can be done, but I


certainly share his deep reservations, worries and doubts about it. The plain fact is that on most of the matters which arise on this treaty we are being taken for a very substantial ride.<br/>
There is another provision in article B on which I have not yet touched, and that is the subject of subsidiarity. Subsidiarity is described here as one of the main objectives of the union. It clearly states that the objectives of the union are to be achieved as laid down
<q>in the Treaty and in accordance with the conditions and the timetable set out therein"&#x2014;</q>
some very important matters relating to the conditions and timetable for economic and monetary union arise on that&#x2014;
<q>while respecting the principle of subsidiarity as defined in Article 3b of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</q>
We all know that Lord Mackenzie-Stuart described subsidiarity as gobbledegook. There are serried ranks of European lawyers who take exactly the same view and are totally opposed to it. They include some of our most distinguished practitioners at the European bar. They know that subsidiarity is a con trick, and they say so repeatedly.<br/>
I see that you have now returned to the Chair, Mr. Morris, and I shall seek to keep within the bounds of order in line with the strong rulings that you have given on these matters. I am very gradually and carefully working my way through the provisions.<br/>
I shall leave it to others to elaborate on subsidiarity because I find that it is a theological concept of such complexity and confusion that it is much better left for the early part of a day&#x2014;perhaps that will be tomorrow.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend asks whether it is possible to equate market forces and a fixed exchange rate. The answer is emphatically no, for this very good reason: what these proposals are attempting to do is to pay lip service to free trading arrangements. That is what the treaty of Rome, the original basis of the European Economic Community, was all about, and I thoroughly endorse and agree with it.<br/>
But then, because of this extraordinary desire to impose systems within it and then to redistribute in this social engineering way that we are expected to agree to under the transfer of resources, they want to have fixed exchange rates, not only to get a greater degree of control over the currencies but also to create one country. At the moment the Berlaymont seems to be closed, but anyone who managed to get in before that happened will have noticed the placards on the way in which say "Europe my country". No attempt is made to disguise that.<br/>
I have enormous respect for the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber and his colleagues, who passionately believe in the virtues of a federal system and European union. They believe that it will enhance democracy, but those who hold the contrary view are equally entitled to develop their arguments. I am worried, however, about compromises being reached on issues that are not capable of being compromised&#x2014;democracy,

voting and citizen' rights in the United Kingdom in the United Kingdom and whether Parliament will be able effectively to conduct its affairs. The budgetary arrangements proposed in the treaty will be imposed on our central bank&#x2014;the Bank of England&#x2014;and thereby on Parliament. We shall not then be able to hold the Chancellor accountable for the Budget.<br/>
There are other measures that I have not mentioned, such as multisurveillance budgets, which sound like something from outer space&#x2014;which is where the treaty should be sent.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend was saying that, if the Chancellor were to announce his Budget at some future date, people would find it difficult to understand. But if, in three years' time, the Chancellor says, "I'm awfully sorry, but we must close 50 schools and 30 hospitals," the reason that he can give is perfectly straightforward: to promote economic and social progress that is balanced and


sustainable. We would have to spend more money for Greek and Portuguese hospitals and schools. It is clearly written in the treaty, so people will know why the Chancellor is doing that in three years' time.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that observation. I do not need to repeat it, because it is now on the record. I hope that people outside will take note of that because I have discovered that people are discovering many things about the treaty and, as we go deeper into it, they will learn even more.<br/>
I return to article C about the consistency of external activities. We well remember what happened in the GATT round recently when France dug itself into a position which, even now, may induce a trade war. It is precisely because of the European Commission's role in that matter that those difficulties arose. It is not just bilateral trade. The provision says:
<q>The Council and the Commission shall be responsible for ensuring such consistency.</q>
The hon. Member for Leicester, South said earlier that I was claiming that the Commission would have more powers under the treaty than I could justify. This is yet another example, and there are many others. It is not simply an airy-fairy canter through "Alice in Wonderland" territory; it is about how the United Kingdom will be governed in future.<br/>
When we see that our business men, companies, partnerships and good, honest, decent hard-working people could find that they are afflicted with a massive trade war because of one country's intransigence and the fact that the European Commission is operating&#x2014;</p>

<p>It certainly does not, because my argument is that, within a European Community that works effectively, people operate on the basis of mutual obligations. It is precisely because some countries are not interested in doing that that we are faced with the difficulty. It is a form of nationalism, not national interests, which is the subtle distinction that needs to be made.<br/>
We have had a similar problem with Honeywell Bull, Renault, Rhone Poulenc and Usinor. There is a stack of

examples&#x2014;the creation of mega-Euro-champions. That is the kind of thing that causes difficulties. It is the job of the European Commission to sort out such things and, in relation to the external activities, it is found wanting. That is why we should not be making these massive transfers of power to it in relation to economic and development policies.<br/>
9.45 pm<br/>
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was present a few moments ago and I should like to address some remarks to him. In the proposed energy policy under the treaty, there are already signs of greater control by the so-called union over our energy affairs. The pit closure programme and the disposition of the balance between nuclear, gas and coal power is a matter that we went into recently. The Vice-President of the European Commission, that tremendous advocate of free trade, Sir Leon Brittan, approved a DM3&#x00B7;3 billion deal between the heavily subsidised German coal producers and the German power operators.<br/>
That gives a tremendous advantage to German energy users at our expense. RWE, which I understand is the biggest energy concern in Germany, intends&#x2014;and I have every reason to believe that it will be successful&#x2014;to sell steam coal to our power generators when we are closing our pits. That is an incredible state of affairs. All that arises out of the movement towards a common energy policy.<br/>
I asked the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when I met him why we did not sort out the European Coal and Steel Community regulations as a precondition to all this, because it is upon that basis that the German coal producers are so heavily subsidised. There are omissions from the arrangements every bit as much as there are matters which should have been sorted out as the negotiations went ahead.</p>

<p>Again, I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to a point that I have made and on which he is dwelling. As a result of the treaty, by the beginning of the next century we shall be left with a British Parliament with little more power than a state senate within the United States. That may satisfy some, such as the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath), but I imagine that it does not satisfy the majority of hon. Members, and certainly not the British people.</p>

<p>I am sure that that is a sound point. The hon. Gentleman compared Britain and America. The harmonisation of our VAT arrangements has put us in a more disadvantageous position vis-a-vis the European Community, even before we enter into this union, than individual states in respect of the federal arrangements for sales tax in the United States. We are worse off even before we go into the union.</p>

<p>Has not the hon. Gentleman persistently confused the development towards federalism with the development towards a unitary state, sometimes using the word "or" to put the two together? Some of us favour the establishment of federalism in Europe, a united states of Europe, but we are against developing a unitary state. We do not believe that we can get to federalism by going through a unitary state. That is the big mistake that the Liberal Democrats seem to be making.</p>

<p>I have enormous sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point, but there is no such thing as a simple,


overarching definition of federalism. I have read articles describing the treaty sometimes in relation to a unitary state, sometimes with a federal connotation. There is a tendency to intermingle the two. I am inclined to agree with the hon. Gentleman that the treaty has more of a unitary character than the commonly regarded federal system.<br/>
There is no way of precisely defining federalism. We must avoid becoming involved so much in semantics&#x2014;which is why all the nonsense about taking the word "federal" out of the treaty does not amount to a row of beans. The issues are the distribution of functions, the extent of the centralising process, and where the power will lie. Those are the questions on which we should concentrate, and I intend to do so tonight.<br/>
I mentioned economic and development in respect of article C, but I have not yet referred to external relations and security. Common foreign and security policy raises big questions. Those are prerogative powers and, as with title I, it is not intended that they will be included in the Bill.<br/>
The extent and range of the powers that will be conferred on the Community are infinitely greater than people have been led to believe. Under a joint action plan or European guidelines, a completely different kind of foreign policy would be run in this country. No longer would we be able unilaterally to enter into the kind of bilateral arrangments that took us into the Gulf war.</p>

<p>Yes, it is. I said that, in the context of a joint action plan or in relation to European guidelines, there would be substantial changes in the way that we carry out our foreign and security policy. I quote from article J.1(4) of the treaty:
<q>The Member States shall support the Union's external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity. They shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union"&#x2014;</q>

<q>or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations. The Council shall ensure that these principles are complied with.</q>

<p>I agree with you absolutely, Mr. Morris, but I was dealing with foreign and security policy, and in the light of my hon. Friend's intervention, I thought that it would be helpful to explain why I thought that she was wrong. However, of course I accept your ruling.<br/>
Article D says:
<q>The European Council"&#x2014;</q>
that is not the same as the Council of Ministers&#x2014;
<q>shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political guidelines thereof.</q>
That represents a curious but none the less dangerous movement towards greater union. When the European Council prescribes the union's general political guidelines that will have a significant adverse impact on the manner in which we in this country, through our elected representatives, decide the basis on which we want to run our affairs.<br/>
There is no definition of those general political guidelines. That should give considerable cause for concern. We often find that the treaty does not provide proper definitions of the expressions within it, and if we do not have those we shall get into deeper and deeper trouble. The expression "general political guidelines" is so vague as to mean almost anything to anybody, yet it is included in the treaty as a legal obligation to be exercised by the European Council.<br/>
No one has a clear idea what the functions of the European Council will be. It appears that, although it is effectively without a democratic base, that body will make decisions at summits, pronouncing on the political affairs of all member states. Apparently it will not be accountable within the new legal framework or specifically accountable to the House. To whom will it be accountable? Nobody knows. It is not set out anywhere how its functions will be implemented.<br/>
As I read through the treaty I find ever more grounds for disturbance and concern, as I imagine that we are about to transfer such powers to a treaty arrangement which has never been explained to the British people.<br/>
The last article that I shall discuss is article F. Interestingly, the Leader of the Opposition tabled an amendment to that article that was identical to the one that I had tabled.</p>

<p>As ever, my hon. Friend has made a most valuable intervention. The European Council will report only to the European Parliament. That is where the con trick occurs. In all the verbiage and garbage generated to try to justify the treaty we are told that the European Parliament will be given greater powers, yet all that the European Parliament will get here is a report after each of the council's meetings, and a yearly written report on the progress achieved by the union.<br/>
I do not believe that there is any good reason for giving the European Parliament enhanced powers. I believe that we should retain our powers as a sovereign independent state within Europe. But when I was working on the


Conservative manifesto committee, I was offered a suggestion that would have included the words "sovereign independent state" in the manifesto. Unfortunately, much to my concern, those words disappeared during the proceedings. That demonstrates the basis on which the treaty has been negotiated.<br/>
If the words "sovereign independent state" were taken out of the Conservative manifesto working party paper at about that same time that the Government were beginning to negotiate the treaty, one can begin to understand that the European union they had in mind was not a European union of independent sovereign states.<br/>
I see that my right hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) is here. He has repeatedly made profoundly useful contributions to the question of independent sovereign states within Europe. We are determined to maintain our position in Parliament and not to allow the treaty to overtake the ancient traditions of this House. I was about to turn to article F3, which I raised on a point of order before we started these proceedings. That&#x2014;</p>

<p>I rise on the Adjournment. For a few seconds, I thought that those in the fishing industry watching and listening to this debate would be impressed by the amount of interest shown in the future of the haddock fishery. I am sorry that so many hon. Members are now leaving.<br/>
I hope that the Minister has been informed that my hon. Friend the Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) wishes to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, at the end of my contribution. That is wholly appropriate, because the issues that will be raised affect the whole fishing industry round the coast of Scotland and elsewhere.<br/>
This debate takes place on a motion for the Adjournment. It reflects great shame on the Government that, at the end of a vital Fisheries Council last week, no statement was made to the House on the progress or lack of progress of that Council. There was no opportunity in Government time to debate properly the future of this vital industry. There might then have been more time and opportunity for hon. Members to make their particular contributions. I hope that the Minister will first address the question of when fishing will be accorded its proper priority in terms of the proceedings of the House to allow a variety of hon. Members representing fishing communities to put forward their views.<br/>
I hope that the Minister is under no illusions about the consequences of last Monday's abject failure. There was total failure to gain any extension or borrowing forward of the haddock quota. The consequences will be severe. If the Minister had told the House that he had tried his best, but had failed to achieve any progress in Europe, he would have been subject to a variety of criticisms, but at least he would have had an argument and a leg to start on.<br/>
What is intolerable is that the Minister and the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food did not even attempt to argue for the borrowing forward of the haddock quota. The fishing communities of Scotland regard that failure absolutely and utterly inexplicable.<br/>
There are three consequences. As a direct result of the Minister's failure, the industry will move from its current position of total scarcity to one of glut on 1 January, when the haddock quota will zoom up by 120 per cent. on current levels. The industry will move from famine to almost uncontrollable feast. Many industry observers do not believe that the processing sector can cope with 130,000 tonnes of haddock annually. The result of that huge increase in the haddock quota will be glut, depressed prices, and the industry's problems will immediately change as it oscillates from famine to feast.<br/>
In Committee only last week, hon. Members debated the principle of the "Hogmanay haddock". The fish are not to be caught in December, when there is a ready market and keen prices. Exactly the same fish will be available to be caught next month, when there will be a glut and depressed prices. The Minister's failure has subjected the industry to that nonsense. The Minister should reflect on the direct result of his failure&#x2014;the bleak Christmas that many thousands of people in fishing communities will face as catchers and processors lay up boats and lay off workers.<br/>
One of the remarks in Standing Committee a couple of weeks ago which caused most offence was that of the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. He said that there was no real need for concern because
<q>the processing industry in Scotland &#x2026; has not shut up shop."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report, European Standing Committee A,</i> 18 November 1992; c. 14.]</q>
It is extraordinary that a Fisheries Minister can be so oblivious to the problems of the fishing industry as to make such a casual remark.<br/>
At the major demonstration in Aberdeen a week past Friday, that remark was noted by fishing communities. Processors who are trying their best in very difficult conditions not to lay off workers as Christmas approaches found it offensive that the Fisheries Ministers could not even recognise the extent of the problems faced by the processing sector because of the dearth of fresh fish.<br/>
Hon. Members from fishing communities will have been advising constituents at their weekend surgeries on the problems faced by the catching sector, such as obtaining unemployment benefit, which is an extreme problem for many constituents. I should like the Minister at least to tell us that he appreciates the severity of the problems affecting thousands of families in fishing communities.<br/>
There is another consequence which, for many people looking at the long-term future of the industry, is the most severe of all. As a direct consequence of the Minister's failure not to get borrowing forward of the haddock quota at the Fisheries Council, thousands of tonnes of good-quality fish are currently being discarded dead into the North sea.</p>

<p>Does my hon.

<p>My hon. Friend's remarks are well noted. They were universally shared at the fishing rally in Aberdeen a week past Friday. Many people see as the most criminal aspect of the current fisheries mismanagement the fact that good-quality fish could be discarded dead for no useful purpose into the North sea.<br/>
I now refer to why Fisheries Ministers felt unable to take any action. My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and I met the Scottish Fisheries Minister on 21 October, when we first raised the necessity of looking for the advance on next year's quota. He wrote to us last month. He said that it would be "imprudent", in the absence of scientific advice, to borrow forward a quota which was not known. Most of us would say that that is a substantial argument, but, even before the Minister's letter reached me, the quota for next year became known, and of course it is a 120 per cent. increase on this year's quota. So the argument that the Minister presented at that stage was false.<br/>
We were told in Standing Committee that the Government could not argue for this, because it would be difficult in terms of the European negotiations. That struck me as a surprising argument, since haddock is almost

completely a United Kingdom fish and, for that matter, dominatingly a Scottish fish. No one else in the European Community has a strong vested interest in the haddock quota or in stopping borrowing forward.<br/>
No doubt the Minister will say, "What about the Norwegians?" They have a huge interest in the haddock quota in the North sea, but the simple solution was to borrow forward on the west coast quota, which is 100 per cent. a United Kingdom quota and 90 per cent. a Scottish quota. In the coming year, an increase of 50 per cent. for that quota is forecast. The few thousand tonnes of haddock involved could have been borrowed forward on the west coast quota to address the current crisis in the fishing industry in Scotland, with no complications for the Norwegian negotiations.<br/>
The Minister may tell us that there is no precedent for borrowing forward within the Community. That is not so. It is only some five years since the Community rolled forward the entire fishing year, because Fisheries Ministers were not satisfied at the end of the year that we were progressing sensibly. The fishing year became 14 to 15 months. In addition, the Minister is currently negotiating a change in the common fisheries policy, or perhaps a completely new policy which proposes a multi-annual quota, so no damaging precedent would have been set if they had borrowed forward on the haddock quota.<br/>
Can the Scottish Minister tell us whether the real reason for his inability even to table the proposal last week was not given in Standing Committee by the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, when he said:
<q>The industry is fairly divided about whether it is desirable to do that."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, European Standing Committee,</i> 18 November 1992; c. 14.]</q>
The Scottish industry is not divided. Every section of the industry, every producer organisation, every representative organisation, and every representative voice in the processing industry had asked for the same proposal. If the industry was said to be "divided", it can only be a hint that advice was coming from elsewhere against the proposal. The Minister must be honest and tell us whether he was vetoed from putting forward the proposal by objections from elsewhere furth of Scotland.<br/>
It has been suggested by reputable voices in the fishing community that there has been a miscalculation of this year's quota which would explain the extraordinary oscillation of the haddock quota. I have tabled questions, but I hope that the Minister will address that point tonight.<br/>
Finally, I hope that the Scottish Office Minister understands that the Scottish industry is on the march, as was shown in Aberdeen a week past Friday. The Scottish industry will be on the march again a week come this Friday, at a major demonstration at the European summit in Edinburgh. The Minister should not underestimate the anger felt across the fishing communities. I hope that we will get satisfactory explanations tonight. I have never seen a more convincing argument for Scotland needing independence in Europe than the abject failure to represent our fishermen in the European Community last week.</p>

<p>I shall be brief, because the reply from the Minister will be very important to us. In congratulating my hon. Friend on securing the debate, may I say that he and my hon. Friend the Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) recognise that an Adjournment debate is no substitute for a debate in Government time.<br/>
Since the House resumed its official capacity in mid-October, we have mentioned the need for a debate on the fishing industry in Scotland at every business question time, but those requests have not been granted. They have been pushed aside, and the fishing industry and fishing communities feel offended by that attitude. From the Government's approach, one would think that the industry was not important, but it is vital to Scotland's national economy and to our local communities the length and breadth of the Scottish coastline.<br/>
A week past Friday in Aberdeen, our fishing communities showed dignity and decency as they walked in unity, whether they came from the catching or processing sides of the industry and whether they were directly or indirectly involved. They walked throught the streets of Aberdeen and asked that their voices be heard.<br/>
Given that there will be another demonstration in Edinburgh on 11 December, will the Minister at the very least ensure that the Conservative party is represented on the platform and that it makes its views heard in front of the people of Scotland and of those fishing communities? If the Government continue to treat our people with such contempt, they most certainly do not deserve any respect. Will the Minister or his Back-Bench colleagues&#x2014;I notice that at least one has had the decency to turn up for this debate&#x2014;at least show their faces on that occasion?</p>

<p>I am pleased to be able to reply to the debate obtained by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). Although I realise from his speech that he finds it difficult, he must accept that I take this matter as seriously as he, his colleagues from the Scottish National party and my colleagues do.<br/>
Fishing is of prime importance to Scotland. I shall explain why what happened this year has been extremely unfortunate. I know that the hon. Gentleman finds it difficult, but it is important to accept that North sea haddock has been in a distressed state for several years, yet fishing pressure has remained high.<br/>
Spawning was good in 1991; hence the great increased prospects for 1993. There will be an enhanced total allowable catch because of good spawning during the past two years, and not because the scientists got it wrong. That does not mean that we can immediately return to over-fishing. If we do, we shall return to the cycle of recent years, when there has been an extreme shortage of fish. We cannot allow unlimited fishing at present.<br/>
Let us get the facts right. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will listen. As he knows, in 1992, the total allowable catch of haddock was 60,000 tonnes, and we had to negotiate&#x2014;with extreme difficulty&#x2014;with Norway for our 42,640 tonnes quota, which was up 15 per cent. on 1991. He should bear in mind that no one else in the Community has more than 2,000 tonnes, so the haddock quota is significantly a United Kingdom tonnage.<br/>
As the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady know, we fished out that quota by November. Indeed, in some cases it was fished out by October. There were no cuts in the quota&#x2014;it was fished out earlier than expected purely because fishing pressure was so high and fishing was so expert. Management of the quota is the industry's responsibility. Much of the haddock caught was small and difficult to market and, unfortunately, that helped to reduce prices in mid-summer.<br/>
I agree that the non-sector also fished out its quota, but it has to keep roughly in step with the producer organisations, if the quotas are to be fished out equally. The closure in October was not premature. By that time, we were up to 92 or 93 per cent. of the quota. Subsequently, after the fisheries had been closed, we were up to 98&#x00B7;4 per cent. In the Scottish Fisheries Organisation, Iandings were still coming in six weeks after the closure.<br/>
The scientific information from our Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management is that the quota will be much higher in 1993. That is good news, and we should welcome it. The total allowable catch is likely to be about 133,000 tonnes. Once again, we will need to go into detailed negotiations with Norway. I expect that we will receive between 70,000 and 80,000 tonnes of North sea haddock, which is almost double what we have this year.</p>

<p>There is a constraint on time, so I must press on.<br/>
The quota for cod will be much the same next year, and the quota for whiting will be down slightly. Fishermen will be encouraged to know that they can begin fishing in four weeks time with a substantially increased quota.<br/>
The west coast fisheries will have an increased quota for haddock, although not so much as in the North sea, and a small increase in the quotas for cod and whiting. Broadly speaking, the prospects for next year look much better.<br/>
It is unreasonable for the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan to allege that I did not take action. I want to make that matter absolutely clear. As someone who has been preaching about Scotland in Europe for a long time, the hon. Gentleman should begin to understand how Europe works&#x2014;he has no idea whatever. He thinks that he can drift to Brussels or Luxembourg, wave his arms and all the other countries will fall at his feet and accept exactly what he asks.</p>

<p>No, the hon. Gentleman can wait until I have made further progress.<br/>
In early October, my officials foresaw the problem, and immediately commenced discussions with officials and the Council in Brussels and Luxembourg. When I raised the matter at the Council on 19 October, it was clear that no one would grant us an advance of quota, especially in the light of the reputation that we had earned during the year for the production of black fish. Nevertheless, although


the council said no in October, our officials kept up the pressure and did everything possible to obtain an advance of quota, but it simply was not possible. We tried swaps and all means to obtain quota for our Scottish fishermen.<br/>
One day, the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan will get to Europe in some capacity. However, he will not get very far if he does not understand how the Council of Ministers works and how the Council of Europe works generally.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman will let me finish what I am saying, I shall then give way. He must accept that we made positive gains at the last Council&#x2014;we obtained gains from the multi-annual guidance programme, which was reduced to 20 per cent., 15 per cent. and zero. That was a substantial improvement on the reduction in fishing that there might have been over the next four years.<br/>
We have retained the Shetland box, the Hague preference, the six and 12-mile limits. The stability issue is important relative to the quota split. We have also obtained segmentation of demersal, pelagic, and nephrops fishing. We have introduced decommissioning. Nobody was shouting louder about decommissioning than the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan 12 months ago&#x2014;now we have obtained it. It is most important that the hon.

The capabilities of the Scottish fishing fleet in capacity are enormous.

<p>The rumours one hears about eight or ten-day tie-ups are but rumours. The hon. Lady knows what I think about them, from the debate we had two years ago. I hope very much that we are not in that position, particularly bearing in mind the very strict restrictions that we have in this country, and which we will be in a position to enforce later on if the Bill now before another place becomes law. There is a great deal ahead in terms of restrictions.<br/>
The hon. Lady must understand that, if we were not tough on fishing quotas, we would have very few fish to catch, and the fishing industry would be in decline. We are

determined as a Government to see the fishing industry prosper. We shall be in that position next year and will see the fishing industry prosper, because quotas will be substantially more than they were this year. I believe that this is the right way to assist the fishing fleet. That is of the greatest importance to this Government, whatever the hon. Gentleman says about our efforts over recent months.<br/>
Lastly, I reiterate that it was simply impossible to obtain an advance quota. If it had been, we would have achieved it.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Can you clarify the rules on interruptions during Adjournment debates? I was certainly under the impression that no-one could interrupt a debate without the permission of the hon. Member&#x2014;</p>
