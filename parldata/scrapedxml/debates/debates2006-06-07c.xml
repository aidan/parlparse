	<p pid="c.233.6/1">I am pleased to hear about the Secretary of State's ongoing discussions with other Cabinet colleagues. What precautions are the Government going to take to ensure that Welsh and other British farmers are not penalised in the next round of common agricultural policy reform? It is generally recognised that we have the most productive farmers, and they should be applauded for that. Europe should learn from that and our farmers should not be penalised&mdash;in Wales or in any other part of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="c.233.7/1">I totally agree with the hon. Lady. It is important that we take forward the CAP reform agenda, and Britain is now acknowledged as leading in Europe on CAP reform. I can assure her that, although we want to introduce such reforms, the intention is not to penalise our own agricultural industry in doing so. It is clear that the reforms already in place have not penalised our farmers, and we want to continue in that vein.</p>

	<p pid="c.233.9/1">Indeed&mdash;I totally agree with my hon. Friend. It may help the House if I remind everyone of what we lost during the past 10 years because of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy disaster, which happened under the last Government, and the resulting beef ban. In 1995, beef exports from the UK were worth &pound;600 million, and 270,000 tonnes of British beef were exported. We have lost all that in 10 years, and we need to regain those markets. I am glad to say that Hybu Cig Cymru is marketing Welsh beef in Europe, and we have been very successful in securing contracts, particularly in Italy.</p>

	<p pid="c.234.0/1">I agree with what the Minister has just said, but may I draw his attention to another important, current subject: the failure of the fallen stock scheme? This Government would not allow Wales, and north Wales in particular, to be exempted from the scheme, which, for obvious reasons that we warned about at the time, proved impractical. We now have rotting carcases throughout farms in north and mid-Wales, which is bad for biosecurity and human health and, I am afraid, the economy. Will the Minister please speak to his bungling colleagues in the National Assembly?</p>

	<p pid="c.234.1/1">The issue is the failure of a company that has provided that service in north Wales, and I am assured that other companies are coming in to tackle the backlog. I agree that it is essential that we deal with the biosecurity issue, which is why the Assembly is tackling it by getting other fallen stock companies to clear up the backlog.</p>

	<p pid="c.234.2/1">Borders mean nothing to animal disease, so dealing with tuberculosis in cattle and cattle movements between England and Wales requires close co-operation between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Assembly Government and the British Cattle Movement Service, as the Minister will doubtless acknowledge. What checks has he made on the co-ordination of data relating to pre-movement TB tests, and what percentage and number of TB reactors have so far been picked up in pre-movement testing in Wales?</p>

What is the Minister going to do about the absolutely disgraceful Law Lords ruling, which deprives working-class people of their rightful deserts?</p>

	<p pid="c.235.1/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend and other colleagues who are rightly campaigning on this issue. It is a vital concern for hundreds if not thousands of people who have been in contact with asbestos during their working lives. The Government fully understand the concerns expressed about the House of Lords judgment in the Barker <i> v. </i>Corus case and we are sympathetic to the claimants. The judgment raises serious and complex issues and it is important to ensure that we get the right answer. We are therefore exploring all options with the relevant stakeholders to achieve a solution that is fair, but also workable.</p>

	<p pid="c.235.2/1">We support the Government in dealing with asbestos-related illnesses, but will the Minister also consider dealing with the miners who have dust-related injuries and have not yet received their compensation? I refer to one of my constituents, Donald Watkins of Pontneathvaughn, who has been waiting six and a half years. These miners are becoming older and iller by the day and the same sometimes applies to their widows.

Is it not time that we were a bit more honest and reminded the cricket authorities that they are the England and Wales Cricket Board? Would it not be nice if my hon. Friend were able to eat some Welsh&mdash;</p>

Several initiatives are under way on food products, and I welcome the opening last month of Lloyd's dairy in Islington, a recreation of one of the old Welsh dairy shops that used to proliferate in north and west London.

	<p pid="c.237.3/1">I accept the importance of reopening the A5 as quickly as possible. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the closure was because of a serious risk of injury from an unstable cliff face. He will also be aware that while most landowners on the old A5, which could provide an alternative route, are co-operating with the Welsh Assembly Government, one has unfortunately decided not to do so at this stage. The matter needs to be addressed quickly and I understand that Andrew Davies, the Minister with responsibility for transport in Wales, is dealing with it as a priority. Its importance is recognised, but if the hon. Gentleman wants to make his views known, I will pass them on to Andrew Davies. Perhaps he should also make a direct approach.</p>

I know that in many villages in my constituency and, I expect, in his, there are senior citizens who depend on the local post office, and we want to see them kept open if at all possible.

At present, they can use the cheque-and-send service to obtain a passport, for example, from the Bethcar street branch in Ebbw Vale, but will the introduction of the new biometric checks for passports mean that another service is to be lost, under Labour, to post offices and local people in Wales?</p>

More than 213,000 extra patients have been seen in Welsh hospitals since we came to power. Waiting times have plummeted since 1997: in the past year, only 30 patients in Wales waited more than 12 months for treatment&mdash;a massive cut of nearly 14,500. The aim is that, by March next year, no patient will have to wait more than eight months. By the end of December 2009, the maximum total wait, from GP referral to receiving treatment, will be 26 weeks. That is a massive improvement, and the hon. Gentleman ought to welcome it.</p>

	<p pid="c.239.6/1">I fully agree with my hon. Friend. When we came to power, people who needed orthopaedic operations, such as ex-miners and so on, had to wait years and years. That was what we inherited, but our investment in and reform of the health service in Wales have caused those figures to plummet. Moreover, since we came to power, we have been able to recruit 450 more consultants and more than 7,300 more qualified nurses in Wales. That is another sign that Labour invests in the NHS, and that the health service in Wales will be safe only under Labour.</p>

	<p pid="c.241.6/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that response. I welcome the Government White Paper, which is building a consensus for pensioners for the future. At present, many pensioners throughout Wales, including in my constituency, benefit considerably from the pension credit. Will he ensure that, during the transition period to the earnings link, pensioners on pension credit do not lose out; and will he further urge the Department for Work and Pensions to campaign vigorously so that there is a greater take-up of pension credits throughout Wales by our neediest pensioners?</p>

	<p pid="c.241.7/1">We will certainly do that. Indeed, the pension credit has been of enormous benefit to pensioners in Wales and, in particular, to some of the poorest pensioners in Blaenau Gwent, where 4,760 of them have benefited from it. The people of Blaenau Gwent and Wales as a whole need to be told by the Leader of the Opposition whether he will maintain his policy of abolishing the pension credit system.</p>

	<p pid="c.243.2/1">With the greatest respect to the right hon. Gentleman, let me point out to him what tax credits have enabled us to do. We have 2 million more people at work in this country. That is in part not just because of the minimum wage, which he opposed, but because of the working families tax credit, which makes work pay for people. As a result of the children's tax credit, we have been able to give help to millions of families in this country. Those families were let down by the Tory years of boom-and-bust economics, high unemployment and poverty, which was why we made the change, and we are proud of it.</p>

Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that Ministers should not just blame officials when things go wrong. I agree with that. But is not the Chancellor's behaviour typical of this Government? Ministers create a massive bureaucracy that becomes a painful paper chase for hard-working families, so why do they refuse to take responsibility when it all goes wrong?</p>

	<p pid="c.243.4/1">The right hon.

There were families with kids living in poverty, and nothing was done about it. Yes, it is true&mdash;tax credits have helped millions of families in this country. The problems that are there will be dealt with. We are glad that under this Government families have not just a stable economy, but a Government who back children and families, and help them out of poverty into work and into a decent standard of living.</p>

	<p pid="c.244.1/1">Of course we will give full weight to that. That is one of the reasons why we have reduced discharges considerably over the past few years. However, I must tell my hon. Friend that this is not about an expansion of nuclear power. The fact is that over the next 15 or 20 years we will lose that 20 per cent. of our electricity presently generated by nuclear power. It is in the interests of people in Northern Ireland and in the whole of the United Kingdom that we have secure supplies of energy for the future. Therefore, we need a balanced energy policy. A major component of that will be additional renewable energy and a big push on energy efficiency. My own view is that we need a mix of all these things if we are to safeguard the future of the country.</p>

	<p pid="c.246.0/1">Fatal stabbings have increased by almost a fifth in the past eight years, and now represent a third of all recorded killings. Six months ago, the Labour party voted against our proposal to increase the sentence for carrying a knife. Will the Prime Minister confirm that he will support a tougher sentence, and will he tell us when it will be introduced in the House?</p>

	<p pid="c.246.1/1">As I think the Home Secretary has made clear, we will look carefully at the issue of whether we need to toughen the minimum standard for sentences for individuals who are in illegal possession of a knife. As my right hon. Friend explained when this was debated, there are issues about whether it is possible to do this in a sensible way, but I totally agree that knife crime is extremely serious. That is why we have extended the types of knives banned under the legislation, and why we have made sure&mdash;for example, in sentencing guidelines&mdash;that sentences are tough for individuals who carry knives.</p>

	<p pid="c.246.3/1">A lot has happened&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> May I just explain what has happened? Following the introduction of the legislation, if a knife is listed as an offensive weapon, the maximum penalty for carrying it is four years. Since 1997 we have added stealth knives, disguised knives and batons to the offensive weapons list. We are raising the minimum age at which someone can buy a knife from 16 to 18. There is a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon, and there are extra powers, along with extra resources, for head teachers to search pupils for weapons. In addition, there was a national knife amnesty a short time ago. I will look at whether we need to increase minimum sentences. As I said, the issues were explained in detail when the matter was last debated, but in principle, we want to make sure that anybody who is found in illegal possession of a knife is subject to the toughest penalties possible. May I point out to the House that in respect of firearms, we introduced a mandatory minimum five-year sentence, which is now in operation?</p>

	<p pid="c.251.1/1">As my hon. Friend has said, it is important that we tackle the remaining areas of unemployment in our country, and inner-city regeneration is one way of doing so. In our view&mdash;this is a major point of difference with the Conservative party&mdash;we should expand and extend the new deal for the unemployed, rather than closing it down, which the Conservative party would do. If we want to tackle unemployment, the new deal for communities and the new deal for the unemployed should be deepened and strengthened and should not be cut back. I will certainly consider my hon.

	<p pid="c.252.2/1">My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the problems of antisocial behaviour. As a result of the new powers, drug dealers' homes can be shut down and people can be evicted from them, and antisocial behaviour orders and dispersal orders have a real effect in many communities. However, we are looking to see how we can strengthen this still further. We particularly want to ensure that those who are evicted and then receive new tenancies do so under the strictest possible conditions and restraint, and that we have a system to ensure that where people move across different areas there is some sharing of the available information. Antisocial behaviour is still a huge issue for people in very many communities, but the new powers and resources are making a real difference where they are being applied. I make it clear again that if the police and local authorities want even further powers to deal with it, we shall give them those powers.</p>

	NHS Performance

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.253.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" speakername="Patricia Hewitt" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="253"  time="012:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0003.htm#06060754001548">
	<p pid="c.253.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about the NHS chief executive's report and NHS finances for 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/2">Sir Ian Carruthers, acting chief executive of the NHS, today publishes his first report on the performance of the NHS, including the provisional financial out-turn for the last financial year. A copy has been placed in the Library, together with a more detailed report on the finances from the Department's director of finance, Richard Douglas. This information also forms part of the Government's evidence to the Select Committee on Health, which is conducting an inquiry into these matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/3">I should like to begin by reminding the House of the context. Following decades of growth averaging around 3.1 per cent. a year, since 1997 the NHS has received annual average growth in funding of 6.4 per cent. The NHS budget, which has already doubled compared with 1997, will have trebled by 2008. That unprecedented investment has enabled the NHS to employ an additional 307,000 staff, including 85,000 more nurses. I am sure the whole House will want to express our thanks to all NHS staff for their outstanding dedication and hard work. With that investment has come reform, giving patients more choice for elective operations, using the independent sector to add to the capacity and innovation of the NHS, and establishing NHS foundation trusts with more freedom to respond to local people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/4">Sir Ian's report shows that NHS staff are continuing to improve patient care. Waiting times are continuing to fall. Virtually no-one now waits more than six months for an operation, compared with 270,000 patients who were waiting more than six months for an operation in 2000. The majority are treated much more quickly&mdash;the average wait for an operation is around just seven and a half weeks. There is now a maximum 13-week wait for an out-patient appointment. Again, the average wait is much shorter, with four out of five people getting their first out-patient appointment within eight weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/5">Nearly 99 per cent. of people with cancer are treated within a maximum of 31 days of diagnosis, and more than 91 per cent. are treated within 62 days of an urgent referral from their GP, compared with only 75 per cent. one year ago. Early deaths from coronary heart disease, cancer and suicide continue to fall. Patient care is improving everywhere but some parts of the country face significant financial problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/6">The provisional unaudited figures for 2005-06 show a net overspend across the NHS, excluding foundation trusts, of &pound;512 million. That is made up of a gross deficit of &pound;1.27 billion, offset by surpluses of &pound;765 million. Although we clearly cannot allow that position to continue, we also need to put it into perspective. The net deficit in the NHS is less than 1 per cent. of the NHS revenue budget and is concentrated in a minority of organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/7">Seven out of 10 hospitals and other NHS organisations are not only improving patient care, employing more staff and paying them better than ever, but doing so within their budget. Two out of 10 have relatively small levels of overspending and only one in 10 NHS hospitals and other organisations account for more than two thirds of the overspending.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/8">My decision to publish those unaudited financial figures, together with the director of finance's report to me, reflects our commitment to greater transparency in the NHS. In future, we will publish quarterly reports on NHS finances.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/9">In the past, because the focus was largely on the overall financial position of the NHS, overspending organisations had little incentive to improve their performance but relied on other parts of the service to bail them out. The system was unfair because most of the overspending occurred in better-off areas with a generally healthier population and most of the underspending was in places with far greater health needs and health inequalities. We are not prepared to allow that unfairness to continue.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/10">By the end of the financial year, we will return the NHS as a whole to financial balance. The turnaround teams that I announced to the House in January are helping organisations with the biggest financial problems to implement recovery plans that will allow them to maintain and improve patient care within their budgets. As most of the NHS demonstrates, and Sir Ian confirms in his report, there should be no trade-off between improving patient care and sound financial management. They go together.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/11">We are aiming for all organisations with deficits to reach monthly balance of income and expenditure by the beginning of April next year. However, there will be some exceptional cases when an organisation needs longer to make the necessary changes while maintaining patient care. However, because overspending in one organisation has to be balanced by underspending elsewhere, we will continue to challenge and expect that minority of organisations to return to monthly balance as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/12">We have also asked the new strategic health authorities to establish a regional reserve that will support organisations while they return to balance. That means asking primary care trusts that have stayed within their budget or delivered a surplus to contribute some of their growth money, which averages 9.2 per cent., in the current year and to postpone some of the improvements that they were planning to make for their patients. However, that money will not be lost to those communities. It will be repaid, normally in the three-year allocations period. I have stressed to the health authorities that the areas with the greatest health needs should be repaid first.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/13">There will be difficult decisions to make, especially in the minority of trusts with substantial deficits. In some cases, that will mean work force reductions and we all understand the anxiety and uncertainty that that causes for staff who have dedicated their lives to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/14">However, there will not be the wholesale redundancies across the NHS that some commentators have forecast. In most cases, as Sir Ian stresses, work force reductions will be achieved by natural turnover, reduced spending on expensive agency staff, redeploying staff and freezing some posts. Compulsory redundancies will be kept to an absolute minimum and those affected will, of course, be given as much support as possible to find a new post.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.1/15">The NHS is treating more patients and saving more people's lives than ever before. Of course there is still more to do to meet the public's rising expectations, as people are living longer and a revolution is taking place in medical care and scientific knowledge. But Sir lan's report today shows that the NHS is on the right track, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.255.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" speakername="Andrew Lansley" colnum="255"  time="012:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0004.htm#06060754001549">
	<p pid="c.255.0/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving me the opportunity to see her statement and the financial performance report 40 minutes ago. After her excursion into a parallel universe, it is about time we came back down to earth. She has come to the House today to admit that, for the fourth year in a row under this Government, the financial situation in the national health service is deteriorating, and that the deficit is a great deal larger than in the previous year. She says that there was a net deficit of &pound;512 million in the last financial year. On a like-for-like basis, it was &pound;216 million in the previous financial year, so it is now more than two and a half times greater.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.0/2">The Secretary of State's policy has failed, but of course it is the civil servants and the managers in the NHS who will get the blame. Trusts will be singled out and told that they are responsible for the deficit. Sir Nigel Crisp resigned in March. If everything was going so well in March, I wonder why the chief executive of the NHS had to leave in those circumstances. Since then, there has been an exodus from the Department of Health, with people either jumping or being ejected from the sinking ship. Many of them have rightly said that the NHS is suffering from the void of leadership in the rudderless Department of Health. The growing gap between the hard-working staff in the NHS and the leadership that ought to be coming from the Department of Health is causing a crisis of confidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.0/3">The Secretary of State's statement purported to give us financial information about the past year. She gave us the unaudited figures, and mentioned a sum of &pound;512 million. Did she go on to tell us that the unaudited figures last year were out by 80 per cent. compared with the audited figures? The audited figures were &pound;112 million higher than the unaudited figures. We do not yet know what this year's audited figures are going to be.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.0/4">The Secretary of State told us that the gross deficit was &pound;1.27 billion. That is about 1.5 per cent. of the total NHS allocations. She then said that that was being offset by surpluses. Well, yes indeed&mdash;there are &pound;760 million of surpluses. But she did not tell the House that more than &pound;500 million of those surpluses have been generated by the strategic health authorities. That means that they have cut their budgets, and they are planning to do so again this year. Most of those cuts will involve training budgets, which will mean fewer posts for doctors and nurses coming into the profession seeking to pursue their vocation. If there is a 10 per cent. cut in training budgets this year&mdash;as postgraduate deans across the country expect&mdash;that will affect 4,000 training posts for doctors. In Stoke yesterday, a lecturer in nursing at Keele university told me that&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="c.256.1/1">That lecturer told me that 120 student nurses who are finishing her course at Keele university will not find jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.1/2">Did the Secretary of State mention that deficit switching has led to cuts in mental health services that have been deplored by her own national clinical director? Actually, she did not say anything at all about mental health services. She talked about the reductions in waiting times, but did she mention the waiting times for diagnosis? Her own figures, to which she did not admit, now show that waiting times&mdash;including waits for diagnosis&mdash;can be up to four years for trauma and orthopaedics.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.1/3">Did the Secretary of State admit that, but for the strategic health authorities cutting their budgets, the deficits would be more than &pound;1 billon&mdash;precisely the amount that we predicted last November? In December, the Secretary of State told the Health Committee that the deficit would be managed down to &pound;200 million across the NHS by the end of the financial year. Actually, she said &pound;250 million, but she had to be corrected by her officials because she did not have the figure in her head. However, the deficit has not been managed down to &pound;200 million. It is now two and a half times greater than the figure to which the Secretary of State committed herself in front of the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.1/4">Did the Secretary of State come here with any apology? No, she did not. Did she come here with any clarification of what will happen this year? No. There may be a chief executive listening to this out there. Are chief executives required to achieve balance over the whole of the current financial year? We do not know. Are they required instead to achieve what the Department is now calling&mdash;we shall hear this term again&mdash;&quot;run-rate&quot; balance, which means balancing monthly income and expenditure in the last month of the financial year? That is a very different discipline. Perhaps they are expected to achieve such a balance; perhaps they are not. Are they required in all cases to recover earlier deficits? We simply do not know.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.1/5">The Secretary of State is promising that by the end of this financial year the NHS will have returned to financial balance. Will she tell the House that if by the end of this financial year the NHS is recording a further net system-wide deficit, she will resign?</p>
	<p pid="c.256.1/6">Yesterday the Prime Minister told the public service to speed up reform, but it is the mismanagement of reform that is holding the NHS back. Public servants want to deliver better services continuously, year by year&mdash;of course they do&mdash;but they cannot do that under a Government who have let them down. It is policy that is failing. It is not only consultants in the British Medical Association who are saying that. We have a Government who fail to allocate resources in line with the real burden of disease and demand across the country, with the result that some health economies are going into serious deficit.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.1/7">The Government grossly miscalculated the cost of new contracts, and failed to link those contracts to productivity or reform. They are spending billions on the NHS IT programme, but it is over two years late and is not delivering the system that the NHS wants. Last year the Government imposed central targets&mdash;the Secretary of State did not mention them&mdash;which cost hundreds of millions, distorted clinical priorities, and caused some of the deficits. The Secretary of State talked of 300,000 extra staff for the NHS, but she did not tell us that 106,000 of them were administrators. She has doubled the number of managers, and financial management in the NHS is clearly woefully lacking.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.1/8">This is a Government who have let the NHS down. Policy failures and mismanagement have left the NHS in serious and growing deficit. Hard-working front-line NHS staff deliver good, indeed excellent, care to patients, but they complain bitterly&mdash;and with justification&mdash;that that is not because of the Government, but in spite of them. They want to be free of damaging interference by Labour Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="c.257.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.2/2">Not only did the hon. Gentleman fail to mention the improvements in care for patients; he was clearly very disappointed that the deficit was not higher&mdash;that it had not reached the levels that he had predicted. In fact, it is lower than the forecast figure that we published at the half-year point.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.2/3">The hon. Gentleman asked specifically about surpluses in the strategic health authorities. Many of those surpluses come directly from primary care trusts and other NHS trusts; but instead of being transferred directly to the accounts of overspending organisations, where in the past they have served to conceal the real problem of overspending, they have been held in strategic health authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.2/4">The hon. Gentleman said that newly qualified nurses and other staff were finding it difficult to obtain jobs. Of course, with more staff in the NHS than ever before&mdash;85,000 more nurses alone&mdash;it is more difficult for newly qualified nurses to find jobs than it was in the days when it was scarcely possible to find nurses to fill the vacancies that so desperately needed to be filled. What we are doing in response is ensuring that much more effort is made throughout the country to match our newly qualified staff to the vacancies that exist for every kind of staff in some parts of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.2/5">Let me make it clear once again that I am determined that the NHS as a whole will be back in financial balance by the end of March next year. Of course, as Health Secretary I will be accountable to the House and the public for achieving that goal. We have said that we expect individual organisations to sort out their problems and achieve monthly financial balance as quickly as possible. A small number of them&mdash;largely those that have been overspending for several years and have large accumulated deficits&mdash;will not even be able to get to monthly financial balance by the end of next year. However, as I said, we will go on helping them to make the difficult but essential changes so that they get back into balance and deliver the best possible care within their budgets without expecting other parts of the NHS and other patients to bail them out.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.2/6">My final point is that the hon. Gentleman needs to decide whether he wants the NHS to deliver the best value possible for the money&mdash;the increased money that he and Opposition Members voted against&mdash;that the public have put in. Does he really think that poorer areas, which typically are those that have been underspending, should go on bailing out better-off areas that have been overspending? Does he agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>, who wrote to the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="">18 May</phrase> asking for the deficit in Oxfordshire&mdash;one of the overspenders&mdash;to be wiped out? Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that in that area funding has risen by more than &pound;38 million in the past three years? Does he recognise that it will increase again by more than &pound;36 million in the next two years? Does he believe that south-west Oxfordshire, to take one example, which has 64 GPs per 100,000 population, should be given money from, for instance, Sedgefield, with 52 GPs per 100,000 population? Does he really believe that money should be taken from the poor to bail out the overspenders, or does he, like us, believe in fair funding across the NHS, and the best care and value for money everywhere?</p>

	<p pid="c.258.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for her statement. Will she confirm that she just told the House that the NHS deficit has doubled in the past year? Will she confirm that one in three trusts are in deficit and that one in 10 are in serious deficit, which is more than last year? Will she confirm that the scale of the deficits is so much that the deficit trusts between them have run up a deficit in excess of &pound;1 billion, which they will have to sort out, including paying back any assistance that they get from other trusts? The Secretary of State gave figures excluding foundation trusts. What are the figures including foundation trusts?</p>
	<p pid="c.258.0/2">Who is responsible for the financial crisis? If the Government set the pay rate for GPs, doctors and consultants, set &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; and NHS staff rates, set the tariff for how much trusts get and set all the targets, is it someone else's fault or is it the Government's fault if the sums do not add up? Will the Secretary of State take responsibility for the deficit in the NHS? How much of it is due to Department of Health mistakes, creating bodies that get abolished a few years later and negotiating contracts that result in overspending&mdash;the GP contract and the consultant contract? Is that her fault or someone else's fault? Can we believe her when she says that the NHS will be in balance at the end of the year when Sir Nigel Crisp said in December that the deficit this year would only be &pound;200 million and then, just a few months later, she told us that it would be two and a half times as big? Why should we believe her when she says that she will get the deficit under control this time around?</p>
	<p pid="c.258.0/3">The surpluses in the NHS are in different places to the deficits, so the gross deficit of &pound;1.2 billion is huge. Is not it the case that it takes incredible mismanagement to spend record sums of money on the NHS and to come to the House admitting the worst deficits in years? How has the Secretary of State achieved that? How did she manage to do that?</p>
	<p pid="c.258.0/4">Is not it the case that what is going on is breakneck NHS reform, because the Prime Minister said that he will not go until the NHS is sorted out? How quickly will it be sorted out? Is not it the case that what we are getting is not measured organisational change, with long-term planning and rational reorganisation, but emergency cuts packages to deal with a short-term financial crisis? Does the Secretary of State accept that that is no way to run the NHS?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.259.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" speakername="Patricia Hewitt" colnum="259"  time="012:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0004.htm#06060754001556">
	<p pid="c.259.0/1">I have already given the specific answers to the questions that the hon. Gentleman asked initially. I have made it clear, and I shall make it clear again: seven out of 10 NHS organisations are in balance or delivering a surplus. Two out of 10 have a relatively small deficit, which is quite manageable. One out of 10 organisations, many of which have been overspending for several years, have serious financial problems. The financial figures for the foundation trusts were published earlier this week by Monitor. Their overall deficit is &pound;24 million, making an overall deficit of &pound;536 million, which is still significantly less than 1 per cent. of the overall NHS budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/2">If the cause of the deficits was pay rises for staff or targets for better care for patients, there would be deficits everywhere, and there are not. The majority of trusts in the NHS are employing more staff and paying them better, treating more patients faster than ever before, and saving more people's lives&mdash;and they are doing it within their budgets. It is entirely reasonable&mdash;I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman does not support this&mdash;to say that the NHS should be doing that everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/3">I am proud of the fact that we are paying our staff better than ever before. I am sure that they will note with interest that the Liberal Democrats are not so keen on that. It is perfectly true that the GP contract cost more than we and the British Medical Association initially anticipated. There is a very good reason for that: it is a performance-related contract and the GPs have delivered more and better care than we and the BMA expected. The additional costs in the GP contracts&mdash;somewhat below &pound;300 million&mdash;have delivered better care for patients. Indeed, thousands of people are alive today as a direct result of that GP contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/4">I stress&mdash;I tried to make this point earlier&mdash;that in the past the financial reporting systems within the NHS had the effect of concealing persistent overspending in a minority of organisations. In some cases, the underlying financial problems were wholly unclear even to the organisations themselves. We have stopped that. As a result of the changes and reforms that we are making, we have much greater transparency right across the NHS as we give patients more choice, as money follows the patients, and as hospitals, particularly foundation trusts, have greater freedom to respond to what patients need while taking responsibility for their performance and for delivering the best possible patient care within those increased budgets. In other words, our reforms are helping to reveal the problems and to deal with them, rather than causing them.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/5">As Health Secretary, I take responsibility for the NHS, for getting the policy framework right, and for ensuring that we have got the right support within the Department of Health to make sure that our front-line staff go on doing a superb job for patients. I regret that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the hon. Gentleman, like the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, failed once again to acknowledge all the improvements taking place in the NHS for patients.</p>

	<p pid="c.260.0/1">Does my right hon.

	<p pid="c.261.2/1">Brokerage was clearly the drug to which the NHS should never have become addicted. Anyone who has run a large public organisation will recognise the need to drive out overspends on a continuing basis. Where trusts still have to recover debts and the financial recovery plans that protect patient services take perhaps two years, rather than one, to take effect, will the fund that the Secretary of State hopes that strategic health authorities will hold enable trusts&mdash;where such a fund is available&mdash;to deliver over the longer term, rather than the shorter term?</p>

	<p pid="c.261.3/1">Yes, but as I stressed earlier we want that to happen only in exceptional cases and for the reason that I gave, which is that, where an organisation is taking longer to return to balance, another organisation will have to underspend and thereby postpone improvements that they want and need to make for their own patients.</p>

	<p pid="c.261.4/1">Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospitals NHS Trust is entering a year of great change, in which services and patients will have to be transferred from two old hospitals to one new one. That in itself is an enormous management challenge and has cost implications. Does the Secretary of State agree that it is almost too much to ask the trust to achieve that and to recover its budget deficit in one year? Will she seriously consider allowing the trust to recover its budget deficit over two years, or even three, in order to protect services to the public?</p>

I have no doubt that the point that she makes is also being made by many hospitals that have been overspending. The chief executive and chair of her local hospital will of course be discussing this matter with the London strategic authority, which has a reserve power; it has the discretion&mdash;but only in exceptional circumstances&mdash;to allow longer for that recovery to take place.</p>

I ask her to continue to take a keen interest in our efforts to move the north Staffordshire health economy out of deficit, which will take longer than the time that the Government are allocating.

	<p pid="c.262.1/1">Let me explain one of the reasons why there is such a problem with finances in West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which is in my constituency. Sedgefield, for instance, gets &pound;1,210 per head, whereas last year in Hemel Hempstead, Dacorum primary care trust received &pound;960 per head. There is a clear problem across the country in this regard. On Monday night, the health trust announced, in essence, the closure of Hemel Hempstead hospital, as it is facing &pound;450 million-worth of debts. My constituents will be astonished at the complacent and patronising way in which the Secretary of State has addressed this problem. Their hospital, which was built for their community, is to close.</p>

	<p pid="c.262.2/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, the deficit and overspending problems not only in Hemel Hempstead but across Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire are extremely serious. They have to be tackled, and there has been lengthy debate and full consultation on the changes that are needed in respect of different hospitals in that area. He talked about funding, but I should point out that in his constituency there are 65 general practitioners per 100,000 population, which is significantly more than the average and significantly more than in a constituency such as Sedgefield. I am sure that the entire House and the public will be interested to hear that what the hon. Gentleman is asking for is less money for areas such as Sedgefield, which have far greater health needs, and more money for his area. However, his area has already received enormous increases in its NHS budget, and, on average, it has a healthier and wealthier population than the areas from which he would seek to take money.</p>

If Peugeot had been able to produce the same results, its workers would still be at work, and if the National Coal Board had been able to produce those results, there would be 200 or 300 pits open today. The truth is that this is nothing other than a success story for people like me and the 30 others who had open-heart surgery. But the BBC, which joined with the Tories, refused to come to Brompton hospital and do a success story about the 30-odd people who had open-heart surgery and managed to survive.</p>

However, if we look at the audited accounts for 2004-05, we see that the audited account deficit was almost twice as much as the unaudited deficit. In light of what has happened in the last year, what credence can we give to these figures, which are unaudited, and how much trust can we have in financial management in some parts of the NHS?</p>

The hon. Gentleman is quite right: last year saw a significant shift between the unaudited figures and the audited accounts. Obviously, we do not yet know what the audited accounts will show this year, but for several months the finance and turnaround teams have been crawling over the accounts of the organisations with the biggest financial problems, which has revealed problems that had not been acknowledged or discovered at the point of the mid-year accounts.</p>

Will the Secretary of State inform the House who is responsible for that?

	<p pid="c.264.1/1">There are different specific reasons for the deficits that have arisen in a minority of organisations&mdash;there is no single cause. If it were the targets or the pay rises, the deficits would arise everywhere, which is not the case. The Royal Cornwall hospital and the health community there must look into the same issues as other parts of the NHS are having to look into. For instance, are they doing enough day case surgery? Are they doing enough in the community to reduce the number of emergency admissions? Are they carrying out all the proven measures that are being used in other parts of the NHS to deliver better care to patients, with better value for money? The hon. Gentleman mentioned the funding formula, which we have made fairer. It now takes account of issues such as the demands of a rural economy, the proportion of elderly people living within the community and, above all, social and economic deprivation. That is why, over this year and the next, the poorest areas with the biggest health needs that are furthest from their target funding will get the biggest increases. I think that that is fair, and I regret the fact that the Opposition parties do not agree.</p>

Friend's to help manage the deficit in a different part of the north-west will be repaid, and it should be repaid to areas with the biggest health problems and the poorest populations before it is paid to others.</p>

	<p pid="c.265.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for acknowledging the superb work that is being done. He reflects the fact that an enormous amount of change is and has been going on in the NHS for some years, and of course that is enormously demanding for staff. The reason that change is continuing is, first, because it is working. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would, like me, welcome the fact that the latest survey of patients showed that 90 per cent. believed that their NHS care was good, very good or excellent&mdash;the highest-ever level of patient satisfaction. That places demands on staff and we have to continue to change within the NHS in order to meet all the challenges of which the hon. Gentleman is so well aware, including the need to release resources for the new drugs and treatments that are becoming available, which patients quite rightly want to receive as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.265.2/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that it would be unacceptable if deficits created a new postcode lottery whereby patients from one area had to wait longer for treatment than patients in a neighbouring area? Selby and York primary care trust has the worst deficit by far in the north of England. If it had been required to balance its books in a single year, it would have had to cut spending by more than 15 per cent., which would have had devastating consequences for patient care. I welcome my right hon. Friend's decision that some PCTs with the worst deficits will have longer than a single year to balance their books, but would she be prepared to meet me and senior health leaders from York and Selby to discuss the recovery strategy and reassure herself that she is not imposing conditions that would lead to an unacceptable postcode lottery?</p>

	<p pid="c.265.4/1">I welcome the increased investment in the NHS, but is not the introduction of practice-based commissioning, payment by results, patient choice, the merger of the primary care trusts, the abolition of the strategic health authorities, the roll-out of foundation trusts and the introduction of a new IT system simply imposing too much change at the same time?

I know from my own city of Leicester that people have felt for some time that it was wrong and unnecessary to have two PCTs when one PCT, coterminous with social services, could do even better than the existing organisations. I believe that those changes were necessary. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned practice-based commissioning, and I am delighted that already a number of GP practices are signing up to it. That work will continue because it provides a way of ensuring that we can deliver better care more conveniently for patients and closer to home. We want to provide better care and better value for money as well.</p>

	<p pid="c.266.1/1">My right hon. Friend will be aware that South Birmingham primary care trust is one of the better-managed PCTs that has kept to budget and contributed to improvements in patient care. Indeed, some of the local hospitals, such as University hospital, also have a good financial record. Although they and I understand the logic behind the reserve and the fact that they will need to contribute to it, does she understand that they need some more reassurance that, while the much-needed improvements that they have planned may be delayed somewhat, they need to come on stream, so that their health needs and the needs of those communities, which are often uneven but nevertheless very severe, will be addressed and so that they will not have to wait an unreasonable time for that to happen?</p>

	<p pid="c.266.2/1">I can certainly give my hon. Friend that reassurance. One of the reasons I am being so tough on the overspending organisations is that I am not prepared to allow the areas with the greatest health needs, such as his constituency, to go on bailing out overspending in areas that often have more NHS services than those poorer areas. I know that he and his constituents very much welcome the recent announcement that University Hospital Birmingham Trust will have a badly needed new hospital, which will enable it to go on improving the care that it offers to the people of Birmingham and the west midlands.</p>

Although she tried to diminish the importance of that figure by making excuses, the reality is that 30 per cent. of NHS organisations are in deficit, the impact of which is felt by thousands and thousands of people who receive less treatment than they would otherwise. It is regrettable that the Secretary of State cannot bring herself to admit that failure under her stewardship, but it is worse still that she cannot bring herself to apologise to those thousands and thousands of people. I invite her to review the position and to consider apologising to the thousands of people who are suffering.</p>

Waveney primary care trust has a small but manageable deficit. We are delighted that we are about to be merged with Great Yarmouth PCT. I thank my right hon. Friend for that decision. The Great Yarmouth PCT has no deficit, but the strategic health authority is requiring it to loan about &pound;3 million to other trusts. Will she guarantee that we will get that money back? Can we be in the first group of trusts to get it back, bearing in mind our levels of deprivation and health inequality?</p>

The James Paget hospital has achieved some outstanding innovations in the organisation of its surgeries. That is one of the reasons why it is performing so well. He refers to the reserves and the contribution that his PCT is making towards them. Of course, as I indicated earlier, those in his health community will have the ability to spend restored to them. That will be done as quickly as possible, and I have made it clear to the SHA that the areas in the greatest need should get their money back first.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.0/1">My constituency has never had a higher level of health care than we have at present. That is partly due to the funding coming from the Government, but is mainly due to the dedication and professionalism of the staff. However, what would the Secretary of State advise me to tell my constituents who are seeing a ward close&mdash;not as the result of inefficiency; the hospital is run effectively&mdash;while the salaries of the foundation trust's chairman and board members are being doubled? Right across the country, every foundation trust's non-executive members' salaries will double. Sometimes, those people are earning more than &pound;50,000. How can we justify sacking nurses and closing wards when we are paying unelected people those huge salaries? What added value do they bring to the system? Will she look radically at their work?</p>

	<p pid="c.268.1/1">Board members' salaries are entirely a matter for foundation trusts. The hon. Gentleman's foundation trust, like others, will have local members and a local governance arrangement, and it is up to the members and the governing council to decide what those salaries should be. He refers to ward closures. There are many reasons why a hospital might want to reorganise wards. It might need and want to reduce the number of beds. For instance, if it is doing more day case surgery or if it is bringing people in for an operation on the morning that it takes place rather than the day before, that is better for patients, but it has the effect that fewer beds are required and therefore resources can be released for use on other improvements in care for other patients. I thought that he would welcome that, as well as the strong leadership that is provided by those on the good board of any well-performing organisation, rather than criticising them in the shallow way that he did.</p>

	<p pid="c.273.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to align cigarette manufacturing standards with international best practice so as to reduce the number of fires and fatalities in the home caused by cigarettes.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/3">This Bill would require that tobacco firms modify their cigarettes so that they have a reduced ignition propensity. Essentially, that means that such cigarettes go out if left without being drawn on for more than a few seconds. The House is of course well aware of the toll of premature death and disease caused by smoking. As a result of recent debates, if nothing else, we are also now well informed about the damage that breathing in other people's smoke can do to one's health. However, there is a third element of the misery caused by smoking that is perhaps less well understood, and that is the number of deaths and injuries from fires started by cigarettes. I commend the Fire Brigades Union and Action on Smoking and Health for the work they have done to highlight the continuing risks associated with smouldering cigarettes.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/4">Despite some success with &quot;stub it out&quot; campaigns, the number of tragic and avoidable deaths in such domestic fires has proved hard to drive down. The Government report &quot;Fire Statistics for the United Kingdom&quot; shows that in 2004, 3,500 fires in dwellings were caused by smoking materials, not including cigarette lighters and matches, and a further 1,600 in other buildings. Over the previous 10 years, the number of such fires totalled more than 60,000. Fires in dwellings caused in that way resulted in 114 deaths in 2004 and 1,260 non-fatal casualties. Smokers' materials are the most frequent source of ignition causing accidental dwelling fire deaths, accounting for around a third of such deaths every year. The vast majority of those fires were caused by manufactured cigarettes.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/5">The victims of those fires are more likely to be from low-income households and of course they include non-smokers as well as smokers, children as well as adults, and firefighters as well as members of the public, so this is no trivial matter. If the dry statistics are not enough, the human stories behind them are all too evident. For example, the <i> Edinburgh Evening News</i> of <phrase class="date" code="">16 May</phrase> this year reported on a fire that left a child aged less than 18 months with burns over almost half his body, requiring the amputation of two of his toes. It also left his family without a home. By great good fortune, and thanks to the presence of a smoke alarm, no lives were lost. Investigators believe that that fire, like so many others, was most likely to have been caused by smokers' materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/6">Tobacco manufacturers have long dismissed the link between cigarettes and fire deaths as &quot;merely a public perception&quot;, but for more than 20 years, as internal industry documents clearly show, the tobacco industry has known full well that many of those fires could be easily prevented. It argues that the introduction of cigarettes with a reduced propensity to ignite would lead to more negligent behaviour, but that is not a valid argument as the changes needed to the cigarette are slight and unlikely to be noticed by smokers. There are also many examples of safety standards being imposed on consumer products to protect public health without triggering dangerous or irrational behaviour, such as seatbelts and airbags in cars. If that argument were accepted, nothing would be accomplished by any attempt by the authorities to impose safety standards on consumer products. To avoid misleading descriptions, I suggest the use of the term &quot;reduced ignition propensity&quot;&mdash;as used in Canada&mdash;rather than &quot;fire safe&quot; or &quot;self-extinguishing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/7">In January 2000, the tobacco firm Philip Morris introduced a reduced ignition propensity cigarette into the market, using small speed bands on special paper, which ensured that the cigarette rapidly went out if not actively smoked. In August 2000, New York state passed fire safety regulations requiring that all cigarettes sold there had to meet reduced ignition standards by June 2003. Early figures suggest that that may have reduced the number of fire deaths from smoking materials across the state by at least a third. Similar standards now apply in Canada, and the regulatory impact assessment there forecasts a reduction in the number of fires caused by manufactured cigarettes of up to two thirds. In the US, Illinois and Vermont have already followed the example of New York.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/8">In this country, a fire research report done for the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimated that, had cigarettes in the UK conformed to the highest standards in New York, the number of fires caused by cigarettes would have fallen by nearly two thirds. The ODPM figures suggest that that would have meant 78 fewer deaths in 2003 alone.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/9">Such standards could be introduced across the European Union, under the general product safety directive. Indeed, the European Commission is believed to favour such a move. Therefore, I hope very much that we can now discount early rumours that officials at the Department of Trade and Industry might not support further progress on this issue, when the relevant Committee meets in Brussels on 13 and <phrase class="date" code="">14 June</phrase> next week. I understand and accept that the DTI rightly seeks to protect business from unnecessary regulation, but I do not accept that the bulging bank accounts of the tobacco industry really need such diligent defence by Government officials. Surely the experience of that child in Edinburgh and the thousands of other victims of fires caused by cigarettes merit a little consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/10">If DTI officials are really so worried, let me reassure them that reduced ignition standards could be introduced at minimal cost to business and without threatening sales. Many of us may say in relation to cigarettes that that is not something to be given undue priority in any event. I hope that, now this matter has been drawn to the attention of Ministers, they will instruct their officials to take a more constructive approach. However, this House does not need to wait for the cumbersome processes of the European Union and the internal workings of Whitehall Departments to bear fruit. My Bill would require this simple and overdue measure to be introduced in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/11">Smoking is a lawful activity in a free society, but it brings with it terrible problems and it is surely our job as legislators to ensure that they are minimised as far as possible. In this case, we could introduce reduced ignition standards without affecting anyone's freedom to any significant extent. The number of fires would be reduced. The number of deaths and serious injuries in fires would fall too, and insurance costs would fall with them. The Department of Health would be assisted in its hugely important aim of reducing health inequalities. The Department of Communities and Local Government would be helped to meet its equally crucial public service agreement target of cutting the number of deaths from fires in the home by a fifth by 2010. And fewer young children like the Edinburgh toddler would be exposed to horrific accidents and injuries.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/12">In my own county of Leicestershire, a 55-year-old Anstey man would still be alive today if this Bill had been on the statute book, as would a 70-year-old woman from Fleckney. Residents in Thringstone and Ravenstone, wards that I have represented at various stages in my local government career, would not have had some serious fires occur in their homes&mdash;so it is not surprising that the Bill is supported by firefighters who, all too often, have to risk their own safety to deal with fires caused by cigarettes. That is especially true for those in the Leicestershire fire service, whom I thank for their research into one element of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/13">In short, everyone would gain from my Bill&mdash;and even the tobacco industry would barely notice its effect. The recent historic votes in this House on the Health Bill show that there is overwhelming support for action to reduce the burden of death and disease caused by smoking. We must disregard the rather odd conclusion reached yesterday by the Economic Affairs Committee in the other place, which suggested that we should have legislated to prevent passive smoking in the home&mdash;how on earth would we do that?&mdash;instead of taking the historic step of eliminating it in workplaces and enclosed public spaces. I chair the all-party group on smoking and health, and I respectfully suggest that their lordships are somewhat detached from reality on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/14">I recently tabled early-day motion 2290, which draws attention to the hundreds of lives being lost in fires caused by smoking-related materials. I am gratified at the extent of support already shown by parliamentary colleagues for that motion.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/15">Where we cannot persuade people to quit smoking altogether, we can&mdash;and must&mdash;act to reduce the harm caused by that habit and addiction. My Bill is a simple and overdue measure that is designed to achieve precisely that. I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.277.4/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="c.277.4/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes the overpayment, fraud and incompetence in the administration of the tax credit system; is concerned about the impact of this incompetence on the most vulnerable members of society; and calls upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the author of the tax credit policy, to explain to this House what measures are being undertaken to address these problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.4/3">The incompetent administration of tax credits touches the constituents of every Member of this House. This debate could not be more timely: last week, the Inland Revenue revealed that almost half of the 6 million people in receipt of tax credits were paid the wrong amount. That is a staggering level of error, and an increase on the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.4/4">I welcome to the debate the Chairman of the main Treasury Select Committee, and his counterpart on the Treasury Sub-Committee. The Treasury Committee, of course, is made up of Members from all parties. Yesterday, it published a report identifying Government error as a key cause of the overpayments. In its briefing for this debate, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux reminds us that, four years after the introduction of tax credits, it continues to see</p>
	<p pid="c.277.4/5" class="indent">&quot;thousands of families who face hardship and genuine confusion as they have been told that they have been overpaid but given no explanation and no warning before payments are suddenly cut&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.4/6">Yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer still lacks the courage to defend a policy that he designed and implemented. We are told that he is at ECOFIN&mdash;the first such meeting that he has attended since December. Two days ago, he was planning to send the Paymaster General. We know that because we have the list of the week's events produced by No. 10 Downing street. It clearly states:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.4/7" class="indent">&quot;EU ECOFIN Council meets in Luxembourg &mdash; Paymaster General Dawn Primarolo attends.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.4/8">Then this debate was called and, for some reason, the Chancellor of the Exchequer changed his mind. Is it not strange how the right hon. Gentleman is always around to take the credit if things go well, but always happy to let others take the blame when things go wrong? Not once in the past year has he made a statement, taken part in a debate or even answered a question on tax credits. It is the policy that dares not speak its name, from a Chancellor who dares not open his mouth. Prime Ministers need many qualities, but political cowardice is not one of them.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.4/9">In the Chancellor's absence, we have the poor new Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He, at least, must know something about the chaos in the tax credits system as he happens to represent the constituency with the largest number of people who are overpaid and the largest number who are underpaid in the entire country. Half of all the hon. Gentleman's constituents in East Ham who claim tax credits receive the wrong amount from the Department that he helps to run.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.4/10">The Chief Secretary will undoubtedly tell us that the amount being overpaid across the country has fallen a little, to a mere &pound;1.7 billion. When he does so, perhaps he will confirm that the number of people being overpaid has risen, with almost 3 million people getting the wrong award. When he tells us that help is going to the poorest families, will he also confirm that more than 100,000 of the poorest families&mdash;those on incomes of less than &pound;5,000&mdash;did not receive the level of support to which they were entitled? When he tells us about what he has called in the past couple of days the &quot;improved performance&quot; of the tax credits system, will he explain why the number of people in his constituency being overpaid has doubled in a year? Why did NACAB tell me yesterday that there was no sign of a reduction in the number of families contacting it?</p>

They lie at the heart of whether the Chancellor's tax credit system, designed by the Economic Secretary, can ever be made to work in future. First, can the Chief Secretary confirm that the huge annual overpayments&mdash;almost &pound;4 billion in two years&mdash;are not the result of what the Paymaster General once dismissed as &quot;teething problems&quot;, but are now a permanent feature of the tax credit system? He admitted as much last week when he set out the latest emergency reforms to the way in which the credits operate. He said&mdash;this is a striking statement&mdash;that once the changes are</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/3" class="indent">&quot;fully implemented, we expect them to reduce overpayments in future years by around one third&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/4">So, even if the reforms work as well as he hopes&mdash;let us face it, nothing else that the Government have promised on tax credits has worked&mdash;two thirds of the overpayments will remain. Almost 2 million people a year will go on receiving the wrong tax credit payment and will face having the money clawed back off them, with all the hardship that we know that brings.</p>

	<p pid="c.280.0/1">As I understand it&mdash;there is an opportunity for the Chief Secretary to clarify this&mdash;the reduction of a third would occur if all the changes, both the reporting requirements and the increase in the disregard, were to take place. The increase in the earnings disregard simply reclassifies overpayments as disregarded income. That is one of the ways in which the Government are dealing with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/2">As I said, the Chief's Secretary's admission was extraordinary. As the Child Poverty Action Group reminded us last week:</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/3" class="indent">&quot;behind these figures are thousands of families struggling to survive when the overpayments are clawed back&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/4">Not that we need reminding&mdash;we see that every week in our constituency surgeries. A disabled young constituent of mine told me that she was</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/5" class="indent">&quot;at the point of despair&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/6">because of the clawback of tax credits that were rightfully hers. The chairman of the Inland Revenue wrote to me about the case earlier this year. He said:</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/7" class="indent">&quot;I am sorry to say that when we processed your constituent's claim we missed including her new income details&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/8">How can one possibly miss including the income details when one processes a tax credit claim? That reveals a deep flaw in the system.</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/9">The new changes announced by the Government include new obligations on claimants to fill in more forms and to file them more quickly&mdash;any bureaucracy's answer to any problem. Why do not the changes also include new obligations on the Treasury? The parliamentary ombudsman recommended a year ago that the Government introduce a statutory test for the recovery of overpayments that gives people a right to appeal to an independent tribunal when they think that the Revenue has got things wrong. That is the same test that exists for other benefits. The parliamentary ombudsman said that the test would</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/10" class="indent">&quot;strike the right balance between the obligations on the part of the administrators and those on the part of the recipients&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/11">NACAB says today that the test would</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/12" class="indent">&quot;build confidence in...the decisions being made&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.280.0/13">Why have the Government refused to introduce that statutory test? Why are they instead imposing new obligations on the recipients that are not matched by new obligations on the administrators?</p>

	<p pid="c.280.1/1">Surely the impenetrable complexity of the system is such that it is understood only by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if at all. Is it not distinctly shameful for him to have devised a system that is even more complicated than the Schleswig-Holstein question? At least three people understood that&mdash;even if one of them went mad, the second died and the third forgot what the answer to the question was.</p>

	<p pid="c.281.0/1">Believe it or not, I studied the Schleswig-Holstein question at university, but I am not going to go into it. My hon. Friend makes a telling point. It is a remarkable achievement of the Chancellor that he has made the tax affairs of the poorest almost as complex as the tax affairs of the richest.</p>

	<p pid="c.281.1/1">I was interested in what the hon. Gentleman said about the new forms. What good is there in changing forms if part of the problem is that the information does not seem to get on to the computer system in the first place? The people who return forms still end up with overpayments or the wrong payments because the information goes missing, does not get put on to the computer or the computer seems unable to recognise it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.281.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1868" speakername="George Osborne" colnum="281"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0007.htm#06060754001628">
	<p pid="c.281.2/1">That is one of the rare issues on which I agree with the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/2">The other question for the Government on overpayments is, why have they not implemented their own promise last year to pause before proceeding to recover an overpayment so that they can work out whether it is the Revenue that has made the mistake? Again, the parliamentary ombudsman recommended that approach. So, too, did NACAB. The Select Committee said in its report yesterday that that was</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/3" class="indent">&quot;crucial, in the interests of natural justice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/4">However, the Committee also said that it feared that the Government promise had been &quot;sidelined&quot;. Why have the Government reneged on that promise? Perhaps the Chief Secretary can explain.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/5">If multi-billion pound overpayments affecting millions of people are to be an annual feature of the tax credit system, the Government need to implement the changes needed to protect the rights of our most vulnerable families. That brings me to the second question&mdash;when will the ongoing fiasco of the computer system be resolved? Again, I recently dealt with a case in my constituency of a single parent who repeatedly tried to tell the Inland Revenue that she was being overpaid. She was ignored for months, only for her tax credits suddenly to be suspended altogether two weeks before Christmas. She wrote to me to say that she could not buy her two young children presents because she was struggling to provide them with even the basics. A month later, after Christmas, the Revenue wrote to me admitting that it had got the case wrong because of</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/6" class="indent">&quot;a technical fault we are experiencing with our computer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/7">That was this year. That was the same computer that the Paymaster General told the House a year ago was &quot;stable and performing...well&quot;. Does the Chief Secretary still think that the computer is stable and performing well? Will he repeat that phrase when he gets up to speak?</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/8">The Government amendment says that the IT problems affected only</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/9" class="indent">&quot;the early stages of implementation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/10">If Ministers really think that that is the case, I am afraid that they are living in a fantasy world. Certainly the Select Committee does not agree. It says in its report that IT error remains a &quot;significant&quot; cause of the tax credit mistakes. Do Ministers not realise what is going on in their own Department? The report goes on to talk about the Paymaster General's evidence. It states:</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/11" class="indent">&quot;The factors cited by the Paymaster General...as contributing to the problem of overpayments do not appear to give us a comprehensive account of the reasons why overpayments have arisen&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/12">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.281.2/13" class="indent">&quot;It is obvious to us that the Paymaster General's account makes no reference to causes which have arisen as a consequence of the Department's own processes&mdash;for example official error and IT error&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.282.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the position on information technology is even worse than he has set out? Is he aware that in my constituency I have a case in which a lady was overpaid repeatedly? She told the authority that that was happening and the reply was, &quot;Yes, we know, but the computer won't let us put it right.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.282.1/1">It is an extraordinary example&mdash;one of many. I suspect that every Member could produce similar examples of computer errors.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/2">The Government finally sacked EDS, the company that provided the computer, and announced triumphantly that the company would pay them compensation. However, as yesterday's Select Committee report shows, the deal done by Ministers means that&mdash;this is truly incredible&mdash;full compensation is paid only if EDS wins other Government contracts. In short, the company that Ministers believe is guilty of messing up the tax credit computer will pay full compensation to taxpayers only if it is given a chance to mess up another Government computer system. Only this Government could negotiate such an incompetent deal, and now they refuse to discuss the details of the deal on the ground of commercial confidentiality. The Select Committee is right&mdash;Ministers should be accountable for the mistakes that they make and subject to parliamentary scrutiny on the arrangements into which they enter on our behalf, instead of hiding behind commercial contracts.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/3">Of course, it is not only the computer that has cost the taxpayer millions of pounds, but fraud, which brings me to my third question&mdash;what is the true cost of tax credit fraud and what are the Government doing to tackle it? The Government refuse to tell us the true extent of tax credit fraud. According to the Paymaster General, there have been</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/4" class="indent">&quot;persistent attempts by organised criminals to obtain tax credits by using stolen or fictitious identities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/5">We know that the Government had to abandon their online application system six months ago after systematic abuse. We know, too, that although Ministers say that they are acting tough, there were just 211 prosecutions for tax credit fraud, with only two for organised tax credit fraud, out of 6.5 million applications. However, we do not know when Ministers knew for the first time that systematic fraud was taking place or how much money has been lost. Does the figure run into hundreds of millions of pounds, or even billions?</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/6">Ministers were warned about the possibility of fraud before the tax credit system was introduced. Why did the Chancellor ignore the series of security checks that was proposed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> when he was Minister for welfare reform? The right hon. Gentleman said earlier this year:</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/7" class="indent">&quot;After I resigned ... the counter-fraud measures were not carried out and now it shows in the figures&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/8">Why were those counter-fraud measures not carried out?</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/9">What about stopping fraud in the future? Surely the Select Committee is right when it warns that increasing the earnings disregard to &pound;25,000 creates an incentive for further fraud as people deliberately fluctuate their incomes from year to year, but the Government have done nothing to prevent that from happening. Will the Chief Secretary address that problem today, too?</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/10">The Paymaster General promised the House that the Treasury would provide</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/11" class="indent">&quot;more comprehensive information on the level of claimant error and fraud ... in spring 2006.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 551W.]</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/12">I know that winter has descended early on the Labour party and it is getting its seasons muddled up, but it is now June. Where is the information that we were promised for the spring?</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/13">For the second year running, ministerial incompetence and computer chaos have caused hardship for hundreds of thousands of people and cost the taxpayer billions of pounds, so I ask my final question&mdash;is it not time that the Government looked at the design of the tax credit system? The Government say that money has got to the poorest, but after spending more than &pound;15 billion a year, it would be extraordinary if it had not. However, that comes at a price. In <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the words of the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase>, a great friend of the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, in the Budget debate in the House:</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/14" class="indent">&quot;poverty has become more entrenched.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/15">The right hon. Gentleman said:</p>

	<p pid="c.284.2/1">There we go. The hon. Gentleman is one of the Chancellor's henchmen and a proponent of what was called the &quot;Kill Mil&quot; operation. No doubt he is getting to work on the Education Secretary as we speak.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.2/2">The right hon. Member for Darlington is not the only person who has criticised the operation of tax credits. As my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition pointed out during Prime Minister's questions, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead has said:</p>
	<p pid="c.284.2/3" class="indent">&quot;using tax credits as an anti-poverty weapon is like attempting keyhole surgery with a hacksaw&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.2/4">That is Labour's verdict on Labour's record.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.2/5">At question is not the existence of tax credits&mdash;we support tax credits, but want tax credits that work&mdash;but the system that the Chancellor chose of annual awards, annual income assessments, annual overpayments and annual clawbacks. That system means that almost half of all families get the wrong tax credit payment.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.2/6">Perhaps the Economic Secretary to the Treasury has not even read the parliamentary ombudsman's report, but if he did, he would see that she says that there is</p>
	<p pid="c.284.2/7" class="indent">&quot;the fundamental question as to whether, for people on modest incomes who have to budget and plan their finances carefully to manage their lives, such inbuilt instability or uncertainty really works.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.284.2/8">The Treasury Committee, in its first and perhaps most important recommendation, points to the new evidence that shows that the family incomes of many of the poorest have become more variable and unstable as a result of tax credits. That all-party Committee asks the Chancellor to consider fixing awards over shorter periods than a year, and I ask him again to do so. The time has come to give serious consideration to moving to a tax credit system that is based on shorter, more fixed payments, that brings greater certainty to family incomes and that avoids the hardship of overpayment.</p>

Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)</phrase> said, in introducing the report, that tax credits are right in principle. I agree. The report rightly drew attention to the wide support among non-Government organisations, such as Citizens Advice, for the tax credit system. It underlined the importance of improving the quality of service provided to tax credit claimants. I agree about that as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.285.3/3">It is a shame that the speech of the hon. Gentleman did not reflect very much of the now broad agreement on the gains from the tax credit system.

Today, 6 million people benefit from tax credits. Ninety three per cent. of families on incomes below &pound;10,000 claim their entitlement to child tax credit compared to the initial family credit take-up of just 57 per cent. under the Tories. In 1997-98, fewer than 2.5 million families with children paid no net tax. Under today's tax credit system, there are now 3 million families in that position.</p>

	<p pid="c.286.4/1">Undoubtedly the tax credit system has helped many people, but there are many families that suffer huge distress when they receive claims for large sums that they have no means of paying.

	<p pid="c.286.5/1">I shall set out the progress that we are making on that, because I think that it will be acknowledged that it has led to considerable improvements. Before I do so, I am grateful for acknowledgement of the benefits of the system, which I shall set out. First, tax credits have significantly improved incentives to work. In the past, far too many people found that they were better off on benefits than in a job. Tax credits have put that right. That is one of the reasons why so many more people are now in work and why the historic high rate of employment that we have achieved has been maintained for so long. Secondly, the tax credit system has reduced the tax burden on low to middle-income families. An OECD study, published in March, showed that, thanks to tax credits, net tax paid by a couple with one child living on the average manufacturing wage has fallen from more than 17 per cent. in 1997 to less than 10 per cent. now. That is a dramatic reduction in the tax burden for people who are benefiting greatly from the improvements that have been introduced.</p>

	<p pid="c.287.0/2" class="indent">&quot;I should like to point out that although initially the tax credit payments proved very useful, the situation created by your overpayment has caused me substantial hardship and increased stress.

	<p pid="c.287.1/1">I shall describe to the House the improvements that we have made. It is particularly interesting to note that take-up of tax credits has continued to rise.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.1/2">The most recent figures and data have confirmed that the third big gain has been that tax credits have helped to achieve a big reduction in child poverty&mdash;since 1997, the number of children growing up in poverty has fallen by 700,000. That is consistent with our aim of halving child poverty by 2010 and abolishing it by 2020. Tax credits have made a big contribution to that success.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.1/3">Of course, there have been problems with administration and with IT. It is right that the House should press for those problems to be fixed, and I want to report progress on that. I hope that the debate will reflect a new agreement across the House that tax credits are right in principle and that the focus now needs to be on how we can make the system more effective still. Conservative Members now say that they agree with that, and that is progress, but that is not reflected in the detail of their contributions to the debate. Tax credits are playing a key role in moving people into work, helping people move up the employment ladder while in work and ensuring that it pays to be in a job.</p>

	<p pid="c.287.3/1">The Conservative party was responsible for that. My hon. Friend is absolutely right that the Conservative party consistently opposed tax credits and consistently opposed the dramatic improvements that we have seen in work incentives, reductions in tax burdens and reductions in child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.3/2">I will say a little more about those three key improvements. Tax credits have improved incentives to work. Together with our wider economic stability, they have helped to increase the number of people in work by more than 2 million since the spring of 1997. Since then, long-term unemployment has reduced by 450,000. For example, from this October, a couple with two children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will be &pound;41 a week better off for having done so. A lone parent with two children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will be &pound;76 a week better off compared with the &pound;54 that that person would have received under the system as it was in 1997. A single person without children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will be &pound;58 a week better off compared with the &pound;39 that they would have received under the system as it was in 1997. There have been substantial improvements in the incentives to move into work, and they are one of the main reasons why we have seen such a big increase in the employment rate.</p>

	<p pid="c.288.0/1">The Minister is keen to emphasise the positive aspects of the system. Will he concede, bearing in mind some of the recipients of tax credit are the poorest in the land and some of the most vulnerable, that he and the system are doing such people no favours by increasing bureaucracy and the responsibility on them to make claims without there being a similar impact on the administrators?</p>

	<p pid="c.288.1/1">There is a big impact on precisely the people to whom the hon. Gentleman refers, and that is for the good. For example, the tax credit system has reduced substantially the tax burden on low to middle-income families, precisely those to which he refers. That tax take of 9.8 per cent. on a single earner couple on &pound;21,000, with two children&mdash;the manufacturing average wage&mdash;is now, according to OECD studies, the lowest rate of any country in the G7. There has been a huge gain for middle and low-income families. The single earner family with two children can now earn just under two thirds of the average wage before they start to pay any net tax. Thanks to tax credits, the number of families with children paying no net tax will have risen by more than 500,000 to more than 3 million this year. Those improvements should attract wide support from across the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.288.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his remarks on the constructive but critical report of the Treasury Committee. It says clearly that tax credits are right in principle. The core issue is whether we want a flexible system or a fixed system. I would wish to take up that issue if I were to catch the eye of the occupant of the Chair. I have not had a response from the shadow Chief Secretary about the core issue. Where are the Opposition going? Are they fixed or flexible? Will my hon. Friend address that core issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.288.3/1">If I understood him correctly, the shadow Chancellor wants a more flexible inflexible system. However, I look forward to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall)</phrase>, as I agree that this is a very important point indeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.3/2">The third big gain from the system is the fact that tax credits have helped to achieve a significant reduction in child poverty&mdash;700,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty since 1997, compared with a doubling of child poverty in the previous 20 years under the Tory Government. There is recognition across the House that child poverty must be tackled. Previously, the Opposition did not acknowledge that, but they do so today, which is another reason for the broad agreement that, as the Treasury Committee said, the tax credit system is right in principle. Tax credits provide support for 20 million people&mdash;a third of the population&mdash;and assist 6 million families and just over 10 million children. Take-up is substantially higher than in any previous system of income-related financial support for families in work, and it has risen much faster than it did under previous benefit systems such as family credit. The people most likely to take up their entitlement are the low-income families who stand to benefit the most.</p>

Recently, the worst case with which I dealt was one in which someone received an overpayment of &pound;9,000 that they were asked to repay in monthly instalments of &pound;600, which is far beyond their means. Until the Chief Secretary and the Government accept that the problem affects individuals and until they stop citing facts and statistics, we will not make any progress.

In itself, that should not mean that a family suffers hardship when their income increases and they have to repay it but, in a small minority of cases, the calculations are wrong, resulting in difficult circumstances. Furthermore, does my hon. Friend not agree that the alternative is a fixed, inflexible system that penalises people far more?</p>

The total number of families who benefit from tax credit rose to 5.9 million in 2004-05, and 305,000 families have benefited from the child care element alone&mdash;a 14 per cent. increase on the previous year. A total of 79,000 families benefit from the disabled worker element, which represents an increase of 23 per cent. on 2003-04. Tax credits, as my hon.

Let me make the position clear: as family circumstances change, we must reflect those changes in the tax credits that are paid, which is why end-of-year adjustments are integral to a flexible system that responds to people's changing needs. For example, if a couple have a second child or if they suffer a sudden drop in income, the tax credit system should be able respond with extra help straight away. That is the great strength of the flexible system that has been set up, and such a response is only possible if payments can be adjusted during the year and, where necessary, at the end of the year, once any changes in income are known.</p>

This week, I received a letter from Revenue and Customs saying that it could not retrieve information from the system to tell me whether my constituent had been overpaid, underpaid or paid the correct amount. My constituent is beside herself with worry&mdash;there is a problem in the system, as it cannot deal with flexibility.</p>

	<p pid="c.291.3/1">I was pleased to discuss the improvements that we have made in a recent Adjournment debate, when the hon. Gentleman raised his concerns. Procedures are in place to minimise hardship, including reduced recovery rates from continuing tax credit payments for people on low incomes. For people who no longer receive an award, there are 12-month instalment plans, with longer repayments where necessary. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs considers the case for making additional payments to people who claim hardship as a result of recovery. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General listened to representations last year about the balance between certainty and flexibility, and responded with changes that reflected those representations.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.3/2">We do need to improve the quality of service to tax credit customers, as the Treasury Committee stated. That is why we have introduced a series of changes building on experience from the first couple of years of the system.

	<p pid="c.292.0/1">As a member of the Select Committee, I appreciate the open mind that my hon. Friend is bringing to the problems that were thrown up. They are not easy problems to resolve, but the fact that they are accepted and that work is going on is welcomed. However, seeing the problems should not distract us from the effect that tax credits have had on our estates. I have seen so many young people waste away on benefits, particularly single parents, who should be in a job but whose lack of skills means that their first job will be a low-paid one, which does not make it worth their while coming off benefits. Tax credits&mdash;my hon. Friend mentioned the figure of &pound;50 to &pound;76 a week&mdash;have provided the incentive for so many people on my estate to take up work, enter society and be a stakeholder for the first time.</p>

	<p pid="c.292.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The dramatic improvement to the incentives to get into a job have been a big gain from the system. I am grateful to him for drawing the attention of the House to the gains in his constituency, and I pay tribute to his work on behalf of his constituents in that respect. That is why the Select Committee said yesterday that we could not go further on certainty without putting flexibility at risk. That was an interesting conclusion, which the House will want to reflect on.</p>
	<p pid="c.292.1/2">My right hon. Friend announced some important policy changes last November, in particular to address the impact of the annual income rises that have led to the need for adjustment and an increase in the tax credits disregard from &pound;2,500 to &pound;25,000. That crucial change has taken effect from April this year. Together with other changes, those policies will minimise the need for adjustments, yet maintain the flexibility to respond to changes in circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.292.3/1">The overall impact of the package is broadly neutral in cost terms. When one considers the elements of it that cost money and those that gain revenue, the overall impact is broadly neutral.</p>
	<p pid="c.292.3/2">In our modern labour market, where in any year 3 million people change jobs, flexibility to respond is tremendously important. That is the big benefit of the system as it has been constructed. I welcome the Treasury Committee's comments about that.</p>
	<p pid="c.292.3/3">Our strategy is to make work pay and to provide real financial support to families through tax credits. There have been problems in the early stages of implementation, but there have also been vital gains. That is why there is growing recognition&mdash;across the House, I hope&mdash;that tax credits are right in principle.</p>

	<p pid="c.293.0/1">I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for giving way again. I sense that he is winding up. Will he deal with two specific points, which I know the Select Committee considered and Citizens Advice is concerned about? One is the statutory test and the right to appeal to an independent tribunal, which exists for other benefits. The second is the pause that the Government promised before the clawback of overpayments, to give people the right to question the Treasury's decision on that.</p>

	<p pid="c.293.1/1">On the first point, the procedure as we now have it is consistent between the tax credit system and the benefits system as regards the handling of official error. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have just come from the Department for Work and Pensions, and there is consistency now between those two. On the pause, we have said that we want to accept the ombudsman's recommendation. I can reaffirm that today. Some IT changes will be needed to achieve that, and they may take a little time. We want to take the time, to make sure we get it right. It is our intention to proceed with that, as we have said.</p>
	<p pid="c.293.1/2">Better incentives for work, a lower tax take from families on low and middle incomes, a big reduction in the number of children growing up in poverty&mdash;the system is right not just in principle, but increasingly in practice as well. It is the right system for a progressive welfare state and for a fair and prosperous Britain.</p>

	<p pid="c.293.2/1">As the Front-Bench speakers for the Conservative party and for the Government observed, this is a timely moment to consider tax credits and the future of the system. Not only do we have the figures that were published last week on the 2004-05 performance of the tax credit system, but we have the excellent report from the Treasury Committee, which throws a great deal of light on the salient issues that we shall discuss today, many of which were glossed over in the Chief Secretary's response. I hope that the Paymaster General will be able to say more when she sums up.</p>
	<p pid="c.293.2/2">I welcome the Chief Secretary to his new responsibilities and am glad to see that he is taking a leading role in tax credits policy. Indeed, he seems to have been taking the lead role over the past week as the Government dealt with the implications of last week's figures.</p>
	<p pid="c.293.2/3">I had not spotted the statistics that the shadow Chancellor drew to our attention, which indicate that in the Chief Secretary's constituency there are greater problems with the tax credit system than anywhere else in the country. I hope that that will ensure that there is a stronger spokesman in the Treasury than there has been in the past for the interests of those who have been failed by the system and who are looking for reforms, rather than complacency, from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.293.2/4">There are two aspects of tax credits that we must debate today. The first group of issues are those on which the Select Committee commented in its excellent report, concerning the practicalities of the tax credit system, with its existing broad design. The parliamentary ombudsman commented on many of those in her report a year ago. The Chief Secretary said that the Government accepted all the ombudsman's recommendations, but he failed to say which had been implemented to date, and he is surely wrong to say that the Government accept all the recommendations. I thought it had already been made clear by the Paymaster General that the Government did not accept the ombudsman's most important recommendation, No. 10, which was to write off the overpayments that have occurred in the past owing to official error. Perhaps the Paymaster General can put on the record later whether the Government's position on that has changed.</p>

	<p pid="c.294.0/1">The hon. Gentleman hits upon something that affects one of my constituents, Susan Webster, who is in a distressing situation. She made Revenue and Customs aware each time her circumstances changed, as HMRC has confirmed to me on its hotline, yet she still had an overpayment of &pound;1,000, which she is expected to pay back. Revenue and Customs refuses to write off that sum. Surely it is wrong, when someone makes HMRC aware of changes in their circumstances at the right time, that they are still expected to pay back a considerable amount of money.</p>

	<p pid="c.294.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. He draws to our attention the fact that the Government have been in denial about the problems of tax credits ever since the system was established, and they have maintained from the beginning&mdash;it is picked up in the Treasury Committee's report&mdash;that all the problems that people have faced with tax credits have been due to their own incompetence in dealing with the system. In fact, most of the people I have seen in my advice centres in my constituency&mdash;I must have seen 250 to 300 over the past two years&mdash;have faced problems that were caused in some way by official error. That is what the Government have neither acknowledged nor dealt with in the design of the system.</p>

	<p pid="c.294.5/1">I shall make a little progress and then give way.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.5/2">The Chief Secretary dealt with some of the successes of the tax credit system, and 17 of the 18 lines of the Government's amendment trumpet its successes. Every hon. Member today has acknowledged that for many people, tax credits have made an enormous difference. It would have been almost unbelievable that a Government could spend &pound;15.8 billion in a single year on means-tested benefits without benefiting anybody. The issue is that the design of the tax credits system has been fundamentally flawed, that overpayments are fundamental to the system and that they have driven into poverty many of the people whom the Government have sought to help most, as has been shown by not only the Select Committee's report, but the ombudsman's report, which has been sitting on the shelf for the best part of a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.5/3">The Chief Secretary and the Paymaster General would do well to read the leader article in the <i> Financial Times </i>last week on the day on which the Government published the latest statistics, in which the leader writer said:</p>
	<p pid="c.294.5/4" class="indent">&quot;Compassionate governments insulate low-income hard-working families from the ravages of a global market. Enlightened governments seek such protection by rewarding work through their tax and social security systems. Arrogant governments close their ears when these policies are failing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.294.5/5">One of the greatest disappointments in terms of the Government's response over the past year, and to some extent even the Chief Secretary's response today, is that there has been an arrogance and an unwillingness to accept the problems that have been created for many people on the lowest incomes throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.5/6">The problems of the tax credits system, in terms of the loss of public money and the enormous overpayments that have had to be recovered from people on low incomes, are already well known. Many hon. Members today have already spoken, and I am sure others will later, of their own experiences of dealing with the individuals who have had these problems, many of whom have never been significantly in debt before, are baffled by the complexity of the system, and have got into these enormous debts and overpayments through no fault of their own. It is on those practical issues that I seek some reassurance from the Government today.</p>

	<p pid="c.295.0/1">The hon. Gentleman's main proposal is the reintroduction of a much less flexible system, like the old family credit system based on fixed awards. He will have seen what the Treasury Committee said about that yesterday. I quote:</p>
	<p pid="c.295.0/2" class="indent">&quot;there seemed to be little support amongst our witnesses for returning to a regime of fixed awards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.295.0/3">Indeed the hon. Gentleman's predecessor in his current post explicitly supported the ability of the system to be flexible in the way that it is. Does that give the hon. Gentleman any pause to reflect on the merits of the proposal that he has been running with for some time now.</p>

	<p pid="c.295.1/1">I find the Government's position on this issue rather difficult to fathom. The Chief Secretary has said a number of times that the fixed system would have terrible disadvantages and that it would be some kind of disaster, and that was the line that the Paymaster General used to take. But at the same time they have acknowledged to the shadow Chancellor that they are considering precisely such an option and that they are keeping it under review. I remember being in this House a year ago and hearing the Paymaster General tell us how the alternatives to the then system were ridiculous; that a fixed award system would be ludicrous and that increasing the disregard to the outrageous figure of &pound;10,000 would be enormously expensive. Yet a few months later the disregard went up from &pound;2,500 to &pound;25,000. The Chief Secretary would do well to acknowledge that in paragraph 52 of their report, members of the Select Committee say that they had not sought in this inquiry</p>
	<p pid="c.295.1/2" class="indent">&quot;to ask whether the model of tax credits regime which the Government has adopted is the right model.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.295.1/3">That is not what the Select Committee has pretended to do. The Committee also took evidence from a series of people, as the Chief Secretary will know, including one-parent families, who want to see a return to fixed awards; the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which believes that that option needs to be looked at seriously; and the Child Poverty Action Group, which has said that it believes that if the existing system cannot be made to work, there should be a major redesign. If the Chief Secretary really believes that the system of fixed awards is so flawed, why do not the Government carry out a public assessment? Why do they not commission some sort of research about other systems in the world? We have this extraordinary debate where it is hinted that a fixed system would be unacceptable, yet the Government simultaneously say that the system is being kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="c.295.1/4">I noticed today that one of the things that the Chief Secretary is trying to do by continually coming back to the issue of a fixed award system, which was not even an aspect of the Select Committee's report, or one of the recommendations of the ombudsman, is to try to distract attention from the lack of progress on some of the major issues in the ombudsman's report, which came out a year ago. I find it extraordinary that the Chief Secretary is unable to say how many of the ombudsman's recommendations made a full year ago have been implemented. I find it extraordinary that he does not know that the principal recommendation that the ombudsman made has been rejected by the Government. It is extraordinary that the Government do not seem to have taken on board the implications of the existing system for low-income families. It is also extraordinary that, one year after the ombudsman's report, which was the most powerful critique of the impact that the tax credits system was having on some low income families and will probably never be bettered in terms of its insights into the tax credits system and its recommendations for putting it right in its existing form, a cross-party Select Committee with many thoughtful but also instinctively loyal Members of the Government, a majority Labour Committee, should be reporting that</p>
	<p pid="c.295.1/5" class="indent">&quot;we are not convinced that the Paymaster General and the Department fully realise the extent to which HMRC needs to re-focus its administrative structures for tax credits around the needs of claimants.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.295.1/6">It is astonishing that the Select Committee has gone on to conclude:</p>
	<p pid="c.295.1/7" class="indent">&quot;We consider it would be much more helpful if the Department were to focus on the quality of the service it provides to claimants, rather than seeking to attribute the majority of problems with the tax credits regime to error or omission on the part of claimants.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.295.1/8">The Select Committee refers to the Paymaster General's statement about a year ago when she attributed virtually every aspect of the overpayments to errors that other people were making, and no aspect of the overpayments to the errors that are being made by the system itself and by the Inland Revenue.</p>

	<p pid="c.297.0/1">Does the hon.

	<p pid="c.297.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point about the Government's package that was presented in the PBR last year, and the Treasury Committee's report was fairly scathing in setting out the lack of evidence about costings for those changes. I suspect that that is either because the disregard of &pound;25,000 will be much more expensive than the Government expect, or perhaps the Government were never expecting ever to be able to reclaim a lot of those overpayments in any case, and therefore have treated them as written off.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.1/2">Let us come to the main recommendations of the ombudsman in her report last year, and the main recommendations about overpayments in the Select Committee's report and what I would like the Government to focus on as their first priority. I will touch upon some of the interesting issues that have been raised with regard to fixed awards and some of the comments about means-testing. There are challenges there for all the parties. But the first matter to get right is the system as it is working now.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.1/3">There are a number of problems in the ombudsman's report that, in fairness to the Government, they have started to try to deal with. Unfortunately, the problems that they seem to have prioritised have been some of the smallest and therefore the easiest to change. The biggest recommendation of all, which would have involved a lot of money, writing off overpayments due to official error, has been disregarded by the Government. But the really critical recommendations that the ombudsman has made concern the way in which overpayments are treated. That was clear from today's briefing by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, from recommendations 10 to 17 of the Select Committee's report, and from the shadow Chancellor's questions, but it was not clear in the answer from the Chief Secretary. We must move away from the type of system that one-parent families described in the Committee's evidence as a system designed by HMRC that would work with IT rather than with claimants. That is the type of system that the Paymaster General described to me in a letter last June, when she said that it was right that there should be</p>
	<p pid="c.297.1/4" class="indent">&quot;a presumption of recovery by means of reducing or stopping further payments&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.297.1/5">because most overpayments would be due to errors by claimants. In other words, the system as it has always worked from the beginning has been driven by IT and computers, not by any sense of justice.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.1/6">In light of the responses by the Paymaster General and the Chief Secretary, I am very disappointed that one year on from the recommendations made by the parliamentary ombudsman, the Government seem to have made absolutely no progress on putting in place a pause so that people are able to challenge the overpayments that have been alleged against them. That pause must not only mean that people are not guilty until proven innocent but allow them to understand why the overpayment has occurred. At the moment, the information about that is completely inadequate in most cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.298.0/1">This is a very important point that comes back to how one manages the collection of debts, which is what they are in some instances, from people on low incomes. We must ensure that, in the name of having a pause, we do not build another big delay into the system that makes it worse for people who are having difficulties. That is not a flippant point but a serious one about managing income, repayments and debt.</p>

	<p pid="c.298.1/1">The hon. Lady makes a legitimate point about the balance between not allowing people to get further into debt and overpayment and giving them a reasonable breathing space to challenge overpayments. I am sure that she accepts that the existing system that presumes that people are guilty until they prove themselves innocent is inadequate and, as the ombudsman puts it, systemic maladministration. It is fundamentally unjust.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.1/2">What has struck me from my own constituency cases is the complexity of making decisions about many of the cases where overpayments occur. Looking at the system from the top, one might think that one would be dealing either with an overpayment caused by an outright error by the Inland Revenue, where it was obvious to the person that &pound;1 million had turned up in their bank account, or the opposite, where there had been a case of fraud. A huge number of cases are much more complicated, and the tax credits system needs to deal with that. They usually arise when individuals have accurately reported information over a helpline or on paper to the Inland Revenue. Those individuals usually then assume that the Inland Revenue will use that information correctly, but often it does not. It makes errors that it expects people to pick up from extremely complex forms which most people do not understand, and which, in fact, many Members of Parliament probably would not understand.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.1/3">I can think of an enormous number of cases in my advice centres just over the past few weeks. People have reported that in a particular year they had no income and then have gone into a job, and the tax credits award notice that came back showed them simultaneously working 40 hours and also having no income. People have been on the basic state pension but the award notice has said that they are on pension credit and they have not understood that. People have put in one application for a disabled child with particular mobility components and something else has turned up on the form. Many of these cases are not black and white. The existing system, which applies the double lock whereby someone has somehow to prove not only official error but that they could not have found it by looking through all the forms, is completely inadequate for most of our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.1/4">I cannot understand why the Chief Secretary does not accept that the systems of the Department for Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue are fundamentally different in relation to the assumptions that are made about error and reasonableness. We need a fairer test.</p>

	<p pid="c.299.0/1">May I draw the hon.

	<p pid="c.299.1/1">With all due respect to the hon. Gentleman, who is my former colleague on the Treasury Committee, I am sure that he is making a serious point&mdash;that one needs to be a professor of social policy and a former fellow of the Institute for Fiscal Studies to understand this system. I was once a Treasury spokesman for my party, and I am now supposed to be the Work and Pensions spokesman, yet I cannot understand some aspects of the forms that the Government send out. They are still not simple enough, and it is still unsatisfactory that there is no statutory test. It is bizarre that the Government have been maintaining several different standards for writing off overpayments over the past couple of years. It is disappointing that none of those issues was addressed by the Chief Secretary. The Treasury Committee's report goes over incredibly important ground that we knew about a year ago following the report by the parliamentary ombudsman.</p>

	<p pid="c.299.2/1">I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the complexity of the system. I used to be a solicitor, and I find it very difficult to follow. The situation is even worse than he suggests. A constituent of mine recognised that she had been overpaid and continually told the Revenue so, but it would not accept it. Eventually she got a letter from it claiming an overpayment and saying that although she had repeatedly said that she was being overpaid, it was not reasonable for her to accept the payments. What sort of reasonableness are the Revenue working to when they send out such letters?</p>

	<p pid="c.299.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. Many hon. Members who have had people with tax credit problems coming to see them will recognise such cases, and yet will be entirely uncertain about how the Inland Revenue would deal with them in practice. I have referred cases to the tax credits office where a correct judgment has been made to overturn the overpayments. I have had other cases where there is still fundamental injustice&mdash;sometimes involving people with serious disabilities or people with learning difficulties who could not possibly be expected to understand aspects of the form having given the correct information to the Treasury.</p>

Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins)</phrase>. I went on television to defend the Liberal spokesperson for claiming tax credit despite a wage of about &pound;60,000. This is a good opportunity to put that on the agenda. My personal view is that if a system directed at the poorest and most vulnerable extends to people such as MPs, that clearly pushes a lot of work on to the Revenue that it should not have because we should not be able to claim. The system should be tighter and directed at the most needy.</p>

	<p pid="c.300.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a sensible point. As he says, people are entitled to claim from a system that the Government have established and on which they have a legitimate claim. He will know that there will be huge sympathy for his viewpoint. It seems bizarre that people who otherwise pay the upper rate of tax can get such benefits. The Government's difficulty with a means-tested system is that if one wants to deny the benefits to such individuals, one has to taper it away more sharply, which raises the disincentive issues mentioned by the shadow Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/2">When the Paymaster General winds up, I would like to hear what progress has been made on the crucial recommendations made by the parliamentary ombudsman a year ago, which the Treasury Committee has felt it necessary to come back to in its report. That should not have been necessary. The Government should have been able to progress these issues by now, even if they had decided to make changes that could not have been implemented for some time.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/3">I would also like to follow up the shadow Chancellor's point about fraud. Those matters deserve a much bigger debate than we have today. However, it is clear that the Comptroller and Auditor General was expecting the updated fraud figures this spring. Have provisional figures already been made available to him? When will they be given to the House?</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/4">We need to have a wider debate on fixed awards and the balance between flexibility and stability. The Select Committee acknowledged that it did not fully investigate that in the report. It would be enormously beneficial to the House if it could examine some of those issues in future. Even the Government have had to learn to some extent from their experience when the original design of the tax credits system went wrong. The Chief Secretary's claims that a fixed award system would be wrong or damaging sits ill with the Government's statements that they are keeping the matter under review. If they are keeping it under review, it would be interesting to know what they are doing to review it.</p>

	<p pid="c.301.3/1">I advise the hon. Gentleman to read the Select Committee report and the parliamentary ombudsman's report and ask the Government why they have not implemented the recommendations, which we support, that should have been implemented as a priority a year ago. I ask the hon. Gentleman to ask the Chief Secretary to consider seriously the case for a fixed award system such as that in Canada. I thought that he would brief us on Canada's excellent experience of a fixed and stable system. The Government should examine that option because stability is as important if not more important than flexibility for families on low incomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.3/2">We all understand that the Government have made, at considerable cost to the public finances, an enormous commitment to trying to reduce child poverty and improve work incentives. They have changed the terms of the political debate, even though there are some major problems with the design of tax credits and the extent to which we can rely on increasing use of means-tested benefits. The Chief Secretary will know about that from his time in the Department for Work and Pensions, dealing with the pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.3/3">My major criticism of the Government is not that they have rejected all our proposals for a fixed award system, but that we are sitting here, one year after the parliamentary ombudsman reported and two years after we knew about the problems, and the most important recommendations have not been implemented. I do not like to personalise such matters but it is regrettable that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has not bothered to be here today and that he can find time to change his diary and deal with international issues but cannot find time to tackle an important issue such as this. It is also regrettable that much that the Paymaster General has said in the past couple of years has been complacent and reflected a state of denial. That must lie behind the fact that a year has passed and yet we have made no progress on the key issue. I therefore believe that the Department would benefit from new ministerial responsibilities for tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.3/4">I started by quoting from an excellent leading article that appeared in the <i> Financial Times </i>on the day when the tax credit figures were published last week. It concluded that the Chancellor's</p>
	<p pid="c.301.3/5" class="indent">&quot;failure to sort out the tax credits mess bodes ill for this government, the Labour party and low income working families.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.301.3/6">I hope that Ministers will listen to hon. Members today. If they do not listen to Liberal Democrat Members, I hope that they will listen to the ombudsman and their colleagues on the Select Committee. If they do not, they will pay a high price at the ballot box in losing the votes of precisely those people whom the tax credit system was designed to help.</p>

	<p pid="c.303.8/2" class="indent">&quot;we are not convinced that the Paymaster General and the Department fully realise the extent to which HMRC needs to re-focus its administrative structures for tax credits around the needs of claimants.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.304.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" speakername="John McFall" colnum="304"  time="015:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0011.htm#06060754001712">
	<p pid="c.304.0/1">The hon. Gentleman anticipates some of the points that I am going to make. His raising that point further underlines my objectivity on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.0/2">On increasing support for families, we now have 20 million people getting support, as the Paymaster General said, involving 6 million families and 10 million children. That is an increase on the results of every past policy, and the take-up rate among low earners has been 93 per cent. That is a big improvement compared with the take-up rates of 57 per cent. in the early years of family income supplement, of 62 per cent. for family credit and of 65 per cent. for working families tax credit. That is why the Select Committee has endorsed this policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.0/3">The Select Committee also endorses the child poverty objectives that have resulted in 700,000 children being lifted out of relative poverty, and the measures on creating adequate financial incentives to work. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury mentioned the tax burden. Like him, I look to the survey carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which showed that, as a result of the tax credit, there had been a large fall in the tax burden for families. The tax burden on a single-earner couple with no children earning &pound;21,000 has fallen from 17.3 per cent. of gross earnings in 1997 to 9.8 per cent. in 2004. That is the lowest rate for any G7 country, and it is indeed an incentive for people to get into work. The effect of the policy on children is also important, and the Select Committee report notes that the tax credit has helped to ensure that the number of families with children paying no net tax has risen from under 2.5 million to more than 3 million in 2006-07. That is a considerable improvement.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.0/4">However, I must ask whether everything is going right with the regime, and the answer is most definitely no. That is why the Treasury Committee has sought to address a number of points. Is the regime fit for purpose? Yes, in terms of the majority of people getting tax credits. However, it is not fit for purpose for the minority of people having problems with the tax credit system. That is why the Select Committee visited the tax credit office in Preston, where we looked at the way in which the regime was working in practice. Overpayments were a big issue there.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.0/5">We examined the problem of overpayments, and the staff gave us three reasons for it. The first is that people's incomes rise from one year to the next. The second is that families overestimate the extent to which their income has fallen. The third is that the provision of payments at the start of a tax year might be based on out-of-date information. Those three reasons combined account for 70 per cent. of the overpayments. I would like to think that the Select Committee has performed a service in identifying those three issues so that they can be tackled. The Select Committee also noted that 30 per cent. of the overpayments were due to delays in reporting changes in a family's circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.0/6">The Conservative and Liberal Democrat spokesmen both mentioned the arguments for either fixed or flexible systems, and I would like to say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> that that subject was very much a feature of the Committee's discussions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">My right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> gave oral evidence to the Committee in which he said that he was getting fewer complaints at his surgeries about tax credits now. I have also taken anecdotal evidence on this, and that is certainly a feature of what hon. Members tell me more widely.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.0/7">If we were to go back to a fixed system, hon. Members would have an increasing number of people coming to see us about the problems involved. I would also like to point out to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury that if we returned to a fixed system, we would not be responding to the demands of a modern labour market. That is important because 3 million people change jobs every year in a modern labour market, and each year more than 200,000 move into new or better jobs, resulting in an increase in their family income by &pound;10,000 a year or more.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.0/8">Those are the reasons for the overpayments. I cannot stress strongly enough that, if we are to have a flexible system, overpayments will be a feature of it. So how can we manage this in a client-sensitive manner? I might be departing from what the Select Committee has said on this, but my experience is that the benefits of a flexible system are there for everyone in the family.</p>

	<p pid="c.305.0/1">Will my right hon. Friend comment on paragraph 30 of the report's conclusions and recommendations? The Select Committee makes it clear that, if we are to have a system with the flexibility that he described, it will not be reasonable to expect to achieve staff reductions. In fact, the number of people being employed to achieve a more flexible system is growing, and that pattern is likely to continue. We will not be able to achieve staff reductions if we want to achieve flexibility.</p>

	<p pid="c.305.1/1">That is a very good point. That issue was raised with us at the tax credit office in Preston. As a result of the demands on the office, extra members of staff were being drafted into that area. When the Minister and others look at the Gershon reviews, and at the demands that have been made on the Department already, they should keep this issue up front. We realise that this cannot be fixed overnight; it will take time. I will mention some of the problems involved as I go through my speech. However, it is an issue that we can all tackle constructively.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/2">I know that the Chancellor has an open mind about this system. The media and others focus on the fact that there have been &pound;2 billion of overpayments this year. That equates in the public's mind to &pound;2 billion of losses, but that is not the case. However, it does give the impression that the system is running less than smoothly. So perhaps the Chancellor will anticipate that reaction and say, &quot;Okay, we'll go back to a fixed system. It will be a surer system.&quot; But will it serve the interests of our constituents? I do not think so.</p>

	<p pid="c.305.2/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that this is not just an issue of presentational embarrassment for the Government or lost money for the taxpayer? It is also a fact that many of the overpayments are being recovered from people on extremely low incomes, sometimes when the problem has arisen through official error rather than their own. That is an even bigger problem than the fact that the Government have paid out &pound;2 billion more than they intended.</p>

	<p pid="c.306.0/1">The hon. Gentleman must accept that overpayments are an inherent part of a flexible system. But how can we marry such a system with a client-sensitive system? The Select Committee had that discussion with members of the unions and officials in Preston when we visited the tax credit office there, and that is the important issue for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/2">The overpayments were &pound;2.2 billion in 2004-05 and &pound;1.8 billion in 2005-06, and I hope that the Paymaster General will respond to this point when she winds up the debate. A breakdown is needed of those overpayments to determine what the Government's figures are. The figure of &pound;4 billion over two years needs to be broken down.</p>

	<p pid="c.306.1/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that this is not just about the overall amount of money involved? It is also about the number of people involved. He referred to a minority who had received overpayments, but we heard from the shadow Chancellor earlier that, in many constituencies, nearly 50 per cent. of those entitled to payments are either being underpaid or overpaid. I have just worked out that, in my constituency, 47 per cent. are getting the wrong payment. Given the administrative nightmare that is taking place in HMRC, the impact on people's lives of having to deal with this problem is getting them very upset, and we have to spend all our time dealing with that. Solving the problem of administrative incompetence is absolutely critical to getting this matter right.</p>

	<p pid="c.306.2/1">As I said earlier, overpayments are an integral part of the system, but it is necessary to distinguish between individuals who can make an adequate response to the tax credit office about overpayments and those&mdash;perhaps people on low incomes and in distress&mdash;who cannot. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman's second point.</p>

	<p pid="c.306.3/1">I understand what the right hon.

	<p pid="c.306.5/1">My right hon. Friend is doing a great job in drawing out what I perceive as a consensus, evidenced by the last two interventions. The consensus on both sides of the House seems to be that tax credits are a good thing and are doing a great deal to alleviate poverty, and that there are administrative teething problems. The only difference now seems to concern the magnitude of the problems, and how far the Government have gone towards addressing them. The overpayment figures for two years that my right hon. Friend has given show that they are moving in the right direction. If the Opposition would be a little more flexible, we could have consensus on that. There are problems, which are being fixed. It will take more effort to fix them further.</p>

	<p pid="c.307.0/1">The Paymaster General dealt with a number of those problems in the pre-Budget report, and I am sure that she will discuss them later.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.0/2">End-of-year adjustments feature in any flexible system. The only way in which to eliminate overpayments is to have a fixed system in which eligibility is based on the previous year's income and circumstances, and I certainly do not want to go down that road.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.0/3">The Treasury Committee said that there should be a shift in the culture of HMRC if the tax credits system was to be a success. HMRC conducted a review of the merger of the two departments, which the Select Committee recommended to the Government. As has been pointed out, there are two entirely different cultures, and the client-centred culture has not been predominant. That must be addressed, and I hope that David Varney, HMRC's chief executive, and his colleagues will read the report with that constructive criticism in mind.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.0/4">I should like the Paymaster General to think about what the Committee said about official error. The Committee believes that it has been a cause of overpayments in a significant number of cases, and that the Government should publish a complete analysis of incidences. There are also the errors caused by the IT system, which a number of Members have mentioned. Constituents have come to me about it. After our visit to Preston, the reason is obvious to us. When a client telephones a civil servant who then consults a computer, not all the information on the client will be on that computer. If decisions are being made on the basis of incomplete information, we can be sure that the system will be made worse. The IT problem must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.0/5">When we visited Preston, we learned that only about 25 per cent. of claims went straight through the automated system with no need for manual intervention. About 80 per cent. of new claims required intervention, and it was required by about 30 to 35 per cent. of claims for renewal. The Public and Commercial Services Union told us that the Government initially intended the &quot;rapid data capture&quot; process&mdash;the conversion of written information from application forms into electronic data&mdash;to handle about 90 per cent. of claims without further need for human intervention. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1729" name="Jim Cousins">My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins)</phrase> mentioned staff numbers, and those figures make his point. There is an urgent need to keep staff at the tax credit office.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.0/6">A recurring theme was the IT system's lack of flexibility, and the difficulty of correcting a mistake once it had been entered into the system. Staff may&mdash;as they told us&mdash;accept that the information is wrong, but may still be unable to correct the error.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.0/7">The Committee also referred to fraud, error and organised crime. When the Paymaster General appeared before the Committee, I personally interrogated her on issues relating to staff from the Department of Work and Pensions and from Network Rail. HMRC has closed the e-portal and it feels that the fraud issue can be addressed, but there is still a problem over national insurance numbers. Vigilance is needed.</p>

	<p pid="c.308.0/1">Perhaps it is wrong to raise this when my right hon. Friend is talking about fraud, but I think we should record the problems that the Committee had with Electronic Data Systems. We were not able to confirm that we could discuss the matter with the Minister, because we were bound by a settlement. The Public Accounts Committee has raised the issue, and it has been raised by us. I think it should be put on record that the settlement with EDS is insupportable&mdash;that it is quite wrong, requires investigation, and should never be replicated.</p>

	<p pid="c.308.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. I remind the Paymaster General that David Varney, the HMRC chief executive, contacted us and offered us a confidential briefing. However, that would naturally have meant that we could not open our mouths at any future date. As politicians and public representatives, we were not prepared to enter into any such negotiation.</p>
	<p pid="c.308.1/2">There is a credibility problem. There is, perhaps, a perception of impropriety. There may have been no impropriety, but the position is far from satisfactory, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> has done us a service by referring to it.</p>
	<p pid="c.308.1/3">The Committee welcomed the increase in disregard from &pound;2,500 to &pound;25,000, but the Government say that they expect the increase to reduce the current level of overpayments by a third. That suggests that the remaining two thirds of overpayments arise as a result of changes in claimants' circumstances other than increases in income. Consequently, over the next few years&mdash;although the tax credits regime may see a decrease in the number of overpayments&mdash;levels are likely to continue to be high. At the same time, claimants' problems may well become increasingly complex as their case histories within the regime lengthen. I should like the Paymaster General to examine that issue, as well the important issues of the pause and the referral to an independent tribunal for appeal. We have mentioned both those issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.308.2/1">On the independent tribunal appeal, does my right hon. Friend agree that it is important that we see the report first, as the Treasury Committee suggests, so that we can determine the practicality of having an independent appeal system, which is what we recommended?</p>

	<p pid="c.308.3/1">I agree and hope that the Paymaster General continues to talk to the Committee while she considers the pause. We said that we were concerned by the apparent lack of urgency on the part of the Government and the Paymaster General in seeking to implement the pause before recovery of overpayment, given that automatic recovery of overpayments is contrary to natural justice. We recommend that the Government reassess the priority that they have assigned to implementing the pause. I hope that she refers to that.</p>
	<p pid="c.308.3/2">In deciding whether to write off an overpayment, HMRC should not apply a stringently objective reasonableness test, but take account of things such as a claimant's circumstances and the clarity of award notices. I know that the Paymaster General has considered that.</p>

	<p pid="c.309.1/1">I agree entirely. I do not know the particular circumstances of the case, but I am willing to take my hon. Friend's word on it. However, as I said, we have to distinguish between those who have been overpaid and can pay the money back adequately, and those low-income families who are experiencing hardship and are in distress. As he says, a hardship team is essential in determining that, and I hope that the Paymaster General considers the issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.309.1/2">I think that I have exhausted all possible interventions and finish on three things mentioned earlier. First, on the support for families, more families are getting the credit. Secondly, we are making progress on child poverty targets. Thirdly, on incentives to work, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East mentioned young people who are unemployed. I am a former school teacher. When I first took up teaching, a lot of the kids whom I taught in the area where I lived went on not to work, but to unemployment. I would meet some of them five, 10 years later. They would be with their wife or kids, pushing a pram, and I would dread asking, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I was reluctant to do that. Now I can walk down my high street and ask people what they are doing with more confidence and more authority because more people are in work.</p>
	<p pid="c.309.1/3">We need a flexible system that responds to people's needs and provides incentives to work, especially for young people, because we must remember that unemployment is the single most important determinant of poverty. If we can have such a system, warts and all, it deserves our support. However, we will keep our critical eye on the Paymaster General over the next few months.

	<p pid="c.309.2/1">I am saddened that the Paymaster General is alone on the Front Bench. In the time that I have dealt with her on such issues, and on the two occasions when I have found it necessary to go to the Treasury to meet her to discuss them, I have found her and her civil servants extremely courteous. The fact of the matter is, however, that a ghost is missing from the banquet&mdash;it is the author of this shambles, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is conspicuous that over the three years of malfunction of the system that he introduced he has not taken part in one of these debates. Like the Duke of Plaza-Toro, he has led his troops from behind. Frankly, that level of political timidity in somebody who&mdash;at least once&mdash;aspired to be the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is very unbecoming indeed.</p>

	<p pid="c.310.1/1">I want to deal with the people issues. Some correspondence fortuitously landed on my desk this morning. It was from a constituent and pretty much encapsulates much of the argument. He enclosed a letter from HM Revenue and Customs, which was sent to him on <phrase class="date" code="">17 May</phrase>. It said:</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/2" class="indent">&quot;On <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-25">25 June 2004</phrase>, an amendment was made to your award as you had informed us that&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/3">your wife's</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/4" class="indent">&quot;correct income was &pound;7500.00. Unfortunately due to a system error&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/5">your income</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/6" class="indent">&quot;of &pound;23930.00 was not taken into consideration and you were awarded a higher entitlement than normal.</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/7" class="indent">Two award notices dated 25-06-2004 were issued to you, one referring to your 2003-2004 award and the other referring to your 2004-2005 award. They both stated that you were now entitled to &pound;5695.85 tax credits...In our view&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/8">the Treasury view&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/9" class="indent">&quot;it was reasonable for you to have known that due to the increased level of your joint household income this increased entitlement was incorrect...Although this overpayment was caused by a mistake on our behalf, we do not believe it was reasonable for you to think this increased entitlement was correct. I consider that you should have been aware that your payments were wrong, therefore the decision to recover both overpayments is correct.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/10">In other words, &quot;Game, set and match; we're right and you're wrong.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/11">My constituent replied:</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/12" class="indent">&quot;In your last letter in which you changed your mind about how the overpayment occurred and we pointed out errors so you 'reconsider'. We find this wholly unreasonable and yet again you have made a glaring mistake in stating&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/13">my constituent&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/14" class="indent">&quot;received Tax Credits via his employer totalling &pound;1,393.74...In fact we received no tax credits via my employer as the enclosed wage slips will verify.</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/15" class="indent">You state it was reasonable for us to know we should not be entitled to the overpayment, may we enquire why? We supplied all the information, you made the errors, you stated our award may change...You accept the errors, You make more errors in stating tax credits paid via employer...You change your mind over the reasons for overpayment and we are meant to believe you when you state we should have been responsible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/16">The Revenue and Customs has batteries of civil servants and an unbelievably expensive information technology system paid for by United Kingdom taxpayers, yet it cannot get its sums right. However, it expects our constituents to work out&mdash;presumably on the back of an envelope, without the help of the civil servants and the computer&mdash;sums that the Treasury cannot itself get right, and to take responsibility for the Treasury's errors.</p>
	<p pid="c.310.1/17">The Prime Minister stood at the Dispatch Box at a Prime Minister's Question Time and told the House, in terms, that the Treasury would not seek to reclaim money that was paid as a result of a fault of the Treasury. Ever since that statement was made, the Treasury has wriggled and weasled. It has sought to claim, in one form or another, that all the problems&mdash;problems that have been referred to every Member of Parliament&mdash;are the fault not of the Treasury or of Revenue and Customs, but of the man who cannot work out complex sums on the back of an envelope, who, in this instance, is my constituent.</p>

	<p pid="c.311.0/1">All Members could give similar examples to that which my hon. Friend offers of HMRC's excuses for its incompetence. A problem of the sort that we have not heard mention of so far arrived on my desk yesterday. As a result of an internal systems breakdown, an overpayment remained unrecognised for more than six months. The advice given to my constituent&mdash;the excuse&mdash;was, &quot;Treat it as an interest-free loan and we will come and get it from you later. We cannot sort it now because things are in such a mess.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.311.1/1">My hon. Friend highlights a point that has been made time and again in our debate. You will be relieved to know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I do not propose to read out all the 106 cases with which I have dealt. Twenty-nine are still live, many have been outstanding for more than two years, one has been referred to the adjudicator, and eight more will have to be referred to the adjudicator. Because of our debate, I plucked out 12 cases from the 29 live ones and discovered that there was an average repayment claim of &pound;2,190 per household, a lowest figure of &pound;611 and a highest figure of &pound;4,262.</p>
	<p pid="c.311.1/2">By implication, we are talking about some of the poorest, most underprivileged families in the country. Sadly, the per capita level of deprivation in North Thanet, in east Kent, is still among the highest in the United Kingdom. Can any Member begin to contemplate the terror and misery felt by a young man or woman who picks off the doormat a bill for &pound;4,000, when they do not have 4,000 pence in the bank, and such money as they did have has long been spent on household and living essentials? How can the Treasury and the chairman of the Revenue and Customs, who was rewarded with a knighthood for his incompetence, dare to justify this sort of situation? We know how, because in response to another constituency case, a Revenue and Customs senior business manager wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="">1 June</phrase> and said:</p>
	<p pid="c.311.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Overpayments are sometimes inevitable in a flexible system as changes in circumstances which reduce entitlement can happen at any time in the year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.311.1/4">Forgive me, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall)</phrase> has referred over and over again to the wonderfully flexible system. The system is flexible, in so far as I can see, in terms of the number of excuses that it allows Revenue and Customs to generate for its failures, but it is not responsive to data input&mdash;I think that that is the expression.</p>
	<p pid="c.311.1/5">In evidence to the Treasury Committee, the Paymaster General said with tremendous and accustomed candour:</p>
	<p pid="c.311.1/6" class="indent">&quot;I am not a computer person.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.311.1/7">The problem is that not only is the right hon. Lady not a computer person, but so far I can see, the people responsible for the installation and maintenance of the Treasury's computers are not computer people either&mdash;they are not capable of getting it right&mdash;and the result is a Treasury Committee report that is absolutely scathing in its determination.</p>
	<p pid="c.311.1/8">We are dealing with real people. Teething troubles have been referred to&mdash;if there are such troubles, all I can say is that second teeth are coming through, because the programme is now three years old. The Treasury team responsible, including the Paymaster General and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have had three years to get it right.</p>
	<p pid="c.311.1/9">Members of Parliament continue to receive cases of hardship and misery, generated by a scheme that we were told would solve people's problems and help them out of debt, poverty and hardship and back into work. For a third of the people involved in the scheme, who are supposedly receiving money as beneficiaries, the reverse is the case&mdash;it is creating problems and causing hardship. It hurts me to have to say this, but frankly, if the chairman of Revenue and Customs and the Treasury team responsible for the scheme cannot get it right after three years, they should move over and make way for someone who can.</p>

	<p pid="c.312.0/1">A bit later in my remarks, I want to deal with an aspect of the tax credit scheme that has not been talked about much: the child care element&mdash;a particularly important point that is responsible for some of the very high levels of overpayment. Before I do so, it is important to return to the fact that the policy is basically the right one. Although everyone says, &quot;Oh yes, we agree that it is the right one, but...&quot;, we are left with the &quot;buts&quot;, which are undermining. The implication that the system is working so badly that it cannot be made to work and therefore that it must be changed is one of the things that I want to refute very strongly.</p>
	<p pid="c.312.0/2">We have a choice, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall)</phrase> was right to press on both Opposition parties that there is a choice between flat-rate and real-time benefits. Of course, a flat-rate benefit would be easier to administer. We could just say, &quot;We know the family size, and here's a flat-rate payment.&quot; However, the real issue is what the payment should be. That is where things become problematic, because we might assume that there is an identikit family and we might give people a certain amount of money. Labour Members' suspicion is that if the Opposition ever got their hands on the system, the level would be too low.</p>
	<p pid="c.312.0/3">People are now much more familiar with working with computer systems and real-time benefits can take account of changing circumstances. In a sense, people expect the system to target their real needs much more carefully. Again, that comes back to the child care element. That is why it is so important and why my right hon. Friend was correct constantly to press the point about the flat-rate system versus the more flexible version.</p>
	<p pid="c.312.0/4">By providing flexibility, we make it possible for people to remain in work. That is fundamental not only to the fight against poverty, but to people's dignity, self-respect, standing in society and ability to support their children and to hold out the prospect of a better life for them and all the other things that people want to do for their families. In a previous incarnation, when I was the leader of an inner-London council during all the Tory recessions, I saw people on flat-rate benefits who lived on large council estates, and those benefits only served to keep them in poverty.</p>

	<p pid="c.313.1/1">It is not a fictitious idea, because it relates to policy choices and what has been learned from the past to inform the future. It also relates to what happens to lone parents&mdash;unemployed women bringing up children&mdash;and their prospects. I do not think that anyone&mdash;and that includes Labour Members&mdash;has referred to that key issue for the tax credit system.</p>

	<p pid="c.313.2/1">The hon. Lady rightly sets out the objectives for the system, but major problems are caused by the high degree of error and incompetence, and they would make it worth while investigating returning to a system of fixed awards. The experience of my constituents is that it is no longer worth the trouble of engaging with the tax credits system&mdash;which was set up to help them&mdash;because the incompetence has been going on for three years and they are sick of it.</p>

	<p pid="c.313.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes the fair point that if a system is constantly run down, people disengage from it. It is important therefore to ensure that the public understand that the system can make a real difference to their life chances. I accept that it is complicated, and people may need help with working their way through it. The Committee's report contains important recommendations with which, as a member of the Committee, I wholeheartedly concur. We must recognise that if we are to give people a hand up, not a hand out&mdash;to use one of our old phrases&mdash;we must ensure that we provide them with the kind of support that will help them best in their present circumstances, not the circumstances in which they were last year.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/2">The system is important because of what it has done for women, and that is why we must get the administration of it right. I take second place to nobody in criticising the administration and the amount of fraud. The system was designed to give a real chance to people on low and average incomes&mdash;and in some cases, people with fairly high earnings but large family commitments&mdash;to get children out of poverty and to provide some dignity for women who had been kept out of work and at home on benefits for many years, and it is a scandal that it is hampered by administration problems and fraud. That is why Labour Members are so concerned about the administration and why the Committee's report has received so much attention. It is certainly an excellent report.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/3">Much of the ground has already been covered and other hon. Members wish to speak, so I shall make only a few points. The staff have received much criticism, and when we visited them in Preston it was clear that they have thought a lot about the issues and learned a lot from doing so. Some of the managers had done superb jobs in sorting out their targeting and working out ways to deal with the administrative problems. That deserves to be recognised, and the staff should be congratulated on their work. The system is complex and people who are not used to it or to dealing with benefits of this type can find it difficult to come to terms with. Such problems need to be resolved, but it is important that we do not merely castigate the staff for what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/4">The report identifies various problems, but other challenges&mdash;such as the difficulty of reporting a change in circumstances&mdash;remain. The report spends a lot of time talking about how people's income can vary in-year. That is understandable when people working shifts or in temporary jobs have to adjust their hours for school holidays and so on. However, evidence gathered for the report made it clear that people's lives change. We must accept that families break up and that people find new partners. New babies get born and children grow up, moving from nursery school to their main school and then out to work.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/5">All those changes can have an impact on a person's tax credit claim. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced changes to the system in his Budget statement, and their implementation must take account of people's changing circumstances. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General is more familiar with the details than I am, but I think that one of the proposals is that a change in circumstances will have to be reported in one month rather than in three months. Staff must be geared up and ready to deal with such changes, and claimants must also be aware of what they have to do. They must be able to manage what can be quite a complicated process, as it is not always clear that a change in circumstances will be permanent.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/6">In addition, the relevant computer systems must be geared up to deal with the requirement that changes in circumstances are reported more quickly. It is important, too, that people who advise claimants understand the changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/7">The Treasury Committee also talks about the ombudsman's recommendation about an independent appeals system, and makes it clear that it wants to see a report on the practicalities involved. I hope that HMRC can look into the matter very carefully and make a report available quickly, because it is really important to ensure that a paper chase, once begun, does not proliferate.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">The hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> mentioned the arguments that people can get into, and the sequence of events is familiar to all hon. Members. When a person in receipt of a tax credit award undergoes a change in circumstances, he or she is likely to say that the award was wrong in the first place. Details of the changes are fed through the system, making the first award even more wrong and rendering incorrect any award made subsequently. The problem then is that it is very difficult to alter the first award, with the result that a paper chase begins that goes on and on. It can take an inordinately long time to resolve such a problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/9">Any appeals system has to be appropriate. It must arrive at the right decision and provide proper redress, but it also has to be quite fast. It must not add to the paper chase&mdash;it is very important that the appeals system makes things better rather than worse. I hope that the HMRC report on an independent appeals system is made available to hon. Members, and that it is prepared very quickly.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/10">My final point has to do with child care, an element in the debate that has been overlooked so far. It is important that we remember that the flexible tax credits system recognises the cost of caring for children. It is not perfect, but for the first time ever women can claim their child care costs and go out to work.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/11">In the early days of the system that led to some fraud, but the new process has helped a bit. Some problems remain, such as how to deal with holidays and what mature students with children can do about their child care costs. However, it is really important that, as we move forward, we retain the recognition that a woman might need only a small amount of money in tax credits because she can earn reasonably well, but she can earn well only if all her child care costs are paid. She might need only a few pounds a week in tax credits, but she will need &pound;100 a week or more in child care costs. I hope that that is recognised.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/12">I hope that it is also recognised that, because that is the case, I have constituents who have received huge overpayments because of the child care element. I am sure that other hon. Members have such constituents, too. I ask that that be looked at&mdash;particularly in any future proposals that the Treasury makes&mdash;to make sure that women can get their child care costs, and also that, if mistakes are made, women do not suddenly find themselves plunged into paying large amounts of money because of miscalculations on child care, especially when child care costs sometimes do not take account of holidays and some of the difficulties that women have.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/13">I know that Conservative Members do not like being told about things that happened in the past. Fortunately, it is a long time since the last Tory Government. However, I remember hundreds of people being laid off work and being put on benefits in the middle of one of the worst of the Tory recessions in Birmingham. That was in the days before computers&mdash;or before large-scale computers. The then Department of Health and Social Security system&mdash;all the offices in Birmingham&mdash;shut down in a strike because people were overloaded. It was not just that the admin did not work; it shut down completely. For about nine months, people got nothing. That was an example of the Conservative Government administering financial support to people who were out of work because of the recession that the Conservative Government created, and who were in dire poverty. The suffering was severe, which is one reason why Labour Members think twice when they hear Conservative Members talking about benefits for people on low incomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.3/14">As I say, I will be second to none in criticising maladministration and fraud in the benefits system. Will my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General make sure that we have a welfare system that does not act as a kind of opium of the masses in keeping them in unemployment, but enables people to transform their lives, go out to work and have proper child care for their children, and create a much better future for their families?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.316.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="316"  time="015:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0013.htm#06060754001739">
	<p pid="c.316.0/1">There is no perfect system of welfare. The system always involves choices. There is no utopia that we can ever hope to achieve. Because those choices have to be made, it is important that they should be debated properly and fully in Parliament. Those choices are fundamental to the designs of systems. There is the choice to provide incentives for people to stay in work&mdash;that extends in-work benefits up the income scale to the levels that we have. That is a choice that has to be made. We can have the simplicity of universalism in benefits, but that comes at a cost. All those questions need to be discussed fully and properly. What has been a bit disappointing in the contributions from Labour Members is how unwilling they have been to have a proper and open debate about the changes. Instead, they have defended a system that reflects some policy choices that can and should be questioned. The Select Committee report has done that.</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/2">It is important to address three points in particular. First, there is the question of overpayments. Secondly, there is the complexity of the system and, thirdly, there is the effect of the tax credit system on low pay. When it comes to the level of overpayments, let none of us be under any illusions. The overpayments are a direct consequence of the policy. The tax credit system is engaged in bringing together two completely different policies: the tax system, which has traditionally taken a look at income on an annual basis, and the welfare system, which takes a much shorter term&mdash;often week by week&mdash;looks at what claimants need. Needless to say, putting those two things together involves exactly the type of problems that we have seen and that are intrinsic in that system. That is why that requires debating.</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/3">Quite reasonably, the Government have recognised the problem and increased the disregard from &pound;2,500 a year to &pound;25,000. No doubt that will help to solve the problem. It is, however, important that we assess whether the change represents value for money, but the Government have consistently refused to allow us to make such an assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/4">When the disregard was set at &pound;2,500, the Treasury was able to estimate that it would cost &pound;800 million. When the disregard was increased tenfold to &pound;25,000, similar figures, miraculously, could not be produced and no assessment could be given&mdash;or so we thought. When the Public Accounts Committee questioned senior officials in Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs on the matter, it emerged, after a degree of probing, that such estimates had been produced. However, presumably because it would have been inconvenient to Treasury Ministers if the figures were disclosed, the information was not put in the public domain, although we know that it is available.</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/5">The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a well-respected think-tank that does valuable work to inform all parliamentarians about the technical aspects of the tax system, was eager to obtain the information so that it could make what, as every hon. Member would agree, would be an independent assessment of the consequences of the change, but its request was refused. HMRC sent the IFS an unbelievable letter in which it disclosed that it had information about the cost of the increased disregard, but refused, on freedom of information grounds, to give it. The letter read:</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/6" class="indent">&quot;In applying this exemption we had to balance the public interest in withholding the information against the public interest in disclosing the information.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/7">I have no idea what the public interest in withholding the information can be. If the Paymaster General wishes to explain it to me, I will be happy to take her intervention, but she is, perhaps conveniently, buried in her paperwork, as ever.</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/8">We are able to make an estimate of the figure because we know that the overpayments in the most recent financial year amounted to some &pound;1.8 billion. It is argued that the overpayments reflect several factors, of which changes to income in-year is but one, and that it is impossible to work out the situation, although calculations have been done. However, in the qualification of the annual report and accounts of the Inland Revenue, the Comptroller and Auditor General was able to make an assessment of the reasons for the overpayments. In the 2004-05 accounts, the CAG said that the</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Total overpayments for 2003/4 were mainly because family income had increased by more than the &pound;2,500 disregard&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/10">In other words, the CAG, who is an unimpeachable figure, says that the main contribution to the then &pound;2.2 billion figure, which is now &pound;1.8 billion, was in-year changes in income. If the Paymaster General wishes to correct Sir John Bourn on the record, I will happily give her the opportunity to do so, but I see, again, that she chooses not to intervene. The matter is important. If we interpret the CAG's assessment as generously as possibly by regarding &quot;mainly&quot; as constituting half the expenditure, the relevant figure is well over &pound;1 billion a year and could be as high as &pound;1.8 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.316.0/11">I said at the beginning of my speech that the welfare system involves policy choices. We should be able to debate in both Select Committee and the Chamber whether &pound;1 billion of Government expenditure is best applied to simplifying the system in such a way, or whether, for example, we should use it to increase child benefit by &pound;140 for each family, which would be an alternative. Ministers are disgracefully denying us the opportunity to exercise such scrutiny. Although I understand the political interest in doing such a thing, I do not see the public interest.</p>

	<p pid="c.318.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman reads the report, it works out that 30 per cent. of the overpayments are due to changes in income, roughly 30 per cent. due to changes in circumstances, and about 15 per cent. each to two other factors. That does not mean that there can then be a transfer into values. There is an interrelationship between the different elements, so the conclusion is wrong.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.318.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="318"  time="015:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0013.htm#06060754001743">
	<p pid="c.318.3/1">The hon. Lady is right in saying that there are different factors. That is why I referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose qualification of the accounts was based not on the number of claimants&mdash;he has no interest in that&mdash;but on value. He said that the main contribution was from in-year changes in income. That was his assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/2">There are two more deficiencies in the present system. The first is its complexity. We should be able to have a reasonable exchange of views on the complexity of the developing system without having to pretend that it is the best possible system for the best possible set of circumstances. The National Audit Office takes a balanced and reasonable view. In a report on the complexity of the benefits system that the PAC considered, the NAO said:</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/3" class="indent">&quot;We consider that an appropriate degree of complexity exists when there is an equilibrium between the system being complex enough to meet the needs of the wide range of different individuals in various circumstances, yet straightforward enough to run efficiently. Overall, in the National Audit Office's view, this equilibrium has not yet been reached.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/4">Those are the objective and independent words of the NAO. Surely Ministers should reflect on that and concede that the system is too complex and needs to be reformed so as to be more simple. If the words of Sir John Bourn do not carry much weight with Treasury Ministers, perhaps those of the Child Poverty Action Group will. Its helpful handbook on welfare benefits and tax credits has, I think, been sent to all of us, as Members of Parliament. It now runs to 1,600 pages. In this year's introduction, it says that recent</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/5" class="indent">&quot;changes...have left activists exhausted, claimants increasingly anxious about their entitlements&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/6">we have heard that from many of my hon. Friends&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/7" class="indent">&quot;and arguably, a system more fragile and complex than ever before.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/8">This cannot be seen to be a system that works.</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/9">I was concerned when the Chief Secretary seemed almost to be welcoming the ever-increasing numbers of people who are claiming tax credits. I will be the first to welcome improvements in take-up&mdash;that is to say people who are entitled to benefits taking them up&mdash;but surely it cannot be a benchmark of Government policy that more and more people coming onto state benefits should be a symptom of success. What basis of economic competitiveness is that?</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/10">Another way of thinking of record numbers of people claiming tax credits is that 7 million working people&mdash;representing 6 million families&mdash;are in jobs that are not productive enough to generate an income to keep themselves and their families without a top-up from the state. Of course, if they are not able to earn to that level, they need to have a top-up. They need to be helped, but we cannot congratulate ourselves that earnings are so low that more and more people every year require the intervention of the state so as to have a decent sum on which to live.</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/11">I endorse the view of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who, in a notable lecture to the Fabian Society, recently said:</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/12" class="indent">&quot;It is a striking fact that around half of the children living in poverty today live in a household where an adult is in work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/13">There are two reasons why people require these top-ups to sustain themselves. One reason is that they may not be productive enough&mdash;their skills may not be adequate enough to support themselves and their families. An increase in claimants for that reason is a damning indictment of what we need to do to be competitive. Again, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said:</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/14" class="indent">&quot;Whereas we today have 3.4 million unskilled jobs, it is estimated that by 2020 we will need only 600,000.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.318.3/15">It is extremely important that we increase skill levels within society.</p>

	<p pid="c.319.0/1">The conclusion of the hon. Gentleman's argument is that it is better to be unemployed and on benefits than to be in work and on benefits. However, the tax credit system is designed to support people into work, which is why they claim when they are in work.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.319.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="319"  time="015:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0013.htm#06060754001745">
	<p pid="c.319.1/1">The hon. Lady has got the wrong end of the stick. People who cannot earn enough to keep themselves deserve to be supported, but we should not congratulate ourselves, as every year, more and more people have jobs that pay so little that their earnings need to be topped up by the state. However, support should be available.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/2">Unusually for a Conservative Member, I endorse the campaign by the Transport and General Workers Union on low pay in the cleaning industry, in which it points out that, for example, 60 per cent. of cleaners employed in the City of London earn less than &pound;5.50 an hour. It is unacceptable for employers who make do very well from large profits and who depend on those services to get away with poverty pay. We should not accept such behaviour, and Government Members should not accept it either. We need to look seriously at the tax credit system and its interaction with the minimum wage if we are to address the argument of the eminent academic Jonathan Bradshaw of the university of York:</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/3" class="indent">&quot;At the moment the state is playing a vital part in supporting market earnings. At no time in our history has it had to do more...The taxpayer is providing a large subsidy to low-paying employers and no doubt many are laughing all the way to their shareholders&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/4">In conclusion, this is such an important issue that it is disappointing that the Government have complacently defended the present position. We need to debate these things more thoroughly and positively. If my words and those of of my right hon. and hon. Friends do not carry any weight with Treasury Ministers, perhaps <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the words of the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase> will do so. In March, he said that we need to</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/5" class="indent">&quot;tackle the root causes, not the symptoms. That must mean moving beyond simply correcting low wages and family poverty after the event, towards policies that spread opportunity and help people to realise their own aspirations for progress.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 710.]</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/6">Conservative Members certainly share those aspirations, and I hope that when she replies to our debate, the Paymaster General will say that the Government do so, too.</p>

	<p pid="c.320.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" name="Greg Clark">the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase>, given his apparent conversion to Labour's national minimum wage.</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/2">I welcome this debate, but the House will be relieved to learn that I wish to make only a brief contribution. Tax credits have made a huge difference to a great many families in my constituency. Earlier, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> bemoaned the citing of facts and statistics, and she urged us to focus on individuals. I am happy to do so, because she reminded me that in the last general election campaign, I ran a street stall on Denton market ground on a Sunday morning. A young mother came up to me and said, &quot;Are you Labour?&quot; Given her tone, I hesitated to reply, but I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; She said, &quot;That's okay, because your lot have made a real difference to my life. You have done so much for me and my family. The tax credits have really made a difference, and have enabled me to go out and find a job.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/3">That is the hidden success of the Government's tax credit system. Quite simply, tax credits have made work pay, and they have helped to support families financially. As the Minister said, they have helped us to lift 700,000 children out of relative poverty, which is good news that should be applauded. Yes, some of my constituents have experienced problems, and when things go wrong they often go very wrong indeed, which causes those families great concern. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall)</phrase> said, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">our right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> and others have received anecdotal evidence of fewer tax credit problems than in earlier years. Having worked in my predecessor's constituency office, and having dealt with many of those tax credit problems myself, I can confirm that there has been a substantial reduction in cases, although there are still some issues that need to be resolved. I have every confidence that they will be.</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/4">I welcome the changes being put in place by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, which will alleviate some of the problems in the system, not least with the increase in the disregard for earnings between one tax year and the next from &pound;2,500 to &pound;25,000. That will reduce the overpayments substantially once the measure is fully implemented, as has been acknowledged by speakers in all parts of the House. People whose circumstances have changed and who currently get caught up in the system should not get caught up in future. That is surely to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/5">I am working to resolve the cases that my constituents have brought to me, and I will continue to do so, as I am sure other hon. Members will do. I re-emphasise what tax credits mean to many people. Tax credits benefit 6 million families. In my constituency, Denton and Reddish, that amounts to 7,600 families in receipt of family tax credit and 12,600 in receipt of child tax credit. Those are often lower paid families who struggled to survive under the Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/6">For all the difficulties that there were and are in the system, that extra money is making a fantastic difference to a great many families in Denton and Reddish and throughout the country. It is most certainly not <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the shambles that the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> described. Yes, let us iron out the problems, but let us also be proud of this good policy&mdash;a redistributive policy, a Labour policy and one that is lifting families out of poverty and giving people opportunities to secure work. I am proud of that and I want to see those principles continue into the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/7">Despite the apparent conversion today of those on the Opposition Front Bench, I do not</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/8" class="indent">&quot;long for a Chancellor who...introduces a Budget which abolishes all of Brown's endless reliefs and credits&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/9">as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> does. That would be a retrograde step and it would be a disaster for that young mum on Denton market and thousands like her in Denton and Reddish, Greater Manchester and throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="c.321.0/1">It will take me just three minutes to get my views across in this interesting debate. I am sad that the Chancellor is not present to hear some of the comments, and that it has taken the Conservatives to bring the issues to the fore. We listened with interest to the Chief Secretary, but one can always tell when a Minister is on the back foot. Rather than answer the questions put to him by the shadow Chancellor, the hon. Gentleman went on to attack what a Conservative Government might or might not do in the future. He failed to explain why about half of those who apply for tax credits do not receive the correct amount. He failed to explain why the overpayment threshold has been changed from &pound;2,500 and increased tenfold to &pound;25,000, and the consequences of that to the taxpayer. On a personal note, he also failed to explain why his own constituency is among those that fare worst in the tables published last week.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/2">We have a benefits system that is getting worse, not better, getting more complicated, not simpler, and costing more, not less. It has taken the Conservatives to bring the matter to the Floor of the House. It is interesting that Mr. Speaker decided to throw out the amendments to the motion because they were not worthy. We wanted to discuss issues of overpayment, fraud and incompetence in the administration of the tax system. We wanted the Chancellor to reply, since he created the system in the first place, but he is not here.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/3">In their amendment the Government usually cite a great many statistics. I am glad to hear that some of the &pound;15 billion that is being spent on the tax system is going to some places, but with just under half the people not getting the right amount, there are clearly questions to be answered. They were not answered today. I hope that the shadow Chancellor will have the wisdom to call another debate when the Chancellor can fit it into his diary and be present in the Chamber. However, the Government have been forced in their amendment, which has been thrown out, to acknowledge that there are IT problems and that there have been administration cock-ups, and to acknowledge the need for more changes yet again in a system that the Chancellor created.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/4">We have had enough renaming, rebranding and restructuring. We need a radical overhaul of the tax system, with a programme that simplifies it to its core, that is revenue neutral and that reduces the gap between the cost of paying a tax and the amount of tax collected. Until we go down that road, more and more of the &pound;15 billion that has been spent every year will be wasted.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.322.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" speakername="Mark Francois" colnum="322"  time="016:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0014.htm#06060754001748">
	<p pid="c.322.0/1">It is a genuine pleasure to sum up the debate today for Her Majesty's Opposition and to highlight what has become the shambles of the tax credits system as administered by the Government. The system now costs some &pound;16 billion a year, or the equivalent of 5p on the standard rate of income tax. It incorporates some 6 million families, of which some 2 million were overpaid in 2004-05, while at the same time just under 1 million families were underpaid. In other words, nearly half of all the payments in the entire system were incorrect. I therefore welcome the Chief Secretary's admission that the system has serious problems, and his acceptance this afternoon that there is now &quot;a consensus&quot; that tax credits should be retained. It was important that the Government accepted that there was a consensus to retain them, and we welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/2">However, the tax credits system, as it is currently configured, is seriously flawed. It is prone to fraud and it is also far too complicated, to the extent that many of the claimants who use it do not fully understand what they are claiming, many of the staff who administer it do not really comprehend it properly, and it is all based around a computer system that itself is highly unreliable, as was brought out clearly in the typically punchy contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase>. That serves only to compound the mistakes in the system itself.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/3">The Government's defence, as outlined in their hurried written statement that was rushed out on Monday, is essentially that the package of remedial measures announced in the December pre-Budget report will put things right. But six months on, they still refuse to tell the House what the package will really cost, and even then, they admit that this will reduce the overpayments by only a third, so well over 1 million families will still be overpaid even when the package is fully up and running. The PBR package does not address the problems at the heart of the current system&mdash;namely, its excessive complexity and its dependence on unreliable information technology. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Chief Secretary has returned just in time for me to welcome his acknowledgement of our consensus. In effect, the PBR package is an attempt to place a sticking plaster over what has become a gaping wound.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/4">Since the new, and supposedly more flexible, system was introduced in 2003, a series of independent reports has subsequently criticised the operation of the Chancellor's system. In June 2005, after receiving thousands of individual complaints about the new system, the parliamentary ombudsman produced a report that concluded:</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/5" class="indent">&quot;A review of all the cases referred to the Ombudsman shows that the greatest difficulties are suffered by the core group that the tax credit system is aimed at helping, mainly families on low incomes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/6">In September 2005, the Public Accounts Committee looked at the system and attacked its complexity. It concluded:</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The Government intended the new tax credits to provide a system that was simple for people to understand and to administer. In practice, many people have found the scheme difficult to understand. Many have complained to the Inland Revenue about the system and the frustration and misery it has caused to claimants.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/8">We heard that reflected on both sides of the House in our debate this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/9">In January 2006, after reviewing the ombudsman's findings, the Public Administration Committee delivered the following damning verdict on the IT system, which underlines the current tax credits system. It said:</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/10" class="indent">&quot;We are concerned that the IT system which is supposed to enable an efficient delivery of the scheme has in fact been a root cause, first of creating some of the problems which have led to the criticism and complaints about the scheme and then of acting as a barrier to resolving them quickly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/11">Then, in April 2006, we had a scathing report by the Public Accounts Committee that looked at the fraud and errors in the system, including overpayments that totalled &pound;1.8 billion in 2004-05. It concluded:</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The Department does not have reliable or up to date information on levels of claimant error and fraud in tax credits. The absence of this information and its analysis seriously impairs the Department's management of the schemes and its ability to safeguard taxpayers' money&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/13">Despite that, Ministers at all levels in the Treasury keep trying to insist in the media that the system is working well.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/14">Can the Paymaster General tell us the true extent of the fraud that is now inherent in the tax credits system? We were promised those figures in the spring&mdash;let us have them now. Picking up on what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" name="Greg Clark">my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase> cleverly pointed out, we still have not had the cost of the tenfold increase in the disregard, and we are now told that it is not in the public interest to tell us, as elected Members of Parliament, what that figure is. Will the Paymaster General tell us why?</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/15">Only yesterday we had, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall)</phrase> said, a very objective report from the Treasury Committee, which looked in great detail at the administration of the system and concluded:</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/16" class="indent">&quot;It is obvious to us that the Paymaster General's account makes no reference to causes of overpayments which have arisen as a consequence of the Department's own processes&mdash;for example official error and IT systems error. Rather, the Paymaster General has referred only to those causes of overpayments which can be attributed to claimant error or omission, or to the design of the tax credits regime, or a combination of both.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/17">All these critical reports, in just two years, represent a litany of failure, and it is a failure lodged firmly on the doorstep of No. 11 Downing street.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/18">There is also a growing consensus among the voluntary sector that the current system does not work properly. As we have heard, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux&mdash;citizens advice bureaux now advise tax credit claimants as a major part of their work load&mdash;provided a frank commentary on the problems in the system:</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/19" class="indent">&quot;Last year Citizens Advice Bureaux across the UK advised on around 150,000 tax credit problems. CAB experience is that the recovery of overpayments has caused significant hardship to many families as payments have stopped without warning or explanation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/20">Whereas, for those who read <i> The Guardian</i>, the Reverend Paul Nicholas, chairman of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, was quoted in the paper this week as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/21" class="indent">&quot;Enforcement is driven by computers that have no means of identifying the illiterate, blind, disabled, mentally or chronically ill&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/22">and in some cases, even dead. He concludes that</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/23" class="indent">&quot;an overpayment of tax credits can lead to a downward spiral of a family's fortunes into a morass of debt.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/24">Even the Fabian Society has acknowledged that the system is not working. In its report, &quot;Narrowing the Gap&quot;, issued earlier this year, it admitted that the system had faults and that tax credits were associated with &quot;complexity and administrative problems&quot;. Now it has a sleeper within the Treasury arguing that agenda, as the report was launched by none other than the Economic Secretary&mdash;and where is he?</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/25">It needs to be remembered that this system was established to assist people on low incomes. In many cases, it is doing precisely the opposite. It needs to be reformed in order to continue to provide help to people who need it but without driving them to distraction in the process. As far as the current configuration of tax credits is concerned, the Treasury is shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic, with the Economic Secretary particularly desperate to get one before they all disappear.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/26">Perhaps the greatest irony of all is that the architect of this system is the Chancellor himself, who famously said in the mid-1990s that he wanted to abolish means-testing. Yet the current system is the apotheosis of that concept, against which there is now an overwhelming consensus that it needs to be reformed. The Prime Minister referred at Prime Minister's questions earlier this afternoon to: &quot;Working families tax credit, which makes work pay for people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/27">Working families tax credit was abolished three years ago. That is the old system. We are debating the new one. The Chancellor has created a system that is so complicated that even the Prime Minister does not understand it, so what hope is there for a single mother, who perhaps has not had a strong financial education, living on a run-down council estate struggling to fill in the forms and deal with the bureaucracy that the Select Committee identified?</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/28">The greatest shame is that the system was the Chancellor's personal creation. It was his pet project above all others. Yet when the day came for him to be held to account, what did the iron Chancellor do? He ran away. Unusually, the Government's amendment has not been selected, so hon. Members have a clear choice. They can put up with the shambles that is the current system, and go along with the fact that the Chancellor invented it but would not come and defend it, or they can join us in the Lobby and protest against a system that drives ordinary working families to distraction. I hope that they will do the latter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.325.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" speakeroffice="The Paymaster General"  colnum="325"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0014.htm#06060754001749">
	<p pid="c.325.0/1">We have had another interesting debate on tax credits. As always, the Conservatives miss the point&mdash;about tackling child poverty, helping those with volatile incomes and helping people into work.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/2">I welcome the Treasury Committee report and congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall)</phrase>, not only on steering through that helpful contribution to the general debate, but on presenting the outstanding issues so comprehensively and in such a considered way today.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/3">The debate divided into two halves. The first dealt with administration and the second considered a flexible system&mdash;the tax credit system as it is now&mdash;versus a fixed system. I shall revert to those points later.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/4">My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire specifically mentioned the pause or the 30 days and the appeals process. I shall respond to those points shortly. He also made it clear that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs must put the needs of the claimants first. I agree with him and the Committee. He also said that there must be a shift in the fundamental culture of HMRC if tax credits are to be a success. I agree with him about that and so does the Department, as the report acknowledges.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> congratulated the staff on their commitment and recognition of the challenges and the changes that they needed to make.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">The hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> made several things absolutely clear but I shall pick on one of them. He said that the system was about people. I could not agree more. He knows that I have made it clear both in private meetings and in exchanges across the Floor that it is crucial to do what needs to be done to take forward a basically sound policy and ensure that its administration is right.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North also highlighted the challenges that remained to be met of the changing circumstances that people experience in their lives and the accuracy and swiftness of the Department's response. She made important points about child care, to which I want to refer.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1531" name="Andrew Gwynne">My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> echoed the point about the important contribution that tax credits have made in his constituency and in constituencies throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/9">Let us be clear: the tax credits deliver three key achievements. They improve incentives to work, they reduce tax on low to middle income families, they help dramatically to reduce child poverty and they have played a major role in helping people into work and to move up the employment ladder, ensuring that work pays over benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/10">I am not surprised that a party that presided over doubling child poverty when in power attaches so little credit to those achievements. When we seek a consensus in the Chamber&mdash;the consensus to which my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire referred&mdash;it is to get all Opposition parties to commit themselves to the principle of eradicating child poverty and the practical means of achieving that. Every time the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats were challenged by Labour Members this afternoon, they were unable to say how they would match the huge contribution that tax credits have made to this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/11">Let us remind ourselves of that contribution. A couple with two children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will be &pound;41 a week better off, compared with &pound;34 in 1997. A lone parent&mdash;and I can assure hon. Members that they can read and write&mdash;with two children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will be &pound;76 a week better off, compared with &pound;54 in 1997. A single person without children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will be &pound;58 a week better off, compared with &pound;39 a week in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/12">Tax credits are central to reducing the tax on low and middle-income families, as the recent OECD study shows. The tax paid by a couple with two children earning &pound;21,000 a year has fallen from 17.3 per cent. of gross earnings in 1997 to 9.8 per cent. in 2004. That is the lowest rate in any G7 country. In the UK, a single-earner family with two children can now earn just under two thirds of the average wage before they start to pay any tax. Those are the benefits of tax credits. That is the contribution that is being made by a policy that the Treasury Committee unanimously agreed in principle was the right way to proceed. It has reduced poverty and raised children out of living on absolute low incomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/13">Are families responding to this in a positive way? We have only to look at the take-up figures to see the answer. In the first year, 93 per cent. of families on an annual income below &pound;10,000&mdash;that is low pay by any definition&mdash;claimed their entitlement, compared with 50 per cent. in the early years of family income supplement, and 57 per cent. for family credit.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/14">My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire asked about appeals and about the pause. On the latter point, the Department entirely supports in principle the ombudsman's recommendation to give taxpayers notice before commencing recovery&mdash;the so-called 30 days&mdash;and we are considering how we can integrate such a pause into the information technology system without jeopardising it. On appeals, we are exploring with the adjudicator's office the feasibility of introducing a fast-track process to provide claimants with the timely, accurate response that my right hon. Friend described. We have done that in close consultation with the ombudsman, who circulated a letter to every Member of this House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase> stating:</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Since I published that report, my staff and I have had regular discussions at senior level with staff in the Revenue, including the Tax Credit Office and the Adjudicator's Office.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/16">Those matters are being taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/17">The key objective in tackling poverty is to consider how the needs of families&mdash;especially low-income families&mdash;change, and how we can respond to those changes. We know that their incomes are volatile. More than a quarter of households analysed by Professor John Hills had erratic and high levels of income changes. The statistics for tax credits show that 1 million families saw their income fall between 2003 and 2004, and 700,000 of them would have been worse off under a fixed system. We would have to bear that in mind if we went back to a fixed award system. They would not have received the extra money that tax credits provide for them. We need that flexibility, and of course that means that there sometimes has to be an end of year adjustment. Let us keep this in perspective, however. Fifty-four per cent. of the overpayments are less than &pound;500, and 31 per cent. are less than &pound;200.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/18">In 1997, only 800,000 families received family credit; 6 million now receive tax credits. In 1997, only 50 per cent. take-up was achieved; now take-up is 93 per cent. among the poorest families. Today the income tax liability of 3 million families has been effectively wiped out by tax credits which ensure that they can use their money to spend on their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.0/19">The consensus that we seek today is one that includes the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. We seek a commitment to the eradication of child poverty, a commitment to recognising that people have volatile incomes, and a commitment to willing the means. Today the Conservatives failed in that regard. That is no surprise in the case of a party that presided over child poverty in the 1990s.</p>

</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.332.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="332"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0015.htm#06060754002260">
	<p pid="c.332.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="c.332.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House takes note of the immense contribution to society made by those honoured during the recent Volunteers Week and forthcoming Carers Week; recognises and values the significant economic and social benefits resulting from the work of volunteers and carers, often performed in difficult circumstances requiring the most selfless qualities; further notes the need to ensure that the fewest possible barriers are placed before those wanting to volunteer and act as carers; believes that encouragement should be given to all, especially the young, to consider volunteering as a contribution to the welfare of a healthy society; and expresses its thanks to all those who act as role models for volunteering and caring.</p>
	<p pid="c.332.1/3">I am delighted to have the privilege of leading this afternoon's debate on a matter close to the heart of virtually every Member. Its purpose is to honour those involved in volunteering and caring in society by using mainstream time on the Floor of the House to demonstrate how important their contribution is to all hon. Members. We have therefore taken the opportunity offered by volunteers week and carers week to do precisely that. We want to recognise the immense, varied and significant contribution made by individuals throughout the country who participate in volunteering and caring and to register the extent of their commitment and the contribution that they make.</p>
	<p pid="c.332.1/4">I trust that we can explore current issues facing volunteering and caring, consider the barriers that still need to be overcome to make the most effective use of people and their time and examine how life can be made easier for those involved. Finally, I hope that we can look to the future and raise issues that the recently announced Commission on the Future of Volunteering will examine over the next 12 months. I have little doubt that the debate will be well informed by all hon. Members and that we will hear about the personal experiences of some of the remarkable people we have met who are involved in these activities. I intend to concentrate on volunteering, leaving <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> to talk in greater detail about the work of carers when he winds up the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.332.1/5">There is no typical volunteer in this country. People who give up their time to help others come from all sections of the community, are of all ages and come from all cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Despite the dreadful story in the newspapers this morning of the poor child left calling for help in the middle of the road after being struck by a car, the instinct to help one's neighbour is one of the deepest human ones imaginable.</p>
	<p pid="c.332.1/6">Members of Parliament have many privileges, as journalists are frequently keen to remind us, but one of the privileges rarely reported is the opportunity that we have to observe some of the finer instincts of members of our community. A typical MP's diary of time spent in the constituency will reveal visits to those involved in some of the most selfless activities, which all too rarely command national headlines. Our local newspapers make an excellent, if too often unsung, contribution, and often provide the recognition necessary to enable a community to appreciate that the picture of national collapse&mdash;an inference too often drawn from some appalling incident&mdash;is not the reality of life for everyone.</p>
	<p pid="c.332.1/7">Before we consider individual stories, let us gain some sense of how important the voluntary sector is to this country. I am indebted to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and Stuart Etherington for their statistical analysis and work on this matter. The latest information available shows that the voluntary and community sector, as best it can be defined, has an income of more than &pound;26 billion. Its work force is sizeable, at some 600,000, but the number who volunteer&mdash;defined as giving unpaid help through groups, clubs and organisations to benefit other people or the environment&mdash;is staggering. Some 29 per cent. of our community take part in formal volunteering at least once a month and 44 per cent. at least once a year. Half of our population has volunteered, formally or informally, at least once a month, which is equivalent to more than 20 million people in England and Wales.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.333.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1751" speakername="Derek Conway" colnum="333"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0015.htm#06060754002261">
	<p pid="c.333.0/1">My hon. Friend's support for the voluntary sector is renowned in the House and I am delighted that he is opening the debate. Will he recall that volunteers in the animal welfare sector&mdash;especially the 10,000 who do so for the organisation to which I am connected, Cats Protection&mdash;make a commitment not once a week or once a month but, because they are dealing with live animals, every day? Those who volunteer to help animals, especially cats and dogs, make a seven-day-a-week commitment, and it is all the more remarkable for it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.333.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="333"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0015.htm#06060754002262">
	<p pid="c.333.1/1">In a typically feline intervention, my hon. Friend uses his personal knowledge, as many other hon. Members will do in this debate, to highlight another corner of national life in which volunteers and carers are involved. It is remarkable that hardly any facet of our national and community life does not involve selfless giving by people, and my hon. Friend's valuable work and expertise in his area is recognised. It is right for him to say what he said.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.333.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1694" speakername="Andy Reed" colnum="333"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0015.htm#06060754002263">
	<p pid="c.333.2/1">I do not wish to diminish the work done by a wide variety of organisations, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will mention many of them, but will he recognise that 26 per cent. of all volunteers work in sport? Some 6 million people volunteer in sport regularly, and I speak with a slight vested interest as chair of the National Strategic Partnership for Volunteering in Sport, which brings them all together. The hon. Gentleman could also give us some indication of his own prowess at sport with his run earlier today in the Westminster mile.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.333.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="333"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0015.htm#06060754002264">
	<p pid="c.333.3/1">Unaccustomed as I am to talking of my activities in the parliamentary football team or other sports, I nevertheless seem to recall that I was a minute ahead of the hon. Gentleman this afternoon, in an event graced again by an astonishing performance by the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" name="Jim Murphy">the hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>, who did the mile for Sport Relief in 5 minutes and 35 seconds&mdash;an extremely creditable performance.</p>
	<p pid="c.333.3/2">Colleagues will know from their constituency work that remarkable things can be done with sport. It touches all parts of society, including the most needy people. Time given up for sport is exceptionally valuable, but that brings us to one of the problems of modern life. People used to live and work in more or less the same area, finishing work at a reasonable time and going home for tea at 5 o'clock. They were therefore able to go out and support a sports club or train a team in the evening. These days, however, people work further away and get home much later. They are more tired and more committed to their work, so it is harder for them to offer the support for sport that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1694" name="Andy Reed">the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed)</phrase> mentioned. We should pay a special tribute to those who work with youngsters in sports teams and who thus make an immense contribution.</p>

	<p pid="c.334.0/1">My hon. Friend has visited my constituency several times, and knows that it is a rural area that does not have as many sporting facilities as other places. However, we are rich in mums and dads and other volunteers prepared to give up their time in the middle of the week and at weekends, in all sorts of weather. I am thinking of George Hibbert of the Clitheroe Wolves, who helps more than 450 young boys and girls to play football on a regular basis, and of Farouk Hussain, who gives up his time in the middle of the week to help youngsters play cricket. Without such people, young people in rural areas would not have the same opportunity to play sport.</p>

	<p pid="c.334.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. He makes the point that voluntary activity to help disadvantaged people is not confined to urban areas but is also effective in rural areas. He mentions the time commitment required of those who work and train with youngsters in the way described by the hon. Member for Loughborough. I pay tribute to the people in my hon. Friend's constituency who devote so much time to that&mdash;and especially to those who are working to build up yet another wonderful Lancashire cricket team that will win more trophies.</p>
	<p pid="c.334.1/2">What is the economic worth of voluntary activity, quite apart from the personal and social benefits that it confers? People who volunteer formally tend to spend about eight hours a month on voluntary work. That adds up to 1.9 billion hours of work&mdash;about the same as that done by 1 million full-time workers. At the national average wage, that contribution is worth &pound;22 billion a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.334.1/3">There is no possibility that that amount of effort could be taken over by the state or people in the paid sector. It could not be afforded, so the voluntary contribution that people make constitutes an exceptional addition to this country's national life. We should all salute and celebrate it.</p>

	<p pid="c.334.2/1">My hon. Friend has set out the undoubted economic benefit accruing from voluntary work, but does he agree that the long-term, one-on-one personal care devoted to some of the most vulnerable people in our society by people in the voluntary sector&mdash;including but not exclusively those in the faith communities&mdash; could never be replicated by the state? The voluntary sector provides a great saving, but the quality of the care that is given could never be delivered by the state, no matter how well it was intended. Is not that the real benefit of what the voluntary sector provides?</p>

	<p pid="c.335.0/1">There are some remarkable examples of the personal care provided by people in both the voluntary and state sectors. Those of our public sector workers who work with the most distressed individuals make a substantial contribution, but there is something special about people who do something that is not part of their job. Volunteering adds an extra dimension to their lives, as we have all seen.</p>
	<p pid="c.335.0/2">For two years in the 1990s, I had the great honour to be the Minister with responsibility for people with disabilities. In that role, I came into contact with some exceptional people. I met people struggling with disabilities and overcoming circumstances that would be unimaginable to most of us, and I also met their carers, who were prepared to put in an extraordinary amount of time. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> is absolutely right to recognise the contribution that such people make.</p>
	<p pid="c.335.0/3">I have mentioned the economic impact of those who work in the voluntary sectors, but I now turn to carers specifically. About 6 million people in the UK look after someone who is frail, sick or disabled. The care that they provide is unpaid. Many do not identify themselves as carers because the care that they give is to a family member. Three in five of us will become a carer at some stage in our lifetime and 301,000 people are becoming carers each year. If each carer worked for 20 hours a week&mdash;1.25 million carers currently work for more than 50 hours a week and the Department of Health estimates that more than 400,000 carers combine a full-time job with more than 20 hours of caring a week&mdash;that collective output would dwarf the NHS's 1 million-strong work force. That is how much we depend on our extraordinary carers.</p>

	<p pid="c.335.1/1">Everybody in the House shares the sentiments that are being expressed on both sides of the House. I certainly agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> about the special nature of voluntary care, but I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon.

	<p pid="c.335.2/1">Absolutely. I hope that I made that clear when I responded to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon. There should not be any sense of competition. We know that a number of people feel a calling to work in the public service. Some of us do that through politics, and we all know people in our constituencies who do it, whether in the health service, teaching or care. Some people feel called to give their lives in an extraordinary way and do so through their work; some people, because they work in a different sector, give their lives in a different way. There is no sense of competition.</p>
	<p pid="c.335.2/2">That builds to an extraordinary national sense. We are talking about something that makes us the country that we are. That is why the story in the newspaper this morning was so shocking. It goes against everything in all our natures, and in the natures of the vast majority of people we come across, that someone in distress could be left. That still makes one stop and think when one travels abroad to a country where the extent of poverty is so great and the cheapness of human life is rather greater. One sees children in some degree of agony being left on the side of the road because no one can afford to care. That should not happen here. We build into our national life that sense of people being involved&mdash;either through their working lives or their voluntary lives.</p>

	<p pid="c.336.1/1">It is exactly as the hon. Lady says. It is still a sign of hope that the national reaction has been so intense and that we all recognise that behaviour as abhorrent. The worry is that, over the years, experience has tended to show that a dreadful story one year might become commonplace the next. We are all striving to avoid that.</p>
	<p pid="c.336.1/2">I know that a number of Members will seek to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to talk about people in their constituency or their experiences of volunteering with others, so that the House can get a flavour of what is behind the statistics. Volunteers week has been taken up by colleagues on this side of the House&mdash;as I am sure that it has been on the other side&mdash;as a particular opportunity to take part in or support voluntary activities. My colleagues have been involved in quite a range of activities. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1737" name="Henry Bellingham">My hon.

They are playing in Germany in a round-robin tournament that involves other teams comprising fans supporting Germany or England. My hon. Friend lent a hand when some of that squad showed the giant banner that they have created in this country, which they intend to give to their German hosts. All of us in this place could come up with equally interesting stories and I hope that we do.</p>

	<p pid="c.337.3/1">My hon. Friend's expertise with his local newspapers is well known, especially by hon. Members who attend the end-of-term Adjournment debates, when he regularly wins the prize for naming the most constituents and linking them with his local papers. He makes a fair point about the difficulties that we have when choosing from among the causes that we are asked to support.</p>
	<p pid="c.337.3/2">As far as my experience of support volunteering week is concerned&mdash;I raise this as an example of something in which we are all involved&mdash;I express my thanks to Gary Bishop, who is a church leader in Openshaw, Manchester, in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the constituency of the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase>. Gary is involved in the Eden project, which is a Christian-based initiative that has been operating in Manchester for several years. The project is especially extraordinary because it has asked young people to commit up to five years of their lives to live and work in some of the most deprived communities in the city. That enables them to become part of the community so that they can stimulate and support the personal and human development that is often necessary in places where there has been little family stability and where hopes and aspirations can be low, with self-esteem lower still.</p>
	<p pid="c.337.3/3">The name of Bob Holman is known to many hon. Members because of his work on poverty. He identified that one of the key features of estates in difficulty is that when anyone gets a job or tries to improve themselves, they move out of the estate, thus depriving it of natural community leaders and people who might provide stability and focus for others. His life of commitment in Easterhouse in Glasgow has been the inspiration for many, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase>, whose work on social justice is proving to be a significant contribution to politics.</p>
	<p pid="c.337.3/4">Members of the Eden project are working in Manchester in much the same way. Two of the estates in the area are classified as the 11th and 12th most deprived areas out of the 32,482 in the United Kingdom. Through a series of projects&mdash;including supporting mothers and children, home visiting, parents survival and family intervention, working with youths in clubs and on the streets, and providing after-school clubs, Sunday supper clubs and other opportunities&mdash;the Eden project and those who work with it are putting their time and effort into unglamorous and difficult work. It can be harder to ask volunteers to give their time to some projects than others. There are six staff, but 30 volunteers. Each of their stories is inspirational, but they would acknowledge that they are only representative of many more people working throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.337.3/5">Pete had the call to move from Leicester to Manchester to be involved in the community. He works in a Sure Start project and gives spare time to the community. Hannah is married to Gary. She came to Manchester, where she qualified as a nurse. Her daily work is as a district nurse in the area of need, but she still finds time to volunteer as a family support worker, when she works mostly with people with drug or alcohol misuse problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.337.3/6">Unlike those who have moved from other areas to Manchester, Sinead, at 18, has always lived in the community. She got involved with Eden when it began to work with her and her friends, and now she is qualified as a nursery nurse, but spends extra time volunteering with families and children in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.337.3/7">Shannon, at 15, is even younger and is still at school, yet she has learned that she has a gift for working with and leading other youngsters in the area. I think that the project, and the work being done by Andy Hawthorn and others in Manchester, is remarkable, given the commitment that they have shown in becoming embedded in an area.</p>
	<p pid="c.337.3/8">What has brought these volunteers to work in that place is no different from what has brought others to work in other areas&mdash;they recognise the need to help others. At the same time, they say how much they themselves have grown and developed through contributing voluntarily: getting involved with a simple and often repeated statement. They aim to ensure that their work is sustainable. Being able to lead youngsters such as Shannon and Sinead into positions of responsibility is a key objective. It is not merely that an elastoplast is being applied to the wound. These volunteers are participating in long-term care and recovery.</p>
	<p pid="c.337.3/9">Although the multiple problems that the estate and those who live on it may face can be daunting at times, volunteers gain strength from working with each other and supporting each other through difficult times. I suspect that that is a common feature among those who work in difficult areas of society.</p>

	<p pid="c.338.0/1">I have also visited the Eden project. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that one of the project's most impressive points is that unlike some of us who volunteer&mdash;I help with my local Beavers group; we go in, we do it and we go away&mdash;the commitment shown by the volunteers whom we are talking about is that they live in the communities in which they aim to serve. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we should try to replicate such a model as far as possible? It is not something that we can force, but would not it be great if the hope that such Christian groups have fostered in being part of the communities in which they serve could be models for the future?</p>

	<p pid="c.339.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The commitment shown is extraordinary. The number of people who can make such a commitment is limited, but there is no doubt about what these people provide by physically being present in an area and staying in it. Those who live in some of the most difficult places in our society get used to seeing other people for a short period. A social worker moves on; someone who is trusted takes a different job. There is nothing wrong with that, but the more that people can stay and be consistently identified as points of stability in difficult areas, the better. If more projects can see that as a model, that will make a tremendous contribution.</p>

	<p pid="c.339.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has referred to some young people involved in volunteering. Is that not an important point to be made in the debate? So much media coverage of young people is focused on antisocial behaviour, hoodies and all the associated problems. I acknowledge that these problems exist, but would it not be appropriate to have a more balanced view of young people, so many of whom, especially through school, perhaps, work hard to raise money and raise the profile of many issues? For example, in Bedfordshire we know of the tsunami appeal, Work Africa, African Children and teaching and work on AIDS. Is not that an important aspect of volunteering? Young people can involve themselves in thinking beyond their immediate needs and wants and take on board the needs and wants of others.</p>

	<p pid="c.339.2/1">The hon. Gentleman correctly identifies one of the privileges that we have that all too often others do not. We are lucky in that we see many youngsters&mdash;good youngsters in our community&mdash;who far outweigh the number of those who cause difficulties. We are lucky enough to see them at work. I pay tribute to our local newspapers, which tend to highlight good youngsters rather more than national newspapers. It is always easy to criticise and to pick up the things that go wrong. Nationally, to value our youngsters who are working so hard, would do us all a great deal of good.</p>

	<p pid="c.339.3/1">Right hon. and hon. Members often pay lip service in Treasury questions to a light-touch approach to regulation, monitoring and inspection of small and medium-sized enterprises for fear of stifling initiative. Is there not strong power in the voluntary sector as well, where legislators should step in with great reluctance, ensuring proportionate protection for children and others involved in voluntary bodies through the Criminal Records Bureau and other bodies? Is there not a risk that we can stifle community spirit by excessive interference and involvement from the centre?</p>

	<p pid="c.340.0/1">The telepathy between good friends and near neighbours has worked again. The hon. Gentleman anticipates the next section of my speech, which will deal with some of the barriers and problems that affect those who volunteer. He is right to raise the issue and I shall now focus on it. I say a final thank you to those who I spent time with on Sunday and Monday, to the mums and toddlers' clubs, to Nicky who reintroduced me to Play-Doh after many years of absence, as my own children have grown up. I thank all of those people in that community as an example of those who are doing so much.</p>
	<p pid="c.340.0/2">As the hon. Gentleman has just said, there are barriers to volunteering. I shall touch on them briefly, as time is short. Surprisingly, one of those barriers is disagreement about the value of volunteering, as not everyone believes in the importance of volunteering. The &quot;NCVO's Vision for the Future&quot;, which was published in September 2005, said that in many cases volunteers have accepted the role of junior partner when, in fact, they should have been prepared to make their case more strongly. It said:</p>
	<p pid="c.340.0/3" class="indent">&quot;We have a tendency to undervalue ourselves, particularly our value to government. If we genuinely believe that we should have a voice on the biggest issues facing our society then we need to have the courage of our convictions. We need to break through the boundaries that others place around us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.340.0/4">We do not undervalue the sector, and it is important that we ensure that volunteering is not considered an amateur pursuit. People who volunteer should be proud to do so. They deserve our respect, and our debate should highlight that.</p>
	<p pid="c.340.0/5">Regulation and bureaucracy are more difficult problems. The delicate issue of checks by the Criminal Records Bureau gives rise to a clash of principles, as no one would wish volunteers with access to some of the most personal aspects of people's lives to misuse that confidence. People who rely on the services of volunteers should be sure about them, and a cloud of suspicion should not hang over them. CRB checks provide clearance, but the bureaucracy involved is sometimes overbearing. Many volunteering organisations do not know when or why they need to check volunteers, or when they do not need to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.340.0/6">There are different levels of CRB checks, and it is not always certain which level is necessary. My wife is not an untypical example: she has three separate CRB clearances&mdash;two at a high level, and one at a lower level. She chairs the Bedford branch of Home Start&mdash;an excellent scheme that assists vulnerable families nationwide&mdash;as well as working in the local church and at a school with children. A total of &pound;100 has been spent on obtaining those clearances. That expenditure is multiplied for volunteers throughout the country, but it could be used for other purposes. At least two of the checks on my wife were unnecessary, and there should be a platform of check on which to build if someone needs to move from a lower-level clearance to a higher-level one. The cost and the obscure nature of the checks are a barrier to volunteers and voluntary groups. They are a barrier, too, to developing projects that involve contact with vulnerable groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.340.0/7">That problem, among others, was picked up by the Better Regulation Task Force in its report of November 2005, &quot;Better Regulations for Civil Society&mdash; Making Life Easier for Those Who Help Others&quot;. Its seventh recommendation dealt specifically with the CRB checks, and I should be grateful if Ministers told us, either in response to my opening contribution or at the end of the debate, whether we can expect an explanation for the slow progress in responding to those recommendations. I have been in touch with the Better Regulation Commission, which is disappointed by the time it has taken to receive a response. We all appreciate that the Home Office is under pressure, but it would be helpful to reform CRB checks and implement the recommendations of the taskforce, so we would appreciate a progress report.</p>

	<p pid="c.341.0/1">My hon. Friend's remarks on the CRB checks are timely, as a few days ago I received a letter from a constituent who recently was subject to seven separate checks. That is not unusual, as many volunteers volunteer for many organisations, so any steps that can be taken to ensure that that needless duplication is ended would be welcome.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.341.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="341"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0016.htm#06060754002284">
	<p pid="c.341.1/1">My hon. Friend is quite right. I cannot foresee any objections to his proposal&mdash;it is simply a matter of streamlining the system and making sure that each individual has a single reference number so that checks are carried through from one voluntary role to another. If they need to move up a level, they should be able to do so. The problem that my hon. Friend highlighted has been experienced by other people, so we must deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/2">Closely related to issues opened up by the problem of CRB checks is the general culture of risk aversion, which now affects many organisations working with the public. In an excellent speech last year, Justin Davis Smith, the deputy chief executive of Volunteering England, addressed the problem directly. He said that</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/3" class="indent">&quot;we must avoid the temptation to overstate the case, but the warning signs are there...a volunteer movement without risk is a contradiction in terms and one not worth having.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/4">Volunteering England surveyed various organisations about the issue of whether compensation culture was a myth or reality. Nine in 10 voluntary organisations believed that the UK had developed a compensation culture.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Not surprisingly,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/6">Justin Davis Smith continues,</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/7" class="indent">&quot;given this belief in the shift towards a compensation culture, a majority of organisations&mdash;some two thirds&mdash;felt that issues of risk in relation to volunteering had become more of a problem in recent years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/8">One result is the difficulty in recruiting volunteers. One in five organisations reported to Volunteering England that volunteers had stopped volunteering for them because of risk and liability fears.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/9">The good news is that many organisations are coming to terms with this change in culture and want to fight back and put in place preventive strategies that allow them to continue to operate, despite the sense of risk. Politicians of all parties should work closely with them to do whatever we can to remove whatever fears are unreasonable. Risk management policies and strategies may seem tedious, but they can be reassuring and effective. Organisations share good practice among themselves, and Volunteering England's own risk project funded by the Home Office is looking to develop a set of tools to help volunteer-involving agencies to develop their risk management policies. We collectively need to ensure that no more than is reasonable is demanded of organisations in the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/10">A less high profile issue but one that is just as real is the increased responsibility being attached to trustees and governors. Not too long ago, those were honorary positions often held by retired professionals who cast a benevolent eye over governance and financial matters&mdash;but no longer. Being held liable for significant financial sums or being embroiled in quite serious employment difficulties has made those jobs much more difficult and, for some, not worth the candle. We must make it easier for people to volunteer for such positions. It might be right to ask whether it is truly necessary to demand exactly the same rigorous standards in every organisation as might be expected from a major plc or an Enron.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/11">Other problems that colleagues may wish to address when they get a chance to speak include the problem of recruiting people who are older, making sure there is no age discrimination, watching out for disability discrimination, and making sure that the pattern of funding is compatible with the work of voluntary organisations. All too many complain of the short-term funding problem. I was speaking to a charity for the homeless this morning and was told that it was involved in 47 local contracts with 16 different authorities, of which only one contract lasted for longer than a year. It is not possible to work that way. We are trying to work in a different way in the public sector, and I hope that that will extend more to voluntary bodies.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/12">We need to make sure that everyone from all sections of society can contribute. It is true that those from a higher social class&mdash;a higher financial background&mdash;tend to be more involved in volunteering than others. Looking for ways to make sure that we break down the barriers and that people can afford to give time and effort to voluntary organisations is extremely important. We must continue to do that.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/13">Finally, looking ahead, on <phrase class="date" code="">29 March</phrase> Baroness Julia Neuberger launched the Commission on the Future of Volunteering. Following on from the success of volunteers year last year and the Russell Commission, over the next 12 months the commission will examine a range of issues, some of which I have touched on, to try and ensure that volunteering has a secure base for the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/14">Baroness Neuberger recognises, as do many others, that volunteering has never seemed as important as it does today, and is keen that the heightened interest of political parties should not result in party or Government takeover of voluntary activity. I can assure her from the Conservative Benches that there is no intention or aim of that happening. We recognise, as I am sure does the Minister, that volunteers offer a valuable non-partisan service which he appreciates in government, and which we will equally appreciate when we sit on the Government Benches.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/15">One of the key areas that we will be looking at is how we encourage young people into more voluntary activity. There is already quite a high level of participation, but as the Eden project shows, we want to encourage more. Growing people into voluntary organisations in their own areas is very valuable. I pay particular tribute to the Biggleswade sea cadets, of which I happen to be president. I have seen them being exceptionally active in the local community, and so many of those who have been in the sea cadets go on to give their time back to the local area and to the sea cadets and other voluntary organisations. The benefit to a small market town can only be imagined. When that is spread across the whole country, one sees how valuable the work can be.</p>
	<p pid="c.341.1/16">We all have our stories about the value of carers and volunteers. We have seen them in every circumstance. We have seen them working abroad to teach, relieve pain and suffering or protect the environment. We have seen them at home, from joyful participation in local events in their communities to sitting down with hurt and miserable children with the direst of backgrounds, but who suddenly have hope and aspiration as a result of a kind word and skilled advice. From all of us in this place, to all of them, wherever they are, you have our hearty thanks.</p>

	<p pid="c.343.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>. He spoke as someone who cares passionately about carers and volunteering, and he will no doubt make an important contribution to the Neuberger commission, the results of which we look forward to.</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/2">I have been in my job as Minister with responsibility for the third sector in the Cabinet Office for a month or so, and I am delighted to have this opportunity to set out the Government's approach and future plans. We have good reason to be optimistic about the ethic of volunteering in this country. Next year, the new Office of the Third Sector will be investing &pound;65 million a year directly in the infrastructure of volunteering programmes. Millennium Volunteers saw a transformation of youth volunteering in this country, engaging almost a quarter of a million young people. Today 20.4 million men and women in our country volunteer regularly, up from 18.4 million in 2001, a rise in both formal and informal volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/3">We need to go further. We have just launched V, the independent body that will build on the work of the Millennium Volunteers and is tasked with recruiting a million more youth volunteers. For carers too, there is more to do. There are more resources and better legislation, and the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>, who has responsibility for social care, will have more to say about that when he replies to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/4">For my part, I want to focus on the Government's approach to volunteering, which is based on three principles. The first is that volunteering, including mentoring, is the bedrock of our society. The second is that the Government have an enabling role to play, investing in organisations with the expertise to make the best use of resources and breaking down barriers to volunteering, and I will deal with some of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised on that. The third&mdash;this is important&mdash;is that volunteering should be seen as complementary to state action, not a substitute for it.</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/5">I will deal first with the role that volunteering and mentoring play in our society. Almost 50 years ago, William Beveridge published a report&mdash;not his most famous&mdash;entitled &quot;Voluntary Action&quot; on the role of the voluntary sector in society. One phrase in it seems particularly apt as we meet in this House today. Voluntary action, he wrote, expressed</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the driving power of social conscience&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/7">I spent the first day of volunteers week last Thursday visiting and volunteering at different organisations, and for me they showed that driving power in action. They included the Whitechapel mission, serving breakfast to the homeless; Live magazine in Brixton, which is produced for and by some of the most disadvantaged young people in south London; the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, with its 140,000 volunteers across the UK, which is improving public spaces all round Britain; and Sixty Plus, in Kensington and Chelsea, which brings together young people and older citizens.</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/8">The Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1936" name="Patrick McFadden">my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden)</phrase>, volunteered for the excellent senior citizens' link line project in Bilston in his constituency, to which I pay tribute today, and the Minister for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1557" name="Hilary Armstrong">the Cabinet Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong)</phrase>, visited a women's aid project and volunteered there this morning.</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/9">What united the volunteers in those diverse organisations was both the individual fulfilment that people got out of their volunteering and the difference that they were making to their communities, as those to whom I spoke confirmed. As the hon. Gentleman and others have said, we see that all around the country, from the millions of volunteer sports coaches, to the hundreds of thousands of school governors, to the many thousands of volunteers who campaign for the causes in which they believe.</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/10">The Government, of course, do not create volunteers, and it is important to remember that, but they do have an enabling role, which takes me to the second principle of our approach. That is partly seen in the enabling role of the Government investing in our volunteering infrastructure, and I want to talk about our future plans in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="c.343.0/11">Today, 47 per cent. of young people volunteer at least once a year. In the ways that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">they contribute&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> made this point&mdash;they are a living contradiction to the stereotype of yobbishness with which too many young people are branded today. It is the responsibility of the media&mdash;which we often like to criticise&mdash;but also of politicians, to represent a balanced picture of young people. We want many more young people to have the chance to volunteer&mdash;1 million more young people over five years. We know that volunteering enables young people to develop new skills outside school and broaden their horizons. By working with the third sector, public services and the private sector, our aim is to transform the number of young people who get involved in volunteering in their communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.345.3/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman and will look kindly on his invitation. Gift aid has improved the situation on tax relief, and the sum provided by the taxpayer has increased from &pound;200 million to &pound;600 million. We all know about the huge impact of volunteering, and I shall discuss that matter later.</p>
	<p pid="c.345.3/2">V is a new, independent organisation, and it embodies the Government's enabling role. It will be led by young people through the youth advisory board, V20; it will be shaped by the needs of young people; and it will fund thousands of full-time youth volunteering opportunities, as well as many thousands more part-time opportunities. The Government have committed up to &pound;100 million over three years to fund increases in youth volunteering through V, and I am pleased to say that 26 companies have already pledged their commitment to the project, contributing a total of more than &pound;10 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.345.4/1">Before the Minister leaves the question of young people and volunteering, does he agree that it is important to consider those young people who have caring responsibilities thrust upon them, such as caring for ailing parents or for younger brothers and sisters?

The new Office of the Third Sector, based in the Cabinet Office, offers an opportunity for greater co-ordination within Government of the effort to break down those barriers, three of which have been cited in particular as preventing volunteering. First, there is the deterrent effect of potential legal action for incidents involving volunteers. Several hon. Members raised that issue. Tomorrow, the Compensation Bill receives its Second Reading in the House. It represents an important response to concerns that have been raised, including in the private Member's Bill introduced in 2004 by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase>. Part 1 of the Compensation Bill makes it clear that when considering a claim of negligence, courts will be able to consider the wider social value of the activity. That will help to ensure that voluntary organisations are not discouraged from taking on volunteers by the threat of legal action. It has been widely welcomed by many organisations that use volunteers. For example, the Scout Association has said that it welcomes the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.0/5">Secondly, there is the operation of the Criminal Records Bureau, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place. Every year, about 500,000 checks on volunteers are processed by the CRB free of charge as a result of a decision made by this Government. That is a considerably higher number of applications than was expected. There have been concerns about delays in processing, but I am pleased to say that the situation has improved, with 93 per cent. of standard checks completed within two weeks and 88 per cent. of enhanced checks completed within four weeks. Of course, we recognise that there is scope for further improvement in this area, and we will continue to consult the sector and work with the CRB to bring about improvements. We are working on several matters, but I believe that the situation has improved.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.0/6">Thirdly, concerns have been raised, including in the Russell report, about the benefit rules being a possible deterrent to volunteering. On examination, it turned out that many of those anxieties related to the implementation of the rules rather than the rules themselves. For example, those on jobseeker's allowance can volunteer provided that they continue to look for work and can start a job within a week. That is why the Government have launched an updated guide to volunteering while on benefits. The task is now to ensure that it is implemented locally in jobcentres.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.0/7">A final part of the enabling role of Government is to build an ethos of volunteering&mdash;the sense that we all have a responsibility to put something back into our society. That must start in schools, and that is why the Government have already piloted the active citizens in schools programme and are determined to do more to embed volunteering in the citizenship curriculum. We are also working with the private sector, through Business in the Community, and with the public sector to open up more volunteering opportunities and persuade more people to volunteer.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.0/8">The third principle of the Government's approach is that the role of the third sector in general, and volunteers in particular, must be seen as a supplement to and not a substitute for Government funding of public services. The relationship of state and the third sector has always been difficult for our society&mdash;we should be honest about that&mdash;and, indeed, for any major advanced industrial society that has a welfare state. The third sector can reach out to the disadvantaged, it is close to the communities that it serves and it has a deserved reputation for innovation. As we have already heard in the debate, the role of volunteers reflects the reality that there will always be ways in which Government provision and services can be supplemented by the engagement of volunteers. However, volunteering must not be seen as, and cannot be a cut-price alternative to Government. That is true of the third sector generally.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.0/9">Before the second world war, the patchwork nature of the welfare state may have encouraged a spirit of charity and voluntary action, but Labour Members do not romanticise that era, for it was a time when services were frail and failed many people. For Labour Members, the significant increases in expenditure on public services&mdash;and the resultant improvements&mdash;are consistent with the increase in volunteering. Both contribute to a more just society.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.0/10">Today's debate is important because I hope that it might enable us to declare a happy consensus on the need for partnership between the state and the voluntary sector. That would be welcome. It would mark a major change from the position of the Conservative party in the 1980s, when the choice between state and volunteer was perceived as a zero sum game&mdash;more state provision meant crowding out the volunteer; less state provision was desirable because it would increase voluntary action.</p>

I feel some anxiety when reading some of the speeches that he has given on the issue and I hope that he will have the chance to speak in the debate. Last November, around the time when he was appointed to his new role, he made a speech in which he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.348.1/3" class="indent">&quot;As big charity gets ever closer to big government, it increasingly mirrors its thinking and behaviour&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.349.0/1">The speech to which the Parliamentary Secretary refers dealt with the relationship between larger charities and the smaller voluntary groups. He should go back to his office and examine carefully what happens with some of the bigger charities. Approximately 5 per cent. dominate charitable giving to such an extent that many smaller groups cannot get money. At the same time, they dominate the relationship with big government, often dictating the pressure on it. Genuine voluntary effort in the community groups often gets crowded out by that combination of big government and big charity.</p>

	<p pid="c.349.1/1">I have the utmost respect for the right hon. Gentleman, who is a much more senior Member of the House than I am. However, in the last part of his intervention, he again referred to crowding out by big government. He and I have a very honest disagreement&mdash;not about ends, because I completely respect the ends towards which he is working, but about means. I do not think that the role of the Government necessarily crowds out the work of voluntary sector groups. However, when we are considering ways in which the voluntary sector can carry out more public service delivery, big charities will inevitably be involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.349.2/1">I really must take up this issue with the hon. Gentleman. I visit a lot of small community groups around the country, pretty much throughout the year now, as part of my work with the Centre for Social Justice. One of the abiding features of what the people working in those groups tell me time and again is that they do not want to access local or national Government money because when they do, they feel that their activities get taken over by the Government and they fall into the pattern of being &quot;check-listed&quot; by civil servants. They absolutely fear the hand of the Government. I did not make that up. The hon. Gentleman should come with me on some of those visits, and I will show him people in Glasgow, Manchester and Sheffield who all work hard and all say the same thing: that they fear big government because it tends to take them over. Those are not my words, but theirs.</p>

	<p pid="c.350.0/1">Of course, the right hon. Gentleman is right. In a way, that is what I was talking about when I referred to barriers. The Government's relationship with the voluntary sector needs to be conducted with a light touch, and we need to strike the proper balance between accountability and the flexibility to spend resources. I am afraid that the right hon. Gentleman and I simply have a philosophical disagreement on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.0/2">In the months and years ahead we will scrutinise the Conservatives' proposals and intentions, and I hope that there can be consensus on this question. The relationship between state and voluntary activity is an important issue for our country, but it is not an easy one. There might be disagreements, but I hope that we can reach consensus.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.0/3">I believe that it is right to celebrate the work of volunteers. In small ways and large, they are making a huge difference to our country. Forty years ago this month, the American politician Robert Kennedy said in a speech to young people in South Africa that the biggest danger facing our society was the sense of futility, and the belief that</p>
	<p pid="c.350.0/4" class="indent">&quot;there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the world's ills.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.350.0/5">Every year, millions of British volunteers are the living answer to the danger of futility. They are active citizens changing our country for the better. They have a Government on their side, and I salute their work today.</p>

	<p pid="c.350.1/1">I very much welcome the debate and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the tone in which the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> opened it. I suspected from the start that this would be one of the most consensual debates of the year, and, so far, that has been borne out by the words of the hon. Gentleman and of the Minister. I think that this is the first time that I have had the opportunity to welcome the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1545" name="Edward Miliband">the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband)</phrase> to his new responsibilities, after he was so cruelly robbed of that opportunity during the course of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill. I congratulate him, and warmly welcome him. I also thank him for what he has said today. If he makes a habit of quoting that great Liberal, William Beveridge, in his speeches, he will maintain a welcome from these Benches.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/2">Although the contributions to the debate will probably follow more or less the same lines&mdash;albeit with some areas of tension, such as the one that was explored in the latter stages of the Minister's speech&mdash; we need to recognise that the warm feeling that comes from congratulating the voluntary sector from the Chamber is insufficient to its needs. To use the time-honoured phrase, fine words butter no parsnips. The requirement is not only to feel well disposed towards the voluntary sector, but to help it to do its essential job and to recognise some of the barriers that stand in its way.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/3">We have already heard about the huge range of activities across the country that are covered by the voluntary sector. Those activities are all done for the greater public good. The citizens advice bureaux, for instance, do a marvellous job in many of our communities. Those who work with elderly people are doing work that would otherwise not be done, because it would not be done by the statutory sector. There are also the special constables, who were mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1840" name="Dari Taylor">the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/4">Those who work in the artistic and cultural heritage sectors are important to the life of our communities, not only adding to but maintaining that which we have. The industrial heritage sector in particular is often unsung. In that sector, people devote their lives to maintaining things that give instruction and pleasure to people in our local communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/5">We should not forget those in local government, who are often forgotten in their role as volunteers. In fact, local government is made up of volunteers, particularly at parish council level. Many parish councillors take on considerable responsibilities in return for few thanks and little reward, and I am grateful for the work that they do. Those who volunteer to work for political parties certainly do not often receive thanks publicly, but they are volunteers none the less. Many of them give their time because of their commitment to a principle. They are prepared to do that day after day, week after week and year after year, and we should say thank you to them. We may feel that a number of them are mistaken in their political beliefs, but they are all doing what they do because they believe it to be for the common good.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/6">School governors, who have been mentioned today, take on an extraordinarily responsible task nowadays, which is probably far beyond what they thought they were taking on in the first instance. I am worried by some of the responsibilities that now fall on their shoulders.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/7">We should also take account of youth work, in its widest context. I am glad that the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire mentioned his sea cadets, because I think we should pay special regard to the inestimable value of the work of the cadet force with young people. It does not merely provide them with the experiences that it is traditionally so good at providing. Earlier today, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> told me that at the weekend he had presented awards for community service to a number of cadets who had been not climbing mountains, sailing ships or flying planes, but helping the elderly as part of their training. That strikes me as an extremely valuable contribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/8">There are those who raise funds for all sorts of purposes: organisations such as rotary clubs and, in my part of the world, carnival associations. Carnivals are not, in fact, a Notting Hill phenomenon; they are a Somerset phenomenon. We have the largest and best carnivals in the country, although they are not known to a great many people. The work of carnival associations continues throughout the year. They produce the floats for carnivals such as the Bridgwater carnival, which is attended by a quarter of a million people. Such carnivals raise a phenomenal amount of money for good causes.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/9">We would not have a sports structure without the voluntary sector&mdash;without the coaches, the groundsmen and the honorary secretaries, treasurers, presidents and chairmen of the sports clubs in our constituencies. Those who work for the environment and conservation give up their time to make their communities that little bit better. But it is pointless to highlight particular organisations or individuals, because the list is endless.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/10">The Minister may be relieved to hear that I am not going to invite him to my constituency&mdash;not because I would not be delighted to see him there, and not because I do not have a huge array of local organisations that I think would be worthy of his attention, but simply because I recognise that he has new responsibilities in his Department. Let me say how glad I am that responsibility for voluntary work has been removed from the maw of the Home Office and its tottering empire and given to the Cabinet Office, where I hope more attention will be paid to it.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/11">Last, but certainly not least, are carers. No doubt attention will be paid to them later. They are, by definition, volunteers. They probably do not think of themselves as such but rather as people who provide care either because of an obligation or out of love for the individual on whom they are bestowing that care. However, they are part of the voluntary sector. What does the sector provide? It adds value to statutory activities and fills the gaps that the statutory providers will never fill. It also strengthens communities, supports families and reduces crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/12">I want to highlight the effect of the sector on rural areas. We often think of urban volunteers as providing services, but that activity is often even more important in rural areas because of the lack of statutory provision. If the statutory bodies and local authorities do not provide various functions, it is left to the volunteers to fill those gaps. I applaud the point made about the Licensing Act 2005 and its effect on village hall committees. Village halls are often key components of voluntary activity in local areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.1/13">Volunteering is done for a mixture of motives. Altruism is one. Care and love for individuals is another. The feeling that one has skills that are unused and can be put to better use for the community is a third. The fourth, and not to be forgotten, motive is fun. It is fun to do a lot of the activities, and people engage in voluntary activities for that purpose.</p>

	<p pid="c.352.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman make it clear, or join me in saying, that volunteers do many things that the state in no way, shape of form gets involved in? Alan Wade, a farmer in my constituency, is putting together eight very large lorry loads of clothes and medical equipment to go to Chernobyl. No one else is going to do that. He is valiant&mdash;a superb man. There are many Alan Wades in Great Britain, and we should celebrate them again and again.</p>

	<p pid="c.352.1/1">I share the hon. Lady's sentiments. The voluntary sector provides things that the state cannot. The key point, which was made by the Minister, is the need for complementarity&mdash;one adds to the other, not replaces the other. However, I say in parenthesis that I share some of the concerns expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon.

	<p pid="c.353.2/1">The Minister referred to the Conservatives being stuck in a particular pattern of thinking. As I listened to him, I was worried that he had a particular pattern of thought as well, which is about the superiority of public service delivery.

	<p pid="c.353.3/1">I thought that the hon. Gentleman was suggesting that I held that view. I emphatically do not. However, I now understand that he was referring to the Minister. That debate can be resolved during the course of the evening.</p>
	<p pid="c.353.3/2">The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire is equally right to point out the barriers. We should be concentrating on those. It is not enough simply to applaud what is done, but to say how we can enable that to happen in a better and more effective way. There are some aspects of voluntary work in which people are prevented from doing their best, sometimes by a lack of facilities, such as sports fields, and the lack of investment in local communities that provides the wherewithal for people to offer their services effectively. Sometimes it happens because of bureaucracy. The Criminal Records Bureau is still a live issue for many people. I welcome what the Minister said about improvement, but I recognise, because I have come across it in my constituency&mdash;all hon. Members must find the same thing&mdash;that the inevitable checks have a depressing effect on the preparedness of people to volunteer.</p>
	<p pid="c.353.3/3">The checks and balances that we put in place must be proportionate. Of course we must protect the young and the vulnerable, but we need to do so in a way that is consonant with people still providing the levels of support that they themselves can offer. That also applies to the area of risk aversion, which has been mentioned. The Compensation Bill goes some way toward dealing with that.</p>
	<p pid="c.353.3/4">However, the problem is often not the so-called compensation culture&mdash;I have never been convinced that such a culture exists&mdash;or litigation being carried through into court; rather, it is the interpretation by organisations of their liability through litigation that prevents them from doing things that they would otherwise do. A huge educative process is needed in order to tell organisations, &quot;Yes, you can expose people to appropriate risk in carrying out outdoor activities in particular. That is not a wrong thing to do&mdash;it strengthens people and their prospects for the future&mdash; provided that you take reasonable precautions and measures to ensure that they do not come to harm.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.353.3/5">It worries me that support for the voluntary sector, particularly from local government, is always vulnerable. By definition, it occurs in marginal areas of statutory duties, which means that when times are hard in local government, such support is cut. That principle even extends to social services and support for carers in many parts of the country, which is in any case a patchwork of provision and is now under real threat.</p>
	<p pid="c.353.3/6">The key issue, however, is the financial consequences, and here I shall concentrate on carers. For many, the restrictions on the carer's allowance are a real difficulty. An example is the 35-hour restriction, which rules out many people. Moreover, when people become statutory pensioners, they lose the carer's allowance. I understand the financial consequences of taking a different view on this issue; nevertheless, that restriction represents a horror story for many elderly carers, particularly those who are caring for their even more elderly parents. People can earn up to a limit of &pound;84 a week, which is not very much, before they start to lose their carer's allowance. Those who are at school, university or college for more than 21 hours a week do not qualify for carer's allowance. These are all restrictions on people who are desperate to support their loved ones in their homes, and who, in doing so, are saving the state vast sums of money. In addition, such caring is to the advantage of the individual being cared for.</p>
	<p pid="c.353.3/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1454" name="David Lepper">The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper)</phrase> was right to draw attention to child carers, who are the forgotten carers. I hope that schools and colleges become much more aware of this issue, spot the stress experienced by young people who are caring for a parent or an older sibling in the home, and make arrangements to support them through their schooling, so that their education does not suffer, and to support them socially by acting as mentors and helping them deal with the problems that inevitably lie in their way.</p>
	<p pid="c.353.3/8">We have a pension reform programme, which recognises the difficulties faced by carers, but does not propose to do anything about them during the lifetime of those who are currently carers. That is an issue of huge concern.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.354.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="354"  time="017:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0018.htm#06060754002315">
	<p pid="c.354.1/1">We have very limited time and other Members will not get a chance to speak if I give way.</p>
	<p pid="c.354.1/2">Finally, it should be made easier for businesses to release people to allow them to take part in voluntary activity, and it should be in their interests to do so. That brings me to a specific question that I would like the Minister to respond to, if he can. There is a concern about the definition of carers in clause 12 of the Work and Families Bill. The Minister will be aware that although this is to be settled by secondary legislation, the intimation is that the definition of carers will be restricted to those with a familial connection with the person being cared for. That is alarming many people in the sector, who realise that carers can comprise a much larger group. This definition is too narrow and restrictive, and even if it is appropriate in the context of the Bill, its use outside that context and in other aspects of the Government's programme would be counter-productive.</p>
	<p pid="c.354.1/3">Because of the lack of time, I feel that I should shorten my remarks at this point. To some extent, it is a platitude to express a debt of gratitude to carers and volunteers in this country, but it is necessary to do so. We owe them an enormous amount. In cash terms, too, the state owes them an enormous amount for their work. That makes it all the more necessary to reduce the barriers in their way and to promote and encourage their work, which has not always been the case. I am encouraged by the Minister's views, but I now want action taken to reduce the barriers and really encourage those people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.355.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1368" speakername="Hywel Francis" colnum="355"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0018.htm#06060754002316">
	<p pid="c.355.0/1">I wish to declare a number of relevant interests, as a former carer, as vice-president of Carers UK, as chair of the all-party carers group and as the sponsor of the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004. I begin by congratulating the official Opposition on proposing the debate. I particularly welcome the positive comments made by all three speakers so far. This debate is a measure of the progress made in the country and across the House in advancing the cause of carers and volunteers. It is commendable that those issues have moved much higher up on all our political agendas.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.0/2">The official Opposition threw down an intriguing gauntlet by linking volunteering with caring. I am sure that no one would suggest that carers carry out their work as volunteers, as I believe that they undertake their responsibilities out of love for family members. However, many carers are volunteers above the call of duty when they work in carers' organisations. We have already heard about many such excellent organisations and the carers who work in them.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.0/3">In my own county borough of Neath Port Talbot, there are more than 20,000 carers&mdash;the highest proportion in any county borough in the UK. Serving those areas are some admirable carers' organisations, too numerous to mention, but I will refer to as many as I can in the limited time available&mdash;the epilepsy support group, Cancer Challenge, the Special Needs Activity Club, Age Concern and, perhaps most intriguingly of all, a new carers action movement, chaired by my friend, Mr. Ray Thomas, who with his wife Margaret has been a carer for 40 years. Alongside that, he has now formed his own carers action movement. Another interesting initiative involves former carers coming together to support new carers in the upper Afan valley.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.0/4">The Government&mdash;my Government&mdash;have done a great deal to enhance the lives of carers from the launch of the national carers strategy in 1999 and the introduction of the carers special grant to more recent recognition of the right of carers to request flexible working in the Work and Families Bill and, even more recently, in respect of the right to decent pensions for carers, particularly women, in the new White Paper on pensions.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.0/5">This debate affords Members the opportunity to raise some important policy issues relating to the link between caring and volunteering. Young carers provide one example. In my county borough, there are 600 such carers under the age of 16. How can both the Welsh Assembly Government and the Government in Westminster help those young carers to become volunteers, beyond their own caring responsibilities and their school work? I hope that Education Ministers will deal with that when the Education and Inspections Bill returns to the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.0/6">Beyond the Bill, I believe that young carers could benefit more if family support were provided by the expansion of such remarkable schemes as the Winged Fellowship Trust and the Shared Care Network. More respite care of that kind is essential for all carers, but particularly for young carers. Additional funds and awards to such admirable bodies as Crossroads and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and local authorities would greatly assist young and older carers. All that could be part of the implementation of the Russell Commission recommendations on volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.0/7">As carers' rights become more central to public policy in all Departments, would it not be appropriate to appoint a carers' champion&mdash;a specific Minister, with cross-cutting departmental responsibilities to enhance and advance the rights of all carers? It would be admirable, in advance of next week's carers week, if we were to hear today some kind of commitment from the Government to create such a position.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.0/8">In conclusion, I warmly welcome the comment made by my hon. Friend the Minister when he said that there is much more to be done for carers. The debate is worth while in recognising and valuing the indispensable role of carers and volunteers and the collective commitment of hon. Members on both sides of the House to achieve more respect, more recompense and more respite care for carers. I congratulate the official Opposition on their initiative, and I urge the Government to endorse the spirit behind it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.356.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" speakername="Iain Duncan Smith" colnum="356"  time="018:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0018.htm#06060754002317">
	<p pid="c.356.0/1">I did not intend to speak and I hope that I can keep my words fairly limited. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">my hon. and good Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his opening remarks, and I want to try to keep mine in the spirit of non-partisan-style politics. Although I will not quite follow the Minister down that road, I want to make a couple of points. Ever the politician, I do not want to miss the opportunity to respond to a couple of quick points that he made.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.0/2">One of the biggest problems that I see from the work that I do with the Centre for Social Justice relates to the big difference between the concept of charity and that of volunteering. The reality for many people who volunteer to do important work in the community, such as getting kids off drugs, helping pensioners who have difficulty getting out or sorting out problems in the aftermath of family breakdown&mdash;I am sure that all hon. Members will have seen such things every day in their work&mdash;is that they find that there is a growing divide between their activities and those of the bigger charities, most of whose work is done by paid people, who earn a salary and come to work much as many other people do. Worthy as that may be, there is a big disparity in their access to money and that of many small community groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.0/3">Some national charities sit on very large reserves of money, while still collecting donations. In some cases, as much as half their national requirements are held in reserves worth millions of pounds. Many of the groups that I talk to live from hand to mouth. They struggle every day; they literally go out with the begging bowl. Sometimes, visiting them as a politician is one of the ways of getting them publicity, so that people donate some money to them. Let us never underestimate the worth of that publicity to those groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.0/4">In a sense, there is in part a divided world. Small groups doing all the work find it more difficult to provide real access to the welfare society. They often find themselves crowded out by the activities of the national charities, whose dominance in fundraising squeezes out other charities. People who have already committed money to the bigger charities find it difficult to give money to the small community groups. Some of those things need to be thought through. The national charities need to rethink their relationship on giving with the smaller communities groups, and the Government need to do so, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.0/5">I want to speak about a couple of problems, the first of which is the relationship with the Government. A number of issues have been raised and the Minister has made some observations&mdash;I congratulate him on trying to deal with some of these things&mdash;but many Government agencies find it very difficult to deal with small community groups and charities. He is right: he and the agencies like working with the bigger charities. It is always easier to work with big organisations that are well-organised and have marketing directors, chiefs of staff and all those other things. They can talk almost on even terms. Small community groups&mdash;I call them the awkward squad&mdash;often involve people who are challenging opinions and attitudes, sometimes doing things that others are not sure are right, and they can be more difficult to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.0/6">I remember visiting Connexions in my area and asking what it was doing as part of its brief to support some of the smaller community groups and charities. Most of its work seemed to be supporting the local government work in the area, because that was so much easier. The staff were scared stiff of committing to small community groups because they were worried about what might happen if they failed or went wrong, or problems occurred. Therefore, the lion's share of the money that the Government had intended to go to some of the small community groups ended up going to projects set up by the local council. I asked the staff about one specific project and they said that they had had no take-up from local sports groups, but they could not understand why. I asked what requirements they laid on such groups, and it turned out that they had to have a full personnel check and full liability insurance before their bids could be assessed. I threw up my hands and asked how many of those one man and a dog operations that ran two football teams on a Sunday could afford liability insurance before they could make a bid for funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.0/7">I am not blaming the staff, because they were good people trying hard to find a solution, but it had not occurred to them that people were working hand to mouth and struggling to run football teams through pure voluntary work. Everybody involved was giving up time and often money.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.0/8">The attitude of the Government and civil servants to such issues is ingrained. They like dealing with organisations that are sizeable, orderly, working well and structured. They find it really difficult to work with small groups. I urge the Minister to think outside the box and find ways to deal with those groups, which are doing wonderful work in our community and include some of the most inspirational people I have ever met. Such organisations are more like small businesses, with all the same awkwardness and peculiarities, and they fail at the same rate&mdash;but they can also inspire and grow at the same rate. Unless we get our thinking around the fact that those social entrepreneurs are every bit as important to us as economic entrepreneurs, we will not begin to realise why so much in our society is challenging and broken down.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.0/9">I do not wish to labour the point about big charities, but we need to rethink the situation when so many big charities collect vast amounts of money&mdash;and many do very good work with it&mdash;and sit on vast reserves. I visited a charity which received some publicity as a result. Someone who had grown up in Gallowgate and gone on to great things in London read about the charity&mdash;it is run by Jim Doherty and is a local community charity that helps people get off drugs&mdash;and offered it &pound;10,000 a year. That is a lot of money for such a group, but larger charities can have &pound;50 million or more in reserve. Just a tiny proportion of that would go so far towards helping others out. The same goes for the Government, because small amounts of money can make a massive difference.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.0/10">We have talked a lot about how much volunteering saves the nation and delivers services. What we have not mentioned is that volunteering benefits the individuals who do it. It makes them better people, and that improves our society. It is an immeasurable element, but the less volunteers work in our society, the less we are as a nation. Therefore, encouraging people to volunteer is arguably every bit as important as the most encouraging work we do in economics.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.358.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" speakername="Lynda Waltho" colnum="358"  time="018:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0019.htm#06060754002318">
	<p pid="c.358.0/1">I support the main thrust of the motion, especially where it talks of the care and dedication of carers, but we need to be clear about the definition of carers. They can be relatives, friends or neighbours who look after someone who cannot manage without help because of sickness, age or disability. Carers look after people of all ages and can be of all ages themselves. They can be male or female, although they are more often women. Parents who care for a child with a long-term illness or disability are also carers. Some carers look after someone for a few hours a week; others do so for 24 hours a day, every day. Many carers care in their own homes, while others support friends living nearby or miles away.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/2">My constituency is located in the Dudley area, where there are 35,000 carers, of whom 7,500 provide more than 50 hours a week. In addition, there are 900 young carers between the ages of five and 17. That caring support is given willingly, but it must never be taken for granted.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/3">It has been said that carers need society's support as well as its thanks, and that support has led to a great deal being achieved by the combined efforts of organisations campaigning on carers' behalf. Those achievements should also be considered alongside the raft of progressive policy initiatives introduced by this Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/4">This Government are the first to recognise the needs of carers as well as the needs of those who are cared for, and I have seen the effects of their progressive policies on the lives of carers in Dudley. Those carers are also assisted by a dedicated and well organised network that is most ably co-ordinated by a great lady named Christine Rowley.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/5">In addition, we in Dudley are fortunate to have a dedicated helpline that gives carers the opportunity to talk to other carers. That excellent service is staffed by volunteer carers, whose experience ensures that they understand what callers are going through. The aim is to provide a listening ear, carer to carer, and the service is invaluable to many people in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/6">As well as the advice line, carers have access to a vast amount of information on financial matters, health, respite care and employment issues. That access to information is vital, and it is a matter that comes up again and again when I talk to carers in my constituency. They want to be recognised for the care that they provide: they make a strong plea that they should not be called informal carers but that they should be considered to be the real professionals.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/7">I want to highlight the vital area of training opportunities for carers. In Dudley, we have established the care link scheme, which is aimed at people who want to find work in health and social care. Its dedicated team gives full support to job seekers, providing them with the skills needed for a satisfying role in the care industry. The scheme is also open to anyone between the ages of 24 and 59, and full support is given throughout.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/8">Carers can also work for the City and Guilds learning for living certificate, a personal development and learning qualification for unpaid carers. The expert patients programme helping people with long-term illnesses has been welcomed by local carers, and a new programme, &quot;looking after me&quot;, has been developed specifically for carers who themselves have long-term illnesses. Tutors are just finishing their training, and the first course will be offered shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/9">Dudley is well served by a service called Crossroads&mdash;named after the much loved soap opera based in a midlands motel&mdash;that provides caring for carers. The service was praised in 2005 by the Commission for Social Care Inspection for the work that it does in providing sitting services to help carers take a break. It is fully funded from Dudley council's carer's grant, and is backed by the Big Lottery Fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/10">All of the carers grant is still allocated to carers in Dudley. The money is directed specifically at carers who want to use it to enable them take a break. Flexibility is the key, and some 200 carers will benefit from the funding next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/11">I also want, however, to draw attention to the needs of parents of children with disabilities. Those of us who are parents of able-bodied children generally expect our responsibilities to decrease over time, but that is not so for the parents of children with disabilities. Their caring responsibilities generally increase as their children get older and less help is provided by the support services.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/12">In that connection, I want to pay particular tribute to the Orchard partnership, based in Stourbridge. That unique and vital service for vulnerable children with disabilities and their families was set up by a group of parents co-ordinated&mdash;and, as is often of the case, chivvied and coerced&mdash;by one parent in particular. That parent is Madeleine Cowley, who is now the chairman of the organisation&mdash;a volunteer, of course.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/13">Many children now survive illnesses that they would not have survived even 10 years ago, and the Orchard partnership was set up to address their needs and those of their carers. It helps them to have the same quality of life that other children enjoy. I have paid several visits to the Orchard: I have watched its Saturday club run drama workshops, met parent and carer support groups and seen children and carers benefit from short breaks. There is also a special youth forum that is focused on raising the profile of the issues facing young disabled people and their families during the vital period of transition to adult life. The parent-led committee continues to support the services offered by the Orchard partnership and all the services benefit from the contribution of volunteer support workers. All the volunteers are a valuable asset and really enhance the services provided to the children and their families. The Orchard provides a toy library and I was proud to become patron of that last year, at the launch of the story sacks. That is a great initiative that allows parents to use puppets when they are telling stories to their children. I do not quite know who enjoyed that more&mdash;me or the children&mdash;but it is certainly a brilliant initiative.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/14">On a more serious note, I draw the Minister's attention to the problem that such services face when funding streams approach their end. Lengthy waits are often endured before hearing about confirmation of continued funding for future development. Perhaps he can offer some hope of stability or ring-fencing of funding for such projects in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.0/15">To sum up my contribution to today's debate, I will paraphrase my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister: a lot done, a lot more to do. I am proud to have been part of a Government who recognise that caring can affect both the health and the financial status of carers and their families, that access to employment opportunities helps to maintain financial security and self-confidence, that training and education enables people to return to work when they want to or to work flexibly according to their needs, and that access to leisure services gives carers time to themselves to recharge their batteries. It is vital that that is where we target this support. Carers are entitled to the same benefits as anybody else. Put simply: they have earned them. Some ask, &quot;Can we afford to support carers?&quot; We should answer, &quot;Can we afford not to?&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.361.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" speakername="Richard Benyon" colnum="361"  time="018:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0019.htm#06060754002319">
	<p pid="c.361.0/1">I have scythed through my speech and will get through it in seconds. I just want to touch on some of the points that have been raised and add a few of my own. In west Berkshire, I am lucky to have an excellent volunteer centre, which is run by its director, Garry Poulson. He and I talk regularly about what encourages people to volunteer and what makes the voluntary sector tick. He keeps interesting statistics showing who walks through his door and the different areas of volunteering that he guides them towards. It is fascinating to see the number of young people who are volunteering, the gender difference and the type of activities that people wish to go towards.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> touched on the important subject of what prevents people from volunteering. I will touch on that in the few minutes that I have left. As the vice-chairman of our local citizens advice bureau, I completely take <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>. I have spent hours discussing governance issues such as the accounts, the reserves policy, and whether we should be incorporated. All those sort of things sap one's enthusiasm for volunteering. We are interested in what the organisation does and not necessarily how the mechanics of administrating it work. We have to look seriously at the pressure that we put on volunteers in terms of the administration of voluntary bodies&mdash;whether we are talking about the Criminal Records Bureau, the fear of litigation, the cost of insurance, compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, or all the financial regulations that are involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/3">There is a wonderful book by Robert Putnam called &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;, which looks at the problems of American society&mdash;many of which are reflected in this country, as well. He identifies one of the key factors&mdash;it was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire&mdash;that limits people's availability to volunteer: time. Professor Putnam has calculated that every 10 minutes of commuting cuts all forms of social engagement by 10 per cent. That is 10 per cent. fewer family suppers and 10 per cent. fewer local club meetings and other community activities. So, the knock-on effect of the successful battle that we fought in west Berkshire to protect our rail service was to increase to a small degree, or at least sustain, the amount of volunteering. Professor Putnam makes the poignant point that people who want to volunteer get home from work exhausted and it is easier to sit down and watch &quot;Friends&quot; than go out to find and interact with real ones.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/4">Can Government make more people volunteer? Of course, in a direct sense, the answer is almost universally no. However, they can incentivise and make it easier for people to volunteer. I want to point to one key example in my constituency: Vodafone. Vodafone has not had a very good press in recent days, but it continues to be a force for good in west Berkshire. There is scarcely a voluntary body that it does not help financially and, matching that, it encourages employees to participate in environmental working parties and community reading projects. It creates a virtuous circle of a diminution in sickness and increase in productivity. I thus urge the Government to examine the incentives that they can give to companies.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/5">In conclusion, I ask the Government to accept that it is crucial to understand the difference between the voluntary sector and the not-for-profit charitable sector. The latter is an arm's length deliverer of Government services, with a huge call on financial resources, while the other is a wonderfully anarchic network of social and emotional interaction. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> said, the voluntary sector should be allowed to exercise its will&mdash;sometimes in the wrong direction, but always with enormous enthusiasm and in the direction of ultimate right&mdash;within the framework of the Government's plans for the sector.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.362.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" speakername="Tim Loughton" colnum="362"  time="018:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0019.htm#06060772000113">
	<p pid="c.362.0/1">We have had an excellent and brief debate, during which we have heard good and succinct&mdash;in most cases, I am glad to say&mdash;contributions from hon. Members on both sides of the House. I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1545" name="Edward Miliband">the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband)</phrase>, to his post. I welcomed many of the comments that he made in his maiden speech from the Dispatch Box, especially when he talked about the Government's enabling role and said that the work of volunteers should be complementary to state action, not a substitute for it. However, some of his other language betrayed the perception among many in this country that volunteers and carers are too often used as cheap labour, or that we have volunteering and caring on the cheap.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> rightly said, with his great expertise in the area through the Centre for Social Justice, too many volunteers are discouraged by the fear of the heavy hand of big government and the box ticking and regulation that goes with that. Additionally, too many small volunteer groups are crowded out by a higher tier of the bigger charities, which seem to be perhaps too close to the Government in many cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/3">There are also worries about the complementarity of funding. The national lottery has not been mentioned today, but there is a real feeling that many of the things that are funded by the various national lottery funds should be paid for with mainstream funding for the health service or education. This week, I was at the annual general meeting of the Friends of Worthing hospital, of which I am vice-president. Half the money that we raised in the past year was spent on equipping bathrooms in the local hospital. That is not complementary funding, but core funding, and there is thus a worry about the way in which volunteers' time and effort are used.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/4">We have had a good debate on a subject that is important to everyone inside and outside <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the House. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> should be rightly congratulated on moving the motion without a bead of sweat on his brow after completing the mile in six minutes 22 seconds&mdash;I am afraid that he was way ahead of me.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/5">The timing of our debate on this worthy subject is good, given that we had volunteers week last week and it will be carers week next week. Hon. Members on both sides of the House will have been involved in all sorts of projects. I have been asked to point out that Conservative Welsh Assembly Members have recently visited hospices, the ChildLine operations in Wales, projects promoting Welsh produce and superb projects operating with some of the least privileged and most at-risk children in the United Kingdom&mdash;there is a plug for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/6">I declare an interest in that I have been a national trustee of Community Service Volunteers since 2001. The body has operated for more than 40 years as the largest volunteer organisation in the country and is under the excellent leadership of Dame Elisabeth Hoodless. The body is responsible for make a difference day, with which I am sure most people are familiar. I am sure that hon. Members have participated on the day by working in charity shops, on environmental projects and with social workers or NHS hospitals. This year, 100,000 volunteers contributed to make a difference day.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/7">For the past five years, as the shadow children's Minister, I have been to the young carers festival in Southampton. Some youngsters do the most remarkable jobs in enormously stressful situations. They need to be congratulated, but also helped. However, I shall concentrate on corporate volunteering, and on young carers in particular. I will not go into all the figures about the number of people who volunteer and why they are motivated. It should be noted that 45 per cent. of people who volunteer have a disability. Of people who volunteer, 44 per cent. are from the black and minority ethnic communities, while 38 per cent. of those who volunteer are without formal qualifications. It is an inclusive activity. Volunteering is a great leveller and a great satisfier for people who involve themselves in it.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/8">There is corporate social responsibility. Recently, we had the Edith Kahn memorial lecture, during which Jeff Schwartz , the chief executive of Timberland, made an enormously inspiring speech about how volunteering has worked in his corporation and in other companies in America. Every employee of Timberland automatically receives 40 hours of paid time to do volunteering work. That is from the chief executive right down to the person working on the front desk. That time is shown on their pay slip every month&mdash;how much time they have used and how much time they have still got. Everyone is encouraged&mdash;it is not compulsory&mdash;to take up volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/9">On one day last year, across eight different countries, Timberland alone contributed 50,000 hours of human service for volunteering. Other companies in the states had similar big programmes. Hallmark has recently hired a senior leader to be involved in market-based solutions to social challenges. We have heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> about the work that Vodafone does. Many of our big companies do a great deal of work in this area, but we need to do a lot more. Jeff Schwartz said:</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Corporate citizenship must be more demanding than merely complying with all relevant laws.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/11">He had a vision that commerce and justice are not just antithetical notions. His definition of citizenship allowed a business run for profit to demand that sustainable returns were generated from shareholders, and also that business should be actively implicated in the strengthening of the civic square. He talked about inviting the engine of commerce to fit into the chassis of civic society. There is great complementarity, and it is a rich vein of volunteering, along with help and persistence for the advancement of all that we should be doing in this country. How do we go about it? We need to encourage more corporate schemes. We need to encourage more people to become involved individually. We need to make it easier and more convenient for people to become involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/12">I move on briefly to young carers. One in eight people in England is a carer. Three in five carers look after someone with a disability. There are 855,000 carers who provide more than 50 hours of caring per week. The 2001 census estimated that there were just 17,000 young carers. The real estimates from the Princess Royal Trust for Carers suggest that the total is nearer 100,000. People are doing remarkable work in looking after, in most cases, relatives with serious physical and mental disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/13">Sixty five per cent. of UK carers believe that their career prospects have been affected. Seventy four per cent. of carers are currently in paid employment and use their annual leave for caring. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" name="Lynda Waltho">the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho)</phrase> mentioned, the effect on carers' health is considerable and we need to do more about that. Any projects that are designed for carers caring for carers should be applauded. Young carers come to Parliament, as they did recently with the all-party children's group. They face a problem with their school careers. In most instances, there is not an understanding linked teacher in a school who can appreciate the particular needs of a young carer.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/14">A young carer may need access to a phone at work because mum or dad, for whom they are caring, needs to have a visit or needs to be checked on at various times during the day. Young carers do not have time to grow up. They do not have the opportunity to spend time with their friends and to participate in a normal social life that any normal teenager would hope and expect to enjoy. They chose&mdash;often they did not have any choice&mdash;to look after their parents. We should be in the business of making that job easier, not in the business of putting obstacles in their way.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/15">There is so much that we can do and I have so little time to set things out. Certainly, we should have a linked person in each school. Ofsted should have a role in examining young carer strategies in schools. Best practice should be disseminated more widely to make the role of young carers easier, and the Minister could make a start by attending the young carers weekend later this month, where he will learn that impressive work is under way.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/16">Finally, the strength of volunteering is its independence, the harnessing of people's good will, freely given, and the diversity of their interests and involvement. We must appreciate volunteers and carers more. We must make their jobs easier, not put obstacles and bureaucracy in their way, including Criminal Records Bureau checks, which are necessary but must be balanced. Government Departments should do more to promote volunteering, and they should sign up to a code of practice on volunteering. We should streamline funding, as hon. Members have said, as there is too much paperwork for voluntary organisations, which constantly have to reapply for funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.0/17">There should be a level playing field for partnerships with volunteer organisations, and we must acknowledge young carers and do much more for them. We should offer assistance in schools, and make genuine provision for respite care. Hon. Members have had a good opportunity to plug voluntary organisations in their constituencies, and the whole House has had good opportunity to thank the millions of volunteers and carers up and down the country who do an invaluable job, day in, day out, that would otherwise cost the Government an enormous amount. It is time, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> said, to butter parsnips and do more than offer warm words. Hon. Members should look beyond the House and acknowledge the contribution of volunteers and carers, as well as the serious problems that they face, and produce a timetable for action.</p>

	<p pid="c.365.0/1">Everyone would agree we have had an excellent debate in which right hon. and hon. Members have rightly paid tribute to the many unsung heroes who make us proud of our constituencies and of our country.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/2">In a world of perpetual change, the selfless dedication of volunteers and carers is a beacon of light that keeps alive the timeless values of compassion, solidarity and service. Those individuals shatter the cynicism of people who portray today's society as one in which violence, antisocial behaviour and abuse are rife. Carers enable older and disabled people, as well as people with long-term chronic conditions, to remain at home with the dignity, autonomy and security that the rest of us take for granted. Whether it is the adult daughter or son caring 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year for an ageing parent, or the friend who makes daily visits to an adult with a learning disability, carers are in the front line in ensuring that all our citizens have the quality of life that we demand in a civilised and fair society.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/3">It is right to recognise that carers have their own practical and emotional needs, distinct from those of the people for whom they care, although that recognition is long overdue. We must strive to ensure that statutory and voluntary sector providers treat carers as equal and valued partners in the care and support offered to vulnerable people in all our communities. Volunteers are the living, breathing embodiment of a healthy civic society. Whether working under the auspices of a voluntary organisation, or simply making their own personal contribution, they are frequently at the heart of their communities. This month in my constituency, the Radcliffe carnival took place only because of the voluntary commitment of Ray and Hilda Veivers and Colin Jones. Next week's Prestwich carnival has been made possible by David Curtis and his Sunshine Team of volunteers. Every day in every community, volunteers make a difference to the lives of vulnerable people. The much maligned younger generation is often at the forefront of that service. Through Millennium Volunteers, faith groups, schools and universities, young people demonstrate their idealism, responsibility and commitment to helping others, shattering the illusion that the vast majority of young people are engaged in antisocial behavi<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">our&mdash;a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> and the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1545" name="Edward Miliband">my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/4">The Government believe that the state alone cannot transform communities. We are committed to an enhanced role for third sector organisations in the development and delivery of high quality public sector services. The restoration of community solidarity and civic pride requires new, authentic partnerships between the state, third sector organisations, the private sector and active citizens. Professionals, volunteers and carers all have a distinct but crucial role to play in ensuring not only that we care for vulnerable people, but that they have a quality of life fitting in a civilised modern society.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/5">I come to some of the excellent contributions made by right hon. and hon. Members. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>, as usual, presented his argument in a reasonable and fair way, reflecting great credit on his contribution over many years, first in Bury, before he went, not entirely voluntarily, to North-East Bedfordshire. He rightly highlighted the contribution of sports volunteers. We ought to reflect on the massive contribution that volunteers made to the success of the Commonwealth games, which my home city, Manchester, was so proud to host. As we think about the World cup and our hosting of the Olympics, the careers of many of the successful footballers and athletes will start on Saturday and Sunday mornings, when volunteers enable young people to participate in sport. For many of our sporting heroes, that is how it all began.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/6">The hon. Gentleman mentioned his pride in being Minister with responsibility for disabled people for some time. He did not refer to his time as Minister with responsibility for the Child Support Agency, which I know was a stretching and challenging period for him. He rightly drew attention to the success of the Eden project, which is an excellent example of best practice in terms of involving young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/7">In debates such as this, I always say that at the age of 14 I became involved in voluntary work with people with learning disabilities. By the time I reached the age of 16 or 17, I had decided that I wanted to work professionally in the voluntary sector in social care. I do not believe that I would ever have gone into politics or that I would be standing at the Dispatch Box making this speech if I had not been connected at the age of 14 with that voluntary work with those people with learning disabilities, which made me think very differently about the kind of society I wanted to live in and the kind of contribution I wanted to make. That applies to large numbers of young people, who become involved on a voluntary basis and then decide that they want to make a contribution through public service. It is not just a matter of what people give, but of what they get through their own personal development and sense of satisfaction.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1454" name="David Lepper">My hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> rightly spoke about young carers and our responsibility to identify their distinct needs, understand the pressures that they face daily, and recognise that in the education system and the health service we need to be better at identifying those young carers and providing the necessary support.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> spoke about the definition of carers under the Department of Trade and Industry flexible working legislation. The Department is consulting on that legislation and will take account of views about such a definition before reaching a final decision. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1368" name="Hywel Francis">My hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis)</phrase> has made a massive personal contribution in advancing the cause of carers during his period as a Member of the House. That was based on his own experiences. The Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 will make a tremendous difference to carers' lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> made some valid points about the difference between small and large charities, but I do not believe there is any need to attack larger charities. We must build the capacity of smaller charities in local communities. I remember that when I worked in the voluntary sector we had a slogan: &quot;Voluntary does not have to mean amateur&quot;. Vulnerable people depend on the activities of charities, so it is important that we do not think that voluntary organisations should not be accountable.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" name="Lynda Waltho">My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho)</phrase> spoke about the contribution of the Orchard partnership in her constituency, which sounds extremely innovative in its work. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> raised a number of issues relating to work-life balance and family-friendly policies. I am sure he welcomes the Government's contribution in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/12">As we look ahead to the future, carers and volunteers know that the stakes are high. The Labour party in government is strengthening Britain with social justice as our eternal mission and as an integral part of our national success, whereas the Conservative party views the word &quot;compassionate&quot; purely as a political strategy to win power, not as the expression of common values. It is right that today, from all parts of the House, we pay tribute to the contribution of carers and volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/13" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/14" class="italic"> Resolved,</p>
	<p pid="c.365.0/15" class="indent">That this House takes note of the immense contribution to society made by those honoured during the recent Volunteers Week and forthcoming Carers Week; recognises and values the significant economic and social benefits resulting from the work of volunteers and carers, often performed in difficult circumstances requiring the most selfless qualities; further notes the need to ensure that the fewest possible barriers are placed before those wanting to volunteer and act as carers; believes that encouragement should be given to all, especially the young, to consider volunteering as a contribution to the welfare of a healthy society; and expresses its thanks to all those who act as role models for volunteering and caring.</p>

	<p pid="c.369.2/1">I would first like to thank Mr. Speaker for selecting asthma services as the subject for this Adjournment debate. It is a subject close to my heart and I gather, although not from the number of Members present, that it is also a subject in which hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country are interested.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/2">I should like to introduce the background to the debate. World asthma day was on <phrase class="date" code="">2 May</phrase>, and like many other hon. Members I attended a reception given by Asthma UK in this House. The Secretary of State for Health also attended the event and made encouraging noises about the need to improve health care provision for people with long-term conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/3">I am grateful to the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, for coming here today to expand on the Secretary of State's comments, and I will be sure to leave her ample time to deal with the detail of the Government's thinking.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/4">My hope and intention is that today's debate can be a constructive one in which as many Members as possible are able to feed to the Minister some of their thoughts and concerns about asthma services in the UK. There is much to be commended in the work that the Government have done for people with asthma. If that is not clear later on in my speech, it is only because time is tight and I am keen to flag up gaps in provision and procedures that could be improved. In particular I wish to pass on what people with asthma have said to me, because there is no doubt that they are among the best judges of what does and does not work, and what could be improved.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/5">I have lived with asthma all my life. My sister, Caroline, had undiagnosed asthma for many years, and her quality of life suffered as a consequence&mdash;at one point, she ended up in hospital with pneumonia. Through my sister's experience, my shovel-like cough was identified as a symptom of asthma, which was diagnosed at the age of two. My elder son, Alexander, has had two extended visits to hospital in years two and three of his life. My other son, Stephen, who is just two, is showing all the signs of asthma, but he is yet to be diagnosed.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/6">In my previous life, I worked with Asthma UK&mdash;at the time, it was known as the National Asthma Campaign&mdash;on a number of campaigns, including a campaign on smoking in public places. I am delighted to see that a similar ban to that in Scotland will be introduced in the rest of the country, which will make a big improvement to the quality of life of people with asthma. Other important issues include the administration of medicines in schools and the redesign of asthma services.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/7">I have found ways to manage my asthma and, like many others with the condition, enjoy a number of sports and activities in which I would be unable to participate without proper medication. At this point, I challenge other hon. Members to join me in the Scottish coal-carrying championship, which takes place at the end of June. Competitors are required to carry a 1 cwt bag of coal for 1,000 m along the undulating main street in Kelty, my home village. Given the marathon sittings that hon. Members endure in this House, I imagine that they would find that a stroll in the park.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/8">I consider myself lucky that my asthma is relatively mild and controllable and that I have the wherewithal to pay for repeat prescriptions. I believe that the person should control the asthma rather than the asthma controlling the person. When GPs, nurses and pharmacists ask people with asthma whether their condition is under control, the people often say, &quot;Yes.&quot;, but if they are asked whether they can climb stairs without wheezing, whether they can sleep for a whole night without wheezing and whether they can run for the bus, they often say, &quot;No.&quot; People accept far too much of their condition, and awareness needs to be raised among people with asthma about the quality of life that they could live.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/9">I have personal experience of the benefits of modern medicines and the value of asthma clinics. When I was in my 20s, I did not control my asthma well, and when I went to the asthma clinic, the nurse told me that I would die if I continued not to control it. That information was dramatic, and it shook me up. The nurse explained that if I did not manage my asthma, the blue inhaler would not work and my lungs would collapse during my next asthma attack. I took that information to heart and have controlled my asthma much better&mdash;the modern medicines are fantastic. Nurses and pharmacists play as an important part as GPs, and they are skilled health professionals who should be encouraged to do even more. They are in the front line and face people with asthma all the time, and we should encourage them to do more to provoke people to reassess whether their condition is acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/10">Asthma is a disease of the lungs in which the airways are unusually sensitive to a wide range of triggers, including house dust mites, cold air, viral infections&mdash;in my case, it is usually colds&mdash;or cut grass. Common triggers also include tobacco smoke and animal fur&mdash;interestingly, people who live with a cat or dog in their early years tend not to suffer from animal sensitisation in later years, so not all animals are bad for people with asthma. The airways react to those triggers and become inflamed, resulting in symptoms of tightness and wheeziness in the chest. People suffering severe attacks find it nearly impossible to breathe and require rapid medication. Approximately 1,400 people die every year from asthma, and 90 per cent. of those deaths are preventable, which is a huge percentage that needs to be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/11">There are about 5.2 million people with asthma in the UK, which is one of the highest rates in the world. It affects one in eight children and one in 13 adults. An estimated 8 million people in the UK have been diagnosed with asthma at some stage in their lives&mdash;an average of one in seven of the population. There are now three to four times more adult people with asthma in the UK and six times more children with the condition than 25 years ago. There is a big debate as to why that is the case. Asthma is a serious problem encountered by a large proportion of the population. There is currently no cure for it. Some people say that the problem largely disappears when they enter adulthood; many, however, live with it for life. It is a condition that they manage through their medication and lifestyle adaptations.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/12">At the end of January this year, the Government published their White Paper on health care outside hospitals, entitled, &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, which came out of the consultation exercise, &quot;Your health, your care, your say&quot;. There is much to applaud in that White Paper and much for which people with asthma have been calling for many years. In particular, I welcome the recognition that better community-based care can reduce hospital admissions and thus costs. I will, however, press the Minister to take that logic further in relation to prescription charges.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/13">Several specific proposals will have come as welcome news for people with asthma. First, there are the plans to develop so-called information prescriptions and personal care plans for those with long-term conditions. They constitute an important recognition that people can be the best judges of their own needs. I hope that the Minister can confirm that information prescriptions will be just one part of a larger drive towards self-management of long-term medical conditions. I am sure that she will know that my colleagues have long espoused the value of self-management for the estimated 17.5 million people in Britain living with chronic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/14">The potential benefits of such an approach are considerable. For example, a person aware of the nature of their condition and empowered to control it should be less likely to require regular emergency treatment, thereby reducing the burden on stretched NHS resources. Asthma UK estimates that for every &pound;1.60 spent on personal asthma action plans, &pound;7 is saved on NHS care. Many people with asthma resent the feeling of powerlessness that comes with the uncertainty about when attacks might occur. A successful self-management programme should improve a person's mental health and self-esteem as well as promoting their long-term physical well-being. Self-management programmes could be integrated with greater use of voluntary sector organisations such as Asthma UK. There is no doubt that people with asthma looking to develop self-management programmes would benefit from the expert advice that voluntary sector organisations can offer and from the chance to talk to other people with asthma within that context.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/15">Will the Minister expand on how the Government see self-management programmes developing? In particular, may I encourage her to make a commitment to place a clear duty on local health commissioners to commission self-management packages for people with asthma involving patient groups in the design, delivery and evaluation? I hope that she will consult her colleagues in the Scottish Executive, who are funding a pilot project for personal health plans using asthma as the test condition. I am sure that lessons can be learned from each other's experience. The White Paper recognises that health professionals have not always been given sufficient incentives to manage long-term conditions. I have heard many GPs and consultants say that asthma is sorted, but when one hears people with asthma tell stories about what they have to put up with, it is clear that that is certainly not so.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/16">As I said, about 1,400 people die from asthma each year and about 90 per cent. of those deaths are preventable. It is worth taking a minute to consider how those deaths could have been avoided.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/17">First, it is important that people who are admitted to hospital with severe asthma attacks are seen by respiratory specialists. One in five people with asthma say that they do not get to see an asthma specialist when their asthma becomes hard to control. There must be adequate provision of asthma specialists across the board, from GPs and nurses with specific asthma training to respiratory specialists for emergency admissions and long-term support.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/18">Secondly, the Government must be willing to fund properly research into the causes, treatment, cure and prevention of asthma. Asthma UK already puts more funding into asthma research than the Government. A recent report by the UK clinical research collaborative found that respiratory diseases received disproportionately low funding, considering the number of people affected. Indeed, respiratory disease is now the most common illness responsible for emergency admissions to hospitals and kills more people than coronary heart disease.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/19">Above all, the Government must be committed to keeping people with asthma out of hospital by improving their day-to-day support. Nearly 200 people are admitted to hospital every day with emergency asthma attacks at a cost of nearly &pound;80 million. As many as 75 per cent. of hospital admissions are probably preventable with proper long-term care and support.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/20">On <phrase class="date" code="">20 March</phrase>, the Secretary of State called for a 30 per cent. reduction in hospital admissions. She estimated that that would save the NHS more than &pound;400 million a year. The Government's health White Paper commits them to refocusing the quality and outcomes framework of the GP contract and changing the payment by result system to encourage greater concentration on managing long-term conditions. I welcome that and I hope that the Minister can expand on what it might mean for people with asthma who too often feel deprived of specialist advice on the day-to-day management of their condition.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/21">The role of the voluntary sector is vital. I hope hon. Members will not object if I focus on the services provided by Asthma UK as it is the example with which I am most familiar. That is not intended as a slight on the many other charities and support groups that provide excellent services for people with asthma, but I wish to highlight the role of Asthma UK because it has been developing the concept of self-management for some time. The Government could learn much from its example and establish a useful partnership with Asthma UK on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/22">Asthma UK provides an advice line, which is staffed by specialist nurses, who can offer advice on medication and effective self-management. It has also helped thousands of people develop personal asthma action plans or care plans, which already deliver genuine benefits in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. However, research by Asthma UK suggests that only 24 per cent. of people with asthma have care plans. I know that the Minister will want to explain how the Government intend to extend such plans so that people with asthma have access to them.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/23">The Minister may be interested to hear about Asthma UK's control test&mdash;a 60-second, five-point questionnaire that helps people to understand how their asthma is controlled, with a simple score out of 25. I tried it today and I am pleased to say that I scored 23 out of 25, which is not too bad. I encourage hon. Members to take part in the census because it is a good way in which to assess how well one's asthma is being controlled.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/24">I hope that the Minister will join me in applauding a joint collaboration between Asthma UK, the British Heart Foundation and Diabetes UK, which have worked with primary care trusts, the Department of Health, the Healthcare Commission and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to develop a so-called &quot;commissioners' toolkit&quot;. It is intended to outline examples of good practice in the treatment of long-term conditions such as asthma, heart conditions and diabetes and is to be made available to all commissioners of health care.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/25">The final issue that I would like to raise is, I believe, one of the most important, which ties in closely with the theme that I have sought to develop, namely reducing hospital admissions through encouraging self-management of asthma. It is prescription charges. The current system of exemptions from prescription charges dates from 1968 and makes little sense now, if it ever did. The Minister will remember the 2002 report by Mr. Wanless, entitled, &quot;Securing our Future Health: Taking a Long-Term View&quot;. In it, Mr. Wanless stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/26" class="indent">&quot;The present structure of exemptions from prescription charges is not logical, nor rooted in the principles of the NHS. If related issues are being considered in future, it is recommended that the opportunity should be taken to think about the rationale for the exemption policy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/27">Members will be familiar with the general arguments for extending exemptions to a greater range of long-term conditions, but I hope that they will forgive me if I reiterate some of the key points. The present system fails the test of fairness. People with diabetes and certain forms of epilepsy are exempt from prescription charges, but people with arthritis, asthma, mental illness and multiple sclerosis are not. Those with an underactive thyroid are exempt, but those with an overactive thyroid are not.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/28">The present system hits the poorest hardest. The Government's 2000 NHS plan states:</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/29" class="indent">&quot;New charges increase the proportion of funding from the unhealthy, old and poor compared with the healthy, young and wealthy. In particular, high charges risk worsening access to healthcare by the poor.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/30">People with incomes barely above the income support level have to meet the full cost of prescriptions, providing them with two disincentives: a disincentive to work and a disincentive to pay for necessary prescriptions. The knock-on effects of this problem are precisely those that we all wish to avoid. Prescription charges discourage people with asthma from taking medication to control their condition, and encourage them to think of treatment as something only to be taken in an emergency. This increases emergency hospital admissions, thus increasing costs to the NHS. It may also lead to a number of preventable deaths every year.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/31">I am pleased to report that the Scottish Executive are undertaking a review of prescription charges. They have recognised the innate unfairness in the system, and the extensive review will include a full literature review, consultation and debate. I hope that the Government will read the review documentation and have discussions with the Scottish Executive about their emerging conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/32">I do not expect the Minister to make new policy in this Chamber at this time. I would, however, welcome her personal view on how the system of exemptions for prescription charges might develop in the future. As she knows, my party committed itself at the last election to an independent review to suggest reforms to the system of exemptions. I would be grateful if she could tell me whether she sees merit in this suggestion. I would also be grateful to hear the views of others on this matter. It is my view that free prescriptions for people with asthma would do much to help them to control their condition and live normal lives, and I would welcome a range of views on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.2/33">I would now like to give the Minister a chance to give a full response, and I hope that she will make specific reference to the important issues that I have raised about people with asthma.</p>

	<p pid="c.374.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> on securing this important debate today. I saw by the way in which he set out his personal experiences how strongly he feels about this issue. I would also like to join him in paying tribute to the outstanding contribution of bodies such as Asthma UK, and I shall say more about their work later.</p>
	<p pid="c.374.0/2">As the hon. Gentleman graphically described, there are approximately 5 million people whose lives are blighted by asthma to a greater or lesser degree. The big challenge is to find ways for people to manage their condition through medication and lifestyle adaptation. Again, the hon. Gentleman described his personal experience in that regard. Our aim for patients is certainly to move away from care that is reactive, unplanned and episodic, and to put in place an approach that is centred on early detection, disease management and promoting independence. That will involve offering a personalised care plan and improving care in primary and community-based services, particularly for the most vulnerable people. Such an approach will not only improve personal health outcomes for people with long-term conditions; it will also reduce avoidable hospital visits. The hon. Gentleman touched on that issue as well, and I hope that he will welcome our commitment to trying to reduce emergency bed days by 5 per cent. by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.374.0/3">This whole programme of work, which is called &quot;Supporting People with Long-term Conditions&quot;, was launched in 2005. It set out a new NHS and social care model specifically designed to help local NHS and social care organisations to improve care for people with long-term conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.374.0/4">From the outset, self-care has been a vital component of that model. We want to help NHS organisations to develop a local self-care strategy, which means working with local agencies, the community, the voluntary sector and&mdash;as the hon. Gentleman said&mdash;the people themselves and their carers. As the hon. Gentleman also said, part of that involves information prescription. I am happy to reassure him that information prescription is an important part of our approach to self-management.</p>
	<p pid="c.374.0/5">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the White Paper. The theme of community-based services and supported self-care for people with long-term conditions and their families, especially those with asthma, emerged strongly in our consultation. Here again joined-up thinking and working is vital, and not just between health and social care partners. As we said in the White Paper, local strategic partnerships will be responsible for the delivery of services and for ensuring that they are genuinely integrated and, crucially, focused on the needs of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.374.0/6">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the work of the Scottish Executive. We shall, of course, want to hear and learn from our colleagues in Scotland, and elsewhere for that matter, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that the PRODIGY system that is used in GP surgeries in England generates personalised asthma action plans based on guidelines produced by the British Thoracic Society and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.</p>

	<p pid="c.375.2/1">As I think the Minister will admit, self-care is not about simply letting people loose or letting them free. It probably requires harder work to arrange for them to be included in self-management plans. Self-management plans are not simply about printed forms; they are about agreements and partnerships.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-07c.375.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" speakername="Rosie Winterton" colnum="375"  time="019:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060607/debtext/60607-0021.htm#06060772000122">
	<p pid="c.375.3/1">That is absolutely true. The expert patient programme, for instance, has proved to be a very good way of helping people to manage their conditions and learn about them. I realise that it is not always easy, but the benefits are enormous.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/2">It has been the policy of successive Governments that those who can afford to make a small contribution to the costs of medicines should do so. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the existing list of medical conditions that give exemption from prescription charges has been reviewed on a number of occasions, but no clear-cut case for extending it has emerged. There is no consensus on additional conditions that might be included, or on how distinctions could be drawn between one condition and another or between a mild form of a condition and a severe one. It is a difficult issue, and it has been considered, but I am sorry to tell the hon. Gentleman that we currently have no plans to extend that particular list. What we have been doing is giving priority to helping those who have difficulty in paying charges. Nearly 90 per cent. of prescriptions are already issued free of charge because of the extensive exemption and charge remission arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/3">The hon. Gentleman described the vital role of the voluntary sector, and I entirely agree with what he said. He spoke of the work done by Asthma UK in raising awareness of the condition, and mentioned the reception attended by the Secretary of State on world asthma day. That constituted a vital contribution to the development of national policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/4">The hon. Gentleman referred to the commissioners' toolkit that Asthma UK has been working on with my Department. It will be extremely useful in ensuring that there are good services at a local level for people with asthma. The Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, who is responsible for public health, has discussed smoking policies with Asthma UK, and I know that she found that very useful.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/5">Asthma UK has done a lot of work at a local level. There is a project in West Sussex that provides swimming lessons for children with asthma, and a project in Hackney is training 80 people in self-management and in how to live healthy lifestyles. Those are exactly the kind of approaches that the hon. Gentleman set out.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/6">Last July, my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality, in his former role as Minister with responsibility for care services, announced the Third Sector Commissioning Task Force. Its programme is to identify barriers to achieving that strong relationship between the voluntary and public sectors. We want to promote that relationship, but we must ensure that we look out for barriers and see what we can do to assist in removing them.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/7">In terms of asthma specialists, we have more doctors, nurses and other health care professionals than ever before within the NHS. It is from that expanded work force that specialists of all kinds will be drawn.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/8">The hon. Gentleman also asked about research. The agency through which we carry out research is the Medical Research Council. We consider the ways in which we can contribute to increasing research in all areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/9">I hope that I have given an indication of how the Government have put the concerns of those living with long-term conditions at the heart of our reform agenda. Diseases such as asthma present a massive challenge to the health and social care system. It is a challenge that will need to be met by services that benefit not only from the increased funding in the system, but from the reforms to service delivery. By focusing on the needs of patients, we empower them to take control of their own health and care.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/10" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.3/11" class="italic"> Adjourned accordingly at twenty-eight minutes to Eight o'clock.</p>
