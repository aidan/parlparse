<p>Approximately 35,300 recruits are required during the whole of the current financial year to complete the Regular Army to establishment. As my hon. Friend will see from page 14 of the General Annual Report on the British Army for 1935, this number is about 10,000 more than has been taken in each of the past two years. I fully appreciate that the present terms of enlistment for the Infantry may not appear attractive to men who wish to serve for two or three years, but the difficulties which enlistment for the short period would present in regard to overseas drafting are very considerable.</p>

<p>Deer tend to invade many of the larger plantations and to increase rapidly as the young trees grow into the dense thicket stage. If the numbers are not controlled much damage is done not only to the plantations but to the farms, orchards and gardens in the neighbourhood. Roe deer, generally, and fallow deer, occasionally, are most troublesome in plantations. In order to keep the head of deer down to a point where they do no real damage it is necessary to shoot, departmentally and by arrangement with shooting tenants, and in some cases to snare. Blackgame also invade new plantations and sometimes do much damage to pine, larches and occasionally spruces. The numbers are controlled by shooting during the game season.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that His Majesty's Government at no time contemplated asking the Emperor to sign any such agreement in return for the offer of passage in His Majesty's Ship "Enterprise" from Jibuti to Palestine. I have already explained that the offer of this passage was a mark of courtesy to the Emperor, and that it was made in accordance with the message which was conveyed to His Majesty's Minister in


Addis Ababa that His Majesty desired to proceed with his family to Palestine. His Majesty's Government were anxious to be of assistance to the Emperor, but the hon. Member must remember that His Majesty has renounced the direction of affairs, and it was in consequence not unreasonable to suggest that in these circumstances he should be expected not to participate in any way in the furtherance of hostilities.</p>

<p>I have been asked to reply. The Male Servant Licence Duty is not, so far as England and Wales are concerned, an Imperial tax, but forms part of the receipts of the county councils and county borough councils. Proposals to vary the incidence of the duty can thus only be considered after consultation with these councils.

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
During the War a great part of our factory legislation was set aside by the Defence of the Realm Regulations and there grew up, for the purpose of the production of munitions, a system whereby women and young persons, in violation of factory legislation, could work what is commonly known as the two-shift system, being so many hours between 6 o'clock in the morning and 10 o'clock at night. It was thought by those interested in factory legislation that that system would come to an end when the War itself ended, but it was continued, and in 1920 an Act was passed to make what was temporary into a permanent provision. It was provided, however, that the system should come to an end in five years, but each Government in succession has carried it forward under the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, so that it has continued to this day. This Bill will make the two-shift system permanent not only for the next five years, but probably for the next quarter of a century.<br/>
Before this Bill was presented there was a Departmental Committee appointed to inquire into the operation of the two-shift system. There are a goodly number of employers and workpeople who do not like this system at all. The hon. Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh) rather challenges that with a very ominous smile. [<i>Interruption</i>] If the word "menacing"

is more appropriate, I will leave it at that. I am under the impression that she has championed the two-shift system before. It is no use hon. Members arguing in favour of it until they have tried it themselves in a factory. That is the test always&#x2014;not whether we think the young people like it or not, but how we should like it if we were in their place. The Departmental Committee issued a unanimous report, but, as far as I know, the two Labour representatives signed it only on the definite understanding that this problem with which we are now dealing was included in the recommendation. The report says:
<q>It would be advantageous if a standing advisory body could be constituted by the Secretary of State composed of leading representatives of employers and workers who could be consulted as occasion arose on questions of importance in connection with the application and the operation of the two-shift system.</q>
I admit that in Committee upstairs it would appear from the Amendment tabled that each application for an order under this scheme would have to come before the advisory committee. If the right hon. Gentleman, who is nearly as good a lawyer as I am, will bear with me, I think that I can prove to him that in future, if our new Clause be carried, it will not be necessary for the Home Office to submit each application for an order to the advisory committee.<br/>
I pass to one or two arguments as to why an advisory committee should be set up, but, before doing so, I want to meet the plea of the Under-Secretary of State in Committee upstairs. He said that the Home Office were quite willing to set up an advisory committee, but they did not want the committee to be mentioned in an Act of Parliament. He said that that was new. Since we came back after the last General Election I have found a, splendid argument to combat that point of view. I was a Member of the Committee on the Cotton Spinning Industry Bill, and the first thing with which we were confronted was that the President of the Board of Trade was extaordinarily eloquent in proposing to insert in that Bill an advisory committee. If the advisory committees to which the hon. Gentleman objected had never before been mentioned in law, we have started a new chapter in legislation, and we have now an ex-


cellent precedent in the Cotton Spinning Industry Bill Where an advisory committee is Mentioned in the body of the Bill. I have been on several advisory committees. I sat for years on an advisory Committee of the Ministry of Health On the National Health Insurance Scheme, and I am under the impression that that august body is actually mentioned in the Act of Parliament. Therefore, the argument that the advisory committee is not mentioned in previous Acts of Parliament will not avail the Home Office to-day. Why does the right hon. Gentleman say, on the one hand, that he does not object to an advisory committee, but, oh the other hand, he objects to putting it into an Act of Parliament. He thinks that he can satisfy us by saying, "I will see that it is set up; but you must not put it into the Act of Parliament"? Let me tell him frankly that I believe there is a little element of the stubbornness of the Yorkshireman about him on this score. I am hoping that to-day we shall be able to mollify his attitude.<br/>
We are very keen on the advisory committee because we are not sure&#x2014;and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not be offended&#x2014;that the present Government will do very much for the factory operatives of this country unless they are compelled by Statute so to do. His promise to set, up an advisory committee Merely comprised in a statement on the Floor Of the House of Commons Will not convince us that the present Government will implement the promise. If employers of capitalists on the Floor of the House got a promise from the Government upon anything; the Government would implement it, but we are speaking to-day in respect of thousands of women and young persons who have Very little influence,. if any, in the present Government: We are anxious, therefore, to put this provision in the Act. of Parliament, because we are satisfied that the Home Office secure excellent advice from people who are actually in contact with factory work. It would ill become me to bring any criticism against the factory inspectors, because I believe that they are the best body of inspectors employed by the State in this country. I have yet to learn that, when the employer and his workpeople come to the Horne office to seek air order, it is the duty of a factory inspect-

tor when inspecting the factory to decide as to whether the two-shift system should be introduced;<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman really ought to admit our plea and insert the proposed new Clause in the Bill. I am sure that if it is necessary for a Government Department to be advised upon many problems by other boards, there is every reason why it should be advised by representatives of labour and employ&#x00E9;s on this fundamental issue of whether women and young persons should be employed between 6 o'clock in the morning and 10 o'clock at night. We.' are` definitely opposed to the introduction of the two-shift system. I could understand the introduction of the system to cope with prosperity where employers were incapable of meeting all the demands upon them by the markets of the world, but in adversity, when 2,000,000 people are out of work, what is the use of arguing that employers ought to work their women and young persons between 6 o'clock in the morning and 10 o'clock at night? Not only are we introducing this system into our legislation, and making it permanent for the next quarter of a century wrong, but if we are to have a two-shift system the Home Office ought to be ready and willing to accept our proposal to set up an advisory committee, so that the Department may be guided by the people Who are actually in daily contact with the factories.</p>

<p>I would make a strong appeal to the Home Secretary to accept the proposed new Clause which appears in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies) and that of myself. My hon. Friend has made out an overwhelming case for the Home Secretary to incorporate the Clause in the Bill. He stated clearly and truly that we on these benches are opposed to the two-shift system. On the Second Reading of the Bill we made our views clear, but nobody can deny that in the Committee stage upstairs we accepted the Bill as having been passed by a democratic majority of this House, and we sought every opportunity to improve the Bill and to criticise it in a constructive way. At the first meeting of the Standing Committee we proposed an Amendment which We are now seeking to incorporate in this Clause. The


Home Secretary on that occasion repeated the promise that he made on the Second Reading, that if the Bill became law he would set up a committee but said he did not want to incorporate it in the Bill itself. We are very anxious on this special point. Many of us on these benches have knowledge of thousands of women and young persons who will come within the provisions of the Bill. We therefore want a guarantee and safeguard for our people that such a committee will be set up, and the only satisfactory guarantee to us is that it should be included in the Bill.<br/>
We are not asking the Home Secretary to set up a precedent. Many of these committees exist in Government Departments to-day, and hon. Members on these benches have served on such committees for many years and have rendered great and useful service in many directions. My hon. Friend mentioned that the Cotton Spinning Industry Bill incorporates an advisory committee to advise the Spindles Board. I understand that at the Ministry of Transport there is a similar committee which advises on traffic problems, and that in the Ministry of Health there is a committee to advise the Minister on housing. The committee that we suggest would not consider every single application from every employer who wished to operate the two-shift system. We realise that it would be quite impracticable for an advisory committee to do work of that kind. What we ask for is a committee representative of all the interests in industry, a committee representing the employers, the organised workpeople and the Factory Department of the Home Office.<br/>
If the Home Secretary would set up such an advisory committee it would be of real service to him as the Minister who has to be responsible for the extension of the two-shift system in industry. If the two-shift system is to extend, as I believe it will, and is to become a permanent part of the industrial system, a great many problems of administration will arise, and it is of such problems that we believe the committee should keep an oversight. For instance, I believe that if it is made easier for the system to be applied, there would be a, rush of applications, from industries where it is at present in, operation. and

many applications for its extension in industries where at the moment it is not in operation. In cases like those the advisory committee could inquire why there should be a claim for the general extension of the system or why it should be introduced into any industry where it is not now operating. It would thus be of great use to the Home Secretary.<br/>
There are many other matters that such a, committee would be able to consider. We have never yet had any reliable evidence as to the effect of the two-shift system on the health of women and young people. If the system is to be considerably extended one duty of this advisory committee would be to watch the effect on the health of young people of 16 and women. Particularly would the committee render useful service in watching the conditions which are imposed in different industries on the granting of permits to introduce the two-shift system. We have to be very jealous in granting these permits and very careful to see that the conditions laid down by the Home Office are rigorously upheld by the employers. The committee could consider the conditions which ought to be laid down, whether the conditions are stringent enough, whether they are too stringent, or whether new conditions ought to be imposed. There are many ways in which this committee could render useful service to the Home Secretary and to the people in the industries concerned. Those of us who oppose the system as a whole, and the people who are going to work under it, would feel a greater measure of confidence if we knew that there was a committee containing representatives of the workers watching the operation of the system in industry.</p>

<p>As a member of the Departmental Committee whose duty it was to investigate this question of the two shift system I would like to say a word on this proposed new Clause. The Departmental Committee certainly took the view that it would be very useful to have a standing advisory committee to advise upon the working of the system, and hon. Members will see that we suggested that such a committee should be constituted by the Secretary of State. On the Second Reading of the Bill I myself strongly urged that provision for the committee should be included in the Bill.


The hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies) said just now that he thought the Labour Members who served on the Departmental Committee gave their unanimous support to the report of that Committee only on the understanding that the advisory committee was to be made a statutory committee. I cannot help feeling that if either of the two representatives of Labour on the Departmental Committee had such a reservation in mind he would certainly have mentioned the fact in this House. I think that the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. C. Brown) would have thought it necessary if he was going to make such a reservation, to have made that perfectly clear in his Second Reading speech. If my memory serves me aright he made no mention of the advisory committee at all. It is unfortunate that the hon. Member was not on the Standing Committee which considered this Bill. Otherwise he might have there made his position a little clearer.<br/>
But I maintain that the position has been considerably altered since the Second Reading. The structure of the Bill has been altered, and in some very important particulars. First of all, one of the most important functions of the Standing Committee was to decide the method by which the consent of the workers was to be obtained. The Government accepted an Amendment of the senior Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh) that the method should be definitely incorporated in the Bill and that the consent of the workers should be obtained by secret ballot. That seems to alter the situation very considerably. It seems to me to be far the most vital matter which will have to be considered by the advisory committee. It covers a great deal, including the all-important question of wages and their adjustment to meet the shorter hours. All that will be a matter of negotiation before the application is made; and if the workers are not satisfied that the conditions laid down are reasonable they always have the option of voting against the working of the system which is provided for in the secret ballot.<br/>
It seems to me that as long as that particular thing has been clearly established in the Bill it does not matter whether the advisory committee is statutory or not. The Home Secretary has given an undertaking that he, is going to

set up a committee. The hon. Member for Westhoughten says he does not believe that the Government are very much concerned with factory conditions. I myself do not take any better view of the Government, probably, than the hon. Gentleman, but I do think that it is a model of what even a bad Government can do if it only follows good guidance. I do not really think that there is anything very sinister behind the Home Secretary's attitude on this matter. He made it abundantly clear that there never was any desire on the part of the Home Office to exclude from the Bill anything which should properly be made a matter for legislative action. The hon. Member for Westhoughton said it was imperative to have the advisory committee included in the Bill so as to make sure of it, but if I remember aright he said that upstairs in the Standing Committee and in the same breath said that certain specific provisions in Acts of Parliament had been ignored by the present Government. Therefore I really think, looking at it from his point of view, that it does not really much matter whether the advisory committee is included in the Bill or not, for according to the hon. Member's statement he is not going to make sure of it either way.<br/>
I am glad that the hon. Member made it clear this afternoon that he has retreated from the position he took up in the Standing Committee, that this advisory committee should concern itself with individual cases and orders that are brought before it. Obviously when you have 300 orders, perhaps, brought up in one year, the committee would have to sit, if not every day at least several times a week. The hon. Member said it was very important to have a statutory committee because there had been no evidence before the Departmental Committee that the two shift system was not detrimental in its effects on the health of the workers. As a matter of fact the evidence was directly to the contrary. There was no substantial evidence that the system was detrimental to the health of the workers. I mention that for this reason: I do not know exactly what constitution the hon. Member has in mind for this advisory committee. The hon. Member said that he wished the committee to be made up of representatives of the workers and employers. I do not know whether they could be any more


rightly able to decide upon this matter of the health of the workers than would a committee which included a doctor and a social worker who had made a study of the question all her life.<br/>
I, myself, can see a great disadvantage in. making this suggested committee a. statutory committee. I think the hon. Member himself must also feel the disadvantage. He has mentioned his experience of advisory committees. I happen to be a member of two advisory committees, one a statutory committee and the other appointed by a Minister. The first was set up under the Housing Act of 1935. Its terms of reference limit it to definite functions, beyond which it cannot go. If in the course of time new and expected problems arise which could usefully be dealt with by that committee they are bound by Statute and they cannot deal with those new problems. The other body of which I am a member is an advisory committee appointed by the Postmaster-General. That was set up in 1921, but since then its function has been greatly enlarged and there are now practically no questions affecting the Post Office with which it cannot deal.<br/>
In this Bill we are instituting a. new system in the industrial life of this country. As the system develops&#x2014;as I feel sure it will&#x2014;problems of all kinds that have never been visualised by anyone may arise, and they will not be covered by the suggested committee's terms of reference. If the committee's functions are laid down by Statute the committee will be entirely prevented from dealing with those new problems unless the Statute is altered. For these reasons I believe that a standing body appointed by the Secretary of State would be much more useful and would fulfil far more completely the functions which hon. Members desire to have fulfilled.</p>

<p>I am glad that this question should be thrashed out on the Floor of the House, and I realise that every point of view should be brought before us. The hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies) has given me on this occasion the character of a; very obstinate man, but I can assure him that the conclusion, that. I have reached is not the

result of blind obstinacy, but of the best study that I could give to. what is admittedly a rather difficult problem, It may be that, before the Debate on this new Clause concludes, fresh light may break upon me, and, if so, I am open to receive it. I should like to express my gratitude to my hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Miss Lloyd George) whose approval of the attitude of the Government is the more encouraging, because it is administered. with such a discriminating judgment. She cannot be accused in this matter of offering a blind and possibly foolish support to the Government, having regard to the temptations which she may find in that quarter of the House to look into the shortcomings of my colleague and myself. Therefore, her support is specially to be welcomed.<br/>
It is desirable that the House should. realise how this matter arises and, therefore, I may be excused if I state how I regard it. The first question is, did. the Departmental Committee contemplate and did it propose that there should be a statutory advisory committee? On the Second Reading more than one speech was made from the benches opposite which complained that the Bill as we had introduced it did not carry out the intentions of the Departmental Committee, among other things, because it contained no Clause which created an advisory committee. I am not quite sure whether that view is still persisted in, but, if it is, I should like to deal with it and dispose of it. There is no justification for saying that the Departmental Committee recommended. that a. Clause should be inserted in. the new legislation. to provide for an advisory, committee. There are two places, in the report of the committee, which was a unanimous report, which deal with the matter, the passage quoted by the hon. Member for Westhoughton, which is in the concluding portion of. the report, paragraph 13, and also an earlier and fuller passage, on page 30.<br/>
As I pointed out on the Second Reading, nobody could read those paragraphs clearly without noting that the Departmental Committee, while it was suggesting certain amendments of the law, which we, have. endeavoured to include in this new added to that a. recommendation, which was, not itself a proposed amendment of the law, but was couched in terms which were a recommendation


to the executive and a recommendation which I stated on the Second Reading of the Bill I was most glad to accept and would undertake to carry out. The committee say, on page 30:
<q>We desire, in conclusion, to offer a suggestion of a general character.</q>

<p>I will do my best to read what is relative and complete, but let us begin at the beginning. The committee say:
<q>We desire in conclusion to offer a suggestion of a general character. It appears to us certain that from time to time questions will arise in connection with the working of the shift system, on which the Home Office, as the Department responsible for the administration of the system, would find it advantageous to consult leading representatives of employers and workers, with a view to arriving at solutions which would be generally acceptable and so facilitating the smooth working of the system.</q>
Then they give as an illustration the suggestion that the Advisory Committee might help by advising as to the method by which the opinion of the workpeople should be obtained. That matter has now been put beyond doubt by a provision, inserted during the Committee stage upstairs, that that method shall be a secret ballot. What was the passage to which the hon. Member wished me to call attention?</p>

<p>This paragraph:
<q>A provision of a more positive character, such as we suggest, which would secure for the Department representation of both points of view on any questions that may arise and would help to enlist the co-operation of both sides in the application and operation of the system, might, we think, be fruitful and replace with advantage the existing procedure of a joint representation.</q>
That passage, which the hon. Member thinks might assist us, follows an intermediate passage which says:
<q>There is a provision in the, existing Statute which allows of joint representations being made to the Secretary of State by organisations representing a majority of the

employers and workers in an industry that Orders allowing the two shift system should not be made for that industry. No such representations have ever been made and the provision has remained inoperative.</q>
When one looks at paragraph 13, on page 32&#x2014;I do not see how anyone could suggest that it was intended that the Secretary of State should propose, and that Parliament in this present month should define once and for all in the framework of the Bill, exactly what the functions of that Committee should be. The report further says:
<q>It would he advantageous if a standing advisory body could be constituted by the Secretary of State, composed of leading representatives of employers and workers, who could be consulted as occasion arose on questions of importance in connection with the application and operation of the two shift system.</q>

<p>I meant the only hon. Member on the Departmental Committee drawn from the official Opposition. His speech on Second Reading will long be remembered for the way he "laid about" him and explained his own opinion, but he never for one moment suggested that anyone contemplated in the Departmental Committee that there should be a Clause in the Bill providing for an advisory committee. Although that is so, I can assure hon. Members opposite that if, any advantage would be gained by it, I. should not in the last mind proposing it&#x2014;I do not want pedantically to follow the recommendations of the Committee&#x2014;but the report of the Committee satisfies me that the wiser thing is for the advisory committee to be appointed in the way that such committees are usually appointed and to leave it to the Secretary of State for the time being to settle its functions and its composition. In that way we can be certain of getting a flexibility which we should never get if we endeavoured to define these matters here and now in this Bill.<br/>
Let us look at the proposed new Clause moved by the hon. Member. This is his second effort. He proposes that the advisory committee shall consist of eight persons, to represent equally the interest of the employers and the work-people. Unless I entirely misunderstand the Clause, that means that you cannot have more than eight. Incidentally, eight is an even number, so that if it should unfortunately happen that the four representatives of one party did not happen to agree with the four representatives of the other party, you would have a stalemate at once. No provision is made in the new Clause for an independent chairman. There is no provision for any representative from the Factory Department&#x2014;I was glad to hear the hon. Member pay a very well-merited compliment to the inspectors of the Factory Department. No provision is made in the Clause for a woman representative, in terms, although this is largely a problem affecting women and girls. No provision is made in the Clause for anyone drawn from services specially concerned with health. I do not know whether four representatives of the work-people and four representatives of the employers would necessarily be specially skilled to determine the problem of whether the two-shift system is or is not bad for health. There was some extremely valuable medical evidence offered by certain witnesses to the Departmental Committee, and when the Committee had heard all the evidence they reported that they could not find any ground for believing that the two-shift system was bad for health.<br/>
Under the new Clause there would be four representatives of the employers and four representatives of the workpeople, and it would be a committee which could not be added to or subtracted from. Is that the way that Parliament is to make provision for dealing with this problem? What is the committee to do? I listened with attention to the very persuasive speech of the hon. Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Brooke), who described some of the things that the advisory committee might do, but he did not describe what this new Clause says they could do. The Clause says that this committee of four workpeople and four employers&#x2014;I suppose some would have to be drawn

from Scotland, because the Bill will apply to Scotland, and some also, I hope, from Wales&#x2014;must advise:
<q>in particular, as to any complaints which may be received regarding the operation of any authorisation under this Act.</q>
Hitherto, complaints as regards the working of the Factory Acts have been attended to in the first instance by His Majesty's inspectors, under a very skilled Department at-the Home Office, and anyone who is in the least worth his salt as a Home Secretary or Under-Secretary himself takes a close interest in such cases that are brought to his notice. Let us assume that there is a complaint, a manifest, undeniable complaint, which justifies forthwith the cancellation by the Home Secretary of the authorisation that he has given. Such a case might arise, but the new Clause would prevent the Secretary of. State from dealing with a complaint of that sort until he had summoned this advisory committee of four representatives of the employers and four representatives of the workpeople, because according to the Clause he must be advised by the statutory committee:
<q>as to any complaints which may be received regarding the operation of any authorisation.</q>
It is necessary in such cases to act quickly, but according to the new Clause the Secretary of State must not do that. He must allow the admitted evil to go on until he has called this advisory committee together to advise him. I think the whole thing is preposterous. Anyone who has read the new Clause will not be surprised at the hon. Member's declaration that, speaking for himself, he is opposed to the system. We must, however, frame our Bill not on the basis that we are opposed to a system which Parliament is prepared to approve, not that we are opposed to a system which has been in operation since 1920, and which every Government in turn has continued to authorise under the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, but we must give the system a proper basis on which to work, with proper safeguards. If I were an opponent of the whole system, then I might accept an advisory committee, composed of four representatives of the workpeople and four representatives of the employers, who might be expected in many cases to differ, with the result that the Secretary of State could not move hand or foot.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman must read the germane part of the Clause, which is:
<q>&#x2026;and it shall be the duty of this advisory committee to advise the Secretary of State generally as to the operation of this Act.</q>
He forgets to read that.</p>

<p>Perhaps the House will allow me to read that part of the Clause again. It is as follows:
<q>&#x2026;and it shall be the duty of this advisory committee to advise the Secretary of State generally as to the operation of this Act and, in particular, as to any complaints which may be received regarding the operation of any authorisation under this Act.</q>
I can only submit that those words mean that the Secretary of State has a duty to refer to this body any complaint which may be received regarding the operation of any authorisation under this Act, and to ask for their advice upon it. I am saying that that completely upsets the whole of the administrative methods which are followed in this great Department which has been in the hands of so many Secretaries of State drawn from so many parties. There has never been a case in the whole history of the Factory Acts from beginning to end, where you will find a statutory advisory committee set up, in which Parliament has said that the work which an administrator has to do, advised by his own skilled advisers and helped by the factory inspectors, is only to be done after referring complaints to an advisory committee.<br/>
The reason why I have made these observations&#x2014;and I am sorry the hon. Member below the Gangway opposite should think they were unfairly made&#x2014;is to bring to his mind and to the minds of other hon. Members this point, that you cannot put, into an Act of Parliament a precise definition of what an advisory committee is to do without crystallising and limiting its powers. My conception is quite different. My conception is that the Secretary of State will appoint an

advisory committee, in the way that I described on the Second Reading, and I. shall certainly take the opportunity of consulting with representatives of all the interests concerned. I should have thought such a committee would have been likely to consist partly of employers and partly of workpeople with an independent chairman, that it would have been a body to which from time to time the Secretary of State might have referred particular questions upon which he might feel that it would be helpful to have advice, that the committee would sometimes have made some original suggestions, that cases might have arisen where the Secretary of State would have added to the committee, in view of the trade involved or of the part of the country from which the problem came, members for that special purpose.<br/>
None of those things could be done under this proposed new Clause. If you want to do that, you must authorise the carrying of a Bill which does not itself define the precise composition of the committee or its functions, and you must accept the assurance of the Home Office, which I gave at the first possible moment, that we would carry out the recommendation of the report and constitute an advisory committee accordingly. I will gladly listen to what other hon. Members; may have to say, because my mind is not in the least closed if I have made a mistake, but my belief is that if such a committee is to be properly worked, it will be better done by the system usually employed, the system which I described on the Second Reading of the Bill and in Committee upstairs, than if the House attempts to define statutorily what the committee is to do or how it is to be composed. I hope the House will confirm the view taken by the Committee upstairs, where the suggestion was not in the same form&#x2014;indeed, I think it was in a better form than the, present proposal&#x2014;and reject the proposal of the hon. Member.<br/>
There is one last point. When this was suggested by the Departmental Committee, the principal difficulty which they had in mind&#x2014;and it is a very real one&#x2014;was this: How are you to ascertain fairly the opinion of the workpeople concerned I It is a very serious point, and hon. Members opposite, as well as hon. Members on this side, are quite right to look at it very closely. I have myself done a certain amount of work on it and tried


to understand it. It is Very important, if yon are to, establish this neat system permanently instead of continuing it year by year under an annual Act, that you should secure that it is carried out under proper conditions, which involve getting the real judgment of the workpeople. In Committee upstairs we inserted words which secured that it should be by secret ballot, and it was this very problem of what would be the best way of finding out what the Workpeople concerned really wished to do which was a reason, the first reason, perhaps the principal reason, why the Departmental Committee suggested the appointment of an advisory committee.<br/>
That particular point has been disposed of, but there are plenty of other occasions upon which, I am sure, an advisory committee would be most helpful. I would myself, in the interests of the administration of this system, strongly urge hon. Members of this House who wish this system to be given a fair trial to realise that questions may arise which it is very difficult for any of us to define now, and it is much better that the advisory committee should be one which is really able to deal with each new problem of that sort when it arises: I must sincerely state to the House, because it is not a matter on which anybody need be obstitate&#x2014;it does not matter to me&#x2014;what is the view of those who advise me in the Department which the hon. Gentleman opposite has so highly praised, that it would be a much more efficient method if we did not attempt the difficult task of defining the terms of reference of this advisory committee in the Bill or of deciding What its composition should be, but that we should do what I am sure the Departmental Committee intended; namely, that it should be set up with a very much more flexible constitution than even the best drafted Clause could provide.<br/>
I Understand that the hon. Member opposite, in putting this Clause forward, is ready to consider any necessary Amendments which would make it slightly more effectively framed, and I am not criticising his words because I think they are faulty, but because they bring to mind the real point, which is that is not a wise thing to try to define the constitution or the functions of this advisory committee in set terms at present, and for that reason I hope the

House will take the view of the hon. Lady the Member for Anglesey, who was a member of the Departmental Committee, and reject this proposed new Clause.</p>

<p>I represent a constituency where a great number of women and young persons employed who in all probability inky be affected by this Bill if it becomes an Act. I regret very much indeed that I was unfortunate in not being able to catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, during the Second Reading of the Bill, and also that I had no chance of expressing my opinions on this Bill when it was passing through Committee upstairs. However, I have been deeply concerned with these provisions, and with the absence of certain provisions which Members on this side are anxious to see incorporated in the Bill. I have read very carefully indeed the proposed new Clause moved by the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies), and I must confess that its wording does not appear to me to be entirely satisfactory. Yet while I did sit and listen with great patience to the first part of the Minister's speech in dealing with the proposed new Clause, and, I may say with some measure of satisfaction, I listened at first with some trepidation, knowing the reputation of the Government and how very difficult it is sometimes to get agreements implemented that are not specifically laid down in a Bill.<br/>
At the same time I admit that to some extent I was mollified and prepared in a measure to accept the promise that the right hon. Gentleman made, that he would himself set up this advisory committee, but I regret to say that when he came to discuss the terms of the proposed new Clause itself, his attitude so changed that it wrought a complete change in my own attitude of mind, and I felt that after all I could not allow the occasion to pass without drawing attention to the circumstance, at any rate, that the Secretary of State is not very favourably disposed towards the proposals of Members on this side of the House. We are conscious, of course, of our own deficiencies, we are conscious of our limitations, and we are sometimes rather bitterly conscious of the causes of those limitations and deficiencies. We regret that advantages possessed by hon. Mem-


bers opposite, including the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary, are advantages which have not been our advantages, and consequently we expect, not suave scorn to be poured upon our efforts under the pretence of a desire to help, but that those who have great gifts, especially when they have had great advantages for the cultivation of those gifts, should prove the sincerity of their profession of a desire to help by some genuine effort to help, instead of by pouring scorn on the efforts of those less capable than themselves.<br/>
At least there is no lack of honesty upon these benches, and if the right hon. Gentleman had been prepared to meet us with the same honest and candid consideration of the proposed new Clause and had indicated his willingness to help us in the framing of a better Clause, I do not think he would have found us unwilling to have met him more than half way. The right hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I spew in terms of some heat, because of the recollection of a past by no means free from painful experiences, and say that nothing is more calculated to foster and develop and call forth expressions of anger as a result of those painful experiences in the past than to be compelled to witness the spectacle of men who share the advantages which the Secretary of State shares, men who have great gifts, and who, instead of using them to elucidate points that ought to be familiar and capable of being dealt with so by himself, use their great gifts rather to belittle and make to appear insignificant and incapable hon. Members on this side who have not had the advantages which he has had.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that any hon. Member should feel so, and if the hon. Member feels it sincerely I am sure he will allow me to say how ninth I regret it. But I am afraid he has not quite followed me. I do not take the view that if different words were employed, it would be a good thing to add this Clause to the Bill. I have tried to explain to the Douse why I take the view, which I think is widely shared, that it would be better not to have any such Clause inserted in the Bill, and that nobody at this stage could produce a Clause which defined exactly what the advisory committee should do or how it should be constituted. I regret that the

hon. Member opposite should have felt hurt at anything that I said.</p>

<p>I accept the Home Secretary's protestation that he has no desire to wound anybody's feelings or to treat with scorn their humble efforts to improve legislation. I must draw the attention of the House to the fact that the right hon. Gentleman tried to show that the proposed new Clause had certain implications which he, with his legal mind, must have understood it did not really contain. It is true that the Clause relates to certain duties which might be performed satisfactorily by an advisory committee, but it by no means precludes the Secretary of State or the Department from carrying out their respective duties. Under the Clause the Secretary of State himself would nominate the Committee and, therefore, I cannot see the objection to it. There may be legal objections which do not present themselves to the ordinary lay mind. I listened to them, and I confess that they have no weight with an ordinary plain-thinking and perhaps, unfortunately, a plain-speaking person like myself. I hope the Committee will agree with the Clause.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to appreciate the unwillingness of the Secretary of State to agree to the setting up of an advisory committee. As far as I can judge, an advisory committee is absolutely essential if you are to secure for the workers under a two-shift system what is called a fair crack of the whip. I do not think there is much likelihood of the workers being able to express themselves by means of a secret ballot. English industry is changing and the two-shift system in the future affecting new industries will bring tremendous difficulties for women and young girls. The hon. Member for Anglesey (Miss Lloyd George) said that the Committee received evidence to the effect that the two-shift system would not have an evil effect on the health of girls and young women. I do not know whether the Committee had any evidence from North Wales, but in my judgment, after two years of experience, I think that a two-shift system will seriously affect the health of girls and young women. It has been in operation in places where people have been aggregated in large numbers, and girls and young women have had to go only short


distances to their work. It is an entirely different position in North Wales. The new industries are not being established in big industrial centres&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Departmental Committee were in favour of setting up a committee to advise the Home Office, and for some time I have not been able to understand why an advisory committee should not be in the Bill. Contrary to the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Marklew) the speech of the Home Secretary has made it quite clear to me why it would be much better if the committee is not actually put into the Bill. It is obvious that the composition suggested in the Clause will not do, and that the Home Secretary should have power to alter the composition of the committee for the consideration of different questions as they crop up. I am sure the Opposition, like myself, want to safeguard the workers and to make a success of the double-shift system. I think they will be following their own wishes more completely if they withdraw the Clause

and constitute a committee which would have more power to watch over the welfare and health of the workers. I have seen no deleterious effects on the health of people who work under the double-shift system and, indeed, by having two shifts you make more certain that good conditions for the workers will prevail. I hope the Clause will not be pressed, because I do not think it is in the interest of the workers.</p>

<p>I am amazed at some of the statements of the Home Secretary. His argument against the Clause that it makes no mention of women, of Wales or of Scotland certainly shows the poverty of his arguments. If he desired to have Scottish representatives, they could be appointed, so also as regards Wales, and also as regards women. It is difficult to understand why he used such an argument unless he had no other against the proposal. He said that the proposal would prevent his Department acting quickly. I am delighted to hear that at last the Home Office is prepared to act quickly when dealing with labour matters. It will be a new departure. In the past, when we have pointed out that employers and great combines were operating the two-shift system illegally, we could not prevail on the Home Office to take action quickly. It was trade union action which compelled these people to cease operating the two-shift system which they had introduced illegally. I suggest that an advisory committee would be able to deal with complaints which may not be illegal, but which may be most disadvantageous to the people in the industry. If there is anything illegal being done, surely the Home Secretary is not going to consult an advisory committee. I hope he will take action at once whenever there is any illegality.<br/>
Really I find it difficult to understand any of the points put forward by the Home Secretary. He said that there would be a difficulty as to the representation of particular trades. I notice that he did not appoint the Commission with any regard to particular trades, although he is proposing to shelter himself behind the signature of an hon. Member on this side of the House, a representative of the engineers union, who signed that report. The Home


Office is proposing to shelter themselves behind that signature. Those who have had experience of the two-shift system since its first operation in 1920 know that there are many things attaching to it which need investigation, but which might not be considered by the Home Office sufficient to justify them in cancelling these certificates. There are conditions which may require remedy from the point of view of the workpeople. Those are matters to be considered by an advisory committee. The suggestion of the Home Office is to bring the factory inspectors into the discussion as to whether or not certain conditions are unfavourable for the workpeople., If you are going to bring the factory inspectors into the discussion well and good, but once you bring civil servants into the field in connection with this matter we may have to attack or we may have to approve of whatever action they take.<br/>
I am opposed to the two-shift system because I have seen it in operation and I have not known of any advantage in it to the workpeople. Many of us thought that we had at last got away from the 6 a.m. start, but under this system a 6 a.m. start can be made operative for young people at 16. As was so well pointed out by the hon. Member who submitted the proposed new Clause, we are asking young people to work under those conditions while we have some 2,000,000 unemployed in the country. We shall be cutting at the roots of family life in this country if we go back to a system which means hours of work starting at 6 o'clock in the morning and ending at 10 o'clock in the evening. We have the promise of the present occupant of the office of Home Secretary that an advisory committee may be set up but no reason has been advanced against a committee such as is proposed in the new Clause to advise the Home Secretary on these matters.<br/>
The question of the secret ballot has been mentioned. I hope hon. Members realise what this secret ballot means. It is to be taken among the people who happen to be in a particular employment at a particular moment and they can decide that the two-shift system is to be operated in that particular establishment or department. Every one of those who vote in that way may be discharged from that employment but the system will still

be in operation for people who never had the chance of voting on the proposal. They will have to take the employment, because the Ministry of Labour will insist that unless they do so they will be robbed of benefit.</p>

<p>I hope not to go against your Ruling, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, and I am only pointing out one of the matters upon which such a committee might very well advise the Home Secretary. I wish to show the possibility of injustices being inflicted upon people. The Home Secretary has referred to certain things in regard to which he could not act until the advisory committee had reported if our proposal were accepted. But these are matters upon which the advice should be taken immediately. Apparently the Home Secretary refuses to accept his proposal merely because it is something new. I do not see why the House should not be prepared to adopt a proposal even though it is new. I hope the House will divide upon this question. I would like to see the House deciding to put into the Bill something which will alleviate any hardships and injustices inflicted upon boys and girls who are to be forced into these factories at 6 o'clock in the morning and may have to work until 10 o'clock at night without having those reasonable opportunities for education and recreation to which they are entitled.</p>

<p>Anyone who had not a real knowledge of the Bill and the proposed new Clause would imagine from the speech of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Kelly) that, if we passed the Bill without the Clause, young people in this country would be compelled to work from 6 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night. Of course, nothing of the sort is proposed. If they start work at 6 o'clock in the morning they will be free for the afternoon and will be able to enjoy some daylight for their pleasure and their leisure in the winter months which is not possible at present. But I do not propose to follow the hon. Member into a discussion of the Bill or the two-shift system as a whole. I wish to confine my remarks to the proposed new


Clause. I wonder why those who put down the Clause did not adopt the wording of the Departmental Committee's report which suggested that an advisory body should be set up to advise the Horne Secretary
<q>as occasion arose on questions of importance in connection with the application and operation of the system.</q>
I suppose hon. Members opposite did not think that that recommendation went far enough. The Clause seems to go a great deal further. We are told that it is not intended that any complaint which may he received shall go before the committee but that is the effect of the Clause as I read it. Any complaint must go to the committee and that would not be a workable arrangement, as I think hon. Members opposite themselves have agreed. The hon. Member for Rochdale suggested that under the Bill we were not to have any advisory committee. I do pot think that those who have heard this Debate or the discussions in Committee, if they spoke with care and thought, choosing their words, would say that there was not to be an advisory committee. We have had an assurance from the Home Secretary that there is to be an advisory committee and he has explained the reasons why, if this Clause were put into the Bill, it would not do what hon. Members want it to do.<br/>
The Home Secretary has already pointed out the difficulties that would arise if you were to have representatives on such a body from different parts of the country. If the advisory body is to he a rigid statutory body consisting only of eight people who are to represent employers and employ&#x00E9; I do not think it will he sufficient. That is not the type of committee we desire. The Home Secretary and also hon. Members opposite asked what was the use of talking about a representative from Scotland and a representative from Wales. If you are to have on this statutory body only four members representing the workpeople and four members representing the employers and if you have one from Scotland and one from Wales on each side that will only leave two on each side, How are you going to select two people capable of advising on all this wide variety of subjects? It will be necessary to have people who can deal with the

educational side and the health side as well as with the industrial side of the various questions which will arise.<br/>
I feel that the proposed new Clause would not fulfil the purpose which we would all desire an advisory committee to fulfil as laid down in the Departmental Committee's report. If it is to be fixed at eight members and if it is to be confined to those who appear to represent employers and workpeople respectively, it will not be satisfactory. I would like to see on such a committee people who, for want of a better term, are called social workers and who have more to do with the regulation of these matters on the social side than in other respects&#x2014;people such as those who gave evidence to the Departmental Committee who know the needs of the situation from different paints of view and who are acquainted with particular local interests and requirements. I think a rigid statutory committee of the kind proposed in the new Clause would not be a help but a, hindrance. If this scheme is to be worked at all, we all want to see it worked for the best and we want to get the best advice in working it. I know that a great many hon. Members opposite do not approve of the system at all and would vote against the Bill as a whole, as they did on the Second Reading, but if the Bill is to pass, and if the system which has been tried for many years is to become a permanent part of our industrial system, I am sure they will agree that we want it to be tried under the best possible conditions.<br/>
I suggest that if they give further consideration to the wording of this Clause and to the inflexibility of the body which it proposes, they must recognise that it would not be the kind of body to give the Minister the best possible advice. Had they adopted the wording of the Departmental Committee it would have gone a long way with me but I submit to the House that a consideration of the actual wording of the Clause shows how difficult it would be to put into the Bill a. definition of a committee such as we want. When we have the assurance of the Home Secretary that there is to be an advisory body I do not see why we should adopt this proposal. We have embodied in this Bill practically all the suggestions of the Departmental Committee. We have gone further in some respects and have been more definite on certain points. If the


advisory committee has not been put into the Bill, I think it is desirable that it should be a flexible committee rather than a rigid statutory body. I want a committee which can look ahead and deal with difficulties that may arise in the future. I hope that the proposed new Clause will be withdrawn and that a better committee than that proposed will be set up for the benefit of all the people who are to work this system.</p>

<p>The point which we have to consider is whether it would be better to set up an advisory committee under the Bill or whether these matters should be left to a voluntary committee. I am by no means impressed by the arguments which have been used against the wording of the Clause, and I thought the Home Secretary took a rather biased view of the question. He pointed out all the possible disadvantages of the Clause and said its drafting was restrictive from a legal point of view. The right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary said that this is not a matter on which we can get very heated. He said he has an open mind, and as long as it is not open at both ends, I do not mind very much. I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that if we could convince him that the best method would be to put a Clause of this nature in the Bill, he would have no difficulty in finding the right wording for it. It is quite true that this legislation has been carried on for a period of 16 years and that it has been renewed from year to year, but it has never been really acceptable to the trade unionists of this country. When the Labour Government was in office many of us were rather disappointed that they continued the Bill from year to year, and we were rather amused by the arguments which they used to persuade the House to allow the Bill to be carried on.<br/>
Now, however, we have finished with the Measure as a temporary one and it is to be made a permanent part of the law. Now it is to be part and parcel of the law, there may, and I think there probably will, be an extension of the two-shift system to many trades and industries apart from those in which it is already in operation, and that being the case, I am satisfied in my own mind that an advisory committee is absolutely necessary. It is not so much a question of an advisory committee receiving complaints

on what is within the Act, but, in the words of this Clause,
<q>complaints which may be received regarding the operation of any authorisation under this Act.</q>
This two-shift system has been in operation in certain trades and industries, and has been applied chiefly by firms already having the reputation of being pretty good employers. It is now proposed to widen the scope of this Measure. Let me in this connection refer to the baking industry, on which I am competent to speak. The development which is now taking place in the baking industry is that the small employers are being wiped out and the tendency is towards centralisation. You are beginning to get factory-made cakes which, incidentally, speaking as an expert, I would not recommend to any Member of this House. If that development continues there might be a two-shift system, and then there would be factories in which practically the whole of the employ&#x00E9;s would be women and girls. This Bill proposes to allow small children&#x2014;I think I may call them&#x2014;of 16 years of age to come under the operation of the two-shift system. They are to be allowed to work on the afternoon shift up till 10 o'clock at night.<br/>
I am not at all sure whether we should not be well advised to have included in this Bill a Clause setting up this advisory committee for the purpose of inquiring into the operation of this Bill so far as it affects the well-being and the moral and social welfare of small children of 16 years of age who leave a factory at 10 o'clock at night and who, in many instances, have to spend half an hour, three-quarters of an hour, or an hour in getting home. If we are to have this Bill&#x2014;and if the Government are determined to have it, they will have it, of course&#x2014;our duty on this side is to try to safeguard as far as we can the interests of all concerned. I do not agree with some of my friends on this side of the House who necessarily think that the Secretary of State for the Home Department is less sympathetic on this matter than we are ourselves. I do not think anything of the kind. I have had experience of the Horne Office under many Governments and I say in all sincerity that the Home Office have always been willing and ready, irrespective of the Government in office, to listen to representations on matters of this sort.<br/>
I have some doubt as to the voluntary advisory committee, as to the powers it is to be given and the things it will be given to do. I have some doubts as to whether it will see this matter as I see it, that it is not only the strict letter of the law that requires attention, but rather all the effect which a Bill of this nature has on the lives of these very young children. I am very sorry that 16 years of age is in this Bill at all; I see no great necessity for it and I think 18 years of age would have been quite all right. I was not convinced by the arguments used by the hon. Lady the Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh), who has spoken against this Clause. I regret very much indeed that the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. C. Brown) is prevented by illness from being present, because we would have liked very much to have heard his views on this particular matter. It may be that the hon. Member for Mansfield was prepared to support this Measure, but I think we have a right to say that if he were here this afternoon he might be supporting us in setting up a statutory advisory committee under this Bill. We are just as much justified in believing he would take our point of view as hon. Members opposite are in believing he would take their point of view. In any case, during the discussions which have taken place on this Clause I feel that a, great deal of respect has been paid to the Departmental Committee. This is one of those remarkable occasions when all the recommendations of a Departmental Committee appear to coincide with the views of the Home Office and the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>If that be the case, it is a compliment to the Departmental Committee. I am rather inclined to put it to the Secretary of State that the Departmental Committee was guided so carefully by those in charge that the views of the right hon. Gentleman were imperceptibly impressed upon the Committee. I do not know whether that is the case, because I did not serve upon the Committee, but I have known Departmental Committees to make excellent reports on various matters and Secretaries of State to say that it is im-

possible to accept their recommendations. Perhaps it is unfortunate for us on this side of the House that our own representative on the Committee saw eye to eye with the remainder of the members, but I do wish to impress upon the right hon. Gentleman that because this report was unanimous he must not believe it really expresses the feelings of those of us who represent the workpeople in industry. We are compelled by the force of circumstances and by a Government majority to accept this Bill very unwillingly. I beg the right hon. Gentleman to look into this matter again. He will get his majority on this Clause, but in view of what I have said this afternoon, I beg him to see whether there is not some way and some form of words which would satisfy us that these young people, particularly these girls of 16, are to be protected.<br/>
A great deal has been said about the secret ballot. The hon. Lady the Member for Anglesey (Miss Lloyd George) mentioned this in her speech, but unfortunately some of us who know the ins and out of industry, who represent work-people and who have negotiated with employers all our lives, know that work-people can be given secret ballots and that inevitably they will turn out the way the employers want. Perhaps that is because the workpeople have not the courage to stand up to the employers, but that is no reason why we should not protect them. After all, the vast majority of workmen have a great sense of loyalty towards the firm which employs them, and if the firm says it wants to have the two-shift system, even though the workpeople may not like it they feel a sense of loyalty to the firm and do not like to vote against it. We must take some steps to protect them. I am not now referring to the technical breaches of the law, for it is rather to deal with things which come outside technical breaches of the law that I would like this advisory committee to be set up. I hope it will be possible for the right hon. Gentleman to give some assistance. Even if he will not accept this particular wording and method, I beg him to look into the matter and see whether it is possible for him to do something.</p>

<p>I rise with some hesitation to take part in this Debate, because I have not been in the


Chamber very long; but some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Wednesbury (Mr. Banfield) rather inspire me to make a few comments I hope I shall not say anything which will take me beyond the rules of order, because I was not quite clear whether the hon. Member for Wednesbury made a Second Reading speech in opposition to the whole Bill or whether he was supporting the new Clause on the Order Paper, but I take it that he felt he could not support the new Clause without making some fairly wide references to the general subject-matter of the Bill. Honestly, I do not think any of the persons described in this Bill will feel any particular hardship if they work on a shift which starts at six o'clock in the morning and ends at two o'clock, with an hour's break, or if they start at one o'clock and finish at 10 o'clock, with a break. It does not seem to me that this is something which the hulk of them will regard as unduly oppressive. The argument for the setting up of a statutory committee is really based on the idea that these conditions of employment will be oppressive. I do not think most of us who have worked in factories would have regarded them as oppressive.</p>

<p>I happened to be connected with one. In pre-War days, with a few exceptions, the normal starting hour was six o'clock in the morning and very often the employ&#x00E9;s did not finish until five o'clock in the afternoon, and sometimes it was half-past five, a very much longer period than we are inclined to think about in these days.</p>

<p>I am merely saying what used to happen. It was not my experience that the apprentices in the place where I worked regarded themselves as unduly oppressed. On the other hand, I welcomed the reduction in hours which took place, generally speaking, during 1919 and 1920. I had an extensive opportunity of discussing and studying the economic effects of that reduction as

the honorary secretary of a committee of inquiry constituted both by the employers and by the trade unions concerned. It turned out that, broadly speaking, the change did not cause any economic disadvantages. When things bad shaken down, there was not much adverse effect on production, and in a great many cases none at all. This change will clearly have the effect of improving the efficiency of production and will make it much more possible for higher wages to be paid. That has to be borne in mind.

<p>I was afraid that the hon. Member would lead me astray. He used a, general criticism of the Bill as an argument for the setting up of a statutory committee. I agree with the Bishop who said that if Noah had had a committee he would never have built the Ark. If we surround the actions of a Minister with a series of statutory committees this will, in the long run, hamper his work very much, and make it difficult for him to act promptly. In the long run this committee would not facilitate things, but delay them. If a Minister decides from time to time that there are particular problems in connection with the administration of any Act, it would be helpful if he asked a committee to look into them, but if we appoint a committee of this kind, which is to have a roving commission and power to act on its own initiative, the Secretary of State will be hampered in his administration of the Bill. It is not necessary to have such a committee because there is a necessary check on a Minister in this House if he does anything stupid. We should do well to reject the proposed Clause and to trust the Secretary of State to see that whatever is necessary is done by him as an ordinary administrative duty.</p>

<p>I hope that the Home Secretary who said that he had an open mind on this question, will have been convinced by the arguments that have been advanced and will have found on reflection that he is able to accept the new Clause. I gather that he is anxious to have an advisory committee but that he is not prepared to put it in statutory form in the Bill. One of his


arguments against the proposed Clause was that the language was very loose. Surely he could have that amended in another place if he desired to have it. That argument was very weak. Another point in his argument was in regard to the proposed number of persons on this committee. Eight would be a maximum, and they would be drawn from the work-people and employers in equal numbers and from social workers and experts. There is no reason why they should be equally divisible, as was suggested by the Home Secretary. The imperative matter is that the Home Secretary and his Department should be convinced that the persons who have to work under this Bill have as humane treatment as possible.<br/>
This Bill is creating a precedent and setting up a system which will continue in perpetuity and increase substantially as the years go by. We had a discussion yesterday about the setting up of light industries in the Special Areas. One can well see that young persons of 18 and over will be the type of worker to be engaged in ever increasing numbers in these light industries. With the application of new technique and inventions to industry young persons, and particularly girls, are being employed in ever increasing numbers, and the two-shift system is likely to be a permanent and growing feature of our industrial life. That being so, it is imperative that the Home Secretary should have at his disposal persons who could reflect the measure of ill or good that this new system might be doing. They would be able to report from time to time the ill effects of the system and would be in a position to advise how they should be removed.<br/>
There will be no way of eliciting the necessary information and advice unless a statutory body is laid down in the Bill. There are a large number of people who are prepared to act philanthropically and to give their knowledge and advice whenever it is sought, but the Home Secretary will treat this matter very lightly if he leaves it to philanthropic ladies and gentlemen who may be specialists in sociology and other subjects. It is essential that these young persons should have built around them a defence&#x2014;social defence works, call them what you will&#x2014;but it is imperative that they should be

defended against any hardships that this system may impose on them. That defence can only be built by personalities with knowledge and experience, who are able to tender advice and to see whether the operation of the two-shift system is working harm on the juveniles who are employed.<br/>
I should get out of order if I followed the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams). I know what it is to start at five o'clock in the morning and to work underground as a lad for many hours, but I would not dare to make the confession, as the hon. Member did, that I liked it. I do not know whether he meant it when he stated that he revelled in going to the factory at six o'clock in the morning, but one often finds that when people are away from work they always talk about the good old times, while they are, at the same time, always struggling to run away from the horrible days of the past and using all the energy they have to impose the bad past on the present. We find these retrograde brains coming into the House in support of the present Government, and it makes me indignant when I hear people talk like that. If we are progressive we should realise that in this new age it is our duty to secure in legislation the maximum of humane treatment in industry. Much more consideration has been given to the machine than to the human being, because machinery obviously costs more. We ought, therefore, to take the opportunity of a Measure of this kind to set up a body of experienced persons to tender advice from time to time on the working of the two-shift system. I hope from what has been heard since the Home Secretary made his speech, particularly from the hon. Member for Wednesbury (Mr. Banfield), who has so much knowledge of the two-shift system in industry, that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to accept the new Clause.</p>

<p>We are all agreed that this Bill is likely to have a far-reaching effect on the young life of the nation. In many industrial centres it will affect the habits of the homes and the social life of the people. Consequently, it is important that there should be some permanent machinery which will watch the operation of the Measure. It is generally agreed on all sides that there


should be an advisory committee, but we on this side are pressing that the committee should be a statutory body within the Bill itself. We press for it because we want to feel confident that such a committee will be set up and that, once it has been set up, it will not be allowed to lapse at the discretion of any future Home Secretary. Questions relating to the health and welfare of the workers concerned, and the hours of employment, must be continually watched. We, therefore, want to have an assurance that a permanent committee will be set up continually to watch the operations of the</p>

<p>Bill. There is no difference of opinion as to the scope and purposes of the committee. If the pedantic arguments of the Home Secretary are at all sound, he could secure Amendments to the new Clause in, another place. There is a case for a permanent standing committee, and because of the profound results that this Bill will have, that committee should be a statutory body.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 16, to leave out "two in the afternoon," and to insert "twelve noon."<br/>
In moving this Amendment, which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Wednesbury (Mr. Banfield) and myself, I must express regret that all the Amendments which would have provided an opportunity of discussing the hours of labour except this one, which seeks to


make the finishing hour on Saturday noon instead of 2 p.m., have been ruled out. If it be true, as we on this side maintain, that an early start in the morning and a late finishing hour in the evening will have a deleterious effect on the health of the workers, of young persons in particular, there is all the more reason why the Home Office should consider seriously whether we ought not to be granted the concession sought in this Amendment. I feel quite sure that the best employers will welcome this Amendment, and that whether it he accepted or not it will operate in most cases, because experience has taught industrialists that there is a limit to endurance, and the many experiments tried in industry have shown that a long week-end granted to employ&#x00E9;s keeps them more fit to resume work on the Monday morning. From that point of view this Amendment would help at least to maintain, if not to increase, the output of a factory. When the long hours which used to be worked were gradually reduced from 60 hours a week to 50, and then to 48, output was still maintained, because the efficiency and the health of the workers were kept up&#x2014;they were kept at the top of their form.<br/>
I entirely disagree with the hon. Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh), who stated on the Second Reading that the shift system affords more opportunity for leisure and recreation. I took the opportunity on Second Reading to quote from the evidence submitted to the committee of inquiry the evidence of two wit nesses who were employ&#x00E9;s under the system, and they reported that while they felt no ill-effects from it, the reason for that was that when working in the morning they went to bed early or rested during the afternoon. If that is the practice which is followed, where does the opportunity for gaining recreation come in? There is all the more reason for giving additional hours of leisure during the week-end, when recreation is provided for working-class people in particular, by curtailing the hours on Saturday from two in the afternoon until 12 noon. It is in general practice in most industries. Sometimes it is. 12 noon, or an earlier hour than that, on Saturday.<br/>
I have had it from employers on very good authority that they prefer to close down entirely on Saturdays, because they can then clean up the week's work and make preparation and organisation for

commencing work on the following Monday. From the point of view of efficiency and organisation, employers would welcome the curtailing of the work on Saturday morning to 12 noon. Considering the monotony and the exactness required under the two-shift system, we think it will be absolutely necessary for the workers to be released at an earlier hour than 2 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, which is, moreover, an encroachment upon the workers' week-end, which has become a British institution. We look jealously on anything which would take that away or would lessen the opportunities of the workpeople to enjoy leisure and recreation during the weekend.<br/>
I make a strong appeal to the Under-Secretary that he should consider this very important Amendment seriously. It would be appreciated by the operatives much more than a curtailment of hours in mid-week, because they look forward to Saturday for their release from the rigid discipline of the factory so that they can get away to the recreations to which they are justly entitled. We tried to secure this alteration in Committee but it was resisted, unfortunately. We have a complete case on grounds of efficiency and organisation, as well as the health of the workers, and I hope that the appeal which we are making will lead the Under-Secretary to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
The Bill is a kind of slippery slope. Instead of the usual 12 o'clock knocking-off time on Saturday, or one o'clock, we have now reached 2 o'clock. We are opening a fairly wide door, and that will inevitably lead to trade disputes. In places where the two-shift system is in operation, workpeople will be required to arrive at 6 o'clock in the morning and to work until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Some of the effects of the Bill have not been thought out. In the main industries of the country a 6 o'clock starting time is unreasonable. In the constituency which I represent, where a heavy industry makes nuts and bolts, and all sorts of things like that, 7 o'clock is the recognised starting time throughout the year. If a form of two-shift system is adopted, they will have to start work at


6 o'clock on Saturday and continue to work until 2 o'clock in the afternoon.<br/>
In spite of anything we have said, the Government have made up their minds to retain the two-shift system, and the Bill will go through, but if it is necessary to have that system, surely employers might fall into line with the general shutting-down time of 12 o'clock on Saturday. That is not a great concession to ask for from those who will benefit from the two-shift system. Surely the employers are not going to thrust down the throats of the working people an extra two hours after Saturday noon. The tendency to-day is to do away altogether with working on Saturday. The heads of great firms with household reputations have talked to me on many occasions on this matter. They had persuaded themselves&#x2014;I had not to persuade them&#x2014;that it was not good business and was unprofitable to commence work on Saturday morning&#x2014;most of them do not start until about 8 o'clock&#x2014;and to work four hours. In the Bill, not only are young people to work under the disadvantages, which I am sure will be terrible, of the two-shift system, young girls having to work until 10 in the evening, but they will now have to work until 2 o'clock on Saturday.<br/>
The Under-Secretary is new to the job, and his heart must be much tenderer than that of the Home Secretary. How does he think that young boys will be able to go and see West Bromwich Albion play if they are to be kept at work? It is a serious blow to lads who take a pride in their football to be kept at work until 2 o'clock and then have to get home and change. In the winter it will be dark before they get out. I hope the Under-Secretary will reconsider this matter. Employers who will work the two-shift system can well afford to make the concession. The best employers will do so. I do not see for the life of me the necessity to tie workers down from 6 till 2. When the Departmental Committee presented the report which had not to be altered by a full stop or even a semi-colon, apparently the Secretary of State said: "Yes, this is all right, I have not a word to say about it. Just adopt it." This House has the last word to say in that matter. I suggest that we might find a tiny fault in the report in respect of this very small matter, and that

the Under-Secretary can well afford to ask his right hon. Friend to make this small concession.</p>

<p>Some consideration ought to be given on Saturday morning to the early shift which has been working from 6 till 2 on the ordinary days of the week. The reasons given by the Mover and Seconder of the Amendment are not merely those associated with leisure, but with recreation, which is usually taken on Saturday from mid-day. In my own experience in the engineering works in which I served my apprenticeship, there was a 12 o'clock break on Saturday with half-an-hour break after working from 6 in the morning. As a result of a little agitation, it was decided that a shorter Saturday was essential to retain morale and physique, particularly of the young employ&#x00E9;s. When we were given the advantage of an early stoppage at half-past nine on Saturday morning by this firm, known throughout the Kingdom, it gave us an opportunity of recreation at such sports as football and ice hockey, suitable to the north. It is essential that the younger persons should not be subject to an encroachment upon their Saturday afternoon, which will affect not only their interests but the interests of their families. Saturday afternoon is a busy shopping day for the ordinary working-class home. If one or two members of a family are working till 2 o'clock the domestic arrangements are upset in that home, and that affects the temper and ultimately, possibly, the health of the occupants.<br/>
A few weeks ago I had the honour of presenting a shield at a football match between two schoolboy teams. The majority of those schoolboys were leaving school within the next six or 12 months. The shield that I handed was presented by an hon. Member of this House some years ago for the playing of those games. The hon. Member for Walsall (Mr. Leckie) was also a Member of the Committee on this Bill and originally presented this shield&#x2014;I wonder whether he will be very anxious in future, if when the shield is handed over, if it is said that so and so's division were outclassed by Walsall because they had better facilities for getting players as a result of the operation in one district of the two-shift system, which prevented even


the selection of the right teams in the Junior and upper sections in that district. I would ask the Under-Secretary, if he is empowered to express a judgment, that he should offer some little latitude, and even consider some compensation, to young persons who come under this Measure, not only for the convenience of the persons engaged in industry, but for the better content and happiness of the households of which they are members.</p>

<p>I desire to add my voice to the pleas put forward by my hon. Friends. It seems almost unthinkable that, in 1936, the House of Commons should be discussing a Measure which will mean a lengthening of the working day for young people. When we get older, recreation is not such a necessity, but when boys and girls are free from their work in the factory or office it is vital that they should get some time in daylight for recreation, and that time is only available, especially in winter, if they can leave their office or workshop at a reasonable hour. It is said that constant dripping wears away the hardest stone. I would not liken the Under-Secretary to a stone, because he has been very kind to me on several occasions, but I am hoping that, if he hears the same story many times, he will realise that there is considerable weight behind it.<br/>
I can speak on this matter from some experience. I worked for 30 years or more in an office where the Saturday closing hour was not the dreadful one of 2 o'clock, as in, this Bill, but 1 o'clock. Then, in response to trade union requests, the hour was altered to 12, and I can assure the Under-Secretary that hardly any change that took place in that important office gave so much satisfaction as the shortening of the Saturday working time by one hour. If the closing time is 1 o'clock, and still more so if it is 2 o'clock, by the time the worker has got home and had a meal and cleaned and dressed himself it is tea-time, and the afternoon is gone.<br/>
We all value the week-end, and I hope the Under-Secretary will be prepared to make a change in the Bill that will extend the privilege of a reasonable weekend to the people covered by the Measure. Very many people nowadays do riot live next door to their work; they have to

spend some time in journeying, which eats into the available free time on the Saturday, and, if the Under-Secretary will make the hour 12 instead of 2, it will mean a great deal to the young people. Many employers, as has been already said, have cut out the Saturday turn of duty altogether. We are not asking for that. If it would be too big a change to make the hour 12 o'clock, perhaps the hon. Gentleman would meet us by making it 1 o'clock, but at any rate I would beg him not to allow the hour of 2 o'clock to remain in the Bill.</p>

<p>In listening to the speeches of hon. Members opposite, one would think that the hours of 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. which are mentioned in the Bill were compulsory hours; but is it not the case that they are permissive, and that in no case, I suppose, will the young persons work from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.? I should have thought, for instance, that the young people whose case has been quoted, who, very rightly, want to get away to see football matches on Saturdays, will be able to get away, and that in none of these cases will work go on until 2 o'clock. I should think that the trade unions would be very careful to see to it that it does not. The point about which we want to be clear is that the hours mentioned in the Bill are permissive, and not compulsory.</p>

<p>Hon. Gentlemen opposite have put me, in a way, in rather a difficult position. If everything they have said to-day were correct, I must say I should feel that there was a strong case for meeting them, but as a matter of fact they have&#x2014;I do not, of course, say deliberately, but under a misapprehension &#x2014;made several statements to the House which do not give an altogether correct view of the situation. For example my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Mr. A. Somerville) has just made the very valuable point, which has not been mentioned on the other side, that these hours are permissive. They are the maximum hours. No longer hours can be worked than those which we are discussing at the moment. But there is nothing to prevent&#x2014;</p>

<p>Does not the maximum tend to become normal, and would not these hours be copied by all employers everywhere?</p>

<p>That is not the case, because, under the present law, we could have 12-hour working, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. or from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Those are the periods mentioned in the Factory Acts, but hon. Members are well aware that, fortunately, those hours are not now worked, although I believe it is the unfortunate fact that in certain areas, where there is a great deal of work, some excessive hours are being worked. They are, however, permissible at present, and one of the advantages of the present Bill will be that they will definitely not be permissible in the case of any young person or woman to whom the Bill applies. I do not think the hon. Gentleman has really made out his case that the maximum permissible hours always become those which are in fact worked. At the present time the hours stated in the Bill, which hon. Gentlemen opposite seek to alter, are those mentioned in the Act which is extended from year to year under the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, but it is not the practice to work those hours on a Saturday in all the cases in which authorisations have been given by my right hon. Friend, so that, even in the definite case with which we are dealing, the point made by hon. Gentlemen opposite really does not quite apply.<br/>
I should like to remind hon. Gentlemen that not only is it not necessary, and will not, I think, be the case, that workers on the morning shift on Saturday will always be kept till 2 p.m., but there is the very important fact, which hon. Members opposite have not stressed, that in ordinary circumstances those workers have every other Saturday completely free from work, so that the maximum period up to 2 p.m. which we hope will not in every case be worked, can only occur on every other Saturday. If I might take the homely illustration, referred to by the hon. Member for Wednesbury (Mr. Banfield), of the young man who wishes to go to see West Bromwich Albion, or, indeed, Aston Villa or any other local club, I would say that very likely in the Midlands these hours will not be worked up to, because I think that on the whole it is not the normal practice to do so in that part of

the country; and no doubt, therefore, that young man will be able to enjoy his recreation on a Saturday afternoon; but I would also point out that under the Bill any young person working under a two-shift system will not only be able in all probability to attend the home match, but will even have an advantage over people who in the ordinary way work every Saturday, in that he will have every other Saturday completely free, so that if on one of those Saturdays Aston Villa or West Bromwich Albion were playing away in another part of the country, he would be able to travel up with the team. I give that as an illustration to show that it is not all a question of disadvantage, but that there are substantial advantages as well.<br/>
We have heard a great deal about the dreadful nature of this hour of 2 p.m. The hon. Member for Wednesbury said that we are leaving 12 o'clock and going to 2 o'clock, and that that is opening a very wide door. But, as I have pointed out, it is only doing that in regard to every other Saturday, whereas I feel bound to point out that, in the Bill introduced by hon. Gentlemen opposite, which even had the backing of the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies), the hours on Saturday were from 6 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon. I really think that hon. Gentlemen opposite are not treating us altogether candidly in this matter. I hope their feelings will not be wounded if I say, as I feel bound to say, that they are tending to show too much partisanship in regard to this Measure, without any regard to their own record on these matters in the past. Therefore, having cleared away some of the misconceptions and revealed the fact that hon. Gentlemen themselves have taken up a position very similar to this, except that it applied, not to every other Saturday, but to every Saturday, I feel that I could not be reasonably expected to make the alteration for which they ask.</p>

<p>I should require to see the document from which the hon. Gentleman has quoted before I accept what he tells the House about it. After his speech, one would almost imagine that the two-shift system was the best for everyone. If that be the case, why should we have a single-shift system at all? If this is such a splendid


arrangement for boys and girls and young women, Parliament ought to be passing a Bill to call upon everybody to work under the two-shift system. The hon. Member for Windsor (Mr. A. Somerville) has said that the hours of 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays are, after all, permissive, but he will pardon my telling him that I have yet to find an employer who will not utilise and absorb all the permissive hours that are given to him under the law, except where the trade union is strong enough to prevent it. In this case, however, as we have pointed out many times, we are dealing with women and young persons, and young persons under 16 do not take part in trade union activities to the extent of governing their conditions of employment. What is the use, therefore, of talking about trade union activities in this connection?<br/>
The Under-Secretary would have us believe that all is well under the two-shift system, that if we carry the wording of this Clause, and say that these women and young persons shall be employed up to 2 p.m. on Saturdays, employers will not avail themselves of that permission, but will still finish at noon. If that argument holds good, why cannot our Amendment be accepted If it be true that employers do not intend to utilise, and do not now utilise, all the hours up to 2 p.m., that they are all decent folk, that they all have the welfare of their em-</p>

<p>ploy&#x00E9;s at heart and will close their factories at 12, why cannot the hon.

<p>We have always to legislate for that minority of employers who will never do the right thing by their employ&#x00E9;s unless they are compelled. That is why we have tabled this Amendment. I am opposed to the two-shift system altogether. I suppose some Members will live long enough to see the vast majority of women and young persons employed under it. It is very sad that in 1936, for the first time probably in half a century, Parliament is going to give permission to employers to employ women and young persons up to two o'clock on Saturday. Let us make it clear that any one who votes against our Amendment is voting for the possibility of women arid young persons being employed on Saturday up to two o'clock, which is against the custom in nearly all the factories in the country at the moment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 19, to leave out "an average of."<br/>
The object of this Amendment is to prevent in any circumstances women and young persons being employed on the two-shift system for as long as 12 hours in a day in some cases and 10 hours in a day in all cases. The Bill certainly provides that the hours worked in a week cannot exceed 48 and the hours worked in two consecutive weeks cannot exceed 84, and it is reasonable to presume that in an ordinary working week nothing worse than the abominable conditions that were spoken of on the last Amendment are likely to happen, but in weeks where one or more holidays take place the position may easily be very different, and with a maximum of 48 hours in the August bank holiday week, it would be possible for an employer to work these women and young persons, if it was a five-day factory, 48 hours in four days, or 12 hours a day for every working day in that week. I am frankly putting the extreme number of hours which the worst employer could in the holiday week work his employ&#x00E9;s, but quite ordinarily it is possible under the Bill, by means of having a short working day, to have one or more days in the week where the hours may be 12.<br/>
There are certain industries where it would be particularly advantageous to an unscrupulous employer to use the loopholes of the Act in its present form, notably the laundry industry, where the employer is not very particular how many hours he works his employ&#x00E9;s on Monday, or even on Tuesday morning, but he is very anxious to work them the maximum number of hours on Thursday, and particularly on Friday. We think that, to prevent the working of hours in excess of eight where women and young persons are working on the shift system, it is essential that the words, "an average of," should be taken out of the Clause. It would mean that at least no woman or young person could

work in one day longer than from six o'clock in the morning until two o'clock, or from two o'clock in the afternoon until 10 o'clock at night. It is impossible in the Bill that they should start before six o'clock, or that they should finish after 10 o'clock, but between those hours, as the Bill now stands, it is possible for very long hours to be worked on one day. The advantage of the shift system to the employer is such that at least he ought to be compelled not to exceed the maximum of eight hours in any one day in respect of any person employed under the shift system.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
The intention of leaving out these words is to deal mainly with occupations in which there are at certain times of the week rush periods, which entail abnormal hours of working. We, therefore, ask that the words should be deleted from the Clause, and I hope that the House will agree to that course.</p>

<p>I really hope on this Amendment to be able to convince hon. Gentlemen opposite that the Amendment is unnecessary. I will deal, first of all, with the question why the Amendment is not necessary for securing the purposes they wish to secure, because these dangers are already provided against under the existing provisions of the Bill, and, secondly, with the question why there is a good and positive reason for keeping the word "average" in the Bill. I quite appreciate the point of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Clayton (Mr. Jagger) about the danger that there might be some unscrupulous employer causing long hours on particular days. It would be abusing the provisions of the Act if he were able to do it. That is one of the points made by the hon. Gentleman. That cannot be done under the Bill as it stands at present. In each authorisation the Home Secretary lays down exactly the


hours of the shift for every day in the week, and this cannot be altered by an employer, even if he wants to alter it. They are the legal hours and cannot be exceeded.</p>

<p>I do not want to leave it to any person to lay down hours which may be as bad as I have said.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that we must look upon this matter as a practical one, and I assure him that there has never been a proposal made to the Home Office in all the years that this system has been in operation by any employer for a freak system of hours such as he suggests. I can certainly give him the assurance that, if such a freak proposal were made, it would not be entertained by the Department.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1936-05-12a.267.3" hansard_membership_id="7895" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29457" speakername="Mr. LLOYD" colnum="267" time="">
<p>I will in a moment give the hon. Gentleman the reason why there are grave objections to the Amendment. I think that the hon. Gentleman feels that if there was no work done on a particular day, the employer might add the hours of that day on to another day. It cannot happen because the Secretary of State lays down the hours that are to be worked on particular days, and the fact that there is a holiday on a particular day of work does not entitled an employer to add those hours to the next day. He has to work the hours laid down by the Secretary of State for that day. Those are the reasons why we cannot accept, and do not think that it is necessary to have, the Amendment which the hon. Gentleman has moved. There is another reason why we feel that the word "average" should be retained. It often happens in a factory that the workers desire, for particular reasons, such as meal times and other reasons&#x2014;and the House will appreciate the immense variety of individual circumstances existing all over the country&#x2014;to have the afternoon shift longer than the morning shift. Sometimes shifts have been fixed from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 1 p.m. to 10 p.m. alternating weekly. This is a very complicated matter, as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, but that system has been

found to be convenient for the workers in certain factories, and although it comes within the average of eight hours, it could not be worked if the Amendment of the hon. Gentleman were accepted and a rigid limit of eight hours were imposed instead. Those are the practical reasons why we feel that we cannot accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Clayton (Mr. Jagger) has done good service by raising this technical problem of dividing up the hours. I would prefer to see his Amendment put into the Bill, but if the Under-Secretary of State can give a definite undertaking that none of the things which my hon. Friend has raised can possibly happen when the order is issued and the number of hours are stipulated for each day, I wonder whether my hon. Friend and the Seconder of the Amend-men will think it necessary to press the Amendment to a Division.</p>

<p>I want to know something more about the average. Years ago we had such a word in agreements with regard to working conditions between employers and employed, and we found it necessary to strike it out. The eight hours may be extended to nine hours a day. It may be from 1 o'clock in the afternoon until 10 o'clock at night, or the hours in the morning may be extended. For what period is the average to be taken? Does the Home Secretary intend to take it over a period of six months, 12 months, or a month? There is nothing here which states the period. In a seasonal trade, for instance, will the average be for some indefinite period. This is going to be a loophole for all the smart foremen and managers in the country who cause so much trouble in these days with regard to the conditions of work.

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 15, to leave out "the," and to insert "a two-thirds."<br/>
Sub-section (2) of Clause 1 provides that the Secretary of State may make arrangements to see that a secret ballot of the workpeople concerned shall be taken before the order is granted for a two-shift system to be operated in any factory or workshop. That was a concession which we secured in Committee and we were glad of it. We hope to carry the point a little further by suggesting that a simple majority of the workpeople is not sufficient for this purpose. This is not an ordinary election or ballot. Even with the best employer, if he wants the order, it will be very difficult for his workpeople to vote against his wishes, and therefore we think that a simple majority is not a sufficient expression of the wishes of the people concerned. Let the House imagine a factory, employing women and young persons, where the employer comes to the conclusion that it would be good business for him to secure the two-shift system. All that he need do is to tell his workpeople that unless he can get this order it is possible that he will have to close down his factory. When he

says that he will be speaking his own mind, but what is the position of a secret ballot of the workpeople concerned taken under conditions of that kind? No secret ballot in that case could ever be a picture of the mind of the workpeople, especially if it were a simple majority. The vast majority of employers do not want to take advantage of their work-people in this connection, but even the influence of the decent employer on the workpeople would be such that a simple majority would not be sufficient, and therefore we propose to make the majority one of two-thirds.</p>

<p>I hope that this Amendment will not be accepted. I have been interested, listening to the hon. Member's speech, to realise that when the result of a ballot is known it will not be a picture of the workpeople's mind, but that somehow or other it will be a picture of their mind if there is a two-thirds majority. What is the difference?</p>

<p>Why should it be that more people in a factory should have to declare that they are working under a system which they do not like? Why should we say if it is a simple


majority that it is not a picture of the work-people's mind Why should the hon. Member think that the people who vote for one side must be giving their mind correctly and that the people who vote for the other side are doing it under duress? If half the people in a factory wish to work the two-shift system why should they not be able to have it? Why should not the people decide for themselves? One of the best parts of this Bill is that the workpeople themselves are getting a chance of deciding. I am anxious for a secret ballot, but I cannot see why the balance should be weighted in the way which has been suggested, and why, if more than half of the people in a factory wish to have the two-shift system, we should prevent them having it. I hope that this Amendment will not be accepted, so that the will of the workpeople can be known and so that they can decide whether or not they will have the two-shift system.</p>

<p>It does not make much difference and you are just as much entitled to the Noble as other people are. The point we have in mind is the coercion of the bad employer. We have all gone through it, both in the mine and in the factory. We know that pressure can be exerted and that when an employer desires such a change he goes round to his workpeople and tries by persuasion to get them to see his point of view. That may have an effect on some, and we want to prevent that kind of pressure and to arrange for a substantial majority. We are asking that there shall be a clear and definite indication of the mind of the workpeople before a change is made. That is the only reason for this Amendment and I do not want it urged against me on a future occasion when I am supporting a bare majority.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh) would perhaps be interested in having her attention drawn to the fact that there exists

in this country, in relation to trade union and friendly society activities, a good deal of legislation which insists on a two-thirds majority. If we were discussing any wide piece of that mass of legislation the hon. Lady would be opposing any change in such a majority proposed from these benches. There is no special virtue in either a simple or a two-thirds majority in itself. Both have their virtue in relation to given conditions. In certain circumstances even a trade union might voluntarily insist on a two-thirds majority. For example, my own organisation would insist on a certain percentage majority in order to arrive at certain decisions. Any percentage less would not be deemed to reflect the considered view of the membership. So it is in other directions. In this case the Amendment proposed by my hon. Friend is fully justified. It will in fact give the only fair opportunity of finding exactly what the majority of the workpeople really mean at a given time.</p>

<p>Hon. Members in discussing the Amendment are carried away a considerable distance in their argument. We have had arguments to show that there is no special virtue in a bare majority and that there are circumstances in which it is much safer to have a two-thirds majority.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member is quoting me, will he quote me correctly? I said that there is no special virtue in a bare majority in itself, nor is there any special virtue in a, two-thirds majority in itself. Both receive their virtue, if any, under given conditions.</p>

<p>I only wish to point out that people may have very different views about the circumstances. For example, it would appear to hon. Members opposite in a very different light if a proposal were brought forward that it would be necessary to have a two-thirds majority for turning out the Government. At the same time a very strong case could be put up for the <i>status quo</i>, and in support of the view that before you upset the existing position and make a change you should have something stronger than a bare majority. I merely give this argument as an example of how far we can get carried away once we depart from the principle


that a bare majority should be able to decide a question and should be valid, whether in this House or elsewhere. I feel that on the whole we ought not to abandon the principle of the bare majority.<br/>
I do not want hon. Members opposite to think that I am not dealing with their Amendment on a serious basis. I appreciate the point made, that pressure may be brought to bear, but I would point out that there is nothing to prevent the workpeople being in constant communication with their trade unions in regard to this matter. There is nothing to prevent them from consulting their leaders. If there is pressure they can consult their organisation about it. In actual practice at the present time, although there has not been a secret ballot, and although it has been ascertainable by the employers which way the employ&#x00E9;s have voted, on many occasions in recent years they have voted against the proposal. We take the view that the secret ballot that has been put into the Bill at the suggestion of the senior Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh) is a perfect safeguard, and I think that her point is a just one, that there may be a number of workpeople who want this system. Why, then, should they be penalised by having to get a two-thirds majority for it, when already more</p>

<p>than half the workpeople in the factory want this particular system? There has not been a sufficient case made out for the Amendment. The real motive of the Amendment springs from the fact that hon. Members opposite are suspicious of the system and hostile to it and are using their opportunity to put obstacles in the way of its operation. That is an unfair position for them to adopt. Let the system have a fair trial in those places where the workpeople by a majority desire it.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member is so concerned about taking into account the wishes of the workpeople, will he say why it is that when two bodies of work-people wish to amalgamate into one trade union it is necessary by law to have a two-thirds majority, yet if the workpeople in a factory, under this Bill, desire to make a change, it can be done by a bare majority? Perhaps he will distinguish why a two-thirds majority is necessary in one case and only a bare majority in this case.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, to leave out lines 18 to 26.<br/>
This Amendment would have the effect of cutting out entirely the proviso under which the consent of the employ&#x00E9;s need not be required before the two-shift system is adopted in the case of new factories. I suggest that this proviso violates the first principle of democratic control. With regard to any factory biult after this date, the democratic control over the two-shift system by the women who are going to suffer from it is completely cut out, and this is very serious at a time when we are scrapping and rebuilding factories, when we are moving factories, when factories disappear almost in a night and are replaced by others, because it simply renders a very large part of the Bill null and void. I also suggest that this provision makes a very unfair discrimination. If you have Mr. Jones, who has an old factory, he has to get the consent of his workpeople before he can introduce the two-shift system, but his competitor, Mr. Brown, may have just completed a new factory, and he need not ask his workpeople.<br/>
Previously it could have been said that the saving effected by adopting the two-shift system would not be sufficient to justify moving into a new factory, but I am not so sure that that will be the case now, when factories are being put up at very low rates of interest and when, as a matter of fact, it may even mean a possible saving from heavy rates to move into a new district. This may be an extra inducement for people to move out of the heavily rated areas into the new areas, where we do not want them to go and where there will be the added inducement that they will not have to ask permission to get their workers on the two-shift system. There is a third matter, which is even more important, and that is that we are now at a new stage in the rearmament proposals of the Government. There will be enormous munition factories erected in the course of the next year or two, and the whole of these vast new industries in the new areas will not be subject to democratic control by the workers in them. This will be a special disadvantage for some of those girls who may be filling shells, or working on T.N.T. and those kinds of munition work which did the girls' health so much damage during the War. In this case

those girls who will most need protection in against the two-shift system will be the very people who will not have it.<br/>
Finally, I would point out that there is no reason at all why this new set of workers should not have the same rights as the old. It is possible to say that they will know the terms on which they are engaged and that if they do not want to go to that work, they need not do so, but as more and more factories apply this system, that argument will not be valid; and there is the added fact that it will then be possible for the Employment Exchanges to refuse benefits to those who refuse to accept work under the two-shift system, so that you will have something like compulsion. I suggest that to leave this Clause as it stands proves the insincerity of the Government when they claim that the whole matter is being democratically controlled and that the workers have a voice in it. I suggest that hon. Members opposite who want to see this system put into operation with the least possible amount of friction would do well to support the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
From the time when this Bill was introduced I have been much more concerned about protecting a different class of workers from the one to which the hon. Member for Jarrow (Miss Wilkinson) has just referred. Every day we are getting foreign employers coming here and opening up businesses in the luxury trades, such as wireless, electrical fitments, and so on, which have absolutely no trade union organisation, and we are desirous that the workpeople in these works and factories shall at least have a voice in saying whether or not they are prepared to work under this two-shift system. I have not lost an hour's sleep about the Lancashire cotton trade operatives or the engineering operatives about whom the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Kelly) is concerned, in regard to the operation of this Bill. We can look after ourselves, and we shall, but it is this new class of labourers which is being increasingly brought in for whom we are concerned. The only reason for bringing in this Bill is to enable this class of employer to exploit, principally, young persons, and we want every shred and shadow of protection that we can get for them. With


the labour exchanges stopping benefits immediately on refusal to take any employment, it is obvious that these women and young persons who are out of employment cannot refuse to go to the two-shift factories, however much they may object. We say that in the new factories as well as in the old the workpeople should be consulted before permission is given to adopt this system.</p>

<p>This proviso to which we take exception cuts out completely the benefit of the secret ballot which was extolled by the Home Secretary earlier in the Debate, and it appears to me that it lobs the very people who most need the protection of the ballot given to them. Industry is changing, and the newer industries are developing in districts that are not thickly populated. The two-shift system, bad as it is, has up to the present operated in the thickly populated districts, where the hardships endured by the workers are considerably reduced. But take the position in North Wales, where you get new industries established. Under this Clause none of the workers in these industries will have the power, the right, or the privilege of being able to ballot on the question whether or not the two-shift system shall operate. It happens that in North Wales some of the girls and women have to travel several miles, because the bulk of them are recruited, not merely from great distances, but right away on the Welsh hills, and while firms have arranged for a number of coaches to travel out from Flint to Halkin and other places, it is a fact that quite a number of young girls of very tender age are walking across the Welsh hills between 4.30 and 5.30 in the morning and after midnight. In the summer time that may not be too bad, but they do it also in the winter, and simply because this type of industry is gradually building up factories away from what one might call the central industrial areas.<br/>
The Government are saying in this Clause that the young girls and women who are to be called upon to work in these new factories, where the conditions are so much worse than they are in the big towns, shall have no right to any say whatever as to whether or not the two-shift system should operate. As a matter of fact, the two-shift system is operated

merely because it saves overhead charges. It is a cheap system of working. One industry with which I have had a considerable amount to do for a matter of about two years could have worked the one-shift system had it desired to do so, but it was much cheaper to work the two-shift system. It is only a question of economy. From my own viewpoint, it is a very harsh thing, to say the least of it, that young woman and girls should be forced to work under adverse and unfair conditions merely because it is cheaper to employ them on the two-shift system. You say in this Clause that where these industrial conditions are to be established in future, where the new industries are to be developed, in no circumstances will you permit the workers there to have any voice regarding the operation of the two-shift system. For these reasons I hope we may be able to carry this Amendment and get rid of this provision.</p>

<p>This Clause goes farther than was suggested by the last speaker, because it lays it down that the application may relate
<q>to a factory or workshop which is about to be, or has recently been, newly established.</q>
These are terms which, in their interpretation, will bring in a great many people. In fact, I doubt very much whether they will not bring in those old-established firms which may be building new factories probably in the neighbourhood where they have been in operation for some considerable time. The Clause demands that these people shall give an undertaking that they will permanently adopt this system. The system is bad enough even when worked for only a brief period, but under this Clause you are asking for its permanent adoption, and it is an amazing thing that after all the efforts which have been made to give to young people the chance of continued education, we should have a Bill now before the House which asks for the permanent adoption of a system which will be ruinous to their education.<br/>
Up to now we have heard from the Home Secretary of the secret ballot, but the Clause lays it down that the right hon. Gentleman shall decide the question without any consultation, without any such ballot, and indeed, without the consent of the workers. It takes away every-


thing that has been urged as a justification for the operation of the two-shift system. I am glad to think that in the engineering trade we shall be able to arrange it because of the strength of the union, but when one thinks of the many industries throughout the country I hope the House will be induced to do justice to itself and the country by accepting the Amendment.</p>

<p>The Under-Secretary will probably be able to defend the proviso, but on the last Amendment hon. Members opposite took pride in the fact that there was a secret ballot. The hon. Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh) took pride to herself that she had been the means of getting the secret ballot put in, in order to give an opportunity to the working people to have some control over their employment. If it was a good thing to put this in earlier in the Bill, why is it proposed to delete it here? If the Amendment is not accepted workpeople will not be able to speak for themselves. I realise the argument that the majority must count, and it is rather difficult for a politician who realises the strength of the arguments of his opponents, but, on this matter, I cannot see how the Government can defend themselves. Indeed, the fact that not one hon. Member opposite has got up to defend the proviso is a proof that the Government have a bad case.</p>

<p>I want to put a question to the Under-Secretary of State. Suppose a firm decides to recapitalise, or that after a secret ballot has taken place it decides to close for a week and re-form itself into a company, would it be considered to be a newly-established factory? Can we have some assurance that when the Bill goes to another place words will be put in to make it certain that the Sub-section will not apply to a recapitalised or old established firm which opens up again under another name?</p>

<p>We regard this Amendment as of vital importance and hope that the Under-Secretary, on behalf of the Government, will accept it. He has done nothing for us up to the moment, nor has he given us a satisfactory explana-

tion of the meaning of the words in the proviso. The fundamental basis of the two-shift system since 1920 has been the consent of the workers to the granting of an order and its application. The House has taken a most serious view in connection with the administration of this system and the granting of such applications. It has not been content to leave the granting of applications to officers of the State, but has decided that it must rest with the Secretary of State himself, all of it, however, contingent upon the workers deciding by their votes, properly taken under adequate supervision by inspectors of the Home Office, that they want the two-shift system. If the proviso applied to new factories the case would not be so strong, but it goes much further. It says that:
<q>is satisfied that the application relates to a factory or workshop which is about to be, or has recently been, newly established.</q>
I want to know what is meant by the words "has recently been newly established." The Bill if it is passed is to become operative on 1st July, 1936. I want. the Under-Secretary of State to tell us how near to the first day of July, 1936, will a factory be considered to come within the words in the proviso "has recently been established." I am not certain that we can be satisfied with the opinion of the Under-Secretary on this matter. He has displayed great courtesy and charm, as he invariably does. The Opposition have displayed great charm and courtesy. Indeed last night we allowed the Home Office to get away with two Bills without any opposition at all. That should be put to our credit. I am only paying a tribute to the Under-Secretary which I thought would meet with warm approval by hon. Members in all parts of the House. But courtesy and charm are not sufficient. We want some legal definition of the words "has recently been newly established." In and around London new factories are coming into being, some already in the stage of being built, some of them just built, and some of them just beginning to produce. The building of others will start before 1st July, 1936; and I want to know which of these factories, at what date and time, will come within the scope of this proviso.<br/>
This is vital. There is nothing in the Bill which says that owners of new fac-


tories have to give any notice that they are going to employ their people on a two-shift system. They will say "Here is a job for you; here are the terms. If you do not like them you can stop outside. If you do, you can come inside." And they can work the two-shift system just the same as an employer who has to have the secret ballot and obtain the consent of his workpeople. I do not want the Under-Secretary to think that he is going to get away with this easily. We have great respect for him, but this is a matter for the Secretary of State, or if the right hon. Gentleman cannot be present for the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General. We have not seen the Solicitor-General since his appointment.</p>

<p>We shall want a clear and definite statement as to what the proviso means, because it says:
<q>the system of shifts is intended to be permanently adopted.</q>
That is, for all time, making a complete revolution in our industrial system. We are not going to be satisfied with any kind of talk on this matter. If the Under-Secretary of State cannot satisfy us I shall, Mr. Speaker, ask your permission to move to report Progress, in order that the House may have the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown or the Secretary of State himself, who although he speaks with some scorn of hon. Members on this side at any rate is a man of legal discernment. I pass on to point out that we are going to be involved in an enormous expenditure upon armaments. I am not going to discuss the merits or demerits of that policy, but already it has been reflected in the attitude of industry. Already we see a wide extension of aircraft production. With an enormous expenditure of public money "in the offing" new factories will spring up for the production of munitions and every one of those new factories, subsidised to some extent by public money, will be able, by means of this proviso, to introduce the two-shift system, ignoring the will of the workers.<br/>
We have had experience of this. Those of us who lived through the War period can recall the extension which took place then of factories for the production of

munitions. In a varied career I have had a long workshop experience. I was in a workshop during the War and I remember how new factories grew up like mushrooms, how new departments were created, distinct and separate from the original factories, and how women and girl workers were employed in great numbers. We remember how two-shift and three-shift systems were operated in those circumstances. With the prospects of a big loan and an expenditure running up to &#x00A3;300,000,000 on munitions and armaments, the same thing will occur again. We are not even certain, I am sorry to say, that we are not going to move into war itself. If we do, there will be an even greater extension of this sort of activity and more and more factories will be working on this system without the consent of the workers.<br/>
This is a very important matter. [<i>Laughter</i>.] It is all right for hon. Members to laugh, but they do not work on the two-shift system. Many of them do not work at all and have never done so. They find it more convenient to earn their living in easier ways. Indeed I have always though myself that hard work is a slovenly way of getting a living. However, now that the Home Secretary is here&#x2014;</p>

<p>I know that the right hon.

At the same time, we like to see him present to advise us upon these interesting and complicated matters and I hope that the Under-Secretary, if he replies, will address himself seriously to the points I have made. This proviso represents a complete departure from a practice which has operated for over 16 years, which has worked well and has caused no objection or complaint. We cannot see why there should be any deviation from that path of virtue as far as the two-shift system


is concerned. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will try to satisfy us on the interpretation of these words and tell us which factories are to come within the purview of this proviso.</p>

<p>I was about to say that although I think a reasonable case could be made for that point of view, yet it is surprising that the hon.

<p>The hon. Gentleman misunderstood my reference.

<p>I do not think there is any misunderstanding between us. I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman has just said, but the fact is that there has been complaint and there have been difficulties and those difficulties were brought before the Departmental Committee which investigated this matter. It is on the basis of a paragraph in the Committee's recommendations that this provision has been inserted in the Bill. Hon. Members have talked a great deal about exploitation and have referred to the fact that industries are

changing and that this provision is not applicable in the altered circumstances. I would remind them that the Departmental Committee not only received evidence from the interests concerned but had as one of its number the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. C. Brown) who is as fully conversant with industrial conditions, from the workers' point of view, as any hon. Member opposite and has particular experience of the hosiery industry, one of these new trades in which this system is rather prevalent. It is not likely that he, as a member of that Committee, would put forward a proposal which would lead to exploitation or would be unreasonable in itself.</p>

<p>He differed on very few points from the proposal that the Bill should go through. I appreciate the hon. Member's point, but I do not think there is any impropriety in following the definite statement which the hon. Member for Mansfield, as a member of the committee, with other people, signed, since it is upon the basis of that paragraph that we are proceeding. As there has been a great deal of misunderstanding I think I ought to read this passage from the report:
<q>So far as regards factories newly established, the committee sees no advantage in retaining the procedure of a joint application. In some cases the factory and plant have to be planned in advance before work actually commences and workers are taken on. In these cases before granting an order the Department would have to be satisfied that the circumstances are such as to warrant the use of the two-shift system, and that adequate provision is made for


welfare, etc. But beyond this it does not seem possible or necessary for the Department to intervene.</q>
Then in the recommendations on page 31, hon. Members will see:
<q>The provision that requires the consent of the majority of the workpeople concerned for introduction of the system should be retained except in the case of the establishment of new works, designed to be works in whole or in part on the two-shift system, as a permanent part of its organisation.</q>
This Departmental Committee which was charged with the duty of investigating the whole subject and of seeing whether any modification should be made in the system, a committee which had upon it representatives of all parties, went into all the evidence and recommended this procedure. That is why we have introduced it. May I go into more details and point out the practical difficulties which has caused this exception to me made. What would the position be if the proviso were deleted I think it can be said without exaggeration that a farcical situation would result. An employer could not get his factory going without an authorisation and he could not get an authorisation until there had been a ballot. Presumably he would have to resort to the artifice of taking on a certain number of workers, on the understanding that they would be wanted for the shift system when it was authorised. He would then have to wait, pending a ballot the result of which would he a foregone conclusion and the carrying out of the rest of the procedure. We have here a genuine difficulty, because, if you insist that there should be a ballot, even in such a case, the employer should get round the actual intention of that provision presumably by taking on only those who were prepared to work the system and then, after waiting a short time, taking a ballot on it. I do not think the House would think that a suitable or practical method of procedure.<br/>
Surely the real question to be decided is whether or not a certain number of people are prepared to work this system. in the case of an existing factory, naturally you have to lay down the procedure that the views of the workers shall be ascertained as to whether they will change over to the new system or not, but in the case of a factory which does not exist, or is newly established, it seems reasonable to suppose that those

workers who are prepared to work on those conditions will signify their consent by doing so. That seems to us to be a very much more practical state of affairs. It is one of those difficulties of a purely practical nature which is best resolved in a plain and straightforward manner as we are doing in this House, rather than by doing what we might perhaps have done, that is to say, let the procedure go on and be a farce. It is much better to face the practical difficulties now. In conclusion I want to emphasize that the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the works are newly established. I wish to assure the House that there is no sinister motive in this and no desire to evade the general provisions we have laid down. It is the most practical method of dealing with the question.</p>

<p>I had hoped that the Under-Secretary would give some reason for the existence of this proviso. It seems to me that there is something objectionable in the two-shift system being applied in the case of women and girls, and that


has been admitted by virtue of the fact that before it can be established in any factory the consent of the people concerned must be obtained by ballot, and the majority of them must agree to it. That being so, it passes my comprehension why in the case of new factories the Government should run away from the principle to which they themselves agree and have established in their own Bill. The Under-Secretary said it would be a difficult matter, when a new factory was being built, if the workpeople had to be set on before they knew whether there would be a two-shift system or not; but the new factories could be built in exactly the same circumstances as the factories which already exist. If the factories were built for a one-shift system, they would be in the same position as every other factory, there being no advantage and no disadvantage as against every other employer. If after the factory had been established on a one-shift system it was desired to introduce the two-shift system, that could be done with the consent of the workpeople. It appears to me that</p>

<p>I understood the Under-Secretary to say just now that it would be extremely inconvenient for a ballot to be held in the case of new factories, but I would point out that if the workpeople are to be taken on, they may have to perform certain operations about which they may know nothing at all. The new factory might have some entirely different processes, and the work-people would be placed in the position of being asked to go to work in it, possibly at their peril, without having an opportunity of saying whether they wish a two-shift system to operate or not. It seems to me it would be possible for machinery to be devised to get over all these difficulties without having such a proposal as we have now.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 6, to leave out Sub-section (5).<br/>
We consider this Amendment of equal importance to the last, and I would remind the Under-Secretary again, lest he

should have forgotten it in his enthusiasm, that he has not met the Opposition at all, and has not given us a single thing. He has closed his mind to all arguments and appeals, whether to the reason or to the emotions. Now we


have reached the end of this road of travail I am hopeful that we shall get some little reward for our efforts. This Sub-section enables the Secretary of State to delegate his duties to other persons, including the chief inspector of factories or the superintending inspector of factories. The Sub-section was really the result of an afterthought on the part of the Home Office. It was moved in Committee by the Under-Secretary who, at the time of its acceptance, disposed of another Clause in the Bill. The Subsection has relation to the procedure to be adopted in regard to orders. It was suddenly thought desirable to change the procedure which we have been operating for 16 years. It has been going on all that time, and then somebody suddenly had a brain-wave and suggested that the time had arrived for a change. In the report of the Committee, on page 24, we are told that the
<q>procedure seems somewhat cumbrous&#x2014;especially in the case of Orders required only for a temporary purpose&#x2014;and may involve some delay in dealing with urgent applications; and now that the experimental period may be considered to have ended, we recommend that in these cases, at any rate, the permission to work the two-shift system might be granted locally by the appropriate official of the Factory Department (we suggest the superintending inspector) without reference to Whitehall.</q>
On what evidence was this case of the Committee based? I have read the report and the summary of the evidence, and I do not think any employers complained that the procedure was cumbrous, or that the workers did. The only people who seem to have expressed any opinion, though certainly without offering any evidence, as far as the summary of evidence indicates, were the factory inspectors. They expressed their opinions. What is the procedure? I cannot emphasise this point too much, for it is vital. The House demanded, and the Home Office acceded to the demand, that no Orders should be issued under the two shift-system unless they were signed by the Secretary of State or the Under-Secretary. I think that is right.</p>

<p>Why did we decide upon that practice? Because of the unsatisfactory conditions arising out of the operation of the Act of 1920; because hon.

Members on both sides of the House, anxious for the welfare of young people in particular, wanted to be satisfied that no two-shift Orders were issued without the most careful scrutiny and examination. Now we are told that the procedure is cumbrous and may, involve some delay. This is a new word to me, cumbrous. I never heard of it when I was at the Home Office. I never heard of any delay in the issuing of these Orders. This reference to "cumbrous" is a reflection on the Home Office such as I myself, with my experience, would never make. It is one of the most efficient Departments of the State, ever ready to respond to the appeals of wisdom and justice. I do not remember any complaints being made, or any questions being put in this House, charging the Home Secretary and his Department with delay in the issue of these two-shift Orders. I do not say there has not been one case of delay, I do not say there have been not two cases, but I do not recall, during the two and a-half years when the Labour Government were in office, that there were any complaints, and I certainly do not recall any question being put on the Floor of the House.<br/>
I can quite understand that the officers of the State should want to acquire more power. We are always in danger of what is termed the bureaucracy in Whitehall. The Lord Chief Justice wrote a book about the growing dangers of the bureaucracy in Whitehall. I can understand the anxiety of inspectors to acquire greater powers, but if they are to be given greater powers it should only be after evidence which would justify the step. This is a responsibility of the Secretary of State, and we ought not to be parties to banding it over to the Chief Factory Inspector or the Superintending Inspector of Factories. Hitherto the practice has been this&#x2014;that when an application for an Order has been made the factory inspector on the spot has made a careful investigation and has reported to the chief inspector in Whitehall, and after thorough examination the matter has been referred to the Secretary of State or the Under-Secretary. We see no reason why that practice, which has worked so well, and has contributed in no small measure to harmony in the administration of the Act and, what is more important, and even vital, to harmony in this House as regards our attitude towards industrial legislation.<br/>
The Under-Secretary must not think that we want to waste our time firing political bullets every day at himself or the Secretary of State regarding the issue or refusal of Orders. Why does the Secretary of State want to delegate his authority to any superintending inspector of factories? I do not cast any reflection upon the character or the administrative qualities of the factory inspectors. I do not say that I know them all, but I know the majority of those who preside in the various Departments across the road, and I have met many of those who are in the country. I have the greatest respect for them, but this question is not to be decided by considerations of personal respect. We shall certainly want very satisfactory evidence indeed to justify this Sub-section. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary will meet us on this matter. I should like to have an opportunity of carrying away something to-night. I extended myself somewhat on a previous Amendment, and I did so also this one hoping that my hon. Friends and myself would not be turned away empty handed.<br/>
If the Under-Secretary cannot meet us entirely I will make an offer to him. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!"] My hon. Friends say "No." Perhaps I had better wait and let somebody else do it. They say that a readiness to compromise is one of the main characteristics of Englishmen, and I was only anxious to get some proper reward for our efforts. My hon. Friends do not like me to make an offer but, all the same, I hope the Under-Secretary will meet us. I hope he will accept the Amendment or at least give us an assurance that in another place the Government will agree to the deletion of some words in order that we may achieve our object.<br/>
It has been said that we are opposed to the two-shift system; we are, but we are not powerful enough to stop the passage of this Measure. Consequently, we must expect it to reach the Statute Look and be put into operation in our industrial life. Our Amendment is calculated to improve the Measure in its present form. We are anxious to maintain the policy of the issuing of orders, because it is justified by experience during the last 16 years. The Under-Secretary will have to make a better speech than he made on the last occasion,

one far more convincing, if he is to satisfy my hon. Friends and myself in this important matter.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
It seems to us that the Amendment is in the best interests of those who are to be employed under the two-shift system. When the Under-Secretary was replying to a similar Amendment in the Committee, he said that the point the Departmental Committee had in mind was that, in rush jobs, in many industries, the need for piece-working might occur very suddenly and last only for a short time. We admit that that is likely to occur. That is the intention of the Clause which we are discussing. He immediately went on to say that these superintendent inspectors were to decide whether these arrangements were to be made, and that statement appears to be a contradiction. The Under-Secretary also said that there were only 11 in the whole country, each supervising a considerable area. They were men of very high standing in the Service. It is not clear what will happen in actual practice. If there are rush jobs in all parts of the country and only 11 superintending inspectors to deal with them, how is the machinery to be worked? If a rush job is wanted almost at once, will it not be a question of telegraphing to and fro, and the inspector, knowing nothing about the matter, having to give some decision almost in no time?<br/>
There is no suggestion how long a permit will last after it has been granted. Permits are supposed to be purely temporary, but there is nothing to suggest how long their temporary nature will last, or whether permits may be continued. Are they for a week, or a month? Can there be a similar application after they have expired? The superintending inspectors will be put in an entirely different position from the ordinary factory inspector, and indeed, from their own original position. The inspector has, to a large extent, been looked upon as the friend of the employ&#x00E9; but now he will be very much the friend of the person who wants to introduce the two-shift system in a hurry. He will be obliged to give his decision in a rush, knowing very little about the operation to be carried on.<br/>
A further consideration is that although the two-shift system is to be brought in, and although we have, under the old Factory Acts, provision for the medical inspection of workpeople entering industry, we are trying a new experiment with the young life, because there is no provision for a medical examination to see whether they are fit for their occupation.</p>

<p>I appeal to the Under-Secretary to meet us in this matter. I have had experience of the visits of these inspectors. I remember as a youngster 10 years of age, in one of the very factories we are talking about, that an inspector used to call and pay a sort of State visit. His visit was most perfunctory. I have no doubt that these great officers of the Crown, the superintendent inspectors, will be even more perfunctory in their visits, which they will pay at greater stated intervals, than even the ordinary inspectors. I appeal to the Under-Secretary to knock out this Sub-section. I believe that he is not altogether in love with it himself. I have a report of what he said in the Committee, that even the Home Office did not desire to force these recommendations upon the Committee. That was the opinion of the Home Office and also, I suggest, of the Under-Secretary. We do not wish to make it too easy in the West Riding of Yorkshire to institute the two-shift system. We do not like it and we do not want it. We are entitled to say that men, women and children&#x2014;it is a question of women and children first, so far as women in the textile mills are concerned in the West Riding&#x2014;should have all the protection that this House can give them.<br/>
That is why we do not wish to leave dictatorial powers in the hands of a superintendent inspector. What will happen will be a telephone call by the office boy in the mill. It will be switched on to the manager, and then to the local inspector. The manager will state what concession is wanted and the concession will be granted without much inquiry into the facts of the situation. I am afraid that that is what will happen after the Act has been in operation a short time. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Short) I would rather present a bouquet to the Under-Secretary, who

has a kind face, than throw a brick at him. I wish to make my appeal, and to tell him that the women and children in the West Riding do not want the two-shift system. I am an old factory worker who has had experience of factories. No doubt they are improved these days, and I am glad. It is due to more up-to-date factory supervision. I have very vivid recollections of the factories in those days, and also of the visits of the inspector, when we had to fence our machinery and do all sorts of things to come within the law, because of the perfunctory way in which the inspectors performed their work. I desire to reinforce the appeal of my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, and I hope the Under-Secretary will be able to agree that this Sub-section shall come out of the Bill.</p>

<p>I must say that it is very hard to listen to the appeals of hon. Gentlemen opposite and not make some response to them, but I would remind the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Short) that one of the reasons why I have not been able to make concessions this afternoon is that I made so many in Committee, and on this matter a very great concession indeed was made. Originally, Clause 3 provided that the Secretary of State could delegate any of his powers and duties under the Act to the Chief Inspector of Factories, and I think that even the hon. Gentleman will agree that the proposal we are now discussing is much more modest than that. Before I explain to the House the practical basis of this proposal, I should like to say that I was rather interested when the hon. Gentleman mentioned that he might have considered a compromise on this matter, but his hon. Friend would not let him go on. Although I cannot give any undertaking in the sense that he would like, I would remind him that up to the present time he has not produced any practical alternative. If, between now and the consideration of the matter in another place, he could make a suggestion of a practical kind, we should be very glad to consider it and see whether it would be possible to meet him in some way.</p>

<p>While the Under-Secretary is appealing to my hon. Friend, might I ask him if he himself could not make a suggestion between now and the


time when the Bill is considered in another place?</p>

<p>I think the hon. Gentleman will agree that, as the initiative has come from the other side, they should be the first to put forward a suggestion. That is as far as I can go this evening, and I do so in response to the appeals of hon. Gentlemen opposite. May I remind the House how this proposal arises? It simply comes from the businesslike consideration of the matter by the Departmental Committee. They found that there were a certain number of cases where the authorisation was wanted for a short period to meet, a temporary emergency, and was wanted quickly. Reference of these matters to the centre in Whitehall is bound to cause delay, a fact which was illustrated very well by the hon. Member for Attercliffe (Mr. C. Wilson) when he reminded the House of my statement in Committee that there were only 11 of these superintending inspectors in the whole country, who would under this provision be allowed to give an authorization&#x2014;only, be it remembered, after a secret ballot and after all the procedure under the Act had been gone through. How, then, asked the hon. Member, could all this work be done by only 11 men? The proposal, however, is that it should be done by 11 men instead of by one man. I would give the hon. Member the assurance that under the Bill the period cannot exceed six months, which is a pretty severe limitation, but there are cases, of which I have details, though I will not worry the House with them,</p>

<p>where, for instance, there is a rush order for export and this system is really necessary, and it is vital, if the contract is to be secured, that the authorisation should be given as quickly as possible. The Departmental Committee were moved by considerations of that kind to recommend this procedure, and that is why it was put in. I repeat, however, that, if hon. Members opposite can bring forward any alternative at another stage, we will consider it.</p>

<p>Under this proposal the factory inspector is being brought in to do work which he was never appointed to do. He was appointed to inspect factories and to inspect conditions, but now he is to be asked to decide between employers and employed as to the operations of the two-shift system. The Under-Secretary said that it may be required for a rush order for export, but I hope he will find some better reason than that. Industries like those which were mentioned during the Committee stage do not find themselves in the position that the hon. Gentleman has stated, and to place upon the factory inspector this responsibility of authorising the operation of the two-shift system is to bring him into the position of dealing with people who disagree with him, which is a wrong position for civil servants to have to occupy.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 4, line 28, to leave out "July," and to insert "January."<br/>
The effect of this Amendment and the next is to postpone from July to January next the date of coming into operation of the Bill. It was introduced at the end of last year. It was then hoped that it would pass very early in the Session, and that it would be possible to bring it into operation on 1st July, but in view of the delay that has occurred it is not now practicable. It will be necessary, before the Bill can be worked, to set up the proposed advisory committee, to obtain and consider their advice on the kind of procedure to be adopted for consulting the workers and to prepare the draft special Order describing the procedure. The Order has to be issued in draft 40 days before it is made, and any written representations from any interested bodies must be taken into consideration. The House will probably agree that in these circumstances it would be better if the date of coming into operation were postponed.</p>

<p>It is surprising that we should have a Measure of this kind calling upon young people to engage in work in a continuous shift for some eight hours, and for even longer periods, probably from 6 o'clock in the morning till 1 o'clock in the afternoon and from 1 o'clock in the afternoon in some cases till 10 o'clock.

<p>There is no informality. The Third Reading has been moved. There is no need for a speech by the Mover. I called for the Third Reading, and the answer was given from the Government Bench, "Now." The Third Reading has been moved, and it is now being debated, and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Rochdale (Mr. Kelly) is in possession of the Floor of the House.</p>

<p>I was speaking of boys and girls at the age of 16 being forced into industry to work at these hours early in the morning, and, in the case of the second shift, late at night. The Bill provides special facilities for transport, and for health. I have tried to picture what will happen in the case of London with regard to those travelling facilities. How are the young people


from the South-East of London, if they work in the North-West of London, to reach their employment by 6 o'clock in the morning? There is nothing here which provides that the employment may be refused unless those facilities are at the disposal of these young people. Education authorities in the great cities of this country have spent considerable sums of money in setting up evening institutes and providing facilities for the extended education of young people. They are meeting with some success, after many years of effort, and now we are faced with the position that young people who might be desirous of attending the evening institutes will be kept at work during the hours that the institutes are open in the evening. It is asking far too much to expect these young persons who are at work from 6 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock in the afternoon, and those who are at work from 1 o'clock in the afternoon until 10 o'clock at night, to attend these institutes.<br/>
There is also the breaking up of the domestic circle through these young people having to go to work at hours different from the hours of other members of the family. It is surprising that we should be asked to support such a Bill, or even to permit such a Bill to be enforced in the industries of this country. Surely the industrial and commercial life of this country can be carried on without having to sacrifice our young people, as will be the case under these conditions. I am amazed that we should be called upon to deal with such a Measure, and it speaks ill for the captains of industry, if they are behind this Measure, asking for it to be operated to the detriment of the young life of this country.</p>

<p>As one who has been through the whole proceedings on this Bill from the beginning, I wish to say a few words on the Third Reading. It is not very long ago since I joined with others interested in factory legislation in commemorating the end of the first century of progress in that form of legislation. I do not think I am wrong in saying to-night that the passing of this Bill is the first retrograde step taken for over a century in this country in our

factory laws. It is to the dishonour of the House of Commons that we are now, in the year 1936, calling upon young persons of 16 years of age to turn out to work at 6 o'clock in the morning or to work until 10 o'clock at night. What is the reason for such a Bill? It is a concession to the growing speed of modern machinery, and to those who believe that they cannot compete in the markets of the world with the commodities that their factories produce. We are to-day passing a Bill such as this when, in fact, a young girl in a factory in England can produce 50 times as much goods in the same number of hours as her grandmother could produce in the same factory. The Government are taking upon themselves a great responsibility in acceding to the demands of the god of profit.<br/>
The Bill does one thing which annoys me beyond measure. In all occupations outside production there has been a growing tendency to limit the number of hours during which people work in banks, insurance offices, shops and in all commercial occupations&#x2014;to start work at 9 o'clock in the morning and finish at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, while on Saturday offices in the great cities of this country close almost universally at noon. The Bill, however, permits the employment of girls and boys at 16 years of age up to 2 o'clock in factories on Saturday afternoons. The right hon. Gentleman has done one thing. We have worked hard at this Measure &#x2014;and the right hon. Gentleman's Under-Secretary has been very industrious in this matter&#x2014;and have succeeded in obtaining one very important concession. It is right that we should say this. We have secured that the ballot to be taken by the workpeople involved shall be held in secret. That is all to the good. We are, however, still afraid of one thing, that the granting of orders in certain emergencies may indeed bring about a state of affairs, as far as the workpeople are concerned, that may be very undesirable.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman is to set up an advisory committee. Now that we have failed to secure the inclusion of the advisory committee in the Bill, I appeal to him, in appointing the advisory committee, to have regard to one thing above all others. The people who are supposed to represent the workpeople should not


be some of those who say that they represent the social side of industry, but men and women who have actually experienced the difficulties of working in factories and workshops. I do not care how kindly disposed and well-intentioned anybody may be, he cannot understand what it means to have to work in a pit or a factory unless he has been there himself and has experienced the difficulties. I trust that the right hon. Gentleman will be good enough to bear that fact in mind.<br/>
We have failed in one respect in this Bill, and I am very sorry. There was a recommendation of the Departmental Committee, upon which the Bill is based, that where a woman or young person declined to work on the two-shift system for reasons that were good in law, such person should not be deprived of unemployment benefit. We were told that if we inserted a provision of that kind in the Bill it would upset another Act of Parliament. There was great force in that, but I appeal to the Home Secretary finally on that score, that although we have not been able to insert that provision in the Bill he will try to see that no person who declines to work the two-shift system shall be deprived of his unemployment benefit because of that.</p>

<p>This Bill will be characterised by working people as the most reactionary piece of legislation introduced into this House for a large number of years. It has been stated that it will do young life irreparable harm, but I want to make a further charge against the Measure&#x2014;that it will place a premium on cheap labour. That, to me, is one of its most serious aspects. We have about 2,000,000 people in this country unemployed. The most urgent thing that we want is work for them. Yet we have selected this time to extend the opportunities of employers to employ cheap labour. From that point of view I am justified in saying that it is a reactionary Measure. There is another point that we should emphasise. It is that possibly for the first time in industrial legislation we have drawn the Civil Service into industrial disputes. If one of the factory inspectors should put a firm from the one-shift to the two-shift system. there might be an industrial dispute about it. Disputes take place about matters of far less importance. We may have the position

in which a factory inspector will have given consent for a certain firm to employ women and young persons on the two-shift system, and there may be a strike against it, and the Government will then be in the position of taking a definite side in an industrial dispute. I hope the Home Secretary will see that in another place that Clause is eliminated.</p>

<p>The vigour of speech of the hon. Gentleman makes me wonder whether the real situation of this legislation in relation to our existing law is even now appreciated, and I would like, before we part with it, briefly, and I hope uncontroversially, to state what that true position is. This Bill is not a Bill that establishes the two-shift system. It is not establishing any new departure at all, good or bad. The present situation is that year by year Parliament continues an Act passed in 1920 which made provision for the two-shift system. That has taken place in every Parliament and under every Government. When hon. Gentlemen opposite were in office they did it every year, and it is a complete confusion&#x2014;which I am sure hon. Members opposite will do their best to remove from the minds of those they address&#x2014;that this Bill is establishing the two-shift system. The difference between the law as it is operating now and as it will be after this Bill becomes law is this: Not that under the present law there is not a two-shift system and that this Bill establishes it to the prejudice of anybody, but that under the present law there are no provisions adequate to protect the people concerned, and that this Bill in a series of Clauses endeavours to lay down what that protection should he. There is nothing in the present law which provides for a, secret ballot. I am glad to hear with how much approval the hon. Member opposite referred to it. It was a. proposal put forward by the Government, and I am glad that it is so universally approved. It should be a secret ballot with which neither the trade unions nor anybody else can interfere, and it will be so long as I administer it. That was a flaw in the existing law, and I am glad that it is being put right.<br/>
There is nothing in the present law providing that the Home Secretary, in making an Order for the operation of the two-shift system, must procure that proper conditions are laid down for the


welfare of the people concerned, and provision as to their being assisted to their work. Everything in the Bill now proposed for the protection of the work-people is new, but the two-shift system is not being established by the Bill. Reject this Bill, and you will have the two-shift system as you have had it without effective protest for 16 years, and you will not have any of the protection contained in the Bill. That is the real character of this legislation.<br/>
While it is right and proper that we should discuss each provision candidly, and if necessary forcibly, I think it desirable that it should be understood once and for all that this is not a Bill which establishes a two-shift system, for the system has existed by Jaw for 16 years. It is a Bill which introduces a series of statutory conditions designed, with the help of all parties, for the purpose of protecting the workers. When with vigour and rhetoric I hear hon. Members opposite denounce this Bill as the first retrograde step for 100 years, I ask myself whether there was not a Departmental Committee on which the authorised spokesmen of labour were invited to nominate their representatives? Did they not nominate two distinguished representatives, who served on that Committee with all good faith; and did not those representatives agree with the other members of the Committee that the lines of this Bill were lines which they could approve?</p>

<p>I do not think that it would be suggested that Mr. Arthur Shaw or the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. C. Brown) are not persons of the greatest authority on this subject. Therefore, it cannot be said on the Third Reading of the Bill that there has been some trick in regard to the appointment of members of the Departmental Committee. The committee was appointed from people who were drawn from all quarters, and they arrived at an absolutely unanimous conclusion. The offence that has been committed by the Home Secretary, in the opinion of hon. Members opposite, is that he has introduced a Bill

in strict accordance with the unanimous recommendations of that Departmental Committee.<br/>
There is another thing which should be put on record. These things are complicated, and some hon. Members opposite are masters of their subject, but anybody would suppose from some of the language that they have used&#x2014;if we are not careful it may be used outside the House, but, of course, it will not be used when I have pointed out the mistake&#x2014;that we are by this Bill inflicting upon unfortunate victims exceptionally long hours of labour in the interests of some select and favoured class of employers. Nothing of the sort is true. This is a Bill which provides, as the law for the last 16 years has provided, that under certain conditions the system of two shifts may be worked, one of which lies between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m., with an interval for meals, from Mondays to Fridays, and from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or earlier on Saturday. I am not denying that those are considerable hours of labour, but I do not for one moment believe that the women who vote in favour of this system do not deeply appreciate the fact that it is a system which does give them, once they have completed their 'morning shift, a completely free time for the rest of the day, or if they are on the afternoon shift they have a free time until the afternoon.<br/>
These shifts alternate weekly, and that means that in a fortnight the maximum hours that are authorised will be 11 eight-hour shifts, which is equivalent to 44 hours per week, inclusive of meal times. If we take out meal times, it is something like 41&#x00BC; hours per week. Is that putting on the Statute Book some extension of the authorised working week, or is it not, in fact, much shorter than the ordinary working week? In a non-textile factory today the law provides that such persons may work 60 hours in a week, exclusive of meal times. In a textile factory they may work 55&#x00BD; hours a week, exclusive of meal times, and in busy times such hours are far from being unknown. Next year, I hope that we shall have a new Factory Bill and that we shall all co-operate to bring the factory laws up to date. Hon. Members will believe me when I say that there is no one more anxious to secure their friendly co-operation than I am, or more anxious to bring the factory laws up to date. In the meantime, do not let


us talk nonsense, especially nonsense to ignorant people. Do not let us tell them that this Bill is a retrograde step, in that it puts upon these people much more serious legal hours of work than the existing law allows, because it does nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>The hon. Member may be right, but what I am inviting him and his friends to co-operate with me in doing is to make it quite plain that there is no truth in the statement that the two-shift system is imposing upon people hours of work which are beyond those which are now provided for by law. Let us at least realise that it does nothing of the kind. I agree that there have been difficulties in regard to the Bill, and we are grateful to hon. Members opposite for whatever assistance they have been able to give in regard to Amendments.<br/>
One point was raised by an hon. Member opposite with regard to new factories. Before the two-shift system is introduced into a factory which is an existing going concern, I agree that it is perfectly right that the workpeople should be consulted, but if you are dealing with a new factory, with new machinery, which may be installed for the purpose of working the two-shift system, machinery which is to be continuously run, it is, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, pointed out, extremely difficult to know how you are to consult the workpeople concerned. Are you to produce a sort of stage army of workpeople who, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, have not yet been employed, and get a vote from them in the name of those who are to be employed afterwards? If when a new factory is being erected at great expense and expensive machinery is being installed, you were to say to those who are the proprietors of that factory: "You must get a vote of the workpeople concerned before an authorised two-shift system may begin," you would be confronted with the difficulty as to who are the workpeople and how you are to find out who they are to be. If you attempted to get any vote under those circumstances it would be on an entirely fictitious basis. That is why the Departmental Committee and my hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield and Mr. Shaw said: "By all means have a plan by which you can consult the workpeople, but you cannot do it if you are setting up a new factory."<br/>
I think the right answer is that that situation undoubtedly means that there will be a very grave responsibility on the Secretary of State for the time being when he is making an order in regard to new works, because he will not have as much help as he would have in the case of an old works, and I shall not be at all surprised if in days to come hon. Members opposite, so long as they are in Opposition, put questions on this subject from time to time if and when they think the authorisation has been wrongly or foolishly operated.<br/>
After all the hard work which we have done, I should like to acknowledge the welcome help which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has given throughout, especially when other business has kept me away. I am conscious that nobody could have done the work better, with more equable temper and more acceptably. No one is more happy in that knowledge than I am. I ackowledge his skill and help.<br/>
Now that we have reached the end of our work on the Bill, I hope that all who have a special interest in the matter will see that this proposal is not a new proposal but a proposal under which existing conditions are given a fair trial. I do not suppose we have come to the end of this story, but we have thrashed this thing out with a great deal of care. The Home Office have no politics or sides to take in it whatever, and admittedly the factory inspectors of the Home Office are one of the most impartial and finest public services in the world. I have also the knowledge behind me that those who advise me believe that this Bill is one which will make for the improvement of industrial conditions. I cannot believe that it is in the interests of anyone that we should refuse to impose these statutory protections, which do not now exist, in order to resume the hand-to-mouth habit of passing, under the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, these provisions every year. Therefore, after all this controversy&#x2014;more controversy, I think, than might have been expected, having regard to the composition and the unanimous view of the Departmental Committee&#x2014;I invite the House to approve this Bill, and I hope that those who have felt obliged, with so much vigour, though with unfailing good temper, to criticise certain features of the Bill will none the less recognise that in parting with it we


are parting with it with an earnest desire to serve the general interests of all concerned and to promote good industrial legislation.</p>

<p>Before the Bill passes, I want to express my disappointment with it so far as the distressed areas are concerned. If this is all that the Government are going to do for the distressed areas, the outlook is extremely black. Within the last two years they have taken three steps which have raised hopes in the Special Areas only for them to be disappointed on every occasion. Two years ago they appointed four Commissioners to make reports, and it was believed that the Government really intended to do something for the Special Areas. They received the reports, but did nothing except appoint a Commissioner, who has been in existence for 15 months, and we are no better off to-day than when he was appointed. What does the Chancellor expect from this Bill? When the Commissioner was appointed a sum of &#x00A3;2,000,000 was voted for the distressed areas, but only &#x00A3;330,000 has so

far been spent. We complained that a sum of &#x00A3;2,000,000 was of no use, but it has not been spent and now the Chancellor of the Exchequer comes along with a proposal for another &#x00A3;1,000,000 which, I believe, will not be spent either. Last night the Chancellor of the Exchequer made remarks which staggered some of us. In one speech he said:
<q>Here the public have to supply the money, the public will run considerable risks for practically no reward, and you may be quite certain that they are not going to run these risks indefinitely unless the prospects of the work to be done by this company become much more rosy than I reckon them to be at this stage."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL, REPORT, 11th May, 1936; col. 71, Vol. 312.]</q>
In those remarks there is not much hope for the distressed areas. We are justified in assuming that the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself does not expect the reconstruction company to be a success. But that was not the worst thing he said last night. In another speech he said:
<q>The operations of the company, as I conceive them, are not likely ever to be on a gigantic scale. The thing is an ex-periment for small businesses and I am not expecting that the Bill, even if it is as successful as the most sanguine anticipate it will be, is going to set the Thames on fire or provide any great revolution in the affairs of the depressed areas."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL, REPORT, 11th May, 1936; col. 55, Vol. 312.]</q>
What does the Chancellor of the Exchequer expect from the Bill? He says


that it is not going to create a revolution in the distressed areas. Is it then only shop-window dressing? Is it only going to do what the Government have done before&#x2014;raise hopes in these areas and then dash them to the ground? We want a revolution in the distressed areas. Unemployment, we are told, is going down throughout the country, but that is not true so far as the distressed areas are concerned. In the Spennymoor Exchange there has been an increase in the number of unemployed by 381 as compared with April of last year. The prosperity of the country has not touched these areas and, therefore, we want to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether this is the Government's last word on this matter and how long they propose to wait to see whether this experiment is to succeed. Are they going to sit down quietly and wait for six months, or 12 months, or two years before they do anything else for the distressed areas?<br/>
Nothing that the Government have done so far has touched the fringe of the problem in these areas. During the General Election we were told that a trading estate was to be started and that &#x00A3;100,000 had been earmarked for the purpose. It is still in the air. The Commissioner made this statement during the Election, and I believe that when this last experiment has been in operation for one or two years we shall be no better off. In my opinion, you will not really help the distressed areas until you are prepared to find the money to restore the basic industry in the areas&#x2014;the coal industry. Unless you are prepared to find the money to do that, nothing that you are proposing to do will help them, and 12 months after this Bill has been passed we shall be in the same condition as we are to-day. I want the Chancellor of the Exchequer to realise that in these areas this is a human problem. The people are gradually going down. They expect the Government to do something for them, but all the Government can do is to raise their hopes and then dash them to the ground. We are no better off now than when the Government took office.</p>

<p>I understand that on the Third Reading of a

Bill we are reduced to discussing what is in the Bill and not what is outside it. That makes it easy to deliver a short speech. Quite frankly, there is not a tremendous amount in the Bill, and in fairness to the Chancellor of the Exchequer I recognise that the right hon. Gentleman has never pretended that there was very much in it. As I have said before, the most misleading thing about the Measure is its Title. If you are going to give out to the world that this is your programme for the Special Areas reconstruction, people will be disappointed. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made it clear that he is trying to fulfil a particular recommendation of the Commission, a recommendation which I and other people have asked should be adopted, and, therefore, it would be ungracious if I were to attempt to belittle the experiment which is being made. If this were the Government's whole programme it would be ludicrous and would merit every word which the hon. Member for Spennymoor (Mr. Batey) could use against it. But it is only one item and it is as such that I consider it. I think that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has gone too far in decrying the value of his own experiment. It is possible to make an experiment fail by saying how little you think of it. All the speeches on this Bill have had a tendency towards making people think that this is going to be a risky experiment, and to cause them to ask themselves whether it is worth while risking the money. I do not want that to be the final impression.<br/>
The Bill is not intended to help the heavy industries. The hon. Member was right in saying that they are the essentials of the problem, through which, alone, the depressed areas can be restored, but the object of the Bill is, within certain limited lines, to supply not a substitute for those industries but some kind of help which will give a little more resilience in these areas so that they will not depend altogether on one thing. Considering the bad reputation that has been acquired, it will be difficult to make this a success, but although I have been critical of some points in the Bill, and of the efforts of the Government for the depressed areas as a whole, I do not want any single effort they can make to fall short or fail through lack of any help that I can give. I think we ought to


accept these little experiments if we can get no more, and try to make them a success. I wish the Bill success within the limited area which alone it can help.</p>

<p>As the previous speaker has said, we cannot on the Third Reading go outside the four corners of the Bill and discuss genera] policy, but I have always taken the view that, in the long run, the distressed areas problem can only be solved by the general trade and financial policy of the country and not by special localised efforts. This Bill is a Trade Facilities Bill in miniature. It has the same general idea that people who cannot get credit otherwise&#x2014;generally for good reasons&#x2014;should be enabled to get it with the assistance of the Government. It is, to some extent, a device for giving credit to people who ought not to have it. Generally speaking, if people want credit and have a good case they can get it to-day. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!"] I think that is so in general. Never since 1895 or 1896 have interest rates been as low as they now are, nor has there been such a quantity of money on time deposits in the banks, indicating credit that is not functioning properly in the banking system.<br/>
It is obviously also true that a, certain number of people who are just starting may have certain difficulties. Nevertheless this is a proposal to grant credit to people who would not get it from those whose ordinary business is to grant credit It is a device to direct credit by the State through the intermediary of a company which does not yet exist It is a first experiment in nationalised banking. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] Apparently, hon. Members opposite had not thought of that before, and when they hear it they can only make a noise. The Bill consists of six long sentences, two of which begin with "if" and another with "in the event of." The schedule is a contract between the Treasury and a company that does not yet exist, but it is obvious that the company is fundamentally controlled in its general policy. It is difficult to see how much the Treasury is liable to lose in the event of anything going wrong, because the phraseology, being Parliamentary, is obscure. It appears, however, that the Treasury is not going to carry the whole baby but the greater part of it. I do not

know whether any means test is to be applied, but I take it that it is a case of "to those who have nothing shall some thing be added."</p>

<p>The hon. Member says that those who can satisfy the bankers that they are entitled to credit will get credit. Is that not a means test?</p>

<p>I did not say anything about the bankers. I spoke about obtaining credit, and bankers are not the only people who give credit. People in a small way do not get credit in the first place from the banks. I hope I am not unduly narrow-minded in the view which I take of this proposal&#x2014;though I sometimes feel that I am becoming narrow-minded, so many proposals are coming along which I do not like. However, if it is desired to have an experiment, the cost involved is only the equivalent of the cost of two months of collective lunacy in the form of special precautions in the Mediteranean, and if we can chuck money away in that direction, perhaps we can spend some in trying to please the hon. Member for Spennymoor (Mr. Batey).</p>

<p>If it were &#x00A3;2,000,000 it would probably please the hon. Member more. His trouble is that it is not enough. My own impression, however, is that the general conception behind the Bill is bad. As I say, I do not mind occasional laboratory experiments. I know that very often nine-tenths of what you are looking for is not there or, if it is, you do not recognise it, but that is what is called research, and if the Chancellor of the Exchequer likes to make a little economic research well and good. I shall be surprised if it produces any satisfactory results, but I have not the heart to vote against the Bill. I protest, however, against the idea that it is the function of the State to do all these jobs, and I sometimes think that if we had done less than we have done to solve the unemployment problem it might be nearer solution at the present time.</p>

<p>I must protest. I said clearly&#x2014;and I had in mind this country and other countries as well&#x2014;that if, in some directions we had done less, we might perhaps have really done more for a solution of the problem.</p>

<p>In any case the hon. Member can rest satisfied that the Government of which he is a supporter has done nothing for the unemployed, and this Bill will do nothing. In fact, all the discussions that have taken place right through the various stages of this Bill have led me to the conclusion that the best thing about the Bill is its Title. It has an excellent Title which contains the word "reconstruction." On looking at the Title, before listening to the discussion, one would think that at long last the Government were attempting to fulfil their promises to the unemployed, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Spennymoor (Mr. Batey), and that they were now going to reconstruct and, if not build anew, at least attempt to lay down an industrial structure destined to provide work for the unemployed in the distressed areas and to give them an opportunity of reconstructing their own lives and their homes.<br/>
After reading the Bill and listening to the discussion, one is bound to come to the conclusion that there is nothing in this Bill which will satisfy the longing that is in the hearts of the people living in the depressed areas. The Bill will not provide work for the people in those areas, and it will not give them an opportunity of having a brighter outlook on life. It simply means that they are again to be disappointed in looking to the Government for any easing of the burden and solution of the problem which is causing them suffering at the present

time. Even the Chancellor himself has said that the Bill is not going to put the Thames on fire or cause a revolution so far as the affairs of the depressed areas are concerned. He said it is purely an experiment. It seems to me that so far as the National Government are concerned the word "experiment" is a blessed word in connection with the depressed areas. When the last Bill was introduced by the late Minister of Labour, who is now President of the Board of Education, he said that it was to be an experiment. This again is to be an experiment, and from all the experiments of the National Government in the distressed areas all that has been produced is a change in name. First they were known as depressed areas, then distressed areas and now they are Special Areas.<br/>
This problem has been agitating the minds of the unemployed and the local authorities in the depressed areas for many years. It has faced the Government for many years, and all the Government have done has been to experiment. In the name of justice and common sense the time has passed for experimenting upon the lives of the people in the depressed areas. The time has now arrived for the Government to do something tangible for those areas. I contend that so far as this Bill is concerned the Government are not doing anything tangible for them. Eighteen months ago the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the conditions of the depressed areas were such as to call for special treatment and that it was essential for something rapid, something direct., or, he said, if you like, some unorthodox method to be adopted. It may be that this Bill contains very unorthodox methods so far as the policy of the Government is concerned, but they are very heterodox so far as the financial question is concerned &#x2014;so heterodox that after hours of discussion last night I do not think anybody clearly understood what is the financial policy in the Bill. But even if the financial arrangement contained in the Bill is unorthodox in that sense, it cannot be argued that it, is a rapid measure or that it is a direct measure to deal with the problem.<br/>
After 18 months of solid thinking and diligent effort on the part of the Government to get a direct: and rapid method, they have produced this puny Measure in


order to meet one of the gravest problems any Government has had to face. How will this Bill meet the problem? The chancellor has said that it is not intended to solve it. It is simply going to meet conditions that are in certain areas. Last night the right hon. Gentleman remarked that South Wales was not the only depressed area, meaning, I presume, that i f it does not touch South Wales the Bill may be of advantage to some other areas. I hope that he is right. We are riot concerned to oppose the Bill if it would ease the burden in any other part of the country. What are the conditions of the depressed areas to which this Bill will apply? They can be divided into two categories. There are the varied industry areas, where there are idle factories, and the one industry areas, where there is not room for buildings to be erected and where the Chancellor suggested that it was intended to clear away the rubbish heaps in order to get sites for factories. That has not been done yet. It may be possible for the Bill to be of slight advantage to the varied industry areas, but it will not touch the fringe of the problem of the one industry areas. Those areas are suffering the worst, and if there is to be an attempt to solve the problem of the depressed areas it has to be a solution of the problem of the hardest hit areas.<br/>
The company which is to be formed may attract &#x00A3;1,000,000 capital. After receiving that money what is to happen It is to wait until a certain number of applicants come forward for loans in order to start certain new industries in the depressed areas. The company will be like Micawber, except that, instead of waiting for something to turn up, it will wait for someone to turn up; and while they are waiting there will be millions of people in the distressed areas languishing in poverty and want. Are these people to wait again until such time as sufficient applications have come forward? If they do come forward, what sort of industries are they going to establish? There is no indication in the Bill or the Chancellor's speeches. If there are a number of people waiting ready and anxious to invest their money in the depressed areas, we ought to be able to get the information as to the nature of the industries. How many factories are to be built, and how many people are to be employed? What kind of varied

industries will be established in the vicinity of, say, the depressed areas in South Wales? Unless there is to be some information on these lines. it means that these people have again to wait for years in order to ascertain whether it is possible for some new industries to come into these areas.<br/>
We are not opposing the Bill, but we are conscious that it is not going to touch the problem. The Government have either ignored the depressed areas or have failed to understand the magnitude of the problem. The hon. Member for West Middlesbrough (Mr. K. Griffith) said that this was not the Government's whole plan. Our complaint is that it is not part of a general policy. If it were a part of a well thought out plan we should welcome it with pleasure. It is simply one item taken from the recommendations of the Commissioner but the Commissioner said quite clearly that it was impossible to solve the problem of the special areas by one method and that other recommendations had to be taken into consideration. The Commissioner recommended that there should be a raising of the school-leaving age, that there should be a lowering of the age for retiring from industry, that there should be an increase in pensions, that the scientific treatment of coal ought to be taken up. The right hon. Member for Hillhead (Sir R. Horne) said the other night that one of the advantages of having small industries in close conjunction with the depressed areas would be that they would act as a feeder to the established industries. What is the established industry in the distressed areas? The coal industry, and the best feeder for the coal mines would be the scientific treatment of coal, the extraction of oil and chemicals from coal. What about easing the burden of the rates?</p>

<p>I wanted only to mention some of the recommendations of the commissioner in passing. If this Bill were a part of a general programme on the part of the Government we could look forward to the future with some measure of hope so far as the depressed areas are concerned. We shall not ask the Government to withdraw the Bill, but to intro, duce very quickly a sequence of other measures in a policy for the depressed


areas. The Government must be told that the patience of the depressed areas is gradually coming to an end. The people there are getting sick and tired of the conditions under which they live, and it would be to the advantage of the Government and the country generally if this problem were seriously and honestly dealt with in order to give the people there an opportunity again to earn a decent and an honest livelihood.</p>

<p>I had not intended to intervene to-night, but some of the remarks which the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams) made rather encouraged me to put forward my views. I think he was over-critical of this Bill. We ought to appreciate the efforts which are being made to deal with the problem, even though the effort we are now discussing may be only a small one. I have had some considerable experience in raising money for businesses, and I know how difficult it is to raise money for small or medium-sized businesses. It is easy to get &#x00A3;1,000,000; pretty easy to get &#x00A3;500,000; not so difficult to get &#x00A3;250,000; but when you come down to &#x00A3;50,000 or &#x00A3;10,000 the difficulties are very great.<br/>
The reasons are that the expenses incidental to raising money are very much the same whether the amount is great or small. If you want to advertise a prospectus in the Press and pay all the expenses incidental to raising money on the Stock Exchange, you probably find that you have an advertising bill from the newspapers for something 'between &#x00A3;5,000 and &#x00A3;6,000, and that fees and underwriting commissions run into &#x00A3;2,000 or &#x00A3;3,000. It is quite impossible, therefore, for small businesses to get money with ease. It has been suggested by my hon. Friends that it is easy to obtain money from the banks because bankers find difficulty at the present time in making use of their funds. That may well be so, but it is not the business of bankers to find money for businesses. The business of bankers is to find working capital for some businesses and to find such money as is required from time to time on short term. If the Bill draws the attention of financial interests to this problem it may have good

results, in that more companies may be formed to deal with this form of credit.<br/>
It is easy to criticise the Bill. I found difficulty in understanding paragraph 4 of the Schedule. Criticisms are easy to make, but we have to remember that here is a Bill introduced by the Government with the very definite object of filling a gap in our financial system. It may be that private enterprise ought to have filled this gap: I sincerely hope that private enterprise will take note of what this Bill is doing and will, in its own interests, do something more to fill a gap which clearly exists in our financial system. I hope the House will give the Bill a Third Reading, and I thank the Government for what they have done to draw attention to the matter.</p>

<p>In welcoming or not welcoming the Bill which the House is now asked to give a Third Reading, one would be entitled to judge the proposals from the standpoint of what is contained in it, and whether, as a result, one might expect from the Government any other proposals to deal with the problems towards the solution of which this Bill affects to move. From the initials of the title of the Bill, S.A.R.A., I very much fear that, like another historic personage with a very similar name, it will remain barren to a very old age. I doubt very much whether the Front Bench will ever be able to fructify the Bill. The hon. Member for West Middlesbrough (Mr. K. Griffith) suggests that this is not the Government programme but a request by the Commissioner. One is entitled to ask whether the Government are correctly interpreting what the Bill proposes to do. The hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams)&#x2014;I do not know whether he thought his suggestion was humorous&#x2014;said that in a minature way this was a trade facilities Measure. He forgot to add "without the facilities."<br/>
The Commissioner said that in his experience of attempting to deal with difficulties in the depressed areas, certain people found difficulty in obtaining the necessary capital. That was his suggestion. If the Government have adopted it as an instruction, how have they endeavoured to interpret it? Let us see how it has been interpreted, even as


recently as last evening, by the Financial Secretary. In opposing an Amendment he emphasised the fact that it should be none of our business, and particularly of this Bill, to provide easier credit facilities for the men who are courageous enough to attempt to find a solution of this problem than are available to other people. He said that the individual who comes to this association for loans is, in the eyes of the normal and orthodox organisation, not creditworthy, and that, if the Amendment in question were put into the Bill, it would confer upon this non-creditworthy individual a lower rate of interest than other people could have.<br/>
The Financial Secretary last night objected to giving to men who are dealing with a special difficulty special terms for dealing with it. Previously he had said that the individual entering a depressed area with a view to starting a new industry would be a very courageous individual; he would be embarking upon a very bold adventure; and then the Financial Secretary confused the first individual, who had thus adventured into the troubled world of a depressed area, with the Association itself, which does not adventure at all. The Special Areas Reconstruction Association is a very well-blessed Association. The Bill provides that its shareholders shall have 3&#x00BD; and 3 per cent. interest on the money they subscribe. The Association will also receive handsome contributions from the Treasury towards its reserves. Thirdly, it is guaranteed as to any loss of capital up to a given percentage; and, fourthly, it is guaranteed also that its administrative costs will be found. The Association adventures nothing; it is the individuals who come to it for loans who are adventurous, and for them there is no assistance, except that the Financial Secretary held out to them last night a wonderful vision for the future, if the company is prosperous.<br/>
It is no wonder that the Government agreed to give to this company, which must find 32 per cent. for its shareholders, its administrative costs, because one can imagine the rate of interest that it would have to charge its borrowers if it had to pay 3&#x00BD; per cent. to its own shareholders, plus its own administrative costs, plus providing for its reserves, plus the condition upon the borrowers to repay the capital as well as the interest upon it. One can imagine the burden upon the

poor clients, even with all the assistance that the Government are giving. Therefore, the Financial Secretary suggested that, if the company is prosperous&#x2014;if it can exact from the first range of clients a sufficiently high rate of interest, and secure the return of the borrowed capital in a sufficiently short time&#x2014;if it is prosperous to that degree, there is a possibility that the second, third, fourth and fifth ranges of clients may have the benefit of a lower rate of interest. In other words, if the depressed areas can remove their own depression, there is the hope that someone will get money at a cheaper rate.<br/>
That is the way the Government attempt to solve the problem. There is nothing in the Bill, and we should be justified to the hilt in voting against it. [An HON. MEMBER: "Are you going to vote against it?"] I am prepared to vote against it. You are simply playing with the problem. I only wish that Members could be compelled to live in a distressed area for a month. Then they would know what to do about it. The Chancellor of the Exchequer the other evening admitted that the Bill does not touch the distressed areas. It is an experiment in a very limited degree. That is no contribution at all. I should like to see the next 12 months rapidly pass by and let everyone realise that there is nothing in it now and there never has been. The unemployment problem is a problem of the depressed areas. The Minister of Labour may be satisfied to some extent by the reduction in the unemployment figures as recorded to-day, but that does not affect the depressed areas. The Rhondda has not yet seen the bottom of the depression. There has not been a suspension yet in the Rhondda of the continued increase in depression which began in 1921, and for how many more years we are going to be compelled to experience an increase of this condition of affairs we do not know. No one need wonder that we carefully analyse the propositions contained in the Bill. In them we see not a vestige of hope for our people. There is not a word in the Bill which offers the slightest possibility of anyone coming into our area and starting anything in the nature of a new industry.</p>

<p>I had not intended to intervene in the Debate, but inadvertently


I found myself in the seat usually occupied by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) and it is difficult, occupying such a seat, not to take part in the Debate. To keep up the traditions of the right hon. Gentleman, I find myself with a desire to pay a genuine tribute to the Government. I have listened with some astonishment to the criticisms of the Bill. It is exactly what the Chancellor represented it to be, not the only thing the Government are to do, not a vast expensive scheme, but a genuine constructive experiment which should have the blessing of everyone in the House. The idea was suggested to him by the Commissioner for the depressed areas, Mr. Malcolm Stewart, and was founded upon his vast experience, and the Bill represents the Chancellor's willingness to carry out the Commissioner's idea.<br/>
It would really seem sometimes that, much as hon. Members opposite desire the welfare of the people of the depressed areas, they live in terror that something that the Government might do would help them. More than once they have talked about the vested interests of the capital class. They sometimes give the impression of regarding the unemployed as their vested interest, for whom nothing must be done by this side of the House. This Bill is a modest one, but firms which could not otherwise get started will begin to get the capital they require. From small beginnings, firms may develop into great concerns. To condemn the Bill and to belittle its possibilities by criticism is to have a very wrong conception of the whole thing. I consider that the Measure which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has brought forward, and which has been criticised so much but with so little effect, ought to have the blessing and the enthusiastic support of every Member of this House.</p>

<p>I wish to say a few words about the Bill from a totally different point of view from any that has yet been expressed. I do not doubt the absolute sincerity of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with regard to the purpose of the Bill, but the House ought to be warned about a Bill of this description. Ever since I came into the

House I have consistently opposed every kind of subsidy and grant to private enterprise. I am a believer in private enterprise, but it is an absolutely wrong principle that the House of Commons should call upon its Members to vote sums of money in order to assist private enter-price. I have stated time after time in this House that there is no justification for private enterprise unless it can stand upon its own feet, and that is the word of warning I want to issue about this Bill when we are voting the money of our constituents in order to try&#x2014;and I agree on this point&#x2014;to help matters in the distressed areas. But it may be that losses will be thrown upon the State. We ought to have that particular point of view in mind.<br/>
It is very difficult indeed for people who believe in private enterprise to come cap in hand to the House of Commons in order that private enterprise should be assisted. There ought to be ways and means of raising money by private enterprise through its own resources rather than having to come to the House of Commons and ask for assistance. [An HON. MEMBER: "That is what they are there for."] Let them answer for themselves; they are of age. What will happen if there should be huge losses to be borne by the State as the result of this Bill? You absolutely invite criticism of this kind of Bill, and further, you invite the State to take over many of these businesses as the logical conclusion of those losses. I warn the House, and those who believe in capitalism, of the danger, as we have done during the last three or four years when private enterprise has had to come cap in hand and ask for help from the resources of the State. That is the word of warning I want to issue to the House. It would be well if the people interested in finance found ways and means of financing their own enterprises, instead of playing into the hands of hon. Members above the Gangway.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two to bring the House back to realities. Some of us have been told that we ought to live in the depressed areas. I have lived in one 40 years. That is why I am here. I have lived among the people all that time, and they know me. It is true that this Bill is in a way a small thing, but its potentialities


are immense. May I give you my own experiences 1 I have tried sometimes to get orders for my constituency on Tyne-side. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not expect this Bill to set the Thames on fire he used the wrong name. It is to set the Tyne busy. It is not the Thames that I am concerned about, or that this House should be concerned about, but the Tyne and the Tees and the North country generally. Many are called distressed, but few are chosen Special Areas. We from the Special Areas lament the fact that we are so. We do not want any favours. We are not used to them. All we ask is fair play. The hon. Member for South Bradford (Mr. Holdsworth) talks as one of the old, rigid, hard, Manchester school about private industry requiring help. We young Liberals 30 years ago deliberately cut ourselves away from that.<br/>
This Bill is another example of social service. I referred to my own experience regarding attempts at beginning businesses at Tyneside. I have had people coming there with sound, new industries. I have taken them to the managers of the chief banks in Newcastle. They have said it was a good business, but there were no balance sheets for three years to show as a tangible thing that could be seen in black and white. When I went to the Commissioner with these schemes&#x2014;I will not divulge them, because when this Bill has gone through the probability is that I will get them&#x2014;and propounded such a scheme as this Bill does, he said that he was sorry he had not the power to do it. Now he has asked for that power, and this Bill is to implement what he desires. As one who has lived in the depressed areas I hope this Bill will be the forerunner of better days. If we get the new Cunarder, if Sir John Jarvis gets Jarrow going, if we get these trading estates on Tyneside, we shall not want favours.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer by the introduction of this Bill seems to have caused great division in the depressed area occupied by the Liberal party. The representative of the Liberal party who spoke last objected to the Bill on the ground that it subsidised private enterprise. Private enterprise, he said, had always stood on its own

feet. That's not true. Private enterprise never at any time stood on its own feet. Private enterprise has always ridden on the backs of the working classes. The point about the Bill is that it represents an economic anomaly. Private enterprise in this country is developing on the lines of big business. The big businesses have wiped out the small businesses, and the big businesses have produced the derelict areas. Instead of tackling big businesses in order to overcome their destructive effects, as expressed in the distressed areas, we are back at the beginning again. We are seeking to build up small businesses. Whether we like it or not, we may have thrown over the Manchester school, but we are going beyond the Manchester school. We are back at the beginning again. Big business will destroy small business in the future, as it has destroyed it in the past.<br/>
If small businesses are to be set up they will have to be businesses that are of a progressive character, in the sense of being businesses that will stand and be able to face the possibility of continuous development. They will have to be businesses that will meet the urgent needs of the people in the distressed areas or the people in the country generally. I should like to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer a question arising out of a remark made by the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams), who expressed the view that so many things were happening in the House that he did not like, that he was beginning to get the idea that he was narrow-minded. The hon. Member's ideas are very slow of development. I am certain that the rest of the House had that idea long ago. The hon. Member said that this Bill would allow people to get money for the starting of businesses when they could not get it by ordinary methods from the ordinary financiers. If that be so, I would ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he would be prepared through this Bill to assist a really progressive enterprise, one that is bound to advance, one that will meet the urgent need of the people in the distressed areas and of the people of the country generally, and that is a Communist printing press and publishing house in these areas.</p>

<p>The very fact that to-day we speak of certain areas of the country as being depressed areas is of itself a striking tribute to the work that has been done by the National Government, because under the last Labour Government the whole country was a depressed area. It is only by contrast with the ever-widening circle of prosperity in the country as a whole that we now see certain areas still depressed. That is very comforting for the country generally, but it is not much comfort to those who live in the depressed areas. I agree with what the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams) said as to the ultimate remedy being a general improvement in the trade and industry of the country. At the same time I feel bound to sympathise with the pleas that are made by hon. Members representing depressed areas for special consideration for those areas.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer offers this Bill as one attempt to assist those areas. He does not make extravagant claims for it. It is pointed out that there is no one general remedy, but if we apply many small remedies, the cumulative effect may produce what we desire. In Committee I ventured to criticise certain obscure passages in the Bill and to suggest that the control over the expansion of the company should be left to the House of Commons, and not with the Treasury. My object in speaking to-night is to make it clear that, despite those criticisms of detail, I support the general principle of the Bill. I do so with my eyes open. I have no doubt myself that there will be losses under the Bill, but I think the country will not be unduly critical of such losses provided that the successes greatly outweigh the failures. I am glad the Chancellor has brought the Bill in, and I wish him luck with it.</p>

<p>Such criticism of the Bill as has been expressed in the course of the Debate has not been of such a serious character as to require much reply from me, but at the same time I should not like to be thought discourteous in not making some reply to the speeches to which we have listened, and for that reason I wish to say a few words.

First, I would like to thank those of my hon. Friends who have expressed their support of the Bill. My bon. Friend the Member for the Rushcliffe Division (Mr. Assheton) made a speech which was, I think, an extremely valuable one, for he showed us exactly what the difficulties are in the way of finding what is called finance for small industries. I would also like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter) and my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead (Mr. Magnay) for their support, and I must, not omit the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, West (Mr. K. Griffith), who made a speech which showed, I thought, a very fair and reasonable outlook and an understanding of the scope and also the limitations of the Bill. With regard to the criticisms of the party opposite, they were really devoted more to what is not in the Bill than to what it actually contains, but if they will allow me to say so, they suffer from the defect of always overstating their case.</p>

<p>What is the use of their repeating that we have done nothing for the unemployed? Only in the papers this morning they might have read that the numbers of the unemployed have again been reduced by a further 50,000, while the numbers of persons in employment have reached a new high record. What is the problem which we have to consider? The hon. Member for Spennymoor (Mr. Batey) says that the reason for the condition of the special areas is that they were dependent upon certain big businesses, certain heavy industries, and, like the hard-boiled Tory that he really is, he has no idea of doing anything but to revert to the old orignal plans, and to say, "Spend money again in setting up the old industries." The coal industry in some parts of Durham has come to an end because the pits are exhausted, and no amount of money is going to put coal back again into the ground. The hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. John) urged that there should be more scientific research as to improving the uses of coal. I certainly am not going to decry the fullest scientific research, but I must point out that the results of scientific research into that question have been to show that less and less coal is needed to produce the same results in


both the electricity and the gas industries. It is well known that the amount of coal required to do the work which used to be done has been considerably reduced by discoveries and inventions. I accept the suggestion of the hon. Member for Spennymoor that the difficulty is caused by the failure of the big industries upon which these areas have been almost exclusively dependent in the past. Surely the hon. Member will agree that in addition to doing anything you can to assist these big industries, the best thing is to try to bring new industries into the district. His attitude is not a helpful one. He says that it is not the slightest use bringing new industries into these areas.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Spennymoor began by saying that the Government had continually raised hopes in the special areas and then disappointed them, and in the rest of his speech complained that I had not sufficiently raised the hopes of the special areas, because I did not give a more exaggerated idea of the benefits which would come out of the Bill. I have tried to preserve a happy mean on this occasion. The hon. Member for West Middlesbrough suggested that I had gone too far in the other direction and had not said enough about its possibilities. We are continually told that the Government are resenting the Bill as a solution of the problem of the special areas. That is not the intention or the purpose of the

Government in this Bill. It is an attempt to meet one particular point which has been put up to us, and that is the difficulty of finding finance for new small industries in these areas.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Bradford (Mr. Holdsworth) belongs to the old individualistic school and the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) declares that I have brought division into the Liberal party. The hon. Member for West Fife is in the happy position of belonging to the only party in which there cannot be any divisions. I am not one who wishes to say anything in derogation of private enterprise. I am a. believer in private enterprise, but I am not quite so extreme as the hon. Member. Among other amusements of my leisure hours is horticulture, and I know how it is possible to start in a greenhouse, plants which afterwards can be planted out in the kitchen garden to produce useful and nutritious food because it has been possible to give them a little start. That is a parallel with this case. As one of my hon. Friends said, if this experiment proves conclusively that, by taking some risks, which are sufficient to prevent the ordinary sources of finance from operating in these eases, it is possible to do some good; if by our example we can show that those risks are capable of being overcome and that there is a real field for this financial work, without incurring undue losses, then I am sure private enterprise will not be slow to follow our example and this small experiment may lead to something far bigger&#x2014;big enough even to meet the ideas of the hon. Member for Spennymoor of what I ought to do. It is not put forward as a solution of the problem. As the Special Commissioner truly said, there is no one measure which can solve the problem. It can only be solved by a number of measures, addressed to different sections of the problem. This is one of them, and I hope the House will now be ready to give the Bill the Third Reading.</p>

<q>That the Additional Import Duties (No. 8) Order, 1936, dated the fifteenth clay of April, nineteen hundred and thirty-six, made by the Treasury under the Import Duties Act, 1932, a copy of which was presented to this House on the twenty-first day of April, nineteen hundred and thirty-six, be approved.</q>
In accordance with our usual practice, I propose to make a short introductory statement covering the three Orders on the Paper, and hon. Members can, if they wish, put questions to me on any of the Orders, while it will, of course, be open to the House to divide on each Order. These Orders relate to hair combs, to certain chemicals, notably sodium bichromate, and metal capsules. Order No. 9, dealing with chemicals, will probably be disposed of very readily. Orders Nos. 8 and 10 are relatively simple. As regards hair combs, the proposal is that an additional duty of 8s. per gross should be put on as an alternative to the recent duty of 20 per cent. The new duty is directed mainly against Japanese competition. The average declared value of the imports was something like 20s, and the average declared value of the imports from Japan in February, 1936, was only Os. 10d, a gross, and the quantity of imports from Japan increased from nothing at all in 1930 to 126,000 gross in 1935. Japan indeed was sending to this country more than half the total imports of hair combs. The British manufacturers have given the Committee assurances that increased prices to wholesalers should involve no change in the existing low retail prices to the consumer, and the English manufacturers have pointed out that a higher output may even enable the price to be lowered. I should imagine that, there is very little in regard to that Order dealing with combs which would require discussion.</p>

<p>Would the Parliamentary Secretary inform the House what is the price of British combs compared with the 6s. 10d. and 8s. a gross?</p>

<p>The value is about 17s. 6d., or something of that order. I

do not wish to mislead the House in that, because it is difficult to give an average price over a large range of articles. Suffice it to say that 6s. 10d. a gross is only about a third of the value per gross of the British combs. No. 10 Order deals with metal capsules used for sealing bottles and jars. There was a duty of 20 per cent. and for this 20 per cent. a combined duty is now made up of an ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. plus 1s. 8d. per 1,000 capsules. The Order took effect on 2nd May. The imports have increased from 42,000,000 to 86,000,000. The United Kingdom producers were not able to take full advantage of reduced imports. Prices of foreign capsules in the home markets are much higher than those at which these foreign capsules are exported to the United Kingdom, because of deliberate under-selling by foreign producers, which is a severe handicap to United Kingdom producers. The home industry has a strong claim for further protection, and the Import Duties Advisory Committee are of opinion that any rise in price which might follow the increase in duty should have a negligible effect on the consuming industries, by far the largest industry being the wine and spirit trade, which could be counted as a luxury trade.<br/>
That leaves No. 9 Order, and if I rightly understand the wish of hon. Members, it would be that on No. 9 Order I should give a little more information. This Order deals with sodium bichromate and potassium bichromate. These are substances which are used in the chrome tanning of skin which is a more rapid process than the vegetable tanning of skin. They are used largely for light leathers, box and willow calf, and only to a small extent for sole leather. These goods were formerly charged only with the general ad valorem duty and the proposal is that sodium bichromate should be charged with a rate of duty of 8s. per hundredweight and that potassium bichromate should be charged 10s. per hundredweight. The home and the export trade in these commodities is, in a large measure, subjected to control by an international cartel, and that control has been exercised in a reasonable manner and orderly marketing has been possible. The agreement is only a short-term one, running from year to year, and in the Committee's opinion the United Kingdom market is relatively


unprotected, and there is a good deal of insecurity. This lack of protection has exposed the British manufacturer to competition from independent foreign producers who, by undercutting, have increased their trade in this country.<br/>
The home manufacturers have given a. very elaborate assurance as to prices. I want the House to pay particular attention to the terms of the assurance as to prices, which in a moment I will read. The home production is carried on at a number of places, chiefly Glasgow, near Bolton, and County Durham. The production capacity is ample for home and export requirements, and the number of workpeople is something like 600. The imports have came in largely from Russia and Japan. The price assurance which I am anxious to give to the House is this: The large firms of manufacturers of these substances have given the assurance that they will not increase the present prices of either of these chemicals except in so far as increases are justified by an alteration, extending over a period of a month or more in any of the raw materials, that is chrome ironstone, alkali and coal, and an alteration of wages. They have given an undertaking that they will reduce the prices of these chemicals to the extent justified by a reduction in costs of production resulting from any of the same causes. There is thus a very satisfactory assurance given to the Import Duties Advisory Committee with regard to the prices charged to the consuming interests. The Russian and Japanese producers are outside the international cartel. Sodium bichromate has been coming in from Russia&#x2014;2,500 cwts. in 1932 and 10 times as much in 1935. The increase in three years of Russian exports of this chemical which is used as a raw material in the tanning industry has been multiplied by 10. The details of imports from Japan show that the quantities have multiplied by two in 1935 as compared with 1934. So that we have the curious spectacle of Russia and Japan, the two producing countries outside the cartel, multiplying their exports to this country very largely in the years that have followed 1932. This is a trade that can perfectly well be supplied from within our own boundary, and price undertakings have been given. I think, the House will therefore have no hesita-

tion in approving this Order, which I believe is the substantive order of these three. The other Orders are relatively small.</p>

<p>I wish to say a word about the Import Duty on combs. A duty of 8s. per gross on top of the present price of 6s. 10d. will make the price of the imported Japanese article 14s. 10d. per gross, as against 17s. 6d. for the English article. As one who had to handle these goods some years ago I should say that the English combs, costing 17s. 6d. per gross, would be reckoned as costing ls. 6d. a dozen and would be sold in shops which do a big sale at 2d. each or in smaller shops at 2&#x00BD;d. What is the position with regard to the Japanese article&#x2014;not that I say that it ought to be brought in at a price which does not allow the worker here to get a living wage, but one must consider the effect of this protection upon people who live in a poor neighbourhood like my own? These combs are being broken every week; they do not last very long. Under ordinary business conditions Japanese combs bought at 6s. 10c1. per gross would be put into stock as costing 7s. ld., equivalent to roughly &#x00BD;d. per comb, and the retail price in the shops would be ld. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has had any experience of marking up stock, or whether he has ever got as low as marking up combs. I have had to stock combs and I should certainly mark up those combs at 7s. per gross. With the addition of the import duty the price of the Japanese combs will be brought up to near the English price of 17s. 6d. per gross. Then it may be that a trader will not stock the two classes of combs. When there is only a difference of 2s. per gross the English article may be pushed out of the road and the 14s. 10d. line take its place. In that case what protection will there be for many of the small industries up and down the country?<br/>
I look upon the invasion of cheap Japanese goods as being of no benefit to the workers of this country. If a commodity which is in everyday demand is to be brought in at a profit that makes it more beneficial to the manufacturer to import combs rather than to make others, many small makers of combs will go out of business, or will use their warehouses to store Japanese goods instead of making combs. A good deal of business is done in the making of combs, and I want every opportunity for our workers to gain a fair livelihood. It would not be fair to allow these goods to come into the market unless there were some guarantee that the British goods would not be raised in price and that the manufacturers would not drop the home commodity in order to put the Japanese article on the market at a higher price.</p>

<p>Has there been any objection from the textile interests to these Orders? One or two sentences occur in this Order that many of my textile friends would challenge. It is always interesting to see the phraseology of the Import Duties Advisory Committee. This is one sentence, speaking of the cartel:
<q>We have no reason to doubt that that control, which regulates prices at levels of which substantial sections of the consumers would complain&#x2026;</q>
"Substantial" may mean anything. The Colour Users' Association do me the honour of sending me their report every year, and I have never yet seen a report that did not complain of the prices since the cartel arrangement. The Order goes on to say:

<q>The United Kingdom market is relatively unprotected.</q>
I do not know how that can be true. Anybody who knows the workings of that cartel knows that it is better than any protection that can be given.<br/>
I should appreciate it if some of these Orders could be put on to the programme of business of this House for a reasonable hour, when we should be able to debate them seriously. I know the difficulties of the Patronage Secretary in arranging business, but these Orders affect thousands of traders, and we should be glad to give more time to them than can be given after 11 o'clock at night. We all go into the Lobbies to vote on the suspension of the Eleven o'Clock Rule, but there is a general shout if anybody gets up to speak after 11 o'clock. I know that the Patronage Secretary is not responsible for these Orders being put on after 11, but it is not fair to him or to the House to do so, and an earlier hour should be given to the study of the Orders.</p>

<p>The total import of combs from foreign countries is 200,000 gross, and Japan, which exported none at all to this country in 1930, had, by five years of intensive under-cutting, won an entry here to the extent of 126,926 gross out of the total of 200,000 gross.<br/>
Apart from the questions with regard to Order No. 8, which deals with combs, the questions that have been put to me have been, as I expected, directed to Order No 9, which deals with the textile trade. The hon. Member for the Scotland Division of Liverpool (Mr. Logan) will, of course, understand that, although more than half our total import of combs comes from Japan, there are considerable imports from Germany, France and other countries, but the average declared value of Japanese combs is well under one-third of the value of the German combs, and we have to legislate for the whole of the imports that come in. It will interest the hon. Member to know that these combs are sold in the multiple


stores at 2d. to 3d.&#x2014;I am not dealing with the 1d. ones at all&#x2014;and that the British manufacturers sell their infinitely better combs at the same price and have given an undertaking that that price shall not be raised. On the contrary, with the production of a greater number to take the place of these foreign imports, which we intend to exclude by this duty, there is a reasonable hope of their price coming down. The Committee, who have received these assurances, are satisfied that the production capacity of the industry in this country is great enough to enable it to expand and that this is a type of trade which it can well supply; and there is every confidence that this duty, high and therefore prohibitive for most countries, and difficult so far as Japan is concerned, materially reducing the profit that a merchant might be tempted to obtain by selling cheaper combs imported from Japan, will induce a considerably greater consumption of British combs; and I think the arguments used in that regard by the Import Duties Advisory Committee are likely to commend themselves to the House.<br/>
With regard to Order No. 9, the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benson) asks whether it is not possible that Russia's ability to send to this country at low prices does not really show that the local price is too high; and the hon. Member for South Bradford (Mr. Holdsworth) says: "What do you mean by saying that this country is relatively unprotected? Look at the Cartel." It is because the international Cartel does not include Russia and Japan, who are independent producers working outside the Cartel and have chosen, in order to gain an entry into this market, systematically to undercut, that the exports from Russia have increased so very largely. It is not because Russia has been demonstrating that the British prices are too high; it is because Russia has been systematically under-selling in order to gain a place in the market that this duty has become necessary. I do not accept the hon. Member's inference that the British makers of these substances are charging too high a price: I do not think that is borne out at all. The materials used in the textile trade cost approximately &#x00A3;10,000,000 a year, the gross output of the textile trade is about &#x00A3;30,000,000 a year and the total value to the finishing trade of bichromate of sodium and

potassium amounts to &#x00A3;37,000, so that on a cost of &#x00A3;10,000,000, producing a finished result of &#x00A3;30,000,000 the cost price of the chemicals is &#x00A3;37,000. It is obvious that the effect of the new duty on these substances coming in from two countries whose exports we desire to see diminished will not be any serious handicap to our industry.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Bradford (Mr. Holdsworth) asks if there was any opposition. Yes, there was. Was there any large body of consumers who did not object? Yes, there was. The opposition before the Import Duties Advisory Committee, based on allegations that the price of British bichromate had been too high came from certain users of these materials in the textile industry. The United Tanners' Federation did not oppose. They were satisfied with the declaration made by the bichromate manufacturers, but the Allied Association of Bleachers intimated that they were unwilling, on grounds of principle, to co-operate. The manufacturers undertake to communicate grounds for proposing any increase in price and the declaration that has been obtained by the Import Duties Advisory Committee, as a condition of making these recommendations, is in the terms that I have read out, that the prices of sodium and potassium bichromate shall not be raised except to the extent to which raw materials or wages render the cost of manufacture greater and, on the contrary, if the cost of materials or wages falls, the price will be correspondingly reduced. I think that undertaking is of a kind that has commended itself to the House before and is in terms which should be accepted again. [<i>Interruption</i>.]I am not quite sure of that off-hand, but application should be made to the import Duties Advisory Committee if in the opinion of consumers the terms of the undertaking have not been properly kept. I have not given any thought to the hon. Member's last question. I may perhaps reflect on that and write to him. It may well be that, if this comes under the general category of dyestuffs, the greater will include the less but, dealing with the Order by itself, the promise given to the consuming interests is satisfactory and, if it works unfairly, further application should be made to the body that has made the recommendation.</p>

<p>I would add my protest to that of the hon. Member with regard to the absurdity of these very important new taxation proposals being always discussed at 11 o'clock. I beg the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury to co-operate with the Board of Trade in trying to arrange for a more reasonable time for these discussions. Otherwise, while we are apparently on occasion after occasion almost docile in the brevity with which we tackle this question after 11 o'clock, the House must face the taking of other measures to force the Government to provide adequate time for the consideration of these important questions. There is very great substance in the references of the hon. Member for South, Bradford (Mr. Holdsworth) to the wording of these reports. 'Who is there that can imagine from reading the actual report in regard to Order No. 9 that the true facts were as given by the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply to a question? One could not possibly imagine from the report itself that there had been such a very important body of opposition from great sections of the textile industry. That again indicates the injustice of the present procedure. It is intolerable that such large and heavily increased taxation should be placed on industry without adequate information being before the House as to the real position. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary may well say, "I have given the information in reply to questions," but the House is entitled to have that information on paper before it considers the Order, so as to be able to give a sound judgment as to whether the tax is right or wrong. Hon. Members who made that point are completely justified. Nothing is more vicious than taxing the citizens of one particular country in order to maintain the price level of an international cartel.<br/>
That is really the object of this Order. The Parliamentary Secretary has been perfectly frank about it. That applies in regard to other commodities, which are the subject of recommendations, at various times, of the Import Duties Advisory Committee. We are being asked to-night to give approval to the taxation of British subjects, including important users of this commodity as a raw material, in order to keep up the general price level of an international cartel and for the distribution of profits to inter-

national shareholders. When these questions are raised we always have the assurance that prices will not be increased to the consumer, but the fact is that, as the result of the procedure of the Import Duties Advisory Committee, you are taxing the people to-day in this country, and are raising additional revenue of over &#x00A3;70,000,000 more than in 1931. That means that Import Duties Revenue is being collected apparently under the Import Duties Act, and under increased customs of every kind, and you have, in fact, the goods still coming in. You are getting the revenue, and the people who use the goods are paying the taxation. You are taxing them the whole time, both in regard to finished articles and raw materials, and, therefore, the argument that has been put forward is like a receptacle that will not hold water, you are up against the old dilemma&#x2014;which the tariff reformer never could answer&#x2014;that, if you are to get revenue, you are bound to let goods in, and if you keep goods out, there will not be any revenue. If you talk about taxing the foreigner in this connection, you must have a new and more direct tax than you have under the procedure of your latest Import Duties Act.<br/>
I will not say anything about the Order dealing with combs, as my hon. Friend the Member for the Scotland Division (Mr. Logan) has spoken on the subject, but on the point made with regard to capsules, the House should not ride away with the idea that it is going to affect only the wine and spirit trade. That is quite untrue. I can speak with considerable experience of the matter. The duty will affect the price of capsules on almost every class of bottle and food preparations. If the Parliamentary Secretary shakes his head, let me tell him that there is an increasing tendency in many trades to drop other forms of cover for these containers, to drop corks and other things and to turn to capsules. If his Department does not know that fact, it ought to know it. The people in the trade know it. This particular duty will put up all these costs. For that reason we are opposed to the action which the Government are asking the House to approve. I beg the Patronage Secretary, in view of the feeling in the House, to see that we get a better time in future for the discussion of these questions.</p>
