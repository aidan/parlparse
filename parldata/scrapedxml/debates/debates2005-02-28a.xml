	<p pid="a.625.9/1">No one should doubt the Secretary of State's sincerity on this issue. Does he accept, however, that although the intention of last week's statement was no doubt to provide peace of mind, it has created another level of uncertainty? In order to dispel that, will he tell us at what level the cap will be set? When will we know for certain which companies are eligible, and how much money will be left at the end of the day for the 50,000 people who are beyond three years from retirement?</p>

	<p pid="a.625.10/1">First, we envisage that the cap will be the same as that in the Pension Protection Fund&mdash;&pound;12,000. That is our intention. Secondly, I understand that there is uncertainty for other people, but because we will not know absolutely what the assets and obligations are until all the schemes involved have been wound up, we had to make a choice. The temptation was to say nothing until the arrival of that happy state, which is some months away, but following representations by both Government and Opposition Members it was absolutely right to give some comfort to people who were three years away from their scheme age retirement. I am unable to say anything more until we have the final details of the schemes involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.626.0/1">Following last week's news, the workers of the Richards pension scheme in Aberdeen were delighted to find that they were to be included in help from the financial assistance scheme. Notwithstanding what the Secretary of State said in answer to the previous question, can he can give us any idea of time scales? When might all pensioners in such schemes have an idea of what they are going to get and when they are likely to get it?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.626.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/998" speakername="Alan Johnson" colnum="626"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-01.htm#50228-01_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.626.1/1">Our intention is to lay the regulations in the spring, to be in a position to have Royal Assent by around July, and then to give a six-month period for people to apply. The list of almost 400 schemes that we published last week is indicative, not definitive, and some schemes may not be on it. We hope that when the application process is completed and we have full details of all those schemes, which is impossible until those particular pension funds have been wound up, we will be in a position&mdash;it should be around the beginning of next year&mdash;in which to be absolutely sure about what we can offer and to have the scheme fully in place.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.626.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1320" speakername="David Willetts" colnum="626"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-01.htm#50228-01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.626.2/1">Will the Secretary of State confirm a simple point of arithmetic? If the scheme's entire &pound;20 million annual budget were spent on the 15,000 people whom we understand he wants to help, would they get &pound;1,300 a year each&mdash;which is not much&mdash;and how much would be left over to help the other 50,000 or so victims of pension wind-ups?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.626.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/998" speakername="Alan Johnson" colnum="626"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-01.htm#50228-01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.626.3/1">I had better immediately correct an error that I apparently just made. I said that the cap under the financial assistance scheme would be the same as for the Pension Protection Fund. I apologise, Mr. Speaker, for misleading the House. The cap under the PPF is higher; the cap under this fund will be &pound;12,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.3/2">We have a sum set aside that we think, on the basis of our original calculations, will be enough to give proper compensation to people who are in this situation; that is what we want to do. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-22">22 February</phrase>, we announced that the scheme review will now include the finances of the scheme. That process will begin with the next spending review and starts next year. We also said, because this is an issue of great importance to all those affected, that we would not force them to buy annuities, and that we would run the scheme from the DWP, which means that we take the risk rather than the individuals involved. I accept that the full details will have to be laid out at some stage, but I hope that people appreciate that no one has ever tried such an exercise previously. We are taking private sector schemes from <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-01">1 January 1997</phrase>, piecing together all the information on their assets and the gap between their assets and their obligations, and trying to provide help from the centre&mdash;from Government. That is a difficult and complex process, which means that we will not be in a final position to give the sort of details that hon. Members obviously want until some time in the future.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.627.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1320" speakername="David Willetts" colnum="627"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-01.htm#50228-01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.627.0/1">But last week the Secretary of State called for consensus on pensions whenever possible. Can we at least get a consensus that &pound;20 million divided by 15,000 people equals &pound;1,300 per year? I would have thought that all hon. Members could agree about that. Does he accept that many victims of pension wind-ups are working that out and asking, &quot;If we're not in the first 15,000, what is there for us?&quot;? Talking about a review is not good enough. Does not he accept that, if a review is all he can offer, he will leave 50,000 victims of pension wind-ups facing desperate uncertainty? Would not it be far better instead to offer to use banks' unclaimed assets, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/883" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> originally proposed, to help those people?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.627.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/998" speakername="Alan Johnson" colnum="627"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-01.htm#50228-01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.627.1/1">I do not accept that. Conservative Members failed to vote for a Second Reading for the Bill that provided the basis for the legislation. If I understand the argument of the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues correctly, they would have stripped away the FAS from the measure and introduced another Bill. That means that we would be starting the process of getting the necessary legislation only now, with the result that people would have had to wait far longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.627.1/2">Some of the schemes go back to the days when the Conservative party was in power. It never contemplated offering compensation to people in the position that we are considering. [Hon. Members: &quot;Never had to.&quot;] Conservative Members claim that they never had to. The number of redundancies associated with the problem is the lowest on record. It was at its highest under the previous Government. There were plenty of people in that position under the previous Government. We have acted to rectify that, whereas they did nothing.</p>

	<p pid="a.627.2/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on acting first in the interests of those in the most immediate need, as many of us called on him and his predecessor to do in the many debates on the subject. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1170" name="Adam Price">The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price)</phrase> described the announcement as a betrayal in the press. Does my right hon. Friend agree that that is nonsense? Is not it the case that opening the door to the possibility of more funding for the FAS means that people can at least see some light at the end of the tunnel?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.627.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/998" speakername="Alan Johnson" colnum="627"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-01.htm#50228-01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.627.3/1">I agree, and I again pay tribute to my hon. Friend for his role in the campaign following the problems at Allied Steel and Wire. If the announcement is a betrayal, I think that working people need a few more such betrayals, given the assistance it provides to people, some of whom I met last week, who believed that they would never get anything. Some of those people are now in their early 70s.</p>
	<p pid="a.627.3/2">Few people expected us to be able to provide a scheme, and when we did Opposition Members spread cynicism throughout the country and said that it would provide nothing substantial. Now that it has, their next trick is to spread more cynicism and say that people will get no assistance. We are determined to help people in the position that we are discussing. We are probably the first Government even to attempt such an exercise, and I am proud of that. It is far from being a betrayal.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.628.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1311" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="628"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-01.htm#50228-01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.628.0/1">The financial assistance scheme offers 80 per cent., whereas the Pension Protection Fund gives 90 per cent. The Secretary of State has admitted that the cap will be half the level of that for the PPF. There is a third aspect to the problem. Will he confirm that, once the pensions are in payment, they will be frozen until the recipient dies? If so, they will fall in real value year after year. Does he think that that is adequate?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.628.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/998" speakername="Alan Johnson" colnum="628"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-01.htm#50228-01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.628.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is cynicism personified. Yes, the cap has been set at a lower level than that for the Pension Protection Fund, but it is a level at which we estimate that 95 per cent. of people will qualify. It is right that resources should be focused where they are most needed, and that taxpayers do not end up funding pensions paid to executives of failed companies that might have led to the company failing in the first place. Of course the PPF is in a different position: it is an insurance scheme that we are setting up for the future. People cannot insure their house once it has burned down, and we have always made it absolutely clear that the FAS will not be as generous as the PPF. We said that from the start. We also said from the start that we were looking to provide some assistance in an area in which the Government do not have a responsibility to provide compensation. So we are providing assistance in these circumstances. The hon. Gentleman's point is that the PPF scheme guarantees more than the FAS does, but everyone has known that from the start&mdash;it is hardly news to anyone involved. It is about time he gave us some praise for seeking to resolve this issue in a way that gives people some meaningful compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.628.1/2">I was asked about the issue of freezing last week. Not all the schemes involved were index-linked. To index-link the financial assistance scheme would take resources away rather than concentrating them in the area that we think best for giving people maximum compensation. We shall not index-link the FAS, because many of the schemes involved were not index-linked in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="a.628.2/1">My constituents at ASW in Sheerness are thrilled with this announcement. Kent people who had asbestos-related illnesses in Chatham had to wait 18 years for compensation, as did people with lung disease who had worked in the mines in Kent, yet we have done this in two and a half years. Given that the Secretary of State has now opened the door to the &pound;400 million, will the amount being put in be reviewed every three years, or will he consider putting in &pound;100 million a year over 20 years so that everyone knows that there will be adequate funding for the pensioners?</p>

	<p pid="a.628.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on his involvement in this issue. He makes a very good point about the compensation offered to miners. He might also have mentioned the compensation provided to trawlermen by this Government. Those issues were all thought to have been lost a long time ago. I also reminded the House last week about the extra money that we put into the Aberfan fund after people had sought to get it from the Conservative Government for 18 years. When I raised that issue last week, Conservative Front Benchers said, &quot;But Aberfan happened under a Labour Government.&quot; I suppose that that was their reason for not allowing the money to go into the fund during the 18 years in which they were in power.</p>
	<p pid="a.628.3/2">On my hon. Friend's question about the triennial review process, we plan to look at the amount available in the next spending review, at which time we shall have full details of all the schemes. That should prevent us from having to have further reviews every three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.629.4/1">Although my constituency has full employment, hundreds of people who are still on incapacity benefit there would like to get back to work. Will my right hon. Friend join me in congratulating the staff of the Leyland Jobcentre Plus office, who have helped more than 90 people back into work since April last year? Will he also look at ways of helping them to provide even more support to help more people back into work in my constituency?</p>

	<p pid="a.629.5/1">I join my hon. Friend in congratulating the staff at the Leyland office. It is a tremendous achievement to get 90 people off incapacity benefit and back into work in an area that is not part of our pathways to work project, given that pathways areas have double the success rate of non-pathways areas in putting people into jobs. Without the expertise, dedication and almost evangelical approach of front-line personal advisers, we would not achieve such results, so I pay due tribute to the staff involved and to my hon. Friend for taking such an interest in these issues in his constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.629.6/1">While I welcome the aims of my right hon. Friend's policy, I also seek two assurances from him. First, will he do all that he can to ensure that bureaucrats do not reinterpret those aims, as seems to have been the experience of my visually impaired constituent, Steven Buckley? He is doing everything he can to get to work, but the access to work people seem to prefer him to give up his job. Secondly, will my right hon. Friend give me a categorical assurance that there will be no attempt to limit the period for which people can claim incapacity benefit?</p>

	<p pid="a.630.0/1">I invite my hon. Friend to write to me about the specific incident that he mentioned. Obviously I am not denying that problems arise in the system, but I think that in general we get the balance just about right between those who need assistance and those who will probably not be able to work again.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/2">I can reassure my hon. Friend that we will not introduce time-limiting of incapacity benefit. That is not part of our five-year plan, and not part of anything that the Government propose.</p>

	<p pid="a.630.1/1">Will the Secretary of State confirm that, according to his plans, by 2008 new incapacity benefit claimants will receive a lower holding benefit but will be able to increase it to a higher rehabilitation support allowance if they successfully complete a work-focused interview and establish an action plan for seeking work? Is it not the case, however, that in two thirds of the country they will not benefit from the assistance of the pathways to work scheme, which provides more support?</p>

	<p pid="a.630.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is wrong on two counts. The holding benefit will be the same as the current benefit, which is about &pound;54 a week, the same as jobseeker's allowance. Whereas the current benefit applies for 26 weeks, however, we plan to achieve completion of the personal capability assessment in 12 weeks. We are already achieving that in pathways to work areas. The process will become much quicker.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.2/2">As for the move to other benefits, the idea is to ensure that pathways to work is in place throughout the country. That underpins the whole plan, and we will not introduce the new procedures until it has happened. The point is important, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman raised it. What we have said is that by 2008, when a third of the country will be covered by the pathways to work scheme, we intend to have in place legislation enabling us to change to the new system&mdash;which must be primary legislation&mdash;as well as training for GPs, occupational health provision overseen by the Health and Safety Executive, and linking rules so that people who take the huge step of giving up incapacity benefit know that they can return to the same position. All those proposals are crucial to making this a success. After 2008, we will roll out the rest of the pathways to work scheme and implement our proposals fully.</p>

	<p pid="a.630.3/1">We have published proposals to build on the Government's new deal for disabled people, expanding the role of the voluntary sector. Our proposals would reduce the number of existing claimants by 400,000 over the course of a Parliament. Would what the Government recently announced reduce the number by more than that, or less?</p>

	<p pid="a.630.4/1">I find it difficult to take those proposals seriously. Today I wrote to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1320" name="David Willetts">the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts)</phrase> to try to clarify the position. It appears that the Conservatives are saying that they will take 65,000 staff out of Jobcentre Plus, close 600 offices, and give those on the new deal a better deal while ensuring that less money is available to provide that better service. I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman's figures do not add up.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.4/2">Conservative Members do not seem to realise that a third of the Jobcentre Plus programmes are already in the private sector. Their figures do not take that into account. We expect to return far more people on incapacity benefit to work than would be possible under a half-baked proposal to close offices and cut schemes but improve services at the same time. We know the Conservative party's record, and we expect it to be replicated in the unfortunate event of their return to office.</p>

	<p pid="a.631.0/1">Last week I had the pleasure of visiting my local Jobcentre Plus office and Stockton Blind People's Voice. I was there when Blind People's Voice introduced to all in Stockton its &quot;into work&quot; project. Its members were very pleased about much that Ministers are saying, but they wanted me to ask a question. Does not going into work require an enormous leap of confidence for blind and other disabled people? They ask for that to be acknowledged, so that they can work and receive benefit, but can work for as many hours as they can manage rather than a statutory number of hours. If they can work for four hours, that should be accommodated until they can manage 16 or more. I should greatly appreciate a response to that question.</p>

	<p pid="a.631.1/1">I remind my hon. Friend&mdash;I accept her interest in these matters&mdash;that we have changed the permitted work rules precisely because of some of those issues. We need to see whether we need to do anything further. People with the most severe disability want to reconnect with the world of work. They were previously thought to be incapable of doing anything but sit at home. She is absolutely right. We need to use their skills and talents. That is what the Disability Discrimination Bill is all about. That is what the changes in the permitted earnings rules are all about. We need to go even further perhaps to make it easier for those people to take what is, as she says, a very difficult step.</p>

	<p pid="a.631.2/1">The Secretary of State is right to say that more people in the United Kingdom should be economically active both for their financial benefit and to have something to do with themselves during the day. In answer to a previous question, he recognised that for many people it will be quite frightening to go back to work. There will be great anxiety as to whether they can go back to what they previously did, which is more comfortable, if it does not work out. Can he set out in more detail at what point people who find that their attempt to go into the labour market does not work will be able to go back to their more comfortable life, as they will see it, on incapacity benefit?</p>

	<p pid="a.631.3/1">The hon. Lady raises one of the crucial issues. Now in the pathways to work experiments, we are reaching out not to people who have been on IB for 12 months, who were part of the initial pathways to work, but to people who have been on IB for longer&mdash;for up to two years. Ten per cent. of people participating have been on IB for much longer and are volunteers. The crucial aspect is the &pound;40 a week in-work credit to allow them to get over that problem. Because of the linking rules that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget, they will have the opportunity to go back to where they were if it all comes to grief, rather than going through the whole IB process again. That only needs to apply for a certain amount of time&mdash;</p>

If someone has managed to get past those barriers and to be in work for two years, we can safely say that they are back in the world of work and on the road away from that terrible existence on the princely sum of &pound;74 a week, sitting at home disconnected from society. I hope that the hon. Lady accepts that we are seeking to tackle what she is right to say is a real and relevant problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.632.7/1">My right hon. Friend will be well aware that the arrangements for child maintenance payments from March 2003 were meant to get payments flowing quickly and regularly. Two years on, like many of my colleagues, no doubt, I still regularly find cases of incorrect levels of assessment, delays in adjusting assessments and payments, and a system that seems to penalise those willing to pay, rather than those unwilling to pay, causing much distress to many.

	<p pid="a.633.2/1">I think that that is a better description of the Conservative party when it was in power. When it comes to failures in the Child Support Agency and to computer failures, it built up a certain amount of expertise in its 18 years in power.</p>
	<p pid="a.633.2/2">As I said in my initial answer, the first stage is to get the computer system right. I will report to Parliament. Indeed, the Work and Pensions Committee, whose Chairman, the hon. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1025" name="Archy Kirkwood">the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Sir Archy Kirkwood)</phrase>, is present, has asked for a report to Parliament in the spring. It is right that I report to Parliament when the final software upgrade has taken place, because we will then know whether we have got the computer system right. If it is right and up and running properly, we can plan accordingly and transfer the old cases across to it. I hope to be in a better position to provide a precise time scale when I report to Parliament in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.633.3/1">The Secretary of State will know that many absent fathers trapped on the old system are paying so much of their income in CSA payments that they barely have enough left to live on, and certainly not enough to take advantage of their access rights. The best advice that the CSA can offer them is that they give up their jobs and go on to benefits. Clearly, that is to nobody's advantage&mdash;not the men themselves, nor the children nor the community at large. This situation cannot go on. Something has to be done about it urgently.</p>

	<p pid="a.633.4/1">I would be surprised if anyone from the CSA advised such a person to go on to benefits. I know that the hon.

In terms of the difficulties experienced with the CSA, no one should be exempt from criticism&mdash;neither me nor anyone in this House&mdash;except the CSA staff, who have tried hard to cope in very difficult circumstances. They should be applauded, but if there are occasions when the wrong advice has been given, I want to know about them so that we can deal with the situation immediately.</p>

	<p pid="a.633.5/1">Does the Secretary of State not agree that even if the new software works as we hope it will and the transfer of old cases begins, the process has taken substantially longer than we hoped? Moreover, does he also agree that the transition disregard of only &pound;10 a week each year&mdash;the intention behind it was to allow recipients more time to anticipate the change&mdash;is perhaps no longer appropriate? We have been anticipating such a change for year after year, so it will come as no surprise to anyone. Once we get the new system up and running, should we not implement the changes a little faster?</p>

	<p pid="a.634.0/1">We should implement the changes as fast as possible. The &pound;10 disregard is an important part of the new system&mdash;it is not intended as some form of compensation and nor is it dependent on the new system's being introduced more quickly. In fact, it is a very important component and it was agreed to in all parts of the House when the relevant legislation was passed. We are very keen to ensure that as many people as possible can take advantage of the &pound;10 disregard, and to remind people that under the old system a &pound;1,000 payment is available for single parents who take up work. That is an important element of the original CSA scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.634.4/1">As my right hon. Friend knows, we have withheld payments in respect of EDS until the system is right. In fact, to be fair to EDS, our Pension Service system, which it also runs, has been working very well. However, we want to ensure that the scheme is operating properly for the people whom we care about most&mdash;the children involved&mdash;and we will ensure that until that is so, the money will not be released to EDS. Indeed, we will withhold a substantial amount.</p>

	<p pid="a.634.5/1">As the Secretary of State has already made it clear that he has been working closely with EDS, he will recall that it said last October that by the end of the year it would have given the agency the tools to do the job. Is it not now increasingly clear that the main problem is not just computers that do not work, but a management culture that is dysfunctional and an outcome that is based on discrimination between old cases and new cases, which is increasingly unacceptable? The chief executive has been given his cards, but he is apparently still working, so would it not be appropriate if Ministers, who appear to lack any political will or sense of urgency about this matter, were given their cards promptly, too?</p>

	<p pid="a.635.0/1">I shall respond to a little of that. The hon. Gentleman knows that Her Majesty's official Opposition take the rather pathetic course of packing a Back-Bench Select Committee with their own Front Benchers&mdash;something that I always find rather distasteful and unnecessary&mdash;so Conservative Members know that we have been round the track on all of this. The hon. Gentleman is right about EDS having said last year that the computer software would be installed by the end of the year. It will not, but we hope that it will be in place by the next phase in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.0/2">The system is working sufficiently well to make a decision on termination difficult, but not well enough to deliver the standards that our customers expect&mdash;that is the problem. It does not mean that we have removed the so-called nuclear option of changing the provider. That will be kept in play until we are absolutely sure that the new system will work. Changing providers can cause problems; it could mean making children who need the money wait even longer, so we must take that into account as well.</p>

I do not expect them to be significantly different in future, but the point of the new programme is that it will provide significant extra help for those on rehabilitation and support allowance and for those on disability and sickness allowance, should they wish to take advantage of it. The much more supportive environment and additional help provided by pathways will provide an extra financial incentive so that many of the 1 million people currently on sickness and incapacity benefit who tell us that they want to work will have the chance to do so, and it is about time that they did.</p>

Through pathways, 90,000 people have so far been helped and 9,000 people have moved into work; and it is easy to forget that 200,000 people have been helped into work by the mainstream new deals. We are learning how to help these people and it is about time that we extended those lessons across the country.

In a rural area, some of the money might be used to ensure that transport is available. Ensuring that our front-line staff have discretion means that the system will be sufficiently flexible to enable people to be helped, whatever part of the country they live in.</p>

The disability and carers service makes more than 1 million decisions every year, only 8 per cent. of which are appealed; therefore, many of the decisions are correct and satisfy the claimants.</p>

	<p pid="a.639.4/1">I acknowledge that sometimes there are issues when our customers have to go to specific locations. We are piloting enhanced reconsideration processes, which aim to prevent cases that may be appealed from getting as far as the appeal process. We think that it can make a difference if we head off the appeal by checking again, in conjunction with the customer, that we got the decision right. One of the main reasons for a change in decision at appeal is that new evidence is presented that was not available to our original decision makers. A better and more informed reconsideration process could stop many of those appeals from going ahead, and that could be an effective way forward.</p>

He stated that the National Audit Office found mistakes in 50 per cent. of cases. The Minister's response was that only 8 per cent. of decisions are appealed, which suggests that more than 40 per cent. of people, some of the most vulnerable, who are on the DLA or attendance allowance, are receiving the wrong amount of money. Surely she should be taking a rather more urgent approach than she seems to be taking today.</p>

	<p pid="a.640.0/1">I deny that there is no urgency in the Department's response. The subjectivity of the DLA and attendance allowance&mdash;where our decision makers are trying to discover the impact of a condition or disability on the capacity of the individual either to look after themselves or to move around&mdash;means that the situation is inherently difficult to pin down. There is no doubt about that; I think that it would be acknowledged by everybody. It is a difficult process in which to make significant improvements, but that does not mean that we are not trying to do so. We are, and I hope that in future we will be able to make much more progress.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State has already referred, are important in the over-indebtedness strategy.

	<p pid="a.640.5/1">My hon. Friend is right to highlight the dangers, especially for young people, of finding oneself heavily in debt as a result of taking up offers that sometimes seem too tempting to refuse. The strategy to which I referred is cross-departmental and is intended both to increase education about financial resources and to ensure that affordable sources of credit are available in communities where, due to low income and financial exclusion, which we are seeking to address, people find that the only available sources of credit are very expensive and draw them further into debt. We are also working with agencies outside Government; as Members know, the Financial Services Authority has a financial inclusion strategy. We need to ensure that we address the problems faced by the relatively small minority of households that are in debt and for whom such debt can be extremely dangerous.</p>

	<p pid="a.641.0/1">Does the Minister accept that the Government have created a society where it is easier to borrow than to save and where savings have almost halved since 1997? Is it any wonder that personal debt has spiralled out of control and pension savings, in particular, are hopelessly inadequate?</p>

	<p pid="a.641.1/1">No, I do not accept that. Part of the strategy, as I explained, is intended to encourage a culture of saving&mdash;a culture that was badly damaged during the 1980s. Most of us consider credit to be something that helps us to balance our income and expenditure over time. A small minority of people&mdash;those in the 7 per cent. of households who find that their debt is such that it can be considered as over-indebtedness&mdash;need additional support and assistance, but most people's level of credit is quite sustainable. Our policies of economic stability, full employment, low inflation and low interest rates have ensured that far fewer people find themselves heavily in debt than did when the Conservative party was running the show.</p>

I understand the Government's reason for not asking taxpayers to underwrite the Pension Protection Fund&mdash;many taxpayers are not members of pensions funds&mdash;but how do they justify not asking members of public sector pension funds, which are underwritten by the taxpayer, to contribute to the PPF when they require members of private sector schemes to do so?

	<p pid="a.642.1/1">Let us remember that the PPF is coming into being because of the tragedy and scandal whereby pensioners are left bereft when a company goes bust and a scheme is underfunded.

	<p pid="a.645.2/2">We need to have a legal framework in place by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-13">13 March</phrase>. Otherwise, without the renewal of the part 4 powers, we could face the prospect of looking at the possible release of detainees without any legal framework to provide some controls in respect of those detainees. That is why it is important that we consider this legislation today with some urgency.</p>

When the Government approached us to suggest that there should be knives in the programme, we did not even know the programme on which knives were to be imposed. It is not entirely correct to suggest that the Government have acceded to our request. It is true that they have not imposed knives, but they would not have known where they should fall.</p>

	<p pid="a.645.9/1">My hon. Friend is well known for her flexibility and tolerance. Given that this is a basic and important question of not only the rights of the House of Commons, but those of every United Kingdom citizen, surely it would not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the Leader of the House to come to the other parties through the usual channels and ask for this week's programme to be rejigged so that we could have at least one more day to consider the Bill.

Some matters can be dealt with relatively quickly, but sometimes the shortest amendments take the longest time to discuss because they are more fundamental than others.</p>

That is a very different situation from the one in which I find myself now. I am particularly interested in clause 9 and the schedule, because they will determine whether a person can see the evidence on the basis of which their liberty might be taken away or restricted, but I see no prospect of us getting that far on a six-hour timetable.

The House must consider carefully whether it wishes to take a grip of its own procedures or simply allow the Executive to roll us over and treat us as their rubber stamp. The Minister will know that I have always been willing when business has gone into Committee, to try to meet agreed timetables when they are reasonable. I have no objection to a sensible timetable if it can help to provide a degree of certainty for the House, but what we are being asked to do today is scandalous.</p>

Yet the Committee stage of a Bill is precisely when the House is supposed to do its duty by looking at the details. Let us take the schedule as one example. Paragraph 4(3)(c) specifies that the Secretary of State will never be required to disclose information if</p>
	<p pid="a.648.9/4" class="indent">&quot;he does not propose to rely on it in proceedings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.648.9/5">That means that he will be under no obligation to disclose relevant exculpatory material to the court. So if one informer says that somebody is a terrorist but somebody else says that he is not, the Home Office can choose to rely on and disclose what the informer whom it prefers has said, and not do so for the informer whose view it does not support. That is the sort of issue of detail that the House is to be wholly unable to consider in Committee because the schedule is at the very end of the Bill and there is absolutely no possibility of our reaching it.</p>

I could not approve a Bill on that basis under any circumstances.

I have never heard of that process being followed before. It is an outrage. Could you suspend the sitting while the usual channels consider whether the Government can proceed with an important Bill on that basis? It reduces our proceedings to a farce if we know that we are about to discuss a Bill that is going to be amended, if the Government get their way, in another place.

I gently suggest that for the Chair to defend the behaviour of the Government, which dishonours this House, is to take on a duty that is not in line with the way in which the Chair normally sees its role.</p>

I have merely said, or thought that I had merely said, that the documentation to which reference had been made&mdash;two separate items&mdash;now appeared to be available, and that the orderly manner for Members to respond to that is to collect them from the place where they have been put. I was simply objecting to a disturbance in the House while I was on my feet about the distribution that was going on unofficially. These documents are now, as I understand it, in the Vote Office and available to all Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.654.0/1">On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I believe that the House has made it very clear that it wants to suspend and that the Chair is being put in an impossible position. It could help us if you would indicate whether it is your intention to accept manuscript amendments in any discussion. That could influence the decision of individual Members who might feel very strongly that, if you were so inclined, they could allow the discussion to go ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.654.2/1">On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have one small point and one more major one. The small point is that it is not yet clear to the House whether the Government are circulating one document or two. A statement from a Minister would clear that up.</p>
	<p pid="a.654.2/2">The substantive point is that, if the Home Secretary is proposing amendments to the Bill and has decided that he does not want to put them to this House on Report, that is probably because six hours does not give us enough time to discuss them. That is why this matter is relevant to the programme motion. It would be a courtesy and a help to the House if the Leader of the House or the Home Secretary could come here to say what those amendments would be. We could then decide whether to extend the programme motion or reject it so as to allow the Government amendments to be considered at the Report stage of this important Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.654.4/1">On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. When the Home Secretary introduced the Bill, he said that the country faced a threat the like of which we have never faced before. Looking at the rest of this week's business, I would suggest that nothing on our agenda ranks higher than the consideration of this measure. Clearly, there has been pressure from both sides of the House for the Government to give us more time to consider whether it is proper or appropriate given the level of threat that we face. The Opposition parties have a day's debate this week. If the Government are unwilling to give us some of their time to extend the timetable, might not the Opposition give us their day so that we could at least have two days' debate on the Committee and Report stages?</p>

What is happening is unprecedented in my experience and that of hon. Members who have been here much longer than me. Many serious amendments have been tabled on the derogating aspects&mdash;the most important elements&mdash;of the Bill. How can hon. Members possibly debate amendments to a Government Bill that is not, in fact, the Government Bill? We are told that there are inchoate, as yet unexpressed and undrafted amendments that the Government will table in the House of Lords.

I do not recall an occasion of such importance, with points being raised on the way in which the House should proceed, when the Leader of the House has not hurried into the Chamber, if he was not already present. In my experience, the Chair often has to rely on the Leader of the House to take some action following any expression of concern from the Chair.

It appears that we are discussing a programme motion for allocation of time to consider amendments that will be redundant because the Government intend to amend the Bill in their own way in another place. Before we came into the Chamber, the letter and the documents were not available to hon. Members such as me. We have spent 25 minutes discussing a programme motion for which relevant documents were not available before we began the debate. Is that in order?

This problem has existed for three years and the Liberal Democrats have consistently pointed out that the Government should have tackled it during that time, rather than leaving it   until a point at which, because of a Law Lords judgment, we are faced with such a short time scale. It cannot be right that we have to deal with such critical issues in such a short period of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.656.6/3">These are not small matters. We shall have only two hours in which to discuss whether a judge or a politician takes certain decisions, although the Home Secretary is going to help us out with that later. We shall probably have only two hours in which to discuss the standard of proof. We might have only an hour to consider whether evidence can be heard in certain situations and a similar time to discuss what the control orders will involve. It cannot be right to rush such fundamental issues through in six hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.656.6/4">I am sure that all hon.

We have been told that we must rush this Bill through. That is simply not correct, because it is not necessary to have new legislation of this kind in place by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-13">13 March</phrase>. The truth is that the detainees in Belmarsh could be let out tomorrow without there being any danger whatever to the state. The point has already been made that they are not going to be subject to house arrest. They are going to be placed under surveillance and they can be kept under surveillance without any new legislation being passed, so there is no pressing need for the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.657.3/2">If there were a pressing need for this legislation, it would be the fault of the Government, because they have had since last December to contemplate the terms of the House of Lords judgment. They have had more than a year to reflect on the contents of the report prepared by Lord Newton. The fact that we are where we are now is solely and exclusively the fault of the Government. What they are doing is a disgrace. It is profoundly undemocratic, it undermines the liberties of each and every one of us, and this House should have no part of it.

I am not sure whether we are yet in Committee or whether you are still in your role as a Deputy Speaker of the House, but in either guise, will you allow me to read a few brief lines from the letter sent by the Home Secretary to my right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary, which I have now had a chance to look at? I will be quick. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.662.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The new procedure for derogating control orders will be as follows. The Secretary of State would make an ex parte application to the High Court for an order. The application would be heard by the judge as quickly as possible . . . The order would be subject to automatic referral to the full court for an inter-partes hearing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.662.0/3">To me, that amounts to a wrecking amendment by letter. If that is true and that is the Government's intention, clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill are otiose&mdash;</p>

My hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/906" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> has pointed out that substantial amendments have been tabled to the initial clauses of the Bill. The problem is that there are so many amendments that if we debate the initial clauses at the start, we will be unable to debate the later ones, which may remain in the Bill. Can we invite the Home Secretary to tell us which clauses are going to be so substantially rewritten that we need spend only a relatively short period debating them? Otherwise, we are going to debate clauses that are not going to form part of the Bill. In those circumstances, the schedule that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/724" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase> wanted to debate, for example, may not be debated at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.663.3/1">I have to tell the right hon. and learned Member that that is entirely a matter for the Home Secretary. If he seeks to catch my eye, he can deal with the matter. No doubt he will have heard what the right hon. and learned Member said.</p>

I, too, have read the letter mentioned by my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/906" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase>. None of us was aware of it until the Division provided an opportunity to get it. As I read the Home Secretary's intentions, if the Bill is amended as he proposes, it will make the entire first group of amendments otiose and unnecessary, so we could be about to waste a considerable amount of time debating amendments that will fall by the way. Will you, Sir Alan, invite the Home Secretary to table in manuscript form as quickly as possible the amendments that he describes in the letter? We must know exactly what we are debating. As far as I am aware, the only reason for not debating the amendments that have been proposed so far is that the Government do not want the Committee to discuss them. They prefer to wait until the Bill goes to the other place, where there will be more time to deal with them.</p>

	<p pid="a.664.0/1">Further to that point of order, Sir Alan. I would be happy to clarify the position. To be candid, I thought that I was being helpful to the Committee in respect of its consideration of these matters by writing the letter that was mentioned. Since Second Reading last Thursday, I have been considering as fully as I can many of the issues raised on both sides of the House. The choice that I faced was whether to respond to the debate on the first group of amendments, summing up my conclusion at that point, or to seek to help the Committee by letting the position become clearer at an earlier stage of our proceedings. That is why I wrote the letter.</p>
	<p pid="a.664.0/2">In response to the points of order, and if it is convenient to you, Sir Alan, I would be happy to set out clearly the conclusions that I summarised in the letter in order to help the Committee's consideration at this stage. If, on the other hand, you would prefer me to deal with that later, I would be happy to take that advice, too. I defer to you, Sir Alan, as to which of those two courses I should follow.</p>

	<p pid="a.664.1/1">Further to that point of order, Sir Alan. Is not the problem facing us, notwithstanding the Home Secretary's attempt to be helpful, that we cannot prejudge whether the Lords would accept any of the amendments that he said he would submit to their lordships rather than to this Committee? We must debate the Bill and the amendments as they are before us, because even if the Home Secretary has generously decided to tell us what he thinks he will do in another place, he cannot know whether the other place will accept the amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.664.2/1">I shall try to help the Committee as best I can. For the sake of good order, the clarification and debate should take place not on a point of order, but on the first group of amendments.

Then, depending on what he tells the Committee and its reaction to that, it will be able to judge what speed it wishes to make on the first group of amendments.

	<p pid="a.664.5/1">Further to that point of order&mdash;I am trying to be helpful, as you are, Sir Alan. In view of what the Home Secretary said in his letter and at the Dispatch Box, would it not be sensible for the Committee to have a brief suspension so that the Home Secretary can table some amendments that we could then debate? Otherwise, we shall debate amendments that are, as my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/967" name="Douglas Hogg">the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase> said, otiose.</p>

	<p pid="a.672.0/1">I rise with some trepidation to support the amendment, the 47 others in the group and new clause 1, which all relate to decisions made by a court through the judicial process rather than by the Secretary of State as the person in the Executive arm of Government responsible for such matters. I am keeping in mind both the letter that has been distributed to us, as it is bound to have some bearing on the debate, and the fact that when we discussed these issues during the passage of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, I voted for procedures that have since been declared illegal. I feel, therefore, that I need to explain&mdash;although not at length&mdash;why I have come to a different opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.672.0/2">In the appalling aftermath of the terrible twin towers incident in New York, there seemed a pressing and urgent need to do something significant to cope with what seemed an immediate danger. Some people may say that because nothing has happened in the United Kingdom over the past few years I am getting complacent, but that is not the case. I am moving the amendments in the context of the fact that it appears that our intelligence services are doing a good job in maintaining their monitoring of the potential terrorist threat. I wish them well and applaud all that they are doing in that regard. Obviously I do not want any form of terrorist activity in the UK to come to a terrible successful conclusion. However, I am also aware that the terrorist threat is no longer a one-off, but will be a significant experience for perhaps months or years. While the middle east remains a festering sore on the human political and social condition, there is a danger that the threat of terrorism will continue. In other words, it could be around for a long time. So issues relating to putting suspected terrorists under some form of house arrest imprisonment or other non-derogating actions to control the potential terrorist threat&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.673.3/1">Has the hon. Gentleman had the opportunity to read the letter from the Home Secretary on these matters? Does he feel that the letter answers the concerns set out in his amendment? My reading of the amendment is that it goes wider than the letter, which relates only to derogating orders. Will the amendment tackle the difficulty, admitted on Second Reading last week, that a combination of non-derogating control orders could amount to a deprivation of liberty and thereby become an issue that should go before the courts or invoke the need to derogate from the convention on human rights? Does he feel that the amendment overcomes the problems that I still have, as perhaps does he, with the letter from the Home Secretary?</p>

	<p pid="a.673.4/1">On the basis of what is in the Home Secretary's letter, I am still waiting for an explanation and a filling out of exactly what is meant in terms of the non-derogating orders. My own position is that there should be a proper legal process in both cases because that would cover the point about some of the non-derogating issues, perhaps when put together, really being derogating ones.</p>

	<p pid="a.673.5/1">The hon. Gentleman has just made the point that there should be a proper legal process. Does he understand that he is only taking a small step by substituting the judge for the Home Secretary? The real problem is that even if the judge makes the decision, that is a not a proper legal process, because the detained person does not know the evidence, does not know the identity of the informer, is not properly represented, cannot see the evidence and cannot ask questions of counsel.</p>

	<p pid="a.673.6/1">If the right hon. and learned Gentleman has read new clause 1, which I tabled, he may see in that perhaps an imperfect attempt to try to deal with some of the issues that he raises. In new clause 1, I propose the setting up of a court of terrorism control, where between three and six judges could meet to consider what the Home Secretary has said and decide exactly how to proceed in handling the evidence. I admit that I am a layman, not a lawyer, but I believe that that would give the court the opportunity to decide how to handle the evidence and whether it needed the clarifications to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman refers. I will come back to that later on.</p>

	<p pid="a.673.7/1">As someone who broadly supports what the Government intend to do, does my hon. Friend agree that although the Home Secretary has undoubtedly made a move in view of the concern expressed last week so far as derogating orders are concerned&mdash;they will have to be initiated by a judge, which is certainly a step forward&mdash;it is unfortunate, however, that there has been no progress at all on non-derogating control orders, which relate to issues other than house arrest, as he knows, such as tagging and the rest of it? The Home Secretary's letter simply says that the person involved can apply very quickly to the courts. Surely a person should be subject to a control order only as a result of court action. That is a very important point. Does my hon. Friend not agree?</p>

	<p pid="a.674.0/1">My hon. Friend will be aware that I am speaking now because amendment No. 4 deals with that very point. I look forward to an expansion in what the Home Secretary has to say about the matter. Given that he has already conceded that on derogating orders the judge's role should be primary, perhaps there is room for the debate to develop on that point in a similar fashion.</p>

	<p pid="a.674.2/1">That is a very good idea, and I am bearing it in mind. Of course, hon. Members have made a couple of interventions on my speech, which has slowed me down, but in the light of the letter and the conversations that I have had this morning on some of these issues, I certainly do not intend to make the speech that I was planning last night&mdash;although I believe that it is necessary at least to refer to some of those matters before I sit down.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/2">The first issue is the House of Lords judgment that, of course, precipitated the need for this debate and these changes in the law. The one simple point that I want to make about that judgment is that it has two significant parts, the first of which relates to the discrimination between nationals and non-nationals in the United Kingdom, and the second of which is that the Law Lords felt that the response was not proportionate to the threat that we face from terrorism. Of course, we could debate that at some length, but I feel that, all in all, the decision not to use the courts in the first place was wrong. Therefore, the Law Lords were right to say that the provision to set aside the courts as the first place to take such matters was disproportionate. That is why I tabled the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/3">Since then, we had over the weekend the report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights. It makes some clear recommendations. Without mentioning each one in detail, I wish to refer to paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 that refer, in particular, to the</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/4" class="indent">&quot;lack of prior judicial involvement in orders depriving of liberty&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.675.0/1">The hon. Gentleman refers to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights that, understandably from its point of view, would enhance and entrench the role of the Human Rights Act 1998. However, does he know that Lord Hoffmann, in a postscript to the Rehman case, made the position clear only a couple of years ago? He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.675.0/2" class="indent">&quot;It is not only that the executive has access to special information and expertise in these matters. It is also that such decisions, with serious potential results for the community, require a legitimacy which can be conferred only by entrusting them to persons responsible to the community through the democratic process.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.675.0/3">He then adds that those persons are those</p>
	<p pid="a.675.0/4" class="indent">&quot;whom the people have elected and whom they can remove.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.675.0/5">In other words, Lord Hoffmann clearly contradicts the basis upon which the Joint Committee is proceeding.</p>

	<p pid="a.675.1/1">The hon. Gentleman points to only one case in which there is a difference of opinion. I would have thought that the Law Lords and the Joint Committee&mdash;which, I believe, is a parliamentary Committee&mdash;have made judgments with which Lord Hoffmann could be happy. The Joint Committee has made it very clear that the derogating orders that would deprive people of their liberty disregard the convention and our own law. Therefore, they would be illegal.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.1/2">On the limited judicial control of the non-derogating control orders, the Joint Committee has a less strident opinion. Nevertheless, it flags up a sufficient warning that it believes that, even under the non-derogating orders, there would be a case to be taken and the Government would be likely to be found to be acting illegally under our legislation with regard to the European convention on human rights. That is why I hope that later in the debate, it will become clear how the Secretary of State will handle the derogating and non-derogating orders. I hope that in both cases, there is sufficient clarity that primary decisions will lie with the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.1/3">Before I conclude, I want to refer briefly to new clause 1, which, in a sense, is a probing effort to try to consider how we can handle the issue of the sensitive material that has been gathered and has led the Secretary of State to believe that someone should be deprived of his liberty in an extreme case, or have some sort of control order placed upon him. There should be some way in which a suspect's case could be properly considered and he should have the opportunity to mount a defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.1/4">One of the significant things that we must bear in mind was referred to by an article in <i>The Guardian</i> this morning&mdash;I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will not see that as a weakness in my argument. The article was written by Clare Dyer, the newspaper's legal correspondent. She pointed out that the Tipton three, who were held at Guantanamo Bay and released without charge after two years, were detained because the Americans believed that they had a video showing them with Osama bin Laden in 2000. However, if the three men had known that at an early stage, they would have been able to prove that one of them was working in an electrical store in the United Kingdom at the time and the other two were in trouble with the police. The situation could thus have been cleared up quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.1/5">There must be a process by which evidence can be considered and suspects can have the opportunity to clear their names. I envisage a court of terrorism control with between three and six judges who could consider evidence and decide, on their own initiative, the procedures that would be needed to allow the suspects to defend themselves. They could then decide whether the application made by the Secretary of State was correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.1/6">As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State will be the prosecutor, judge and jury in the first instance for both types of order. We already know that thanks to the pressure from the House of Commons, the Home Secretary is now minded to make it absolutely clear that a judge will make decisions in cases when people would be deprived of liberty, and that there will be a different and stronger procedure for non-derogating orders&mdash;although as a layman, I am not entirely clear about how that would work. When the Secretary of State speaks, it would be helpful if he would let me know that judges will have a primary role with regard to both types of order, because I would then be able to withdraw my amendment. I am currently waiting in hopeful expectation that he will be able to agree in principle with the points made in my amendments to clause 1 and in new clause 1.</p>

	<p pid="a.676.0/1">May I first apologise to hon. Members and you, Sir Michael, if I erred by writing to the party leaders and putting the letter in the Library of the House? I took that course of action for a simple reason: I felt that I had reached a set of preliminary conclusions following the views expressed in the House last week and subsequent conversations. I thought that it would help today's discussion if I tried to set out clearly where we were, rather than not revealing that until a later stage of the debate. If I have created confusion and caused a problem with the consideration of the Bill, I apologise to the Committee and you, Sir Michael.</p>

	<p pid="a.676.1/1">I thank the Home Secretary for his apology. The letter seems to imply that he has decided clearly how he wishes to amend the Bill, but the obvious complaint is that he has decided not to put the relevant amendments before the Committee for discussion today. Of course they will need drafting, but I cannot imagine that that would take days and days with a little late-night work. Will he explain why he has not put the amendments before the Committee? Why could he not do so this evening, if we were prepared to continue after 10 pm? Why could we not consider them on Wednesday, because if the official Opposition were prepared to give up their Supply day, the Leader of the House could make the necessary business statement to allow us to do that. Given the complexity of the matter, it is unsatisfactory for the Home Secretary to outline what he has decided to do&mdash;the parliamentary draftsman have probably already drafted the measures&mdash;yet for us not to be able to read the amendments so that we can have a serious, sensible and   detailed discussion about them of the kind that should take place in the Committee, if it is to have a scrutinising function.</p>

	<p pid="a.677.0/1">There are two reasons why I have taken the course of action that I have taken. The first is that I finally resolved this morning what to write in the letter, which is why it came over to the House at about half-past 12. It is a preliminary set of conclusions, which I thought I should make available before we discussed the situation further. The fact is that we do not have the detailed amendments in draft to put before the Committee today, and they will not be available today.</p>
	<p pid="a.677.0/2">The second reason is that I want, and I think the Committee should want, to hear the debate that we are about to have so that we are clear about the place from which a wide range of Members argue their particular points of view. That is why I have taken this course of action. As I said, the alternative open to me was to say nothing other than at the end of the discussion on the various groups of amendments. I thought that that would not be the right way to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="a.678.1/1">The procedure is important because it is the only instrument by which the Opposition can debate a Bill. By advancing in a letter an amendment that is not part of the marshalled amendments and was not taken into account when the six-hour limit was set, the Home Secretary places the Committee in a difficult position. I do not deny him the good motive that he wants the House of Commons to know what he is thinking, but what he is thinking and writing about is not before the Committee as part of the Bill or the amendments. It is just a piece of paper that contains his thoughts. We in the Opposition&mdash;what he does in the Government, only he can speak for&mdash;can only discuss what is in the Bill and what has been chosen to be discussed on the marshalled list of amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.678.1/2">We have six hours in which to discuss a page and a half of amendments on the selection list. The amendment set out in the letter is the latest addition, but it is unofficial. Of course, we listen to the Home Secretary with the greatest of care&mdash;he is a Secretary of State&mdash;but we are supposed to take it on good faith that he will give us adequate time when the Bill returns from the House of Lords. The history of the Government suggests that we will get one, two or three hours maximum to discuss Lords amendments.

	<p pid="a.679.3/1">No, I shall make a bit of progress before I give way again.</p>
	<p pid="a.679.3/2">On Second Reading, I undertook to look carefully at the cases that had been made to achieve judicial involvement in the order-making process at the earliest possible stage, in line with the considerations put forward by many in the House. I stated that my first consideration would be the security of the nation, and I retain the view that the proposals in the Bill are the best ones. I am strengthened in that view by some senior judicial opinion. I cite, for example, Lord Donaldson&mdash;a former Master of the Rolls and one of the highest people in the country on the civil side of the law&mdash;who said on the radio this morning:</p>
	<p pid="a.679.3/3" class="indent">&quot;I don't agree with the idea of involving the judges at the initial stage. It's never been the case. It would involve them forming a view and expressing a view as to the correctness of the order before they'd even heard the person who was affected by it. Furthermore, there would be a change in people's perception of what a judge was.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.679.3/4">He concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.679.3/5" class="indent">&quot;A judge is the referee or umpire; he's not a player.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.679.3/6">I state that to indicate that there are serious and senior judges in this country who are of the view that it would be better to remain as we are proposing in the Bill rather than to make the changes that I propose. I nevertheless take the view that it is right to make the changes that I suggest for reasons which I shall state.</p>

	<p pid="a.679.4/1">That is not the interpretation that I put on Lord Donaldson's words. On the contrary, the interpretation that I place on them is that, as we said on Second Reading, the judiciary would be most reluctant to be sullied with a process involving them that falls short of proper judicial procedure. The ball is in the Government's court to provide a process that comes as close to proper judicial procedure as possible. It is possible to do that if the Home Secretary allows for a proper procedure under which the judge can hear the other side before determining any order.</p>

	<p pid="a.680.0/1">I was not seeking to interpret Lord Donaldson; I was quoting him exactly&mdash;I used his precise words. The hon. Gentleman does not understand the critical point, which must be understood, that the Bill covers territory in which we cannot prosecute successfully, and that some people threaten the security of the country through terrorism. That is the territory, and I share the view, which is held on both sides of the House, that we should minimise the number of people who are in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.680.0/2">That is why I say, let us strengthen the paths to prosecution, and that is also why I say, let us bring cases through the courts&mdash;earlier, I mentioned the case of Mr. Badat&mdash;where we can do so. However, I also assert that we are not in that position in a very small number of cases, where the issue is whether we simply allow such people to operate unchallenged or whether we challenge them. Lord Donaldson is saying that judges are not best involved in that small area, which is his argument, not mine.</p>

	<p pid="a.680.1/1">Is not the key issue, on which we touched on Second Reading, why the Home Secretary finds it necessary to take a power where he can be woken at 2 am to direct immediately that a person should be subject to a control order, when, as we have discussed before, if the police believe that a person poses an imminent threat, they already have 14-day detention powers under terrorism legislation, which is ample time in which to bring an inter partes hearing before a judge to determine whether an order should be made?</p>

	<p pid="a.680.2/1">I accept that point, which is why I have set out the proposals for change in my letter. I believe it desirable that we achieve a position in which legislation on the statute book is supported by as broad a range of opinion in this House as we can possibly achieve. I cited Lord Donaldson, who, I believe, is not the only senior judge to take that view, because we are making a change that the judges themselves may not believe to be the best course of action from their point of view.</p>

	<p pid="a.680.3/3">and he has gone on at some length about his interpretation of Lord Donaldson's words. Given the huge controversy that surrounds the implications of what he is doing, he needs consensus and support, but the way in which he is handling the matter is ensuring that he gets as little consensus and support as possible. He should urgently review how he is dealing with the matter in the Committee.</p>

I particularly remain unpersuaded of his argument that the Attorney-General would be an adequate check and balance on the way in which the Government carried out the powers. I fully take my right hon. Friend's point that a number of judges will be very unhappy about the idea of the deprivation of liberty of the citizen without charge, without conviction and without trial.

Secondly, the Home Secretary will have to justify before the House each and every aspect of the control orders that he seeks. If he can persuade us that each and every one of them is required, he will have our support, but the difficulty is that his past utterances have not suggested to us that some of the control orders are justified at all. Why, if the right hon.

	<p pid="a.684.2/1">My hon. Friend the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety will do that later on. However, I can say in summary that it is not our intention to allow the Secretary of State not to disclose exculpatory material to the controlled person or the special advocate. Our intention in the paragraph to which the hon. Gentleman refers is to replicate the substance of the SIAC procedure, so that the court directs the Secretary of State to serve closed material that is sensitive and where there could be vulnerability to the suspect. After the Secretary of State's objection has been heard in closed session, the Secretary of State is able to withdraw that evidence, and if he does so he is not required to disclose it. The Security Service already has the practice of disclosing any exculpatory material, and that will continue.</p>

	<p pid="a.685.1/1">On a point of order, Sir Michael. I apologise to the Committee and to the Home Secretary for interrupting him while he is trying to explain something. However, the longer his speech goes on, the more unsatisfactory the process is revealed to be. We are trying to discuss a huge infringement of the liberty of the individual, on the back of a letter and without any of the amendments or rules of procedure that the Home Secretary seeks to explain. I congratulate him on wanting to explain, but what are the procedures of the House for? That is not just a boring lawyer's point. How can those procedures be properly protected when the Home Secretary can destroy the whole purpose of the Committee stage by coming to the Chamber with a letter to the shadow Home Secretary and making a speech that is wholly unconnected with the fabric of the Bill as presented by the Government? We are being expected to swallow that hook, line and sinker. Surely some control should be placed on a Secretary of State and Government who ride roughshod over the House's proper discussion procedures.</p>

The judge would look at all the material on which the application was based and decide whether there was a prima facie case. If so, he or she would make the order. The order would be subject to automatic referral to the full court for an inter partes hearing, with a special advocate representing the interests of the subject of the order in closed sessions, as currently provided in the Bill. The order could be renewed on application by the Secretary of State following a further inter partes hearing.

Why can he not, even at this late stage, table amendments that this House, the elected House of Commons, could discuss on Wednesday? He could have had his Bill debated with good will and in good order, within the Government's own allotted time, if only he had given us a little more time and treated the House with a little more courtesy. I am sure that it is not his intention to be contemptuous of the House, but that is the effect of the way in which he is proceeding. Will he not concede that?</p>

	<p pid="a.687.2/1">I thank the Home Secretary for giving way. My question is relevant to the procedure. He has described the process in which a Home Secretary or his representatives would go before a judge and seek an order in relation to a prima facie case. Will he make it clear whether, in seeking such an order, it would be sufficient for the judge to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that the person posed a threat to public safety, or would he have to be satisfied that there was an imminent threat to security that justified depriving that person of his liberty? Will a judge considering an application for such an order have as full a hearing as he is ever going to be allowed to have? Will he be able to see all the material on which the Home Secretary and the Security Service are basing their application, and will he have the opportunity to challenge it or to listen to an advocate challenging it? Will the Home Secretary give the Committee a fuller explanation of what is to happen at that preliminary stage of an application for a prima facie order? He might simply be introducing a rather routine procedure before going back to what he proposed in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="a.687.3/1">The first thing to emphasise is that my proposal will be that there be a full hearing at the stage after the prima facie stage. At that full hearing, which will be intra partes, it will be both possible and the reality that the judge will be able to look at all the evidence, either in closed session or open session, and that there will be a position in which the advocates of both sides will be able to make their points in court in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.687.3/2">Opposition Members have raised questions about the detained person. That point has been well covered before in this discussion. It remains my strong view that the special advocate process in these arrangements in front of the High Court is an appropriate procedure to follow in those circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.687.4/1">Am I to understand that at the prima facie stage there will be no hearing? At that stage, will the judge have the material that is being relied on, and will the judge have to be satisfied that a threat exists, or merely satisfied that there are grounds for suspicion?</p>

	<p pid="a.688.2/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman has understood correctly that the detained person will be represented by a special advocate in those circumstances, and it will be the special advocate who can interrogate on the issues before the court. I know that for the right hon. and learned Gentleman this is a disqualifying position. If the defendant himself cannot take instructions, from his point of view no control order should operate. He believes there should be no such legal process in such circumstances: his position is clear. Given the balance between security and liberty, he and I differ on how we should proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.688.2/2">There is an argument to be had, and the right hon. and learned Gentleman will vote accordingly. I believe, and I think the country generally believes, that when there is a reasonable belief that an individual will commit a terrorist act and that we can prevent that from happening, we should do so. That is not the right hon. and learned Gentleman's position, but it is mine.</p>

	<p pid="a.688.3/1">The Home Secretary can only have agreed to make what some of us regard as concessions in relation to derogating orders because he accepts the principle urged on him by Members on all sides that in matters of deprivation of liberty, a judge should be responsible for making the decision that has that effect. If he accepts that principle in relation to derogating orders, why should he not accept it in relation to non-derogating orders?</p>

	<p pid="a.688.4/1">I am coming to that. I find myself in some difficulty: I am trying to give way as much as possible while also making progress. I think I will act on that stimulus, and make my next three points about changes in the position before responding in detail to the question asked by the right hon. and learned Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.688.4/2">I set out in the letter, and now set out for the Committee's benefit, three respects in which we intend to change the procedures for non-derogating control orders in what I consider to be a significant and substantial way. First, we propose that when an appeal is made against a non-derogating order by an individual who wishes to do so, a limit should be set on the time before which it can go to a judge. The criticism has been made that if there were no time limit, no judicial review could take place effectively and definitely. I am saying that we should make the first concession in this context, and provide for a time limit. That is important from the point of view of those who fear that people under non-derogating orders may never have their case heard by a judge&mdash;and, incidentally, it refutes the view of those who say that there is no proper legal process in this regard.</p>

	<p pid="a.689.1/1">I will in a second&mdash;to my right hon. Friend in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.689.1/2">The second issue relates to prosecutions. Let me repeat that, as a matter of practice as well as of policy, prosecution should remain our first option, and the prospect of bringing such a prosecution should remain under review even when a control order has been imposed. I am exploring with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service how we might best include that in the Bill. I intend to place an obligation on the police&mdash;in consultation with the prosecution authorities when that is appropriate&mdash;to keep under review the prospect of a prosecution in respect of any individual who is made subject to a control order.</p>
	<p pid="a.689.1/3">My officials are working on those points now, so that the necessary amendments can be made to the Bill at Committee stage in the Lords.

	<p pid="a.689.2/1">I hope that we will be able to explore the latter point if we ever get to that part of the Bill, but I wonder whether my right hon. Friend can pick up one small but important point. He talked about a time limit for referral to judicial review on the non-derogating orders. Whatever the other arguments, is he able to say what he has in mind for that time limit? Would it be, say, 14 days, for example?</p>

	<p pid="a.689.3/1">Fourteen days may well be a reasonable time scale. One is thinking about a 14 to 28-day period. It is of that order. It requires a little more discussion with the CPS authorities and so on, but it is that kind of time scale that we are describing.</p>

	<p pid="a.689.4/1">On a point of order, Sir Michael. We have just heard the Home Secretary say, I thought quite categorically, that there would be a time scale for the referrals for judicial review.

Indeed, his final point goes to the root of his concession. He has been asked by Members in all parts of the Committee whether he will hand over the power that he is seeking as Home Secretary to deprive someone of their liberty to a judge who, upon application from him, can then deprive someone of their liberty. According to the Home Secretary, all that the judge will have to be satisfied of at this first stage is that there is a case to answer. That is not in fact a full transfer of the decision. What troubles many of us is that a British subject or a foreigner&mdash;we cannot discriminate&mdash;should not be deprived of his liberty by the order of the Home Secretary, unless the latter can satisfy a judge through what is an admittedly closed judicial process that there is at least, on the balance of probability, a need now to deprive that individual of his liberty. With great respect to the Home Secretary, all that he is doing is putting in a minor check before the process proceeds to an inter-parte hearing, which, he says, will provide the substantial protection at a later stage.</p>

Why should there be a different procedure? Why can we not have full and thorough oversight by a judge in all circumstances, and in respect of all the evidence relating to non-derogating orders?</p>

	<p pid="a.692.3/1">Does the Home Secretary accept that, as I mentioned on Second Reading, one of the biggest problems is the question of whether a person detained in such circumstances would have the right to habeas corpus? It is crystal clear that the decision taken by the House of Lords during the second world war in the case of Liversidge <i>v.</i> Anderson has since been completely overridden by subsequent decisions taken by the Lords and others. The Home Secretary knows about whom I am talking. Will he state unequivocally now that there will be no interference with the right of habeas corpus, bearing in mind that habeas corpus was still available during the second world war under emergency powers?</p>

	<p pid="a.692.4/2">I come now to the question&mdash;which a number of Members have genuinely raised&mdash;of why I have sought to differentiate between cases involving a deprivation of liberty and those that do not. I begin by acknowledging that all control orders will impose greater or lesser restrictions on individuals' activities and movements. They could interfere with convention rights such as the right to respect for private and family life&mdash;article 8&mdash;freedom of expression&mdash;article 10&mdash;and freedom of assembly and association&mdash;article 11. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. It is also clear that interference with those rights is permissible under the convention, provided that it is justified by a legitimate aim and is proportionate. It does not involve a derogation from the ECHR and it is not the same as a &quot;deprivation of liberty&quot;. Restrictions on freedom of movement, freedom to choose residence and freedom to leave a country do not fall within the concept of &quot;deprivation of liberty&quot;&mdash;not as set out by me, but as set out in the European convention to which this country has rightly signed up.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.4/3">What is necessary for deprivation of liberty to take place? It is about the extent to which a person's physical liberty is curtailed; it must be of a degree and intensity sufficient to justify a conclusion that liberty has been deprived and not merely restricted. I put it to all Members with all the powers at my command that this distinction between a restriction of liberty and a deprivation of liberty is a real and important one&mdash;it is not simply trivial in regard to these issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.693.0/1">We hear what the Home Secretary says, which is, indeed, enshrined in an unsigned and unattributed document that can be found in the Vote Office&mdash;&quot;A Note on Non-Derogating Control Orders&quot;. It describes deprivation of liberty as &quot;a technical term&quot; from the outset and at the end draws a distinction between liberty being deprived and liberty being restricted. May I ask the Home Secretary where on earth that distinction can be found in the European convention on human rights, or, indeed, in any other legal authority known in this country?</p>

Friend the Member for Thurrock was that there is, indeed, equality of concern between any restriction of liberty that might arise&mdash;I am afraid that I simply cannot accept that. There is a distinction between a particular restriction and what amounts to a deprivation of liberty under the European convention. My point, which I make powerfully, is that it is legitimate under that convention to restrict liberty, provided it is justified by a legitimate aim and provided it is proportionate.</p>

	<p pid="a.693.4/2" class="indent">&quot;It is the case that a combination of measures&mdash;not specifically provided for in the designated derogation order&mdash;could amount to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 ECHR.

	<p pid="a.693.4/3">I can understand the distinction, but a package of measures could be susceptible to attack in court if we had not derogated. However, what would be the position down the road if we had derogated from the ECHR and in a non-derogated case a package of measures were, taken together, extremely restrictive? Could the individual still apply to the court, or would the court say that the UK had now derogated?</p>

	<p pid="a.693.5/1">It is a good question and the position that would arise is clear. It would be open to anyone who had an interest in that particular case to argue that the procedures under derogation applied to the package of non-derogated rights in those circumstances and it would move over. That is to say, the police, the security services or the Home Secretary would not be acting legally if they put forward a package of measures that added up to deprivation under the procedures set out for non-derogated rights. I believe that that makes it clear.</p>

If we do not achieve a proper balance, we are not doing our job as Members of Parliament. I accept, of course, my right hon. Friend's integrity, but if there is a distinction between depriving someone of liberty and restricting it, and if we are going to restrict a person's liberty, why not allow the usual court procedures to apply to those circumstances? That would surely allow the Home Secretary to gain far more support for what he is trying to achieve. I simply cannot see any reason&mdash;I doubt whether the other place will either&mdash;to grant such a distinction.</p>

	<p pid="a.694.1/1">Perhaps I have not been clear enough in setting out my case. I appreciate what my hon. Friend said about my integrity in these matters. There is a range of circumstances surrounding restrictions of liberty, and the restrictions are exercised by various authorities. To provide an example, there are currently warrants authorised by the Home Secretary that allow people's telephone conversations to be listened to under a certain procedure that is clearly set out and approved by the House. Does that amount to a restriction of the liberty of the person whose phone is being listened to? I would say that it does. If a police officer locks someone up in a cell for a while for causing an affray, that is also clearly a restriction of liberty.</p>

	<p pid="a.694.6/1">I have to say that I disagree entirely with the distinction that the Home Secretary has attempted to draw. Although listening into someone's telephone calls may interfere with their right to privacy, it does not interfere with their liberty. Liberty is about a person's ability to go about their lawful business without interference. One need reflect only on the powers that the Home Secretary is arrogating to himself in clause 1 to see that there are numerous powers that interfere with a person's ability to go about their lawful business&mdash;and some of them do so in a potentially very unpleasant fashion, which I would certainly equate with a clear deprivation or infringement of their liberty. I cannot understand the argument that these should be subject to a different category of test before the courts. The Home Secretary has so far produced no rational justification for doing so.</p>

Moreover, having acted wrongly, he would be overruled by a judge on appeal and the case would then have to be referred immediately, under the derogating procedure, to the higher level judicial authority set out in the proposal. That is a clear guarantee to meet the sort of concern that my hon. and learned Friend is raising.</p>

	<p pid="a.696.4/1">The difficulty is that the liberty of the subject will already have been taken away by Executive order and the victim could only appeal. The Home Secretary accepts that taking away someone's liberty under a clause 2 order should be done only by a judge. What is the difference?</p>

	<p pid="a.696.5/1">There is a major difference, which I tried to set out earlier. Let me be clear about whether non-derogating control orders deprive someone of liberty. Derogating obligations must be set out in designated derogation orders. There must be an order to allow the whole process to take place and it must be approved by the House and the other place. It will be clear from the designated derogation order what may be permitted in the derogating control order. The derogating control order before the House and the other place must set out what might be permitted in the derogating control order. If those measures were imposed, the derogated control order procedure would have to be followed and is set out in my proposals. If the other measures were not in the designated control order and amounted to deprivation of liberty, they would be unlawful and would be quashed.</p>

	<p pid="a.697.0/1">I accept that entirely, but a judge must be asked to consider an application to take someone's liberty away under clause 2 and, if it is unlawful, he will not grant it. Why does not the same apply under clause 1? It would be unlawful if my right hon. Friend made an order under clause 1 that deprived someone of liberty, but the subject would be locked up and could appeal. If the Home Secretary had to apply to a judge first, the judge would not grant the order if it was unlawful.</p>

My right hon. Friend then argued&mdash;if I have correctly understood him&mdash;that, despite that distinction, the processes in both cases should be the same. I do not accept that point because the key argument that I heard for the involvement of a judge at the initial stage related to the deprivation of liberty. The argument was that, whether it involved house arrest or detention of some other kind, deprivation of liberty was such a serious matter that it could not be left in the hands of a Minister, but had to be put before a judge. I have, reluctantly, accepted that argument, which was made by my right hon. Friend and others, but I do not think that that argument applies to cases in which the subject will not be deprived of his liberty.</p>

That is common ground between us. We then come to the issue of prevention, which is at the core of this discussion, and the range of considerations that have to be taken into account.

	<p pid="a.699.5/1">Let me take the context that is given in the note that I provided earlier. In the case of Rehman, Lord Hope set out the position clearly. He concluded:</p>

	<p pid="a.699.6/1">I wonder whether the Home Secretary has fully understood the position. If he has not, it may explain some of his difficulty. It has always been accepted in English law that the Home Secretary has a residual Executive right to deport aliens. That is one of the reasons those deportation rights have remained, even if qualified by the Human Rights Act 1998. However, we are not now talking about deportation or dealing with aliens: we are talking about the rights of British subjects to live in peace and be subject to pains and penalties only by due process of law. We are moving into uncharted waters because the Home Secretary says that he wishes to introduce a completely new system of imposing pains and penalties on individuals without due process of law. The argument that he has just put forward about deportation is irrelevant, because we must consider how best&mdash;in the circumstances that the Home Secretary has put forward&mdash;we can protect the liberty of the individual. The Committee's overwhelming view is that that can be best done by having a judicial process.</p>

For example, a person's ability to work could be restricted by orders relating to the use of the internet.

Friend's point about the qualitative difference, but we must proceed on the assumption that any deprivation of rights should not be subject to the arbitrary decision of the Home Secretary. My right hon. Friend has sensibly conceded the change in relation to locking people up. It is reasonable to assume that the people who need to be locked up are the most dangerous of the categories being dealt with, so we find it difficult to understand why he is not prepared to use the same procedure for those who are less dangerous.</p>

	<p pid="a.701.2/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend, as his intervention allows me to set out clearly the reasons for the argument that the Home Secretary is not unlimited in what he or she can do on these measures. First, the Bill itself makes it clear that a control order can impose only obligations that the Secretary of State considers &quot;necessary&quot; for preventing or restricting further involvement of the individual in terrorism related activities. That is a substantial restriction. Secondly, the Secretary of State is required by section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to act compatibly with the convention rights of the individual and his family. It would be unlawful for the Secretary of State to impose restrictions that breached their convention rights. Moreover, the courts would quash an order that did so. Interferences with private and family life, association and communication will have to be expressly justified in each case by a specific aim permitted by the convention&mdash;in this case, we are talking about national security&mdash;and will also have to be proportionate to that end. The Secretary of State will have to weigh up very carefully in each case whether measures can be imposed that are consistent with convention rights. Finally, the Secretary of State's decision may be appealed to judicial review in the ways that I have indicated. More generally, we are proposing a complicated set of procedures whereby the Secretary of State has to report to the House on the way in which the control order regime is operating.</p>

Friend will weigh up those things incredibly carefully, but may I return him to what my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> said? By the time somebody who was put under a combination of control orders that individually were restrictions but collectively could amount to deprivation of liberty could question that, it would be a bit late. By that stage, they might be unable to talk to people or to move around. All they could do would be to appeal on judicial review. There is no automaticity in that. In my right hon. Friend's first proposal, he suggested that a court should automatically check what the Home Secretary was doing, so why in this proposal is there not even automaticity?</p>

My hon. Friend's concern that there would be some process of slide, whereby a combination of non-derogated deprivations that added up to a derogation would slip past the courts and procedures, is simply wrong.</p>

	<p pid="a.703.5/1">Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I think that we are dealing with a matter of order and not just of the content of the debate. For about an hour and a half, the Home Secretary has carried out something of a tour de force, discussing and debating with every member of the Committee the concessions that he is trying to make, but he has illustrated the dangers of not following the normal procedures by just making a speech at large about what the Bill will be like when it has been amended and the type of issue that will then be thrown up. Having listened for an hour and a half, I am partially persuaded on some points, although not on others. Like other Members, I can think of a whole raft of amendments that I should now like to table to clarify some of those points&mdash;although I would be helped if I could first see what the Government were proposing.</p>
	<p pid="a.703.5/2">This is a chaotic way of proceeding. For most of the last two hours nothing has been said that bears any relation to the selection of amendments before us. With respect, Sir Michael, I repeat the request that we have a brief adjournment or suspension of the sitting to consider how best to proceed. Perhaps the Leader of the House might be tempted from 50 yd away, where he is no doubt watching these proceedings on screen, to come to the Chamber and suggest how we might proceed. If we now revert to the first selection of amendments, Sir Michael, and you call Members to make speeches and remotely try to keep to the rules of order, you will have to rule most of the speakers out of order as soon as they start dilating on half the things that the Home Secretary has just told us. That underlines why we have normal procedures&mdash;</p>

I am obviously also aware that many other amendments follow on from that tabled by the hon. Gentleman&mdash; including some tabled by myself and my hon. Friends, and indeed, in some cases, signed up to by Members on both sides of the House&mdash;that provide different ways and mechanisms for doing that. Perhaps I can just say in passing, to avoid having to return to it, that new clause 6, which comes at the tail end of the group&mdash;I am very grateful to Justice for proposing it in such short order&mdash;provides a mechanism that would allow a possible way forward by providing such a system.

Will he ask us to divide the Committee on new clause 6? It is clearly not only a matter that needs to be spoken about, but a public expression of opinion received.</p>

	<p pid="a.704.4/1">I have some slight doubt about whether we will reach new clause 6 to put it to the vote, but it certainly struck me that it is the closest that we have come to finding a sensible mechanism if we are to pursue a line of discussion about setting up a sensible framework for judges to make decisions about whether control orders should be imposed.</p>

	<p pid="a.705.0/1">Given that the Human Rights Act is on the statute book, I think that it were well that the Committee should seek to comply with it.

	<p pid="a.705.1/1">The hon. Gentleman draws the Committee's attention to new clause 6, in the name of the shadow Home Secretary. It is a proposal for control orders for a person who</p>

	<p pid="a.705.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is slightly jumping the gun. We are considering the Bill in Committee. In theory, we are supposed to be moving amendments for consideration by the Committee, so that it may consider them. There are some perfectly valid arguments and points to be made about using a different standard of proof from the criminal standard of proof, although for the purposes of debate, I certainly share Justice's view that the idea of starting with the criminal standard is a good one. I am also mindful of the right hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="a.705.2/2">One of our problems is that the debate in Committee has been completely corrupted: instead of our having the opportunity for informed debate on individual points, which is what I should have liked, it has been hijacked and we must move on to the rather different problem of evaluating the comments made by the hon. Member for Bridgend against the proposals made by the Home Secretary in his lengthy speech. It is to that issue that I shall now turn, but before doing so, I reiterate for the benefit of   <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/851" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> that as we are starting with a model that is not necessarily word for word what we want, it struck me when I considered the various amendments that Justice's ideas merited careful scrutiny, and I flag that up in case we ever, which I rather doubt, have an opportunity to return to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.705.2/3">I now turn to what the Home Secretary had to say. The nub of his argument is that although he has conceded, compared with his position last week, that there are arguments for the sort of mechanisms that the hon. Member for Bridgend wants for control orders that require derogation, he can see no reason or purpose for having them in cases that do not require derogation. As I hope was clear from my interventions, I find the Home Secretary's argument completely unsustainable, and I wish to take just a few minutes of the Committee's time to explain why.</p>
	<p pid="a.705.2/4">First, I return to the comment that I made to the Home Secretary originally that elicited his remark that he was being patronised by lawyers. I certainly apologise to him; I had no intention of patronising him&mdash;rather, I thought that as Home Secretary, he would probably have access to a great deal of sound legal advice and opinion. However, I did not understand the point that he made. He had called in aid Lord Hope's comments in a case called Rehman in which he said that in deportation cases it was appropriate that the Home Secretary, rather than a judge, should make the decision when the wider national interest had to be considered. I suppose that, to an extent, the Home Secretary linked that to the comments that Lord Donaldson made earlier today, when he expressed some reservations about judges being the principal participants in the process of control orders that the Government wish to take up.</p>
	<p pid="a.705.2/5">I wish to make two points about those comments. First, if Lord Hope was referring only to deportation&mdash;I have to tell the right hon. Gentleman that I think that he was&mdash;that is clearly different from a process whereby the Home Secretary decides to take powers not to deal with aliens by deporting them, which has long been accepted in this country as one of the very few Executive powers to deprive people of their liberty that the Home Secretary has, but to translate that into a completely new field, irrespective of whether it applies to foreigners or British citizens, where the Home Secretary, by Executive fiat, deprives individuals of liberty. I believe that the two things are entirely different in principle. The truth is that we are moving into completely uncharted waters.</p>

	<p pid="a.706.1/1">The hon. Lady is right, and of course, I accept that the end result of the deportation process is not that people are permanently deprived of their liberty, but that they deported. So the two things do not have equivalence, but we in this country have always accepted&mdash;certainly, until the Human Rights Act began to bite&mdash;that the Home Secretary has powers to detain aliens, pending their deportation, subject to judicial scrutiny and safeguards. We are not talking about that; we are talking about, at worst, a system of Executive detention, and at best, a parallel system of justice with control orders based, most regrettably, on secrecy, on the inability of a defendant to be given the full facts that he must answer, and on a person being subject to a variety of constraints that would previously have been totally unknown in our law.

	<p pid="a.706.2/2" class="indent">&quot;the whole concept of a standard of proof is not particularly helpful in a case such as the present . . . It is a question of evaluation and judgment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.706.2/3">He was talking specifically not about the kind of case on which he was sitting in judgment, but about whether we move to a new standard of proof.</p>

	<p pid="a.707.0/1">I understand what Lord Hope was saying, but he was saying it with specific reference to the only circumstances in which the problem arose: deportation cases. We are not talking about deportation cases. Indeed, the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen, who is no longer in his place, rightly identified one of the new procedure's basic problems, which is that the ordinary standards of proof&mdash;whether proof beyond reasonable doubt, so that people are sure to the criminal standard, or on the balance of probabilities&mdash;have fairly marginal relevance, arguably, to the sort of procedure that we will be asking judges to carry out.</p>
	<p pid="a.707.0/2">That is why I say to the Home Secretary that I have little doubt that Lord Donaldson's anxieties and distaste for this procedure, and perhaps slight desire to pass it back to the Executive, have their origin in not wishing to see the judiciary sullied by interference in a procedure that does not meet the ordinary norms of justice. That is   a very big problem, and one that we will have to grapple with.</p>

	<p pid="a.707.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the problem with the Home Secretary's argument about the difference between derogating and non-derogating orders, as evidenced this afternoon, is that he seems to be telling us that we must let the penalty rather than the principle decide the process? Although the Bill will go to the other place, we are in danger of creating legislation in which those who are seen by the Home Secretary to be the greatest threat to the security of the state will have the greatest judicial protection, while those who are deemed to be a lesser threat to the state will have a lesser degree of judicial protection. That is a crazy system if the Home Secretary is serious about the fact that he will make the decisions about who is or is not dangerous to the state.</p>

	<p pid="a.707.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point, and I shall try to come to that issue directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.707.2/2">If the Home Secretary can justify each and every control order that he seeks&mdash;not just the general overarching principle; it is the detail that matters&mdash;we must accept that we are setting up a novel and parallel system of justice that is thoroughly imperfect in terms of the rights of the person who is accused. As I said on Second Reading, when my colleagues first floated to me, as a lawyer, the idea of judges taking such decisions, I found that rather distasteful. It seemed to me to undermine the way in which I expect justice to be done. However, on reconsidering the matter, I have absolutely no doubt&mdash;the view seems to be shared by many Members&mdash;that if we really have to go do down this unpleasant and unsatisfactory road, it is much better that judges take the decisions. That will at least provide some protection for the individual and a sense of reassurance that he has been treated fairly.</p>

	<p pid="a.707.3/1">May I put two points to the hon. Gentleman, and perhaps take him into the wider debate? It is not right to say that we have never had these powers before in this country in recent years&mdash;we have. We had them in Northern Ireland with internment, and a lot of bad messages came from that. Thousands of people were involved, and there was no judicial process. Similarly, there is no judicial process with exclusion orders. I have increasingly taken the view in recent years that because of the nature of the threat now&mdash;I will very much welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments on this&mdash;we should perhaps move towards what we seem to be moving towards anyway. I refer to an inquisitorial system of justice for the narrow area of terrorism. We are bringing judges into the process, and the reason why this problem is not faced in Europe is that people are locked up there while judges decide. That may be what we are deciding now.</p>

	<p pid="a.708.0/1">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but I think that we are mixing two different issues. There is the perfectly valid argument&mdash;one that we have been pushing&mdash;that we need to review our criminal procedures to see whether it might be possible to bring suspected terrorists to trial more easily in view of some of the evidential problems that surround successfully prosecuting them. We have made proposals to the Government about that. We have said, &quot;Allow intercept evidence, and have an examining judge collate the material.&quot; However, we have not gone down the road of having an inquisitorial process, as in France.</p>
	<p pid="a.708.0/2">I have the pleasure of being half French. I am familiar with France, speak the language and have ample opportunity to see how the French judicial system operates in practice. It has many flaws, and they are flaws that I would not wish to see reproduced in this country. That is one of the reasons why I believe our common law system to be superior.</p>

	<p pid="a.708.1/1">I agree very much with the hon. Gentleman; I would not want the French system here. However, on the narrow issue of terrorism, I wonder whether we could consider something that might work here with rather more controls than they have in France. Let us remember that they do it rather better elsewhere in Europe. Otherwise we will end up with a system of judges simply deciding the process, and not the whole court procedure.</p>

	<p pid="a.708.2/1">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but we are at risk of straying from the subject matter of the Bill. I wish that this were part of the debate, but it is not. All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that I believe that there is a way of trying to move in that direction without getting rid of the common law protections, and we have put that to the Government in debate on a number of occasions. Unfortunately, our proposal has not been taken up.</p>
	<p pid="a.708.2/2">The suggestion made on Second Reading that France was very different because it effectively had Executive detention, with investigating magistrates able to lock people up for ever and a day, is a bit of a calumny on the French system. Although it allows for quite lengthy detention, that still has to be part of a procedure leading to court. If the procedure does not lead to court because there is not the evidence, no amount of investigation can justify detaining someone.</p>

	<p pid="a.709.0/1">I appreciate that my hon. Friend does not want to linger on this point for too long, but has not <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1240" name="Clive Soley">the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Soley)</phrase> made the point that Lord Donaldson was frightened of this morning? Lord Donaldson does not want judges to descend into becoming advocates for one cause or another. He wants judges to remain impartial, disinterested referees or umpires, to use his words. We do not want judges to become advocates on behalf of the Government, MI5 or whoever it might be. Their role is to make sure that the Government do not apply unfair evidential or other tests to the detriment of an individual who should have his fair day in court. If we stand for anything, that is what we also stand for.</p>

	<p pid="a.709.1/1">I agree with my hon. and learned Friend. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham made that point powerfully and provoked the Home Secretary into saying, &quot;On that basis, control orders are anathema to you.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.709.1/2">To say that I dislike the control orders proposed by the Home Secretary is a serious understatement. I find them disgusting&mdash;there is no other way of describing it. However, I have to face up to the fact that the Government may be able to argue that however repellent and disgusting the orders may be, it is necessary to have a procedure for detaining people without the normal due process of law. The question that we must consider is, what is the best way of doing that, granted all the many imperfections? Although I understand that judges may not wish to participate in such a process, the opportunity for a judge at least to evaluate the evidence presented offers a better degree of protection than the Home Secretary doing it himself. That will be subject to many caveats, and we need to consider the detail in the rest of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.709.2/1">My hon. Friend is making an extremely important speech and I share his distaste. I am delighted by what he has said so far. Does he agree that we would have more confidence in the Government's case if some of the people released from Guantanamo Bay were now facing trial on charges and if we thought that the people who will be released from Belmarsh in due course would also face future judicial action? Is it not remarkable that none of the people who were arrested on suspicion can face trial for any offence at all? I thought we had strengthened the anti-terrorist laws.</p>

	<p pid="a.709.3/1">My right hon. Friend is right to suggest that the Government have still not found a way of bringing to trial the people against whom they claim that they have massive intelligence information implicating them in terrorism. That is a serious issue, and it returns me to the comments made by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush.</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/2">The issue that we must consider is whether judges should make the orders only in cases in which there is a derogation from the European convention on human rights or in all circumstances. On that issue, I found the Home Secretary's arguments incomprehensible. I could not understand why, having conceded that it was necessary for judges to become involved where there was derogation, that was not necessary or could not be done where there was no derogation. There was no coherence whatever in that argument. Indeed, there are compelling reasons for saying that the interferences with the liberty of the individual that are implicit and explicit in the various powers for which clause 1 provides are such that a judge should be required to make an evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="a.710.0/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that I agree with much of what he is saying. Was he as surprised as me that one of the Home Secretary's arguments was the fact that he would be in possession of more information that would be likely to be of evidential value than a judge? If that is the case, does it not suggest that the whole judicial review process is likely to be flawed, given that matters on which the Home Secretary relies will not be relayed to a court?</p>

	<p pid="a.710.1/1">I entirely agree. The hon. Gentleman might recall that in an intervention on the Home Secretary, I pointed out my puzzlement that the schedule to the Bill seemed to provide that the Home Secretary could be privy to information during the proceedings that he would not have to disclose to the judge, even though it might be relevant. He then said that the provision could perhaps be better worded and that an amendment might be tabled at some stage in the Bill's passage.</p>
	<p pid="a.710.1/2">Let us be quite clear that as the Bill is drafted, the Secretary of State is not required to disclose information if he does not propose to rely on it during proceedings. That is remarkable, because I had imagined that if proceedings were to be held in front of a judge, he would be given all necessary information to decide whether the Home Secretary's application for a control order was justified. I do not think that the security of the state would be completely jeopardised if a judge were made privy to such information. Indeed, on a new Home Secretary's first day of work, he will be called upon to make orders on the advice of his officials, with no experience of the background situation in the Department. It is thus a little far fetched to suggest that the Home Secretary is privy to a magical understanding of what the security of the state requires that no one else may have.</p>
	<p pid="a.710.1/3">We shall have to return to a further argument that the Home Secretary put forward at a later stage of the Bill's passage&mdash;or at some point, anyway, because we will not have a later stage. The Home Secretary will need to act quickly. He conceded that in the case of a derogating order, which is presumably the situation in which he must act fastest, he would go to a judge. In the case of a non-derogating order, however, I do not understand why he would need to exercise an Executive function from his bed at 2.30 am when the matter could be taken to a judge at that time. Furthermore, as I have said to the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety&mdash;I hope that she will respond to this point at some stage&mdash;given that existing terrorist legislation allows the police to detain and interview people for up to 14 days if they suspect that a terrorist offence has been committed, I do not understand why the Bill needs to give Executive power for immediate detention to the Home Secretary instead of to the police in the usual way. The police would then decide with the Home Secretary that if no prosecution could be brought, an order should be applied for in the ordinary way.</p>

	<p pid="a.711.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 relate to an ongoing investigation of someone who is involved in the preparation, committal or instigation of an offence? As control orders are preventive measures, consideration can be given to not only what has happened, but what might happen in the context of the threat as a whole. A different process of decision making will be used from that which applies when people are arrested on the basis that they have already committed an offence. This point goes to the heart of the matter. The hon. Gentleman is talking about a justice system that examines things after they have happened, but control orders are designed to deal with not only what has happened, but what might happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.711.1/1">I do not think that I agree with the Minister. When the suspected terrorists were flown back from Guantanamo Bay, instead of coming off the plane and going into the bosom of their families, they were detained by the police, presumably to ascertain whether they had committed offences. After being interviewed, they were released. It beggars belief for the Minister to suggest that if people were suspected of serious involvement in terrorism, there would not be grounds on which the police could arrest them to ascertain whether criminal offences had been committed. I find it impossible to accept that, so I hope that the Minister will clarify her remarks because the situation seems very strange.</p>
	<p pid="a.711.1/2">The problem might be that the Government, in their typical fashion, have tried to over-egg the pudding. The Secretary of State has put his case to the world through the media by saying that he needs the power because he might have to make an immediate on-the-spot decision in the middle of the night that could have important consequences for protecting people from an immediate threat of violence. I think the Minister would agree that under that test, the police would have ample grounds to intervene immediately.</p>

	<p pid="a.711.2/1">Is not the absurdity of the Government's position starker than that? I have telephoned judges at all hours of the day and in the dead of night to get a civil injunction to prevent a newspaper from publishing a potentially defamatory article. It cannot be suggested that a judge would be disturbed by receiving a telephone call from the Home Secretary's advocate to say, &quot;I'd like a control order, please.&quot; If a judge will grant a civil order to ban the immediate publication of a newspaper article, he will not jib one jot at being woken up to make a control order.</p>

	<p pid="a.711.3/1">My hon. and learned Friend is right: there is absolutely no reason why a judge would not do that. However, I am making the point that given the police's powers of detention, there might be no need whatever for ex parte orders. There will be 14 days to establish an inter partes hearing, so the Minister's anxiety has little validity.</p>
	<p pid="a.711.3/2">I want to allow other hon. Members to speak, so I shall bring my remarks to a close. We must face the fact that on any rational analysis, the proposals are seriously flawed. The Secretary of State made the distinction between major infringements of a subject's liberty and minor infringements. It is true that major infringements might be more reprehensible, unless they can be justified, but none of the infringements of a person's liberty proposed in clause 1 should be tolerated unless there are sound and persuasive reasons for doing so. The Committee must face the fact that the Bill is a long-term measure. I fear that such procedures and processes will be in place for years, which makes them entirely different from those in place during the second world war for the detention of enemy aliens, or even the unusual application on certain British subjects under regulation 18B.</p>
	<p pid="a.711.3/3">I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to my points at some stage. No coherent argument has been made for rejecting the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Bridgend. If the Committee wishes to persuade the Government that from the beginning judges must make control orders, irrespective of whether they are derogating or non-derogating orders, the sensible thing to do is to vote for the amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will press the amendment to a Division because such an expression of the Committee's opinion would be the best mechanism to present an alternative to the process that the Home Secretary proposes. The Home Secretary tries to persuade us that his proposal is acceptable, but I disagree. He has not made the case for his proposal. Indeed, by making his concession, for which we are grateful, he has gone a long way towards conceding the validity of the case that the hon. Member for Bridgend made.</p>

	<p pid="a.712.0/1">It was said a long time ago this afternoon that the letter circulated by the Home Secretary rendered a number of the amendments otiose.

I rejoice in the fact that my amendments are otiose. That is welcome news.</p>

I have never come across an amendment tabled by a Back Bencher about which a Minister could not find a reason to argue that it was defective. Indeed, one of my regrets from my period as Foreign Secretary was that we had few pieces of legislation and I did not have adequate opportunity to tell Back Benchers that their amendments were defective. Nevertheless, it would have been a better way of proceeding had the Home Secretary accepted my amendment, or one of the other amendments, and tidied it up in the other place so that when we depart from this place at the end of the day we would at least know what words we had agreed to, rather than expecting them to come back from the House of Lords in a week or two's time.</p>

Gentleman brought his remarks to a point of consensus in his conclusion.On the other matter, of course it is technically possible to have a business statement at any time in our proceedings, although it is rather late in the day for us to start all over again. The difficulty is that we are taking the Committee proceedings and the Report stage at one sitting. Had we separated those two, it would have been entirely possible for the Home Secretary, as he has sought to do today, to respond to the feeling expressed in Committee, to give the assurances that he has given, and to introduce the text for us to consider on Report, rather than doing that in the House of Lords.</p>

First, it is vital that we retain the separation of powers between the Executive and the courts. Any decision on the deprivation of liberty of the citizen should be a matter of judicial process rather than a political judgment. After all, it is our best protection against the arbitrary use of power by the Executive to ensure that any infringement of the liberty of a subject should be a matter of due legal process.</p>
	<p pid="a.713.1/3">Secondly, the Home Secretary is the wrong person to exercise this particular power. My right hon. Friend said today, as he has said a number of times, that it is the Home Secretary who has responsibility for safeguarding the security of the nation. I would not argue with that&mdash;it is a perfectly fair statement&mdash;but it is precisely that consideration that makes him the wrong person to apply the control orders. The decision must necessarily be a balancing act between the evidence of a threat and the right to the liberty of the citizen. The place to put that balancing act to the test is in the courts. It should not be inside the Home Secretary's private office.</p>

	<p pid="a.713.2/1">Only one thing concerns me about what the right hon. Gentleman said both on the &quot;Today&quot; programme and now. Although I understand where he is coming from, does he accept that he is effectively repudiating the history of the best part of 100 years&mdash;including the ruling by Lord Hoffmann in the Rehman case recently&mdash;in which the Home Secretary is assumed to have knowledge, experience and judgment which are, in the view of eminent jurists, including Members of the House of Lords, preferable to those of the courts? That was clearly stated in a House of Lords case only a couple of years ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.714.0/1">My broad political ideology does not preclude me from saying that something that has been done for 100 years might possibly be wrong. On the specific issue, however, I have grave anxieties about the argument that the Home Secretary should have access to information to which the rest of us and the courts do not have access. I would be very reluctant indeed to go down the line of depriving a citizen of liberty on the grounds that the Home Secretary's information is not known to the rest of us, particularly in the light of our experience in this Parliament of the case for the war against Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.714.6/1">No, I am not. There are good grounds for having an argument about what the disclosure rules and procedures should be when the matter comes before a court, but we must first get a case to court. If the decisions are taken inside the Home Office, there is little chance of the suspect having an opportunity to dispose of the matter of which he is accused.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.6/2">This is not an ad hominem point. If my right hon. Friend were Home Secretary for life, I might be slightly more relaxed about the powers, but he will not be. Other people will become Home Secretary. It is theoretically possible that it may even be someone from another party. [Hon. Members: &quot;Oh.&quot;] I am seeking to find a point of consensus without becoming controversial. The serious point is that we are giving powers not to my right hon. Friend as an individual, but to his post, and I do not think that they sit readily with his post.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.6/3">I said that there were three reasons why my right hon. Friend is to be congratulated on his decision to accept the principle of my amendment. The third is that I worry gravely that the powers, in particular the power of house arrest, could be counterproductive in the fight against terrorism. Over the weekend, we heard of the new plans for the Maze prison now that it is to be demolished. It is, perhaps, appropriate to remember that internment was abolished not so much because of concern about civil liberties, but because it was proving counterproductive in the fight against terrorism. It was much more successful in provoking sympathy for the IRA than it was in assisting the police in combating terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.6/4">Let us be frank. We all know that the control orders are most likely to be applied against citizens of Britain who are British Muslims. Those of us who have been in contact with that community know perfectly well the alienation and disaffection that has been caused among many young British Muslims by the way in which current powers under the prevention of terrorism legislation have been used. We need all the communities of Britain to work with us to ensure that we defeat the common enemy of terrorism, and we need all members of the British society to believe that they are allies in that fight and that none of them is a suspect because they belong to any one particular community.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.6/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1004" name="Lynne Jones">the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase> anticipated my point. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has accepted the logic of the argument in relation to clause 2, but that argument applies with almost equal force to clause 1. I congratulate him on a bravura performance of stamina at the Dispatch Box. It is perhaps a pity that the Oscar ceremony took place last night and his performance cannot be considered for an award. I feel a certain sense of guilt, in that I tempted him into accepting my amendment to clause 2, thereby creating some of the difficulty in arguments that he has had in relation to clause 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.6/6">Listening to how the debate unfolded in the hour and a half when my right hon. Friend was at the Dispatch Box, however, it was impossible to avoid the point that the only distinction that could be made was a matter of degree, not a matter of principle. Indeed, he relied not on a qualitative argument, but on a quantitative argument. I am not sure that that adequately justifies adopting a different procedure for the two different forms of control order. Indeed, the restrictions on liberty in clause 1 are severe. They enable the Home Secretary to specify where the citizen will work, to whom the citizen will talk, where the citizen will stay, who visits him there and where he can travel to within the United Kingdom. We are talking not about where he can travel by leaving the UK, but specifically about where he can travel in the UK. Those are very grave restrictions on liberty. My right hon. Friend might be wise in the light of this afternoon's experience to tell the Committee before we conclude our business that he will reflect on the arguments that have been put to him and consider ways in which they can be brought into the text of the Bill before proceedings are completed in both Chambers.</p>

	<p pid="a.715.0/1">Would it not be useful for the Home Secretary to bear in mind the fact that those of us who recognise the shortcomings and think that such a proposal could be counterproductive, but accept control orders for the reasons that we have explained, nevertheless feel very strongly&mdash;no less than Members who are opposed to the measures&mdash;that the matter of who is to be subjected to a control order should be initiated by the court? Clearly, the vast majority of Labour MPs on listening to the debate would certainly agree. If the Home Secretary is to concede, as he must do next door, he should do so earlier and to the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="a.716.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a perfectly fair point with which I would entirely concur. It is notable that we have now been debating this matter for the past four hours and that, apart from the Minister who has spoken from the Dispatch Box, no Member has put in a favourable word for the material before us.</p>

	<p pid="a.716.1/1">Like the Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend is a lay person; I am a lawyer. The Home Secretary seems to be putting forward a lawyer's argument that deprivation of liberty is a technical term that appears in article 5 of the European convention on human rights. However, if my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> went into a pub in Livingston&mdash;or if I went into a pub in Wolverhampton&mdash;and said that the Home Secretary had placed restrictions on an individual so that he could not go to work, speak to his wife, or use his mobile phone or computer, and that where he could travel in the United Kingdom was limited, he would find that the average lay person would think that that was deprivation of liberty.</p>

	<p pid="a.716.2/1">I suspect that my hon. Friend accurately reflects what might be described as the public house commonsense view of the matter. I would add, though, that I would be cautious about accepting the idea of a lawyer's point of view. In my experience, there is no one single point of view that can be expressed as a lawyer's point of view. Indeed, one can usually find a lawyer to support any possible point of view. I very much doubt whether every lawyer will accept the distinction that we have heard made from the Dispatch Box today, and I would not be at all surprised, should this Bill reach the statute book and be implemented, if we found them arguing in the courts that the restrictions on liberty under clause 1 also require a derogation every bit as much as those under clause 2. I am conscious of the fact that a large number of Members wish to speak, so I shall conclude.</p>
	<p pid="a.716.2/2">I mentioned that it has been striking how few voices have been raised in favour of the contents of the measure. One of the main reasons for that is that the places around the world where we find legislation parallel with what we are debating are not comfortable. I heard on BBC radio yesterday the chief of staff of F. W. de Klerk justifying the measure before us. That was not advice that I wished to hear or a source that commended the Bill to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.716.2/3">Those of us who have spent much of our political careers condemning countries where it is possible to put citizens under house arrest on the decision of a politician on the basis of secret police evidence have every reason to be concerned about this Bill. I am glad that this afternoon we have been able to take the significant step to remove one of the worst offences of the measure, but I hope that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will reflect on what has been said and enable us to go further in order to remove some of the more offensive aspects of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.717.0/1">I do not intend to speak for very long because many Members want to speak. It has become clear from events this afternoon that what we say in this Chamber is not what will matter in the next 48 hours. That is a frustration for many of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/2">It is difficult to decide whether we are debating a set of clauses or a letter. The clauses in front of us are unacceptable. Even though I welcome some of the measures that have been set out in the letter, the letter is also unacceptable. Therefore, regardless of how one interprets any votes later&mdash;it will be difficult to do so&mdash;for clarity I should say that whether in relation to the clauses or to the new proposals made by the Home Secretary, we will be voting against the measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/3">We debated at length on Second Reading how it was unacceptable for the Home Secretary to give himself so much power to take away the liberties of others. I genuinely welcome his reflection on that and the fact that he has put forward in his letter a different set of proposals. They do not go far enough, but it would be churlish not to acknowledge that. Just as last week he was able to move on the issue of judicial involvement and judicial review, he has made a fundamental leap in recognising that the role of the judge is not to be one of just signing off or reviewing, and that they, rather than politicians, can take the decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/4">I want to flag up a few concerns about what the Home Secretary has proposed in his letter. If it were possible to table amendments to a letter, we would do so. Let us regard our proposals as a postscript to his letter. We hope that we can address them in more detail in another place and that at some point this evening the Minister will respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/5">We have always acknowledged that if a judge were able to take the initial decision, we would have to overcome what I have described as the problem of the Home Secretary getting a call at 2 o'clock in the morning. In his letter, the Home Secretary outlined the way in which he would amend police powers. It is important that we understand more about that process. There is still the critical issue of whether the Home Secretary or the intelligence services would be directing a chief constable and quite how that relationship would work when that call comes through to the Home Secretary. We have acknowledged that, as a mechanism for achieving what we want&mdash;a judge deciding&mdash;there must be something to fill that gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/6">In the letter, the Home Secretary acknowledges that we will be able to move towards a prima facie case within 24 hours. At the right time of day, that period could be shortened; it may well be possible to get through a court process a great deal faster than that. I see no reason why we should not try to move much closer to a point where that takes place almost as soon as the information is brought forward, instead of setting a limit of 24 hours.</p>

	<p pid="a.717.1/1">I am listening with interest to the hon. Gentleman. I do not think that such a problem exists. If we want to get an injunction in the middle of the night to stop a newspaper publishing something, we can do so. The process of warrantry that covers a great deal of the intrusive actions of our various agencies can be undergone in the middle of the night, and indeed often is. Are we making too much of a problem of this? It can be dealt with by a judge at any point of day or night.</p>

	<p pid="a.718.0/1">I would make two points to the shadow Home Secretary. First, I have acknowledged that the police powers to hold individuals for 14 days may not be acceptable. In relation to those current powers, we would be moving towards a definite charge; clearly, in these circumstances, we would not be doing so. Secondly, if we agreed to many of the amendments, we might be talking about judges who are security vetted and of different types. Therefore, it is unlikely that there would be many of them around at the drop of a hat, as there are for a newspaper libel action. However, I accept the right hon. Gentleman's point that we should try to narrow the gap between the Home Secretary seeking emergency powers and the considering of the prima facie case.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.0/2">Another concern, and one at which the Lords will need to look, are the grounds for which a prima facie case can be considered. At the moment, it is suggested that that should be based on &quot;reasonable grounds&quot;. Even though that would be at a very early stage in the process, we are uncomfortable that the grounds should be &quot;reasonable grounds&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.0/3">Thirdly, when will consideration be given in that process to prosecution? On many occasions, the Home Secretary has said that he intends to move to prosecution at an early stage, but could we not consider the prima facie case for prosecution? Under the Home Secretary's proposals, when will the consideration whether to prosecute occur? In our judgment, the sooner that matter is addressed in the Bill, the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.0/4">The Home Secretary's letter is very quiet on the time that it would take to move from the prima facie case to applying for a full control order, and we have received no indication of how long that period would be. A period must clearly be provided to allow cases to be developed, and I would have hoped to receive some indication that we are discussing a not very long period of between seven and 14 days from seeking a prima facie case to moving towards a full control order being applied for and decided by a judge.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.0/5">So far, we have discussed helpful steps in the right direction in relation to the powers of the judge and we seek clarity on how those powers will work. However, issues of fundamental principle also exist, and they mean that we are uncomfortable with the direction in which the Government are heading. Evidence is one such key issue and it is not satisfactory that the Government still intend individuals not to be able to see the evidence against them. At the moment, a special advocate can see such evidence, but they cannot necessarily share the information with the defendant.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.0/6">There must be a way to allow a defendant to argue about matters of fact in such cases. It would be crazy if an individual had a charge put against them, but they were not allowed to know the information, although they had an alibi. We must be able to work through such matter of fact issues to make sure that a gross miscarriage of justice does not occur simply because certain levels of evidence were not considered.</p>

I have never understood why one should not know whether an individual has an alibi because one does not know the day on which they were alleged to have done something. If the special advocate knows the gist of the allegation, why should he not agree a series of questions with the judge to be put to the defendant? He would not have to ask, &quot;What were you doing on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-10">10 March</phrase>?&quot; He could ask, &quot;What were you doing in March?&quot;, and do his best from the individual's diaries.

When the Bill reaches another place, I hope that the Home Secretary will examine ways to achieve that. I disagree with the hon. and learned Lady in saying that such issues should be dealt with in the Bill. The matters of principle must be addressed in some way in the language of the Bill before my hon. Friends and I can support it.</p>

	<p pid="a.720.4/1">My position is not a million miles away from that of the hon. and learned Lady, but Liberal Democrat Members cannot support a Bill as an act of faith or on the basis of a statement from the Minister. We must understand how evidence will be heard within the mechanics of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.720.4/2">I want to discuss some other aspects of the Home Secretary's proposals, and I hope that they will be addressed in another place. On the standard of proof, the different clauses contain different standards of proof, but we cannot understand why different standards of proof are necessary throughout the process. It is possible to move towards higher standards of proof throughout the process, particularly if one is dealing with special courts in which one can achieve a standard of proof without revealing sensitive aspects of the evidence, which is difficult in an ordinary court process.</p>
	<p pid="a.720.4/3">The Home Secretary took a large number of interventions on his justification for having a different set of rules for the higher and lower control orders&mdash;those that derogate and those that do not. Frankly, he was not convincing on that particular issue. I accept that there is a difference between placing someone under house arrest, tagging them, imposing a curfew, prohibiting who someone can see, or preventing someone from working, but in one way or another all those examples concern losses of liberty. If someone were to tell me with whom I can work, where I can travel and whom I can meet, I would regard it as a gross invasion of my liberty.</p>

	<p pid="a.720.5/1">European jurisprudence accepts that those examples are deprivations of liberty, but the courts in Europe sometimes allow such deprivations on the grounds of proportionality or for the protection of national security.

He argued that because one punishment is worse than another, the process of managing that punishment should be different, in which case why do murder and theft both currently go before a court and a judge? The logical conclusion to draw from the Home Secretary's argument is that we should put murder in front of judges, but not bother with theft. Whatever level we are discussing, the principle should be the same whether we are discussing a higher or lower level of taking liberty away.</p>

Had that been the case, we would have felt that the debate had served some purpose, instead of such a concession being dragged out of the Government, kicking and screaming, in the House of Lords. Even if that does not become part of the Bill, it will be challenged sooner or later on legal grounds. I hope that the Home Secretary and the Minister will indicate that they are prepared the keep the door open, so that the same system is in place for a higher and a lower control order.</p>

It is ridiculous that we are voting on a set of clauses that could be thrown in the bin. The issue on which we should be voting is a letter, which of course we cannot amend.

If people are kept in their house, not allowed to go to certain parts of the country and so on, are not those just the people who are more likely to be martyrs to the cause if they have not had a chance to argue their case and show why they should not be subject to that decision?

	<p pid="a.722.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. Having a good system of justice in place is important in its own right, but it has the further important benefit that it does not make people feel that the system is working against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.1/2">In conclusion, we have reluctantly accepted the need for control orders. We have acknowledged that there is a gap&mdash;a procedural problem&mdash;and a way forward must be found. I have acknowledged that the Home Secretary has taken some steps in the right direction, but they are tiny steps, and big leaps are needed in the future for the Liberal Democrats to support the Bill. We will need clarification on whether there is to be a two-tier system of derogation and non-derogation orders. We will need to see a proper system that allows evidence to be heard along the lines that we have discussed, so that the issues of fact can be dealt with. We will need convincing that the Government are serious about considering better standards of proof. Changes are needed to the legislation on acts preparatory to terrorism so that charges can be brought against individuals. There is a long way to go and at this stage we cannot support the Bill, letter, clause or whatever we are debating this evening.</p>

	<p pid="a.722.2/1">I hope not to detain the Committee for long. Having been involved in debates on the prevention of terrorism for about 25 years, I feel that I have built up some knowledge of the subject. One of the few encouraging aspects of the present situation is that we seem to be much more concerned about the legislation than we were before, when the Liberals and the Conservatives would often vote together to keep the prevention of terrorism Act on the statute book.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.2/2">I want to make one point about the past, and I make it to the former Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> as well. Successive Governments, Labour and Tory, renewed legislation in the House, often in overnight debates, and they did so at times when we were locking up several thousand people in internment in a ship in Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland. We excluded people from one part of the United Kingdom to another, again   without judicial intervention, under successive Governments throughout that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.2/3">What we are doing tonight is not essentially different. I do not use that as an argument for supporting the Bill. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> deployed one of the arguments that I used to use&mdash;that we were locking up many innocent people and, in doing so, losing support. But today there is a difference, and things have changed. I am pleased to say that the present situation is not nearly as bad as it was then. In the worst year of the 1980s, we locked up close to 6,000 people, of whom fewer than 1 per cent. were put on trial for anything to do with terrorism. The numbers now are far smaller, and the way in which the powers are used is a credit to the police. If they were used as they   were in the past, I would be appalled at the consequences, particularly for the Islamic population of Britain, who tend to be in the front line on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.2/4">I must say this to the Committee, and I say it carefully: I agree with the Home Secretary that the threat from terrorism is fundamentally different. That does not mean that we should conclude that what we are doing tonight is good. I shall return to that. The threat is fundamentally different, not only for the reasons given by the Home Secretary and others about suicide attacks and so on, but because the problem is so great when a terrorist organisation seeks to kill the largest number possible. Kofi Annan made a very good speech on the subject in London, but unfortunately he made it on the same day as Prince Charles announced his engagement to Camilla, so it got no mention in the press at all. He spoke about the threat of an attack on London, the numbers involved and the impact on the world economy if weapons of mass destruction were used. It was an important speech. He also spoke of the United Nations being a target for those organisations, as people who read the transcripts from al-Jazeera and other stations will know. The problem is fundamentally different.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.2/5">My issue with the Bill is the same as everyone else's. I do not believe that anyone in the House, including the Home Secretary, is happy about taking such powers. I propose a slightly different way forward. If the amendments being discussed are taken a little further, they will apparently satisfy the Liberals and may satisfy the Conservatives. We should not be content with that. We cannot continue with a situation that has gone on for 20 or 30 years, whereby we try to deal with terrorism in a way that is not suited to the British judicial system. That was the point of my intervention on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.2/6">Let me make it clear that I do not like what the French do, but it is important to understand that the French system is not the only one in Europe. Importantly, the Europeans deal with terrorism by locking people up for long periods without putting them on trial straight away, but they have a judicial system for doing that. The reason, as I understand it&mdash;I am not a lawyer&mdash;is that the inquisitorial system allows them to investigate the possibility of proceeding with a case, whereas the British system, which is adversarial, requires two people to be put up, one on either side, which leads to the very problem that my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> expressed so powerfully&mdash;it makes it impossible to take evidence in the normal way in a British court. However we dress this up, we will not be able to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.2/7">I have great confidence in the Home Secretary, who really does work hard on these issues to move them forward. That is one of the reasons why I will support him tonight. I also think that we need to do something because the threat is very severe. However, I do not want to leave it there. We recognise that we have to do something for the present, but we cannot continue to legislate on terrorism in this way, because we will end up going round this track over and over again. I have heard many of today's arguments before in the past 20 or 30 years. I fear that what will happen is what happened during that period, when the prevention of terrorism Act was renewed every year or every few years and the same debates took place over the same concerns. We must not fall into that trap.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.2/8">I ask the Home Secretary to take the lead in bringing together the political parties represented here to consider a long-term solution to the problem. We should bear it in mind that the United Nations is now recommending that there be an international definition of terrorism. That proposal appeared in the high level panel's report in January and is likely to be accepted. It is also suggesting that it should be dealt with by the International Criminal Court or considered as a crime against humanity. There is potential in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.2/9">We cannot go on with the traditional British way of doing this. It has not worked very well in the past, and it is satisfying no one, including, at present, members of the Government. I should like us to find a way forward and we can do that only if the Government and the major Opposition parties work together to consider our adopting, as I have suggested, a system along the European lines whereby for the very narrow area of terrorism we have an inquisitorial system that allows evidence to be considered before a court. I do not want Britain to have an inquisitorial system generally&mdash;it has many failings, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said&mdash;but we kid ourselves if we think that the common law system provides an answer to the problem that lies at the heart of the Government's difficulties: that is, that the current British system has no way of dealing with a situation where there is enough information on an individual, either from this country or from overseas, to suggest that they might do something that will cost hundreds, if not thousands of lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.2/10">It is that serious and I ask that we try to find a way of producing a longer-term answer than this measure. For the moment, I will vote for it in the hope that the Home Secretary will continue to make concessions and to consider other methods, but even if he makes all the concessions that the Conservatives and the Liberals want, I will remain deeply troubled by this legislation. We cannot leave it here. We have not come up with a solution to this problem in the past 20 or 30 years and we need to take a long, hard look at the way in which we approach it.</p>

	<p pid="a.724.0/1">I agree with some of the reservations expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1240" name="Clive Soley">the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Soley)</phrase>, but I hope that he does not end up simply voting for what we have got because he thinks that it is absolutely necessary. It is crucial that we spend the next few days or weeks&mdash;however long we have&mdash;trying to put adequate precautions into this legislation. I agree with him that the problem of how we deal with protecting the public against terrorism while protecting the essential values of our society and the freedom of the citizen is a critical matter to which we will have to return.</p>
	<p pid="a.724.0/2">The Home Secretary began his appeal to the Committee by reminding us of the extremely serious threat that we face from terrorists in this country and stating that there were some cases that could not be proceeded with by an ordinary criminal prosecution in the ordinary process of the courts. Last week, he implied that many of his critics did not accept either of those points, so for the avoidance of doubt I should say that I agree strongly with both of them. We obviously face a very imminent terrorist threat. It is the duty of the Home Secretary to organise the defence of the country against such threats, and one cannot proceed by an ordinary trial in all cases. But there I pause. If we accept all that, and accept that we have to deal with it, we must make it clear that we must not allow those arguments to induce us to agree to things that we would regret upon careful consideration and which damage our society at the same time as they protect it.</p>
	<p pid="a.724.0/3">We have lived with the terrorist threat for most of the past 20 or 30 years. To be fair, I would be prepared to concede that it has probably got slightly worse, but only because its practitioners now include people who will commit suicide themselves, whereas at least the terrorists of the IRA and the Angry Brigade tried to escape from the scene of the crime. Nevertheless, we have had to protect this country against many dreadful terrorist outrages&mdash;they were no small-scale incidents. In the time that I have been in this House, there has been a bomb in Westminster Hall. Colleagues and Members of this House have been killed by terrorists. We have seen big spectaculars. We can argue about who carried out particular attacks, but there is no doubt that Irish terrorist bombs killed a lot of young people in a packed space in a pub in Birmingham and a lot of people in a pub in Guildford. There have been the outrages at the Old Bailey and the Grand hotel, Brighton. Serious terrorism is not new to this country&mdash;it is not something of which we first became aware after 9/11 in the United States, although that outrage was even worse than anything that we had experienced.</p>
	<p pid="a.724.0/4">As a result, we have sought to take precautions. The danger is that we will be tempted to keep going ever further out of a sense of fear and a spirit of revenge against those who perpetrated the last outrage. Fear is no guide to judgment whatsoever. The Home Secretary was not doing it today, but whenever I see, as I sometimes do, the Government resorting to trying to whip up fear of terrorism to take us into measures that we would not otherwise contemplate, we should all beware of going down that path.</p>
	<p pid="a.724.0/5">I entirely accept that there are occasions on which one cannot have an ordinary prosecution&mdash;for example, where one is not quite sure what the man has done, let alone able to prove the crime that he has committed, or where one is not quite sure what he is planning, but has very good reason to believe that he is planning some major outrage and has to protect against it. There are also cases where one cannot have a jury because it will be intimidated and threatened, where one cannot let the man see witnesses because they will be intimidated and threatened, and where one cannot let the accused person see all the evidence because, if one has got the right man, he will discover the one thing that he wants to know&mdash;exactly how one found out what he was planning, which would be of great assistance thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.724.0/6">I recognise all those difficulties, which we have had to face in the past. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush was, again, right to say that we have been doing this for 20 years. When I was Home Secretary, and when the worst had passed and we were not interning thousands of people, the Labour party had the present Prime Minister as its shadow home affairs spokesman. I seem to recall&mdash;I do not think that he ducked out of it&mdash;that he led for his party in its vehement objection every year to the renewal of the prevention of terrorism Act on the grounds that exclusion orders were non-judicial, that they had no evidence behind them and that we had a draconian security process.</p>
	<p pid="a.724.0/7">I mention that not in order to turn this into a partisan debate&mdash;which the Home Secretary had stopped doing, although he was obviously doing it in his public performances last week&mdash;but to remind the Committee how matters can slip and where we can be taken if every time a Government come back to this House with prevention of terrorism measures we are persuaded by the exigencies of the moment to give up yet one more protection and to go one step further. That is why I decided, when I heard about this Bill and when the Home Secretary made his statement, that we were taking a big leap by suddenly giving the Home Secretary&mdash;a Minister; a member of the Executive&mdash;the power to deprive a British citizen of his liberty and not making that a judicial action by an independent judge or member of the judiciary through some constrained judicial process. I am glad to say that we seem to be making some progress in pulling back from that, but we have to pull back a whole lot further, because this is a very important step.</p>
	<p pid="a.724.0/8">I am tempted to say that, looking back over the years, some of the silliest pieces of advice that I was ever given urged me to do certain things on the grounds of security, protection of the national interest and prevention of terrorism. The second most silly have been on the grounds of health and safety: the blood is made to chill in the face of what might happen if one does not take some essential step. One has to count to 10 and say that the step is basically stupid, illiberal, unacceptable and disproportionate and that, if this society does not stop giving and receiving such advice, we must fear where we end up.</p>

	<p pid="a.726.0/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman has occupied the important position of Home Secretary. Does he have any reflections on the fallibility or infallibility of advice from security services?</p>

	<p pid="a.726.1/1">It is a convention of politics that Ministers always heap praise on their officials, which they do not always reciprocate. In particular, it is a convention that praise is heaped on the security services by all and sundry. I accept that we have excellent security services&mdash;they are essential and do a valuable job. However, I will go no further than to say that I do not believe that they are infallible. They are virtually unaccountable now, even though attempts are made to make them accountable.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/2">One of my predecessors, the late Roy Jenkins, strongly advised me early in my term of office to keep an eye on what those people were doing, because I would never find out what they were really up to. I will say no more on that. Any Home Secretary who uncritically and unquestioningly takes the advice of the security services runs a risk on those occasional moments when they make a mistake or advise him to do something foolish.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/3">There is a danger in our system of politics, which I have seen, that senior politicians and senior officials who have access to an exciting and hidden world of security will get carried away with their excitement. They can sometimes become vulnerable to advice to do things that, with hindsight, are not altogether wise. However, if I am not careful, that will get me back into discussions that we had last year about a war with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase>&mdash;the former Foreign Secretary&mdash;who is sitting next to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/838" name="Tam Dalyell">the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell)</phrase>, and others. However, the idea that the public often have&mdash;that if the security services and the police demand something, it is unpatriotic for the House of Commons to refuse it&mdash;would be dangerous for us to accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/4">I am worried about what we might slip into. My concerns are up to date and pertinent. Let us remember the position of the people who were in Belmarsh. The previous Home Secretary was completely satisfied&mdash;and, let us face it, so was the House of Commons, because we did not really make a challenge&mdash;that those people were so dangerous that they had to be incarcerated in the most secure prison that could be found in the United Kingdom for an indefinite period. Where are we now? The same people are to be let out and not pursued under the legislation. It is open to us to say that perhaps the original judgment cannot have been made as confidently as we were led to believe it was made at the time. Let us beware allowing misjudgments to enter into our deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/5">Let us not be carried away by the concessions that are being hinted at and sketched out in exciting terms. I express my genuine gratitude to the Home Secretary for moving. He has come forward with explanations of judicial process, and I agree with the former Foreign Secretary, the right hon. Member for Livingston that the Home Secretary laid on a quite remarkable performance of an hour and a half, taking on all-comers in his usual combative way, wading through the rather thin paragraphs of his letter and trying to persuade hon. Members that he was on the way to an altogether more civil liberties-conscious solution. I am not wholly persuaded, however, that that will take us to where we want to go, unless we are careful.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/6">The Home Secretary did not come to the House because he had genuinely changed his mind. He made it clear that he preferred the position from which he had started. He came here because it dawned on him and his colleagues that they were not going to get their Bill if they did not change it. Last week, I could not understand why they had not realised that. Most people, when they are running at a brick wall, eventually stop. I expressed the opinion in various interviews that the Government did not have the faintest chance of getting the principle through both Houses. The Home Secretary has now seen that. That is what brought him here, but he did not come in a forthcoming mood.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/7">The Home Secretary followed the unfortunate Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety, who was put up to defend the ridiculous programme motion. She knew that the Home Secretary was going to change the Bill. She knew that the letter was being distributed&mdash;at that stage to favoured recipients, but eventually to us all. She also knew that the whole Bill would be rewritten in the House of Lords. However, she explained that we would have only a limited time&mdash;was it seven hours?&mdash;to discuss the whole shooting match, including Committee, Report and Third Reading, before the Bill went off to the House of Lords, when we would discover exactly what it was going to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/8">The Minister gave no reason for that brevity. She did not try to argue, because everything had been decided. To be fair to her&mdash;she is still here to reply to this debate&mdash;she had no discretion to alter anything. The Leader of House, who could have done something, was sitting 50 yd away, refusing to come and take part in the shambles that had broken out on the Floor about the business of the House, which he had organised. The Home Secretary was lurking behind the Chamber.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.728.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" speakername="Kenneth Clarke" colnum="728"  time="019:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-33.htm#50228-33_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.728.1/1">I was touching on the spirit of the concessions. However, I shall return to the Home Secretary's description of the judicial process. I was merely indicating that he did not seem to be an altogether willing and cheerful bearer of good news to the House. We must consider his proposals with particular care.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/2">The Home Secretary made the curious division of orders into two levels: the deprivation of liberty and the restraint of liberty. That struck me as the nearest thing to legal gobbledegook that I have heard in the House since last week, when we first embarked on the whole debate. He plainly did not want to change his proposals, but he realised that he had to for the most serious orders, so they would have a judicial process, although he would not do for the less serious orders, even though both involved exactly the same deprivation of liberty and exactly the same judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/3">It was explained to us why the serious orders could, to a certain extent, be decided by a judge&mdash;I will return to that&mdash;but the less serious ones could not. That is set out in the anonymous document from the Home Office that we received just as we began. The relevant paragraph on the second page, headed &quot;Why should the Secretary of State make non-derogating control orders?&quot;, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Control orders are preventative orders. They are designed to prevent future atrocities from happening&mdash;they are not designed to punish a person for past events.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/5">That is true of all control orders. The serious ones are not based on any crime or past event that one is going to prove, but are preventive. Everything that follows in the document is applicable to all control orders, of all severity. The only reason the Home Secretary has made a concession is because he thinks that the House will get even more excited about locking somebody up than we will about taking their freedom of movement or their mobile phone. He wants to keep the lesser orders to himself.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/6">I suspect that the real reason why the Government have from the start resisted involving a judge at all was because of the obvious objection: that judges have the habit of being more critical and letting people out. There are cases that are not possible to get past a judge. That is why the Government want to avoid a judge; otherwise, it is difficult to see the different judgment that divides the orders horizontally, as it were.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/7">The description of the role given in the document concludes with a sentence that the Home Secretary plainly still believes:</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/8" class="indent">&quot;This is a role which the Secretary of State is best placed to carry out rather than the courts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/9">I simply do not understand that. The intellectual attainment of the average judge is roughly equivalent to that of the average Secretary of State, if not greater. The mastery of detail of the average holder of judicial office is at least equal to that of most people who hold great offices of state. Such decisions are of course a difficult matter of judgment and it is difficult to apply the ordinary burden of proof. However, judges have to deal with matters of judgment all the time&mdash;sometimes quite fine and difficult ones. Judges assess risk and what is necessary, weighing the public interest on the one hand against the need to protect the liberty of the individual on the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/10">Judges will be more conscious of the overriding national interest in its fullest sense, and will be inclined to be a bit more liberal and libertarian than a Home Secretary relying on the advice of the security services. Let us not deceive ourselves&mdash;that is why it is argued that the Secretary of State is more suited to the role than a judge.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/11">My last point deals with determining how we should look at the proposals on cases where a judge has been let in, when we get them. I am not sure how far the judge will be allowed by the proposals to supplant the Home Secretary to any effective extent. Only in the more serious cases is it suggested that the Home Secretary will have to go before a judge and apply for an order. That was always what I argued for: it is the key to the whole Bill. However, it seems that this will involve something like the committal proceedings of the kind that, in cases of ordinary serious crime, take place&mdash;or used to; it very rarely happens in that way now&mdash;before a magistrate prior to the committal to a Crown court. Under the new proposal, subject to the rather weak test set out in the first clause of the Bill, a person will go before the judge in the committal proceedings, which will be ex parte&mdash;that means that the other side will not be present&mdash;in a closed hearing. All that the Home Secretary will have to show to the judge is that there is a case to answer to go on to a full tribunal. Eventually, there will be an inter partes hearing at which the whole thing will be sorted out. I hope that, when we get the wording of the Bill, it will be absolutely clear that the decision to intern will be taken by the judge&mdash;first at the preliminary stage, and finally at the inter partes hearing&mdash;not only after looking at process and at whether the Home Secretary has behaved unreasonably, but after considering the case in the round and being satisfied at both stages that an overriding threat to the national interest is involved, and that the decision to incarcerate or confine the person will be proportionate to the risk that is seriously feared to be about to happen. That is not clear at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/12">There are two other things that the judge should do. Prosecution is to be preferred in all these cases, and there is always a danger that people might not be prosecuted because they might be acquitted. Even the first judge at the committal hearing should have to be persuaded that there is a good argument for the case not following the ordinary process. New clause 6 provides that it should be the duty of that first judge to be satisfied that there is a good reason why the evidence&mdash;or at least a great deal of it&mdash;should not be put before an ordinary process.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/13">The second thing that a judge should decide is how much of the information should be shared not only with the advocate who is going to challenge the evidence in the next court, but with the defendant himself. I shall not repeat what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> said earlier, but she made an extremely good point in this regard. The judge listening to the first hearing could make orders regarding the conduct of the trial. There is no reason why the Home Secretary and his security people should not have to sit down with that judge and decide how much information should be given to the defendant&mdash;and, therefore, his advocate&mdash;by way of a broad description of what he is accused of. They might not be able to tell him what the evidence is&mdash;they certainly would not be able to tell him how they got it&mdash;but he should be allowed to know that he stands accused of colluding with a particular person, planning a particular escapade, or whatever the allegation happened to be. All that needs to be set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/14">I shall not go on because, as I have already said, we are discussing the Bill even though we do not know what it will finally look like. There are far more details to come. When they are drafted, the clauses on these provisions will be quite complex. It is laughable that we are all sitting here waiting for the true Bill to be drawn up and presented to the House of Lords. We all know that the Minister of State will again be put up to tell us that we have only an hour and a half, or two hours, in which to consider the whole shooting match when the Bill comes back to us. This House will be used as a cipher in this way until, one day, it stands up and rejects a programme motion tabled by some Government or another. These motions get more draconian year by year, and the one that we debated earlier&mdash;on the most serious Bill that the House has had to consider during the lifetime of this Parliament&mdash;is one of the silliest that we have ever had. If we are offered two hours in which to consider the Lords amendments, I shall invite the House to reject the programme motion involved, although that will be in the hands of Labour Members. The Government would not fall if the motion were rejected, and if they knew in advance that we were going to reject it, we might get a proper programme motion. There are ways round this problem, and we must have more sensible discussions in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.1/15">Meanwhile, I shall vote for amendment No. 4 if it is pressed to a vote. All that we have is the Bill before us and a selection of amendments. At least amendment No. 4 asserts that we want a proper judicial process. We might as well send the Bill to the House of Lords in a form that slightly more closely represents the true feeling of the vast majority of the people in this House. The original Bill was a disaster, and we might as well make a few changes to it before we send it off to the Lords, where they will start all over again.</p>

	<p pid="a.731.0/1">Many hon. Members have expressed concerns about control orders, so I shall not go into them further. I accept the Home Secretary's powerful case that we face a unique threat from terrorism, although there are degrees of difference because of the potential scale of the outrages that we might face. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> has just said, the terrorists are prepared to kill themselves and are not looking for an exit strategy. That presents us with a different problem from any that we have faced in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.731.0/2">I would say to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary that many of us are prepared to go down the road to control orders, provided that the safeguard of an independent judge making the decision in each case exists. That is fundamental to the way I feel about this issue. I welcome my right hon. Friend's concessions. He has listened carefully to the points that have been put to him about derogating control orders, as we can see from the fact that he is now prepared to have a judge consider such a case in the first instance and quickly thereafter hear the whole case at an inter partes hearing. I welcome that change, which has virtually satisfied me on that aspect of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.731.0/3">However, although the Home Secretary gave a considerable performance in taking so many interventions earlier, he completely failed to convince me that the same process that he now proposes for derogating control orders should not also be used for non-derogating control orders. I simply did not understand his arguments on that issue. The debate would have been greatly shortened if he had been prepared to make a concession on that point as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.731.0/4">We have heard many arguments today about the difference between the restriction of liberty and the deprivation of liberty. As I understand it, the essence of the difference is that with non-derogating control orders, certain restrictions drawn from the list in clause 1(3) will be deemed appropriate to certain individuals. However, if that list grows, we could reach a point at which the restrictions on an individual could constitute a deprivation of their liberty, and the non-derogating order could become a derogating order. A completely different process would then be used. It is difficult to justify a difference of degree&mdash;that is what it would become&mdash;when some restrictions would be imposed under a non-derogating order, but if a few more were imposed, it would become a derogating order. The processes under which the orders would be considered would be completely different. The Home Secretary failed to justify that in his speech.</p>

	<p pid="a.731.1/1">I am impressed by the fact that my hon. Friend is making exactly the same point as that made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> a moment ago. The right hon. and learned Gentleman suggested that the changes had resulted from the Home Secretary recognising that he was running into a brick wall in the House last week. Is not my hon. Friend describing this week's brick wall? It is inevitable that the Home Secretary will have to concede this point and recognise that there is no distinction between derogating and non-derogating control orders. Surely it would therefore be better for him to do so in this Committee now, because he is going to lose this argument in the other place. It would be more satisfactory if we had a chance to scrutinise any new proposals that he is going to make.</p>

	<p pid="a.732.0/1">I very much agree with my hon. Friend. It might not be inevitable&mdash;although it probably is&mdash;that changes will be made in the other place, and I hope that the Home Secretary will listen to his Labour colleagues on this point, for reasons that I shall come to, and on which I hope that he will reflect.</p>
	<p pid="a.732.0/2">The Home Secretary has in some ways worsened the situation, in that the two processes involved in making the orders will now be even wider apart than they are in the Bill as it stands. Not only do we have the complete difference in process that was there before, involving a different burden of proof&mdash;reasonable suspicion in the case of non-derogating orders, and balance of probability in the case of derogating orders&mdash;but there is now a second difference. A judge will now be brought in at the very beginning in the case of a derogating order. Although the note that has been circulated on non-derogating orders says that there is a role for the judiciary on appeal in such cases, and the Home Secretary now says that that should happen within a given period of time, it would of course happen on judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="a.732.0/3">A judge dealing with non-derogating orders will never reach the point of deciding at first instance whether the orders are correct and whether the proposed measures are reasonable. All that a judge can do at judicial review is decide whether the Home Secretary has behaved, at first instance, in a reasonable way&mdash;reasonable in terms of both process and decision following examination of the facts. The process will involve second-guessing the Home Secretary's decision all the time. That is the fundamental difference between the ways in which the two kinds of order, and the judicial roles, will operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.732.0/4">The existence of two processes involving orders that are very similar, and in some instances different only in terms of degree, is a recipe for potential disaster. What if the Home Secretary says that he believes, in a certain case, that the balance of measures under clause 1(3) makes a derogating order necessary? What if that is subjected to due process and reaches the judges, and the judges decide that the balance of measures is wrong? What if they decide that fewer restrictions are appropriate in that specific case? What if that smaller number of measures then becomes the subject of a non-derogating rather than a derogating order? The court will not be able to deal with a non-derogating order. All that the court can do is decide on judicial review whether the Home Secretary was right to impose a non-derogating order&mdash;and in this instance the Home Secretary will not have done so. His initial view will have been that a derogating order was required.</p>
	<p pid="a.732.0/5">I give that example because I think that the existence of two different processes aimed at addressing very similar issues could lead to complications. I hope that the Home Secretary will take it seriously. It is not a tricky example dreamt up for the occasion, but an example of something that could happen, which could slow down and interfere with the process that we are trying to bring about.</p>
	<p pid="a.732.0/6">The Home Secretary has clearly stated that his most important duty is to ensure the security of the nation, and that that is his paramount concern. Today he has presented proposals to change the way in which derogated orders are made, and to involve a judge from the outset. Presumably he now believes that that is appropriate. Presumably he does not believe that it weakens the legislation or the fight against terrorism in any way. Presumably he would not recommend such an arrangement if he believed that it would do that. If involving a judge in derogating orders at first instance will not weaken the fight against terrorism, why should it weaken the fight against terrorism to involve a judge at first instance in non-derogating orders?</p>
	<p pid="a.732.0/7">If my right hon. Friend cannot convince me on that point, I will find it very difficult to support him&mdash;and I think that that applies to other Labour Members, too. I simply do not see why involving a judge would weaken the legislation. I believe that it would provide the independent scrutiny that many of us want, and would enable us to vote for the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.733.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/906" speakername="Edward Garnier" colnum="733"  time="020:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-34.htm#50228-34_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.733.0/1">I agree with the last point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/734" name="Clive Betts">the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)</phrase>. Before that, however, we heard an important speech from my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, who in the space of 15 or 20 minutes produced a pretty good criticism of the measure before us&mdash;or, at any rate, the measure that we think is before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/2">These proceedings are, of course, entirely absurd. I accept that the Home Secretary came here to do his best to explain his change of mind, or at least a change in the expression of his policy, but I am afraid that that is not good enough. Nor is it good enough for the Minister of State, during her brief speech on the guillotine motion, to fail to mention the Home Secretary's letter to the shadow Home Secretary. Surely it was germane to that debate that the Home Secretary was about to refer in the Chamber to a letter that none of us had seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/3">Having said that, I should add that it is not always best to choose the easiest route. The easiest route is, of course, that chosen by the Home Secretary&mdash;legislating by letter and hoping that no one will notice&mdash;but that simply will not do. It also produces a general lack of public consent for legislation that the House will pass.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/4">We all have to put up with legislation of whose consequences we disapprove. The Government pass tax laws of which those affected do not necessarily approve; they pass all sorts of laws of which we do not necessarily approve. Criminals in the dock clearly disapprove of some of the laws with which they have become entangled. Nevertheless, all of us&mdash;whether or not we support the Government of the day&mdash;consent to legislation, because we broadly approve of the procedures by which it is passed. There is a general unspoken consent to the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/5">That consent is important. Unless people respect the process whereby the law is made, they will not respect the law and will not agree to be bound by it. That is what leads to civil disobedience and a breakdown in our democratic system. I am worried about what will happen if the Home Secretary's proposals, as they appear in the Bill, are passed. What, for goodness sake, are we here to discuss in Committee? We are here to discuss a page and a half of amendments, as they appear on the selection list&mdash;43 pages in the amendment paper. We discover from a letter, however, that the Home Secretary has other plans: he wants the unelected House to have first sight of his new version of the Bill. Why did he make that speech here in Committee? He should have made it on Second Reading&mdash;a new Second Reading. What he has proposed, after all, is a fundamental reconstruction of his Bill and a complete change of policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/6">I realise that in many instances it is inappropriate for everyone to see everything. I have not been involved in an espionage case at the Old Bailey, or in a case in which members of the Security Service have approached the judge with the aim of obtaining a public interest immunity certificate to prevent the defendant or his lawyers from seeing various details of the Crown's case. That happens, however. In espionage cases tried at the Old Bailey, and, no doubt, other important courts, part of the process may take place in camera so that public and press are excluded, or parts of the Crown's case are withheld from the defence. That is not wholly satisfactory, but so that some form of justice that is broadly acceptable can be achieved, the courts permit it, and Parliament has permitted the courts to permit it.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/7">Here, the circumstances are rather different. I have attempted to intervene on the Home Secretary repeatedly to say that his system of legislating by letter is entirely inadequate, but let us consider what he is trying to do. He is telling the Committee that the arrangements for derogated control orders should be different from those for non-derogated control orders. He says that derogated orders should be given the benefit of judicial intervention. He is prepared to go ex parte to a judge, or at least get his representatives to do so, and ask for a quick assessment of whether there is a case for an interim order pending an inter partes hearing at which the Home Secretary's representatives, and, perhaps those of the respondent, will be entitled to appear and present their arguments before the judge.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/8">It may well be that, for reasons of national security or for other reasons, the defence will not be allowed to see all that the judge sees. The judge himself may not be told all that the Home Secretary knows. But&mdash;if we set aside our initial disapproval of control orders&mdash;under the derogated process that we are told will be introduced through legislation by epistle, there will at least be some degree of judicial oversight. What puzzles me, and what has puzzled other Members this afternoon, is that the Home Secretary seems to make a distinction that does not exist&mdash;a distinction between the inconvenience caused to the respondent by a derogating order and the inconvenience caused to him by a non-derogating order.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/9">Non-derogating orders are not confined to the categories set out in clause 1(3). If one goes through the list there, one sees some that may be capable of being non-derogating and some for which, clearly, derogation could be required. However, one is given no guidance in the Secretary of State's speech, his letter or the note that has appeared in the Vote Office which of the control orders in subsection (3) are likely to be non-derogated, which are likely to be derogated and which of those that are non-derogated are, when combined with others, likely to bring them into the category of derogated.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/10">We are not given much comfort. Subsection (3) begins:</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/11" class="indent">&quot;The obligations that may be imposed by a control order on the controlled person include, in particular&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/12">paragraphs (a) to (o)&mdash;but there may be a host of other forms of control order that the Home Secretary has not condescended to tell us about in the Bill, in the schedule, in his letter or in his note. We are left to guess about those. He may have some other ideas that he does not wish to reveal to us today about what could constitute a possible control order.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/13">Just because something is in clause 1 does not mean to say that it is bound to be a non-derogatable order. I think that I heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> claim that only orders under clause 2 would require a derogation from the convention. The implication of his remarks was that those set out in clause 1(3) would not. That is not what the Bill says. The Bill says that the Home Secretary is to be given power to derogate from the convention under clause 2, but in doing that and in finding it necessary to derogate from the convention, he can also draw into his order some, all or many of the powers to be found in subsection (3) of clause 1. Therefore, we should not be fooled into thinking that the sorts of control orders that will require derogation are more heinous or more restrictive of human rights and civil liberties than those that are to be found in clause 1(3). There is a massive absence of clarity both in the process by which these things are to be decided and in the way in which the Bill sets them out.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/14">Take, for example, clause 1(8):</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/15" class="indent">&quot;For the purposes of this Act involvement in terrorism-related activity is any one or more of the following&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/16" class="indent">(a) the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/17">which is fair enough,</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/18" class="indent">&quot;(b) conduct which facilitates the commission, preparation or instigation of such acts, or which is intended to do so&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/19">which is probably fair enough, and</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/20" class="indent">&quot;(c) conduct which gives encouragement to the commission, preparation or instigation of such acts, or which is intended to do so&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/21">The making of a speech by a republican Member of Parliament in this Chamber in support of something that the IRA has done or intended to do during any given period could be seen as</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/22" class="indent">&quot;conduct which gives encouragement to the commission . . . of such acts&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/23">What are those acts? The subsection states that</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/24" class="indent">&quot;for the purposes of this subsection it is immaterial whether the acts of terrorism in question are specific acts of terrorism or acts of terrorism generally.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/25">Therefore, if I were to stand up and speak for the downtrodden masses of some minority in some far-flung country, would I be accused of conduct that supports or assists individuals who are involved in general acts of terrorism? It is simply extraordinary that the Home Secretary should come forward with this sort of legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/26">It seems that if we are to get any clarity about the Government's intentions and the content of the Government's policy, we need to scrap this whole proceeding and start again. It is not good enough for the Home Secretary or his junior Minister to come into this Committee to advocate by letter and by a note to be found in the Vote Office massive changes to the Bill and the policy behind it. Nor is it apt, with such legislation, for a Home Secretary to rely on the House of Lords to be the first recipient of his properly drafted proposal. It must be the case, since the junior Minister must have known about the letter but did not tell us about it, that the Home Secretary has in his room the drafted amendments that he wishes to make to the Bill, but which will be introduced only in the House of Lords. They are in existence, I have no doubt. If they are not, no doubt they will be whipped off some computer between now and the close of business tonight, so that they are ready for the House of Lords tomorrow. It is unreasonable to expect the public to consent to such legislation, whether they approve or disapprove of the behaviour of the people whom the Bill seeks to catch. It is unreasonable to go about changing the law in this way.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/27">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe said far more concisely and with far greater power of oratory and experience what I would like to say on this matter. I hope that those who have a choice, particularly those in the House of Lords, will, when they pick up <i>Hansard</i>, remember to read what he said, even if they do not read what I said, and bear in mind what the shadow Home Secretary said in his answer to the statement by the Home Secretary at the beginning of this process in the early part of last week.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/28">This is a black day for Parliament. If it allows itself to be trodden on by a Government who do this, we might as well all pack up and not worry about the rights of anyone, be they suspected of terrorism or not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.736.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1010" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="736"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-35.htm#50228-35_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.736.0/1">I am pleased to have a chance to take part in the debate, as I have some questions that I want answered about how this process would work.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/2">I welcome the letter, although I regret the procedure that it has plunged us into. It would have been important to see what I imagine will be a long amendment or series of amendments, which should have been debated here. We should have been able to see them, so that we at least knew what we were dealing with. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> said, for many of us, it was our opposition to these types of regimes and measures that got us into politics in the first place. It is not helped when some of us object to the way in which the other place is constituted and feel strongly that, for reasons of democratic accountability, those matters should have been debated here.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/3">Having said that, the letter takes forward some of my concerns about striking a balance. My constituents and, I imagine, quite a number of others are concerned to see security weighed against issues about their right to live free from interference from an authoritarian state. Some people may regard the civil liberties arguments as secondary, but when one has lived in an authoritarian state, as I have, one is as concerned about the operation of the security police as one is sometimes about criminals. It is no light matter, and we must pay careful attention to both sides.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/4">On Second Reading, I intervened on my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on one of the issues that concerned me. There seemed to be quite a muddle in clause 1, with a wide range of powers to deal with a wide range of activities, without the clarity that we would expect for certain activities leading to certain actions by the state carrying certain penalties. Setting out two distinct penalties and two distinct procedures has provided some clarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/5">Let me turn to an issue that I hope will be dealt with in the wind-up. It appears that we still have two different levels of proof: reasonable suspicion and &quot;the balance of probabilities&quot;. It seems strange that different levels of proof are required irrespective of the activities in which such people might have been engaged. If we are to have two penalties, two procedures and two burdens of proof, they should attach to the different levels of activity, which clause 1 also mentions.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/6">Paragraphs (a) to (d) of clause 1(8) provide for a wide range of activities to which such orders could be attached. I hope that the Government will explain which procedure is likely to attach to which activity, and with what levels of burden of proof. Putting someone under house arrest should be considered only in respect of more substantive and serious activities, such as the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism, or conduct that helps somebody so to act. Alternatively, a lesser sanction such as the ordinary control order might attach to assisting in the commission of such acts. Perhaps the Government will also clarify whether a different burden of proof will attach to different levels of activity. I am not happy at the prospect of the Bill's going to the Lords&mdash;assuming that it is given a Third Reading&mdash;with confusion remaining as to how the new provisions will be put into effect. Our constituents will be watching to see in what ways they might trigger such penalties.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/7">I hope that Ministers will reflect carefully on the following point. The one sanction that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary mentioned in talking about the types of orders&mdash;apart from house arrest&mdash;that might be imposed was that relating to mobile phones. There are tyrannies of the left and of the right, and although they start from very different political points, both often lead to similar results. These include the use of house arrest and detention, muddle surrounding the use of judicial procedures and the role of politicians, and major abuses of human rights. As well as major infringements such as house arrest, there can also be minor ones that none the less weigh heavily on the people concerned, and which speak of a highly authoritarian state.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/8">I shall give Ministers one such example to think about that is roughly on a par with the mobile phone example mentioned earlier. A friend of mine who lived in South Africa was subject to such an order. Although the state allowed him to attend his wedding because it was a so-called Christian state that therefore regarded marriage in a church as important, it would not allow him to attend the reception because it was a social gathering. If we introduce control orders, we must be very clear about what we are doing. We must ensure that orders that are intended to provide for constituents' safety and security, and to protect this country from any kind of terrorist attack, do not lead to the petty vindictiveness associated with authoritarian states, and to the imposition of completely unreasonable limitations on people's freedom of movement and ability to go about their ordinary lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/9">In conclusion, I again ask Ministers to clarify whether they intend to make any changes to paragraphs (a) to (d) of clause 1(8), and to explain how such changes might relate to the different types of control orders and the manner of their introduction.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.738.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/787" speakername="William Cash" colnum="738"  time="020:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-35.htm#50228-35_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.738.0/1">Fascinating though this debate has been and important though the contributions have been, there has perhaps been a slight tendency for the Committee to underestimate the danger posed to national security. Much has rightly been said about civil liberty, and I do not doubt for one minute that that issue is of absolute and fundamental importance. However, we are in a somewhat curious position. On the one hand, a state of emergency was declared in the aftermath of the destruction of the twin towers; on the other, we are not actually in a state of war.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/2">In drawing an analogy with the circumstances that gave rise to past examples of detention without trial, one automatically looks back to the first and second world wars. As I said repeatedly in interventions on the Home Secretary during last week's statement and on Second Reading, we should consider the case of Liversidge <i>v.</i> Anderson. I seem to be the only person interested in it, but it is of fundamental importance to our understanding of how such matters should be dealt with. On that occasion, the Home Secretary's function in relation to detention without trial was associated with the words &quot;reasonable cause to believe&quot;. In a time of war, when there was detention without trial, the court in question&mdash;the House of Lords&mdash;overrode the test of reasonableness in favour of the individual. It gave the judgment to the Home Secretary on the grounds that, in the light of the various circumstances, he was best placed to know the intelligence and the danger to the state, and that his function had to predominate.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/3">As I pointed out in interventions, the fact remains that the only dissenting judgment from that of Lord Atkin was unequivocally supported in all subsequent rulings in the House of Lords and in other important cases. It could be said, in the context of the Liversidge <i>v.</i> Anderson case, that the test of reasonableness should not have been overridden and that the House of Lords was wrong on that occasion. That is more or less the basis on which the current legal position stands in respect of wartime circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/4">In other cases, the courts have given, to use the words of one of the academic authorities, &quot;short shrift&quot; in wartime to the individual who has been held in detention without trial, where there was suspicion that that person was involved in activities that were contrary to the interests of the state. Much of our debate so far has tended to gravitate more around the civil liberties issues, which we all acknowledge are of fundamental importance, than around the necessity to secure the interests of the people of this country in a time of emergency.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/5">I have also mentioned the Rehman case, in which the judgment of Lord Hoffmann was unequivocal. It is important to mention Lord Hoffmann in our debate. In the Belmarsh case, it was he who used the most insistent language against the Government. I should like to quote from the Rehman case, where the noble Lord Hoffmann argued that the events of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> in Washington and New York were</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/6" class="indent">&quot;a reminder that in matters of national security, the cost of failure can be high. This seems to me to underline the need for the judicial arm of government to respect the decisions of ministers of the Crown on the question of whether support for terrorist activities in a foreign country constitutes a threat to national security. It is not only that the executive has access to special information and expertise in these matters. It is also that such decisions, with serious potential results for the community, require a legitimacy . . . through the democratic process. If the people are to accept the consequences of such decisions, they must be made by persons whom the people have elected and whom they can remove.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/7">There is, therefore, a certain correlation between what the Home Secretary says and what Lord Hoffmann said in that important judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/8">None of that in any way disposes me to change my view that the manner in which the Bill has been conducted and the outrageous way in which the Government have applied the programme motion to such important debates is disgraceful. I could not support the Government's handling of the Bill in any way, but I have to say that there are a whole string of precedents to demonstrate that, in wartime emergencies, the courts have been reluctant to support civil liberties. As I have said, we are now in a twilight position whereby we live in peacetime, but face emergencies. That poses a curious and difficult dilemma over the balance of judgment between preserving civil liberties and dealing with terrorist activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/9">One matter that has troubled me throughout these proceedings is the tendency to overlook the crucial facet of respect for the law, which the terrorists themselves are disinclined to accept. Some&mdash;Members will know who I am talking about&mdash;are of the persuasion that there is a superior law to the law of this land, so they are not interested in our arguments about civil liberties. For certain people, as I say, there is a higher law than the law of the land. That problem cropped up in the 16th century, when serious questions about treason were connected with political activity. For example, the Jesuits were accused&mdash;many were hung, drawn and quartered&mdash;because they believed that they were pursuing objectives that could be justified as representing a higher religious law. That has dissipated in the interim and we now all subscribe to the rule of law. However, there are those who do not subscribe to our understanding of the rule of law, and that must be taken into account. It scarcely matters what our laws are if some people&mdash;even a tiny minority&mdash;do not subscribe to our rule of law and we end up with civil liberties ahead of the realities with which we could be faced.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/10">In the important case of Conway <i>v.</i> Rimmer some years ago, Lord Pearce said:</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/11" class="indent">&quot;the flame of individual right and justice must burn more palely when it is ringed by the more dramatic light of bombed buildings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/12">We must bear that in mind when considering such important matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/13">The issue at the centre of this debate is that the Government have locked themselves into a dilemma and thrown away the key. The key is the enthusiastic and determined upholding of the Human Rights Act 1998, which put the European convention on human rights into United Kingdom law. Few in the Committee would believe that I am not in favour of maintaining the rights of the individual. Human rights are important; the problem is the framework within which they are put.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/14">The 1998 Act can be overridden by Parliament and in the case of Simms and O'Brien, Lord Hoffmann said unequivocally that if we were to legislate inconsistently, unclearly and ambiguously, contrary to the 1998 Act, we could do so. I tabled a new clause that would have made that crystal clear but, unfortunately, it was not selected. The Government deserve to be severely censured for the way in which this farce has been conducted this afternoon, but the Bill will go to the House of Lords and amendments will be tabled there. It would be sensible to attach to the Bill a preamble stating &quot;notwithstanding the Human Rights Act 1998&quot;. We would then know that we were legislating on our own terms in this House on behalf of the voters of this country, who are more concerned about the balance between liberty and protection of the nation to ensure that they are properly protected. That debate has not yet concluded and it is disgraceful that the Government have prevented the matter from being properly debated this afternoon. Had they tabled amendments&mdash;I believe that they have, at least, been drafted&mdash;we could have had a much more constructive discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/15">The second issue concerns proportionality and discrimination. In the Belmarsh case, eight of the nine distinguished and important judges in the House of Lords made a decision based on the Human Rights Act 1998 and its application to those circumstances. The issue should not be proportionality and discrimination. Leaving aside the 1998 Act for the time being, the issue should be about the proper balance between the liberty of the subject and the safety of subjects. I do not think that we have got to that point properly in these discussions, and I blame the Government for that. They have been besotted with the Human Rights Act 1998 and they have not handled this Bill well, although I appreciate the difficulties involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/16">The real question should be to ensure that we have fair trials for those people who are imprisoned or detained. At the moment, there is no evidence that they would get a fair trial. It is a disgraceful state of affairs if the House of Commons is incapable of coming up with legislation that would guarantee that people had a fair trial on the evidence that could be produced, so that they could be properly prosecuted. Of course that can be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.0/17">I have real problems with the way in which the Bill's passage has been conducted, but I also have real problems with the solution that the Government have provided. I also have considerable difficulties with the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the report it published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-25">25 February</phrase>. The section entitled &quot;The lack of prior judicial involvement in orders depriving of liberty&quot; is based entirely on the Committee's assumption that the whole matter should be conducted within the framework of the ECHR and the 1998 Act. The same was true of the Law Lords' judgment in the Belmarsh case. The Committee will gather that I repudiate that assumption. The danger is that the Bill will be unsustainable and is as likely as not to be overturned by the Law Lords in the application of the 1998 Act. We will have made no further progress, despite this farcical pantomime, in getting the balance right between liberty and security.</p>

	<p pid="a.741.0/1">If the hon. Gentleman does not like the European convention on human rights or the Human Rights Act 1998, will he consider Magna Carta and the Glorious Revolution of 1688? Perhaps they would appeal more to him.</p>

	<p pid="a.741.1/1">I do not think that we need do as the hon. Gentleman suggests, although we have a great attachment&mdash;understandably&mdash;to the idea of Magna Carta. Even more important was what I said to the Home Secretary when I asked him whether habeas corpus would still be applicable after the Bill became law. That is a really important question for today. He gave an unequivocal yes to that question, and I was glad to hear it. In the wartime cases I mentioned earlier, the remedy of habeas corpus was still available, although because of Liversidge <i>v.</i> Anderson it became impossible to apply. I extracted from the Home Secretary this afternoon what I regard as the most important concession&mdash;or perhaps I should say assertion, because I do not want to give the wrong impression. The fact that the Home Secretary said that habeas corpus will still be applicable is fundamental to our proceedings today.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/2">In my intervention on my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, we discussed new clause 6. I cannot give it enthusiastic support because at its very heart, in subsection (8), it states:</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The court shall not impose any obligation under subsection (7) unless it is satisfied that the following conditions apply.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/4">Those conditions include:</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/5" class="indent">&quot;that the obligation is consistent with the defendant's Convention rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1988&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/6">which takes me back to my concern about that Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/7">The application of the Act has resulted in the creation of the Government's current problem. Throughout other jurisdictions in the European community, or the European Union, there are procedures that fall far short of the sort of procedure whereby we are accustomed to preserve the civil liberties of the people of this country, and it is ironic that we are continually being faced down with accusations that we are being anti-European when we make remarks of that kind; in fact, we are really trying to say that the voters of this country should decide on the laws under which they are to be governed, and how they are to be governed, and that we should regulate those laws not by reference to some European nirvana but because we have legislated in the House in accordance with what the voters of this country want.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/8">The reason the proceedings today have been so farcical and are a disgrace to the traditions of the House is that we are still discussing proposals for amendments that are not being put before us and that we are unable to do more than second-guess. They are confused, and adversely affected, by a commitment to a European convention that has created the very problems that we are trying to resolve.</p>

	<p pid="a.742.2/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on having taken steps to put the judge first where, under clause 2, liberty will be taken away and there will be a derogation from the convention to facilitate that. It will now have to be done on application to the court and, overwhelmingly, there will be no Executive detention. That is a hugely important point, and I congratulate my right hon. Friend. If that is contrary to his instincts, as he asserts, his better judgment has certainly won the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.2/2">That provokes a question that has been raised repeatedly: if that system is good enough for the higher level, why is not it good enough for the lower level of taking away liberty? I want to make a point that has not yet, I think, been made. The Home Secretary has made it clear that he has no intention of derogating. Consequently clause 2, on which the concession is made, will not come into effect, so although the concession is important it is only academic, because he will not derogate. We must thus focus our attention on clause 1, the non-derogating control orders, because&mdash;foreign, British, Belmarsh detainee or free at the moment&mdash;all the people who fall within the ambit of   needing to be controlled will be dealt with under clause 1, not clause 2. We are still concerned with a section of statute whereby the Home Secretary can make an order that severely limits a person's liberty and all that person can do is appeal afterwards to the court, if he chooses to do so. I accept that, under the concession made by the Home Secretary, such things may happen more quickly than was first anticipated under the Bill, but that is a rather weak point, and I want to make a different point that has been reflected already in what was said by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/734" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.2/3">The appeal that can follow the making of a clause 1 control order is not only unsatisfactory because it comes second, but is of extremely poor quality: it is judicial review&mdash;very suitable for reviewing the way in which lower courts, planning inspectors or local authorities make their decisions and scrutinising the way in which such a decision is taken, but highly inappropriate for deciding whether people have been deprived of their liberty or whether their liberty has been limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.2/4">Such reviews take into account how the decision was made, so the decision can be quashed if something is left out that should have been taken into account, or if something is taken into account that should not have been taken into account. However, all that need be done is to take the same decision again while taking account of what was left out the first time or whatever the court has found wrong. The same decision can be taken again, so long as it is done properly. No one looks at the merits. No one determines the facts thoroughly&mdash;that is done only in so far as is necessary for that very limited process&mdash;so it is a very poor form of appeal, as well as being only an appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.2/5">If the clause 1 order goes too far and, as we discussed in an exchange that I had with the Home Secretary, takes away liberty&mdash;given the variety of possibilities in clause 1, any number of them put together could amount to a breach of article 5&mdash;on the judicial review, or what I have called the poor quality appeal, the judge could find that order unlawful, contrary to article 5, and quash it. So for those top-end cases where the Home Secretary inadvertently orders something that breaches article 5, even though it comes under clause 1, the appeal process can quash it&mdash;but liberty will have been taken away under clause 1 by then, and all that can happen is that the person can appeal, with his liberty being restored to him some time later.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.2/6">If the reason why an application must be made to a judge under clause 2 is that taking away liberty is too severe a penalty for the Home Secretary to impose, that argument applies equally to clause 1. From time to time, a very fine balance will have to be struck about whether or not a combination of all the possible orders goes over the article 5 limit. It is unrealistic to think that it is not appropriate to let the court make such decisions. It is harder to get the balance right with such decisions than simply to order house arrest, and it is extra important that the courts should have scrutiny over those decisions, but liberty is gone in exactly the same way as under clause 2, so there is no reason not to apply the same procedure.</p>

	<p pid="a.743.0/1">I am following the hon. and learned Lady's argument and very much agree with what she is saying. She welcomed the change to the derogated orders, but if we are talking about an ex parte application where the judge can only look at the material, as the Home Secretary's letter says&mdash;we have no further detail than that&mdash;I am not sure whether there is much difference. As I read that letter, the judge will not able to look behind that material and consider the evidence. Does the hon. and learned Lady agree with that interpretation?</p>

	<p pid="a.743.1/1">Obviously, a two-stage process is involved&mdash;it is intended to be an ex parte application for speed, whereby the judge will consider whether there is a prima facie case. The process is not at all unfamiliar to lawyers. He will make what is in effect an interim order, and there will be an inter partes hearing when all the material will be put. So I suppose that that is unsatisfactory, but it is all that is practical in the very short term.</p>
	<p pid="a.743.1/2">I repeat that, although at the top end of those orders, if they break article 5, they can be quashed. That is a good thing. None the less, it is very bad that they can be quashed only after liberty has been taken away, and that they ever came into being. Any judge to whom an application was made under clause 1 who thought that all the controls went so far as to breach article 5 would simply never make the order, so there would never be a deprivation of liberty. Surely that is the right way round. However, for something that falls short of taking liberty away, the level of the appeal is very poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.743.1/3">I do not wish to labour the point, but the penalties that can befall someone under clause 1 are extraordinarily intrusive and can transform a person's life. They include obvious interferences with freedom of movement, family life and freedom of association. Someone may be ordered not to speak to any member of his family and he may be told to move house, stop doing his business or job or to change his job. He has to agree in certain circumstances to tell people in advance what his movements will be, and he has to allow his premises to be searched. He can be made to wear a tag and may not be able to use the internet or a mobile phone. Limits can also be placed on his movements all over the United Kingdom. In fact, there might be a mixture of all the penalties together or any other thing that the Home Office thinks is necessary in addition to those that I have mentioned. That is a very serious interference with liberty.</p>

	<p pid="a.744.0/1">Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that the intrusions can be so great that, in a particular combination of circumstances, they could, in practice, get in the way of that individual being able to exercise his rights of appeal? He might not be able to contact the people whom he needs to contact, and if he did not know his way around the law in the first place, he might not even be able to access the judicial involvement that the Bill would wish him to have.</p>

	<p pid="a.744.1/1">I suppose that that might be theoretically possible, but I would not have thought it likely that the Home Secretary would make an order that someone could not phone his solicitor and discuss the situation in which he had been placed. However, I guess that the possibility cannot be excluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/2">Let me emphasise what I have said already. All the penalties&mdash;or any of them&mdash;can be imposed on an individual and no judge will look at the questions of fact as to whether there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that that individual is involved in terrorism at all, or at whether the restrictions are necessary to protect the public. Nobody will look at that. Colleagues may think that that is completely unacceptable and that the poor quality of appeal, as placed in the legislation, is a potent additional reason to all those that have been heard before for us all sticking out for an application having to be made to a judge and the whole thing being assimilated with the new process in clause 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/3">I wish to consider the reasons that have been put forward for separating clause 1 from clause 2. The Home Secretary said that the task of assessing and evaluating evidence in order to take a preventive measure is something that the Secretary of State is better equipped to do than a judge. I guess that that means assessing intelligence. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> said, that point applies to both clauses 1 and 2. House arrest, under clause 2, is a preventive measure. It is not about something that has happened before but about something that one wants to stop happening again. If the Home Secretary concedes that, when it comes to evaluating whether clause 2 measures are necessary, the right person to do that is a judge, the same argument has to go for whether a clause 1 provision is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/4">Is there any real difference? Let us look at the test for a clause 1 order. Clause 1(1) says that the Secretary of State may make an order if he</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/5" class="indent">&quot;(a) has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the individual is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity; and</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/6">(b)</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/7" class="indent">considers that it is necessary for . . . protecting members of the public.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/8">Let us look at the test in clause 2. Subsection (1) states that the Secretary of State can make an order if</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/9" class="indent">&quot;(a) he is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the person is an individual who is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity;</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/10" class="indent">       (b) he considers that the imposition . . . is necessary for purposes connected with protecting members of the public&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/11">That is exactly the same test. If the judge is the right person to perform that test for clause 2, he is obviously the right person to perform it for clause 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/12">What else has been put forward? Only a few may fall under the ambit of clause 2, but at the moment we are told that there are none. More may come under the ambit of clause 1, so will we overwhelm the judiciary with a large number of cases if we require it to look at those covered by clause 1? I do not imagine so; no one has ever talked of more than, at most, a few hundred. In the context of the cases that the courts hear day in and day out, that is not a large number to add on. One would also imagine that lower-level control orders need not necessarily go to the High Court, because they could go to a professional magistrate who had security clearance. There would be a good deal of scope for that to happen, so we would not overwhelm the judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/13">It is said that the judges do not want such involvement. Lord Donaldson, who retired a decade ago, said that, but his comments seem to have been open to interpretation. I have not heard further compelling evidence that working judges today do not want to deal with the orders. It seems that they will at least do clause 2 adjudications under sufferance, so why should it be more difficult for them to do clause 1 adjudications? I dare say that they will do what Parliament asks them to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/14">I could not follow the distinction between a deprivation of liberty and interference with liberty. If there is a real distinction between the quality of the impact of the control orders, that is a poor reason for obtaining them using different procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/15">On Second Reading, I asked the Home Secretary to take the small step of putting the judge first, thus springing us free from Executive detention and interference with liberty. He has taken half that step, but by doing so he has utterly shattered any logical reason why he should not take the other half. Amendment No. 4 better represents what the proper position should be than the Bill, as it would provide for judicial involvement in clause 1 applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/16">We are in a hideous position because we will no doubt be asked to vote today against judicial involvement in clause 1 applications. However, the Bill will go to the Lords tomorrow. The Lords will no doubt vote for judicial involvement in clause 1 applications, and this time next week we will doubtless be asked to vote for that. The situation is a complete nonsense and the shortage of time makes that nonsense greater and more obvious.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.1/17">I regret having to say this, because I have immense respect for the Home Secretary and am pleased that he has taken the step that he has. However, drawing a distinction between clause 1 and clause 2 orders makes no sense whatsoever, and I am afraid that we should say so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.746.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/820" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="746"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-37.htm#50228-37_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.746.0/1">Hon. Members always listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> with attention and respect. She has great forensic skills and is a lawyer of tremendous experience. She brings her experience to our debates in the Chamber, so we are grateful to her. I agreed with many things that she said.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/2">As I am not a lawyer, I start from a slightly different base to the hon. and learned Lady. When the Government first announced the Bill, I was extremely sympathetic to it. I believe that the prime duty of any Government is to safeguard the integrity of the state and all its citizens. Although in the normal course of events, as I said to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1050" name="Peter Lilley">the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley)</phrase> last week, it is far better for a guilty person to go free than for an innocent one to be punished, when one is dealing with suicidal terrorists, one perhaps has to redress the balance a little.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/3">I am, however, persuaded that the Home Secretary has not handled the situation as well as he should have done. Although he is not here, I make a point to him through the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety. I remember saying this when we were in government and I was speaking from the other side of the House: any Minister of the Crown should beware of taking powers that he does not wish his opponent to use. For any Home Secretary to take such supreme powers is dangerous, both in itself and in its implications. However, I rather agree with the hon. and learned Member for Redcar that this time next week we will probably see yet another step on the road to sanity.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/4">We are all in your debt, Sir Michael, for allowing a wide-ranging debate on this series of amendments. It was essential that you did so in the wake of that extremely long speech, or teach-in as it almost was, by the Home Secretary. He was generous in giving way, but he came to the Committee having circulated that letter and in effect gave notice that he was going to rewrite some of the fundamental parts of the Bill. So all the amendments in the first group are, in the words of my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, otiose.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/5">The real problem that the Committee faces is that because the Government have handled the matter so badly, a Bill of far-reaching importance is not having the parliamentary scrutiny in this place that Members on both sides believe it should have. When the Leader of the House announced in that brief business statement a week ago today that we would have the Bill, I begged him to defer Second Reading until today so that we could have the weekend to discuss it and reflect on it, and to have the remaining stages later this week. Frankly, there was no reason why we could not have done that and also adhered to the Government's timetable.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/6">I believe that the Government have panicked. The offer made by my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench to extend the existing provisions of the current Act was right. That could have been done and it would have been reasonable to do it, but even accepting the Government's case that they did not wish to do that, we could still have met their timetable of 13 or <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March</phrase> and had a more coherent and better discussion in this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/7">The time is now 9.17 pm and, according to the timetable motion passed earlier today, these proceedings have to come to a conclusion at 10 o'clock&mdash;you, Sir Michael, or whoever is occupying Chair, have no option on that&mdash;yet we are still on the first group of amendments. I was briefly absent from the Chamber, but heard most of the speeches. I certainly did not hear a word of filibustering from hon. Members on either side of the Committee. Yet all these other important aspects of the Bill remain to be discussed, and none of them will be discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/8">When we move on to Third Reading, we will leave a Bill that directly, or indirectly by implication, could affect the lives of many people and change the balance in so far as the liberty of the subject in this country is concerned. When we leave the Bill, we will not have scrutinised it or discussed it in the House of Commons. Yes, it will have four days in the other place. Yes, there are many learned lawyers in the other place who will be able to bring the wisdom and experience that the hon. and learned Member for Redcar brought to her contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/9">I am one of those who believe that the House of Lords, as currently constituted, adds great value to our democratic procedures. I do not suppose that the hon. and learned Lady would entirely agree with that, but I am sure that she would agree that there will be detailed scrutiny and sensible debate down the Corridor. However, we are the elected House and have a duty to hold the Government to account, and, because we do not have a separation of powers, the Government have a duty to allow us to hold them to account. That duty has not been fulfilled in respect of this extremely important Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/10">I have been here now for almost 35 years and others in the Chamber have been here as long. I see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1107" name="Michael Meacher">the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher)</phrase> in his place. I do not remember any major piece of legislation&mdash;he may, and I will give way to him if he does so&mdash;that has aroused such widespread unease in all parts of the House. I do not remember any major piece of legislation put forward by any Government, from the Government of Edward Heath to the present one, for which not a single speaker on Second Reading or in Committee has made an enthusiastically endorsing speech. Yet, in spite of that and of the grave misgivings, which are honourably shared by many on the Government Benches, we are not to have the chance properly to examine and scrutinise.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/11">Many of us made appeals this afternoon in points of order and in other ways. We must have tried severely the patience of Sir Alan, Mrs. Heal and you, Sir Michael, and for that I am sure I can apologise on behalf of us all. However, they were legitimate points of order. We tried very hard to get a suspension so that there could be reconsideration of the timetable and so that we could have another day of debate. If we had had another day of debate on Wednesday, we could at least have discussed in some detail most of the major aspects of the Bill. It is tragic&mdash;I use the word deliberately&mdash;that the Prevention of Terrorism Bill has become the prevention of parliamentary debate Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/12">I know that people in the country are deeply worried about terrorism; of course they are. I saw, as I am sure almost everyone present will have done, the poll in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> this morning, which showed a large majority of people taking the line, which broadly I take, that if it is necessary to sacrifice a little civil liberty for overall civil protection, then so be it. If that is the line taken, how much more is it our duty to ensure that any Bill that we enact does not bolster the power of any Government or individual Minister, but rather gives the final arbitrating role to a judge or even perhaps, as suggested in one amendment that I tabled, which I am sure was quite properly not selected, to the Select Committee on Intelligence and Security, without the agreement of which and without full consultation with it the Home Secretary could not act. That would be a safeguard.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/13">The hon. and learned Member for Redcar was a little scathing about Lord Donaldson, but my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/787" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> quoted Lord Hoffmann. There is a certain reluctance among judges past and present. If the decision is not to fall to a judge, at the very least it should be taken by a cross-party group of Members who can advise and work with the Home Secretary. I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/927" name="Win Griffiths">the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths)</phrase> tabled a similar amendment. We tabled them totally independently of each other, neither knowing that the other had done it. Both of us were seeking a solution that would take away the arbitrary power of the Home Secretary, whoever he or she may be.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/14">The Bill will pass to the other place tomorrow. Their lordships will have their four days in Committee. The Bill will then have to come back to us as amended. I echo the plea made by a number of hon. Members earlier in the debate: let us have a generous allocation of time to debate the Lords amendments in this place, because the House of Commons would be held in contempt if it were given one or two hours to discuss such matters of far-reaching importance. Third Reading will be brief, and only one or two hon. Members will have an opportunity to make a few points of principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/15">I have great respect for the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety. She is always courteous and often humorous. She has done extremely well in her relatively brief time in the House and I wish her well in future, especially in opposition. Will she please listen carefully to the concerns expressed by Labour Members, as well those expressed from this side of the Committee? The Government have not treated Parliament with respect, which they should have done in introducing a Bill that is unprecedented in 300 years or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.0/16">This is a sad day for those of us who care about Parliament. I hope that the Government will never again seek to railroad through a Bill of major constitutional importance with such a ridiculous timetable.</p>

	<p pid="a.749.0/1">Plainly, I play second fiddle to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/820" name="Patrick Cormack">the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> in terms of parliamentary experience. He has made the point that the concern is shared on both sides of the Committee and that the issue is immensely serious because it concerns the role of the Executive and the liberty of citizens. I have not dealt with more important legislation than this Bill, which concerns the security of the nation balanced against the liberty of the individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.0/2">The way in which the matter has been handled should be an appalling embarrassment to all hon. Members. Earlier, I intervened on the Home Secretary&mdash;I am pleased that he is here&mdash;in the hope that he would take the opportunity to find a better way to deal with the matter. He replied that because I oppose the principle of control orders and of the Bill, I have no right to invite comment on how the Government should take the matter forward, and he then gave his own presentation of my views.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.0/3">We should all be appalled that the Government, or anyone else, think it necessary to introduce such measures. If the Government are correct and the situation in which they find themselves and the threat that the nation faces is such that we must put this Bill on the statute book, it should give us extreme pause for thought. The Bill is being introduced in the most enormous hurry, and we have not examined from first principles why it should be put on the statute book. Given the enormous controversy surrounding the Bill, it is essential that the Government take seriously and listen to the debate on this group of amendments, which relates to the role of the judiciary and the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.0/4">Enormous confusion exists about the need for control orders. If the Government stated that control orders are the only way to deal with the threat that we face, I would be prepared to be convinced. However, the threat from al-Qaeda is not somehow different from the threats that our nation has faced down the centuries. In the early 21st century nations possess significant advantages over non-state actors who are determined to overthrow the state. We have never before come across the quantity of information to which states have access and which they can collect about people.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.0/5">I understand that when the Prime Minister was interviewed on &quot;Woman's Hour&quot; today, he said&mdash;outside this place&mdash;that the orders may be applied to hundreds of people. That, together with the fact that the Leader of the House explained last week that the Bill had to be rushed through the House in six days, suggests that we are facing an emergency and that we are not being given the entire picture. The apparent position is that we must have something on the statute book by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March</phrase> in order to replace the measures that will fall because of the judgment in the House of Lords. Yet the Home Secretary will not apply the control orders under clause 2 to the people who will walk out of Belmarsh and be subjected to a type of control order that does not require a derogation from the convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.0/6">I am confused about the depth of the threat that our nation faces from its own citizens. I want the Government to produce the evidence and convince me of the scale of the threat. The dossier that they produced to support the Second Reading debate is not sufficient to justify measures that fly in the face of 790 years of the tradition of British justice and the liberty of British citizens. I listened the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety on the radio this morning. Her instinctive assumption that she, as the Minister, must take at face value the requests of the Security Service and the police and give them all the powers that they desire is not good enough. We need a proper case to be made so that we can be convinced by the weight of the evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.0/7">The Prime Minister, at Prime Minister's questions last week, told the House that the security service was unanimous, but I find that extremely difficult to believe. There are more than 2,000 members of the Security Service, as I understand it, and I find it difficult to believe that although powers on this scale have been met with controversy in the House and in the country, that controversy is not reflected in the Security Service and the police. Members of those services understand the consequences of a lack of faith in Government if the Government take powers to themselves that people see as unfair and potentially unnecessary because there is no proper judicial process to allow people to put the case in their own defence in the proper way.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.0/8">I identified 23 different debates arising from the first group of amendments, but we all know that there is little point in trying to deal with the detail of the business before us because the Government will put a different Bill before the Lords. If the Bill passes through another place and we in due course consider Lords amendments, I hope that the Government will give the House sufficient time to do its job properly, which it has not done in the first stages of consideration of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.750.0/1">This has been a fascinating debate. There have been some excellent contributions ranging right across the spectrum, from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> to my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, who come from opposite political poles and perspectives but take the same view in their dislike of the legislation and, moreover, in their suspicion of the Government's motives in the way that they have presented it. Plenty of other contributions, some from lawyers, whom the Home Secretary appears not particularly to like, highlighted the novel powers that the Government are seeking to take for themselves and urged them on one discrete issue&mdash;that is all that this debate is about&mdash;to change their mind and to allow non-derogation powers to be properly used by a judge under precisely the powers that would be available if they were derogation powers in terms of reviewing the facts of the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.750.0/2">Even at this late stage, I hope that the Home Secretary will listen. As I fear that he will not, however, I will vote&mdash;I encourage every Member in this House, certainly those on my Benches, to do likewise&mdash;in support of the amendment tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/927" name="Win Griffiths">the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths)</phrase>. As this will in reality be the conclusion of our scrutiny of this Bill, it is essential that this Committee should send a signal to the other place regarding what is troubling us. I ask all hon. Members to think carefully about their own positions and be willing, if they possibly can&mdash;although I am sure that some will be loyal to the Government&mdash;to go into the Lobby to support the hon. Gentleman's amendment and send out a signal that the Government need to think again on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.750.0/3">I ask the Home Secretary to deal with one last point, which was picked up by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/740" name="Crispin Blunt">the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt)</phrase>. There is a discrepancy between the number of people whom the Home Secretary believes will be affected by these orders and the number whom the Prime Minister says will be affected. I have here the Prime Minister's quote from &quot;Woman's Hour&quot;, where he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.750.0/4" class="indent">&quot;you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people&mdash;and there are several hundred of them in this country we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts&mdash;between mere surveillance and being sure enough of proof to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.750.0/5">I hope that the Home Secretary will use the opportunity in winding up this debate to answer that discrepancy so that the Committee can understand what we are dealing with.</p>
	<p pid="a.750.0/6">More generally, it would be most helpful if the Government would be franker with the Committee about what they want and the difficulties that they face. If they did that, and listened better to what the Committee has to say, they would find it much easier to obtain a consensus on these difficult issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.751.0/1">I will be brief because I have had more than my fair share of time in this debate. We have had a very full and good debate. First, let me say in response to those right hon. and hon. Members who sought more time for the debate that I will certainly consider with my colleagues through the usual channels the extent to which this House can debate the issues that come back from the other place.</p>
	<p pid="a.751.0/2">Secondly, I believe that I have made very major and significant movement on the proposals that I originally put. I did so in order to seek consensus in this House on these very important matters, particularly on the very powerful motivating concern that I heard expressed by Members on all Benches regarding the need to have proper judicial scrutiny of deprivation of liberty. I have sought to respond to that central concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.751.0/3">Thirdly, I want to make it very clear that every decision of the Home Secretary has to be justified on the basis that it is necessary and proportionate and will be subject to judicial assessment in a very full way.</p>
	<p pid="a.751.0/4">Fourthly, I want to confirm the point with which I started this whole debate&mdash;this is a difficult and problematic issue. Lord Carlile, the reviewer of these matters, stated in his report, powerfully and truthfully, and in a way that the whole House should take full account of:</p>
	<p pid="a.751.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Having seen extensive material, I am in no doubt that national security could be at risk if certain types of evidence were revealed to the detainees. At risk too would be some individuals' lives. The kind of evidence I have in mind includes that provided by . . . human resources including those who might be described as a term of art as 'informants', disclosure of locations used for observation, details of technical facilities available for listening to and/or reading communications, descriptions and identities of police officers and others, and methods of risk assessment used by the control authorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.751.0/6">Those are serious matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.751.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> cited <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/740" name="Crispin Blunt">the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt)</phrase> and raised the Prime Minister's comments on &quot;Woman's Hour&quot; earlier today. It was put to the Prime Minister's official spokesman that my right hon. Friend had said in the interview that there were &quot;several hundred people plotting&quot; a terrorist attack, which is the case. The official spokesman was asked whether that would mean several hundred house arrests. He replied, &quot;No&quot;, and said that the Prime Minister had used exactly the same phraseology last week in Prime Minister's questions and made it clear that, at the extreme end of control orders, which we are discussing, we envisage using the provision against very few people.</p>
	<p pid="a.751.0/8">The hon. Member for Reigate asked whether there was any evidence to show that British citizens were involved in such activity. I cite today's evidence about Mr. Sajid Badat, a British citizen, who admitted to plotting to blow up a plane, in league with Richard Reid, the notorious shoe bomber, who is also a British citizen.</p>

	<p pid="a.752.4/1">The Home Secretary has done his best to explain his change of heart, although I suspect that it is driven more by political expediency than an assessment of the Opposition's argument. None the less, he has done his best and I thank him for the change of policy, even if it was produced through a letter rather than by formal amendments tabled in the proper way.</p>
	<p pid="a.752.4/2">It is a pity that the right hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm for his case&mdash;or at least for the advice that he has been given&mdash;sometimes allows him to draw strength from material that is not helpful to it. Let us take the case of Badat. It demonstrates the strength of the criminal justice system, not the need for the sort of proposals that the Home Secretary presented.</p>
	<p pid="a.752.4/3">No Conservative Member, especially the Leader of the Opposition, could ever be accused of being soft on terrorism. When my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/974" name="Michael Howard">the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase> was Home Secretary, anybody who suggested that he was soft on terrorism would have been laughed out of court. When the Home Secretary mumbles into his beard that the Leader of the Opposition is soft on terrorism, nobody believes him. My right hon. and learned Friend was criticised for being the opposite&mdash;far from soft on anything to do with civil liberties or anything that stank of terrorism. It is absurd for the Home Secretary to rely on the Badat case, which went all the way to the Old Bailey and produced a change of plea today, and to bounce off that and claim that the Conservative party is soft on terrorism. We know that that is absurd and so does he.</p>
	<p pid="a.752.4/4">We all accept the need to protect the nation from terrorist activities by foreign people and British citizens. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Home Secretary says that I do not. I do not know how he thinks that he can read my mind&mdash;he can hardly read his own after his performance today. My family and I and my hon. Friends and their families have fought hard against terrorism&mdash;we have seen colleagues blown up and killed through it.</p>
	<p pid="a.752.4/5">We do not need lectures from the Home Secretary about being soft on terrorism&mdash;perhaps he would care to button his lip on that and simply listen to people who want him to succeed in dealing with the problem but do not wish him to suborn the parliamentary process in doing so. It is important that the parliamentary process should keep its integrity. When a Government&mdash;through a Secretary of State or a Minister&mdash;unwittingly or wittingly mislead Parliament about what they intend to do to gain a guillotine, the process is utterly reduced and the Government should be ashamed.</p>
	<p pid="a.752.4/6">I shall sit down now, but I warn the Government that those in the other place will have listened very carefully to what the Home Secretary has said about the Bill, and to what those on the Labour Back Benches have said. I trust that they will also occasionally have listened to what Conservative Members have said. It is in our shared interest to deal with terrorism and it will not do for the Home Secretary to suborn the parliamentary process. He thinks that he can get away with it because he has a majority of 165, but I suspect that he will find that majority somewhat reduced tonight&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.753.1/1">I rise briefly to answer the Home Secretary. Twice today he has chosen to present my views, although they did not represent my views at all. I fully accept that there is a risk from terrorists, both British and foreign, in the United Kingdom. Surely the reason that British citizens were able to be taken to Guantanamo Bay had some basis in the fact that they were taking part in terrorist activity in Afghanistan. Anyone who has listened to the debates taking place in the Islamic community in the United Kingdom&mdash;particularly among the most extreme elements of that community, where we have seen people preaching wholly unacceptable messages in the streets&mdash;will understand that a small percentage of people in the United Kingdom have some ideological sympathy with the supposed objectives of al-Qaeda. I do not hesitate to say that that potential is out there.</p>
	<p pid="a.753.1/2">The Home Secretary specifically referred to al-Qaeda on Second Reading. He suggested that it posed a uniquely different threat that had to be met with uniquely different measures. That seems to mean that the Executive will take powers to themselves the like of which we have not seen since habeas corpus was suspended in the face of the threat from the French revolution. In taking those powers, however, the Home Secretary is doing something extreme and unique in the history of the United Kingdom, and it should therefore be beyond peradventure that the Government's case should be extremely strong. I do not accept that the threat is so unique that we should throw out 790 years of British jurisprudence and British traditions of liberty.</p>
	<p pid="a.753.1/3">The British criminal justice system has brought such people to justice, as my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> has pointed out. Indeed, the Home Secretary adduced such cases in saying that British terrorists existed. We accept that. We faced down terrorism of an Irish dimension in Britain for more than 30 years, and we made mistakes in that regard when we went too far with the powers of internment. We undermined our case in defending democracy when the state took powers to take on the terrorists that went too far. We then acted as a recruiting sergeant for those&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.754.1/1">I am grateful for your guidance, Mrs. Heal.</p>
	<p pid="a.754.1/2">The Home Secretary weakens his case in support of the amendments that he is going to table to the Bill in another place, and the case against the amendments that we are considering tonight, when he misrepresents the arguments of people who take a different view from his own. It is extremely important that the Government do not indulge in misrepresentation, particularly given their record on other issues relating to war, peace and the security of this country. It is very important that they should carry as much support from the British people, and achieve as much consensus in this House, as possible. The way in which they have carried on has not assisted that objective at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.754.2/1">Let me ask the Home Secretary a question that I asked the Minister when I thought that she would respond to this brief debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.754.2/2">The Home Secretary spoke at length today, and dealt as best he could with many interventions. I hope that on mature reflection he will realise that he has behaved with a degree of arrogance and disdain towards Parliament that does not do him credit. I hope that before 10 pm he will return to the Dispatch Box and at least promise us that when the Bill returns from the House of Lords, where it will be given the scrutiny that we have not been allowed to give it, we will have a proper chance to discuss any substantive amendments made to it in the other place. The Home Secretary owes us that undertaking. The very least he can say is that he will have discussions with the Leader of the House immediately to ensure that proper time is made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.754.2/3">The Home Secretary may look peeved and fed up, but as Home Secretary he is answerable to the House of Commons. Members in all parts of the House&mdash;including many of his own supporters, many of them loyal supporters over the years&mdash;are deeply distressed by the way in which the Bill has been handled. I am closer to him on the Bill than many others, because, as I said earlier, I see a need to ensure the greater safety of the greater number, and certain liberties may have to be sacrificed; but he has gone about this in a manner that makes the proverbial bull in a china shop seem a model of taste, decorum, delicacy and decency.</p>
	<p pid="a.754.2/4">I urge the Home Secretary to tell us that we will have a proper chance to discuss amendments from the other place. He has rewritten the Bill in his letter. He has not tabled amendments so that we can debate them. He has not provided extra time so that we can debate them. He has treated the House of Commons, of which he is a Member, with contempt. I hope that he will now feel able to repent, and to give us the undertaking that I seek. He has eight minutes in which to do it.</p>

	<p pid="a.755.0/1">As I should have said earlier, I hope to be able to press new clause 6 to a Division. I realise that it is not perfect. I am sure that it could be improved, and a Report stage would have allowed us to do that, but I believe it encapsulates a process that might commend itself to many Members as an alternative to what the Government propose.</p>

	<p pid="a.755.1/1">It is not really possible to understand how clause 1 works without understanding clauses 7 and 8 and the schedule, because they determine what kind of judicial proceedings can take place. Like all the other clauses apart from clause 1, they have not been debated at all. I trust that proper note will be taken of that in another place. It is surely deplorable that such fundamental alterations and reductions in the fairness of our court processes can be approved in the House of Commons without any debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.755.2/1">I rise with mixed feelings, having heard an excellent debate. Many speakers have been more eloquent than me, and better informed about the legal processes. They have presented arguments intended to sustain my amendment No. 4 and consequential amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/2">I believe that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has been traduced by many Opposition Members, because of the way in which they chose to interpret his letter and our debate about that letter. It is clear from that debate that the Home Secretary was prepared to accept the principle of amendment No. 1, tabled by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase>, and consequential amendments, and my amendment No. 6&mdash;also relating to clause 2&mdash;and its consequential amendments. However, it was also clear that he was not prepared to    accept amendment No. 4 and consequential amendments to apply the principle of the court making the decision to the non-derogating orders. We could debate the pros and cons and the nuances of that proposal for another six hours, but I believe that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/734" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)</phrase> was right when he said that, having accepted the court making the decision on derogating orders, there would be no weakening of the fight against terrorism by accepting that for clause 1 and the non-derogating orders. My hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> pointed out, correctly, that the judicial review process is not strong when one looks at the issues that are at stake with non-derogating orders. Although any one of them did not amount to a loss of liberty, a combination of them could.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/3">Therefore, I hope that, even now, the Home Secretary will say that he would be prepared to accept in principle a change and look at ways of incorporating the principle of the court making the decision on non-derogating orders. I believe that that would make the process involved certain and consistent. By accepting amendment No. 4 along with amendments Nos. 1 and 6, it would mean that liberty and justice were protected in all cases. I hope that, if the Secretary of State cannot accept in principle my amendment, the Committee will have the opportunity to make its own decision.</p>

He comes to the House, presents a Bill and commends its Third Reading to the House, yet he knows that the debates in Committee have shown that it contains serious flaws that he has to rectify, and that his Government, through the Whips on his Treasury Bench, have, through their programming, denied the House of Commons any opportunity to consider its details.</p>
	<p pid="a.772.10/2">We are being invited to vote on a Bill having not considered the following matters: the obligations on the Secretary of State in connection with control orders; the content of control orders; the definition of &quot;terrorist-related activity&quot;; the balance of proof in relation to the making of control orders; the abolition of a distinction between non-derogating and derogating control orders; the duration of the Act, which some Members might think a most important issue; the content and delivery of a notice of modification of an order; the power of the court to make a conditional discharge; the mechanisms of appeal; the possibility of providing for costs and damages if wrong is done to the individual who is adversely affected by these measures; appeals relating to derogating control orders; reviews; and control order proceedings in the schedule, which, as Members have commented in the short debates that we have been able to have, is clearly a document of the mightiest mischief, because it provides a mechanism whereby this Government&mdash;in whom I have to say that I no longer have any confidence whatsoever in terms of the maintenance of civil liberties in this country&mdash;can produce whatever they like by way of rules of court in an area of novel power-making.</p>
	<p pid="a.772.10/3">How has this situation come about? Over the past week, the Home Secretary has weaved backwards and forwards between saying, when he wishes to appeal to one audience, that this is a non-party-political matter that requires serious consideration, and then denouncing one Opposition party or another for playing politics. Most of the time it has been my party that has been accused of playing politics, but when the Liberal Democrats have stood up against him, it is allegedly they who have been doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.772.10/4">The shallowness of the way in which the Government have embarked upon this project is breathtaking. Although they have known since <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-16">16 December</phrase> that their existing powers were wholly flawed, all they did in the intervening six weeks was to go behind the scenes and decide to try to cobble something together. Here was an opportunity for the Home Secretary, in the new job that he had acquired, to show that he would rise to his office. He could have approached any party for consultation on a pre-legislative basis, but no. He and the Prime Minister, having decided what they would do, graciously extended the opportunity to come into the big tent. However, the moment any objection is raised, one is cast into the outer darkness.</p>

	<p pid="a.773.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, from the time of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and that of the imprisonment of people in Belmarsh, the Government have issued no invitation to take part in two or three-party proceedings to discuss what should happen if, ultimately, the courts ruled, as many of us argued, that their proposals were illegal?</p>

	<p pid="a.773.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman&mdash;what he says is the absolute truth. I believed at the time that the lack of consultation was due to the bizarre and individual attitudes of the previous Home Secretary. However, it has become clear that he has spread contagion throughout the Government because the current Home Secretary has adopted all his worst vices in his approach to the matters that we are considering.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.1/2">What are we to make of the Home Secretary's coming to the Dispatch Box a few moments ago and reciting a series of mantras about the public opinion polls? I stress to him that 99 per cent. of people in this country might believe in the Bill, but I would not vote for it. Hon. Members who consider their consciences, the way in which the Government have gone about the matter and the enormity of what is involved, can readily dismiss the appeals to public sentiment, whether it is accurate or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.1/3">The Government are highly populist. The Prime Minister picks his position carefully. If he believes that he can take some shallow swing of the popular mood with him, that justifies his doing anything, however authoritarian, illiberal or undermining of the constitution. The long-term damage is enormous.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.1/4">I cannot understand how a Government who were elected for the first time in 1997 on the back of commendable promises about their standards of integrity could descend so rapidly into the gutter, in the way in which we have witnessed in the past few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.1/5">The Bill does not deserve a Third Reading. It is fundamentally flawed. It could be made tolerable, but we have been allowed to do nothing to enable that to happen. Every hon. Member should consider sending a signal to the other place that we need its help. Heaven knows, we do.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.1/6">We have demeaned ourselves in the past 24 hours. We have allowed a measure that is poor in quality, content and concept to pass through its Committee stage. We have one last opportunity to say that, although we are prepared to consider the problems that confront the Government, we are not willing to put up with such a dog's breakfast, which so undermines the basic principles of liberty in this country. I therefore ask hon. Members to vote against Third Reading and repeat the signal.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.1/7">We hear a lot about standing up to protect people. I do not need lessons from the Home Secretary about protecting people. I am satisfied that there is a threat to this country but one does not solve it by turning into a coward and dying a thousand deaths, which the right hon. Gentleman appears to invite the population of this country to do. It is possible to respond to and deal with terrorism in ways that are compatible with our freedoms and liberties. The Bill fails that test completely.</p>

	<p pid="a.774.0/1">Third Reading provides an opportunity to ask a question about the constitutional position in relation to Scotland. Jim Wallace, the Deputy First Minister of the Scottish Parliament, raised the prospect of his party at Holyrood triggering a constitutional showdown with the UK Government over the latter's plans for house arrest without trial for terror suspects. He said that the Liberal Democrats would refuse to support aspects of the Bill that fell within the competence of Scottish Ministers and on which Holyrood had to agree, courtesy of a device called a Sewel motion, to allow Westminster to legislate for the whole of the UK. That would mean that, if it came to a Holyrood vote, only Labour MSPs would be certain to support the Sewel motion supporting the Home Secretary. Frankly, I would add that some Labour MSPs would not be dragged by wild horses into such a Lobby.</p>
	<p pid="a.774.0/2">That would mean that, with the main parties also against the plans, the Home Secretary would fail to secure the agreement of enough MSPs for the legislation to cover Scotland. The UK Government would have no choice but to ignore the views of MSPs and, for the first time since devolution, impose legislation in the teeth of Holyrood opposition. I ask the Home Secretary for his comments on this serious situation for us north of the border.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.775.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="775"  time="023:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-45.htm#50228-45_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.775.0/1">This is a debate of the utmost gravity on a matter to which the House should give the highest priority: not only the safety of the people of this country but their liberties. I accuse the Government of dereliction of duty over the past three years for not having sought an acceptable formula to deal with a threat that we acknowledge. I find it incredible that a Bill of this importance should have received no Committee or Report stage today. Instead, it received a mutant form of Second Reading for the second time, which will have to be repeated when the Bill comes back from the Lords in unrecognisable form. A number of new clauses and 227 amendments have simply not been debated today. When will the House get up off its knees and tell the Executive, &quot;Enough is enough. We will not put up with abuses of this kind&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.775.0/2">We are told that the Home Secretary has made a serious concession by accepting the need for judicial oversight of derogating control orders. We are grateful for that; it is a measure that we have argued for and that we believe should be in place. It cannot be right that a citizen of this country should be put under house arrest by the diktat of a member of the Executive, rather than by the courts. Perhaps the Home Secretary believes that that concession is sufficient to win the support of the House, but if he was not disabused of that idea by the debate, I hope that he was disabused of it by the result of the Division and the reduction in his Government's majority. That will send the clearest possible signal to the other place that there is a high level of dissatisfaction with the proposals on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.775.0/3">That is hardly surprising. We have not even seen the concession that we have been promised. The Home Secretary could not bring himself to table amendments on the provision in this elected House so that we could debate it. It is based on a prima facie hearing before a court in which he originally said, with a slip of the tongue, that consideration would be on the balance of probabilities. He then corrected himself and said that there would need to be reasonable grounds to suspect that an individual had been involved in terrorism. That is exactly the low level of proof that has given us so much cause for concern already.</p>
	<p pid="a.775.0/4">We then come to the argument about non-derogating orders. Most people outside the House will not have a clue what the distinction is between a derogating order and a non-derogating order in the context of the Bill. I have to say that many of us inside the House do not have a clue either. We have heard cogent contributions, particularly from Labour Members, pointing out the deficiency of the proposals in regard to appeals and to the definition of a derogating order.</p>

	<p pid="a.776.0/1">I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for putting that on the record, because it makes it clear that for each hon. Member who voted against the Government there was at least one, perhaps two, who disagreed with what they intend to do. If the Government think they can get the Bill through the House in this form, they are mistaken: it will not pass.</p>
	<p pid="a.776.0/2">I have heard the Prime Minister trying to explain the Government's position, and trying to win the favour of the country in, apparently, an all-out bid to impress readers of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, as we just heard from the Home Secretary. His basic argument boils down to this: &quot;What would people think if we knew that someone was a danger to the country and did nothing about it, and then an atrocity was committed?&quot; I would ask the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary this in return: what would people think if the Home Secretary knew that someone was a danger to the country, but did not have the tools to do anything about it because of a totally arbitrary distinction between derogating and non-derogating orders and between whether he goes to a judge one week later or in the first instance, and an atrocity was committed?</p>
	<p pid="a.776.0/3">This is nonsense. It is possible for us to reach a consensus; why on earth are the Government refusing to allow that to happen?</p>

As one of the 59 Labour Members who voted as we did&mdash;I make no apologies for that; far from it&mdash;I shall vote for Third Reading for reasons given by the Home Secretary, but I shall do so in the hope that, one way or another, what we want and what the hon.

	<p pid="a.776.2/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, and I note his intention. I am grateful for his support in the Lobby earlier, but I am saddened that he now feels able to support the Bill in a triumph of hope over experience. I am surprised that he puts his trust in an unelected House rather than in this elected House of Commons to get the legislation right.</p>
	<p pid="a.776.2/2">There are many points that we have not had an opportunity to debate: the standard of evidence required to deprive someone of his liberty, or restrict his liberty; the rules of court and the admissibility of evidence, and the degree to which evidence can be shared. Of course we understand that there are matters that it would not be proper to share with the accused in this instance because of the risk to security, but it would not be impossible to devise protocols allowing people at least to know the broad outline of the charge against them. That is the basis of our judicial system, and it is not one to be lightly thrown aside. We have had no opportunity to make prosecution under the laws of the land&mdash;in a proper court, conducted through the Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;a priority in statute.</p>

	<p pid="a.777.0/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am fundamentally opposed to the principle of Executive detention and Executive orders, but his argument has lost me slightly. Is he saying that the Liberal Democrats do not want defendants to have access to the evidence against them?</p>

	<p pid="a.777.1/1">That is precisely the reverse of my position. I shall leave it at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.1/2">I also think it important to ensure that the conditions of an order are intelligible to the person on whom they are imposed. Many such people will not have English as a first language, but there is no such provision in the Bill. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> raised another important point, about the temporary nature of the legislation. Surely we do not envisage the state of emergency described by the Government as being of indefinite duration&mdash;or perhaps we do. If so, the Bill deserves better scrutiny; if not, there should be a clear limit to its duration.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.1/3">In short, the Bill as it is formulated simply will not do. I repeat that we recognise the dangers that the Government describe. We recognise the need to ensure that our citizens are properly protected. We are prepared to continue the dialogue and hope that it will be more fruitful than it has so far been, while acknowledging the very small movement that the Home Secretary has accepted. We believe&mdash;this is a fundamental principle&mdash;that the safety of the people is paramount, but the liberties of the people are also paramount. This House and the Executive have to find the balance. Frankly, this is no way in which to do it.</p>

	<p pid="a.777.2/1">In the 12 years or so that I have been in the House, the number of days on which what happens in the House of Commons Chamber seems to matter have each year declined dramatically, so it was fun to be here today and last Wednesday, when one got the sense that an actual debate was taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.2/2">It is interesting to consider how today's and last week's debates will look in two or three years. What conclusions will we draw? I suggest that we will draw a number of conclusions. One will be that some of the complaints were overstated. Our ability to restrict the liberties of citizens and to detain people without trial will be considerably less than that of France, Spain or other countries similar to ours, whatever the outcome of the Bill. That has sometimes been lost sight of in the debate on the current legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.2/3">Secondly, we may recognise that, in our society, there are many circumstances in which people's liberty is restricted without their appearing before a judge for quite some period&mdash;I am thinking of the Mental Health Act 1983 as well as of police powers. So let us put the matter in perspective. Some of the discussion today, which has focused so much on judges, has taken us away from the more fundamental debate, which appeared only from time to time: whether it is right at all to have the sort of restrictions on freedom and liberty that are implied by control orders. I believe that that is necessary and that the terrorist threat justifies it. It is a shame that the inability to resolve the issue about judges has stopped that being the central focus of today's debate because, for a lot of people in the Conservative party and for some Labour Members, that is an even more fundamental issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.2/4">Thirdly, I am sure that the Bill will be amended in another place and we will revisit it. Clearly, it is not capable of giving us the structure that we need to deal with these terrorist issues for the future. We must ensure that, over the next two or three years, that structure is put in place. If I am right in thinking that there is a group of individuals against whom we cannot put together a court case for a criminal hearing and we have to take action, the real challenge is that neither the process of the Home Secretary looking at the evidence nor a judge having it presented to him or her will prove to be adequate. Where the security services produce evidence against an individual, it is important to interrogate that evidence as effectively as possible, to consider not just a control order but the other strategies that could be used against that individual, and to weigh the overall national security risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.2/5">I believe that that role can be performed only if there is a procedure that takes on board some of the elements of the investigating magistrate that one has in other jurisdictions. Judges will be able to consider whether a control order should apply. It is much more difficult for them, in any of the proposed procedures, to consider that option against the other options and strategies that could be considered for dealing with that individual. I tabled amendments, which we did not reach, to expand the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions, not simply so that there was a public certification of the inability to prosecute; it was with a conscious eye on the need to develop some investigative capacity within the state, perhaps with a judicial role, to carry out the type of investigation that is necessary. I am absolutely convinced that that is the direction that we need to explore and move in over the next couple of years. We will make what progress we can on this Bill and get it into the best possible form, but I doubt that we will achieve that by Tuesday.</p>

	<p pid="a.778.3/1">I do not entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman, and for this reason. The law that we would have to renew in March, but which we cannot because of the Law Lords' judgment, applies solely to foreign nationals. I do not necessarily believe that we have a year or two before needing to put in place a framework to deal with British citizens who might be involved in terrorism; some moves in that direction are necessary now. But I say with all due respect to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary&mdash;he has approached this entire debate with great openness, but he needs to respond further&mdash;that although he has at no stage proposed anything that deserves the name &quot;Executive detention&quot;, the proposal looks like that and can be presented as such. We need a proposal that cannot be described in those terms, because the wider misinterpretation of the Bill will be too damaging. Our constituents must not be made to feel that their liberties are being restricted by Executive action.</p>

	<p pid="a.779.0/1">Is my right hon. Friend not concerned about paragraph 8(2) of the schedule in particular? The effect of non-derogating control orders not being subject to prior judicial decision will be that, even if an order is quashed or a court refuses to renew it, the Home Secretary will be able to exercise his power to make a new order in respect of the same matters&mdash;in whole if necessary&mdash;because he failed to achieve such an order in the first place. In other words, it is rather like the cat and mouse Act, in that the Home Secretary can keep bringing the matter back before the courts. In the meantime, the person subject to the control order has had their liberties infringed.</p>

	<p pid="a.779.1/1">I cannot answer for the Home Secretary, but I believe that he said earlier that he is willing to look at the schedule's wording. However, it is a shame that that has to be done in another place, rather than here. Round-tripping of the sort that my hon. Friend describes would clearly be unacceptable, because that would be getting into the territory of Executive action untrammelled by judicial review. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
	<p pid="a.779.1/2">I hear a number of Members asking how I can say that the proposal does not constitute Executive detention. A process initiated by the Home Secretary, swiftly followed by a judicial process, cannot be equated with those regimes around the world in which people are locked up simply on the say so of politicians. To make that equation is to distort what has taken place; none the less, the danger that the Government must recognise is that that is how the Bill will be presented in the popular language, unless it is further amended. The only way out of this situation now is to have an initial judicial role for all types of control order.</p>
	<p pid="a.779.1/3">I finish on this note. However hard we now work to get the Bill in order, it is only a stop-gap measure. It cannot provide the lasting framework that we need to deal with a problem that, I am afraid, will be with us for many years.</p>

	<p pid="a.779.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/851" name="John Denham">The right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> has done the House a service in talking about the Bill as part of the approach that the Government and Parliament need to adapt to the problems of terrorism and justice. One of the issues that matters to me is what happens when someone becomes subject to a control order. Who can speak for them; who can advise them; who can raise queries about them on the basis of information?</p>
	<p pid="a.779.2/2">In evidence provided to the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs six days ago, the special advocates said that they were first briefed by a man from the Treasury solicitors who was not security cleared and who was then unable to provide them with information relevant to the security problems that had to be faced. Even if we believe that 95 per cent. of the people who are fingered or targeted under the legislation are in some sense guilty or rightly suspected, let us assume that neither the Government nor their agencies are 100 per cent. correct. It seems that a special advocate, who is appointed not by the person under suspicion but by the Government, is not allowed to resign. That may be a technical issue for some people, but it really matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.779.2/3">It is significant that the sort of terrorist suspect that we saw during the IRA troubles could secure a lawyer such as Gareth Peirce to establish alibis and demonstrate that suspicions were not well founded. If that is to be thrown away, I firmly believe that the House has a duty not to leave the Bill to the other place, but to call the Government, the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip to account and invite the Home Secretary to explain openly the problems that justify the approach that he is adopting in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.779.2/4">The truth is that some of us, probably including the Leader of the House, took pride in breaking control orders when they were applied to people in South Africa or when prevention of terrorism legislation was used to control people such as the late Reverend Beyers Naude, or when the defence and aid fund was used to channel funds from Scandinavia, north-west Europe and this country in order to defend people in South Africa. Yet the legislation that we are now proposing will prevent people from being defended in a similar way because they will not have been accused. People will not know what they have been charged with.</p>
	<p pid="a.779.2/5">I put that simple point to the Home Secretary and Labour Members, including the 59 who did not vote with the Government in the Lobbies this evening, and to those who should have crept in to join the 59. I hope that those creepers will feel ashamed of themselves for their inaction this evening. Just eight more hon. Members would have changed the result of the vote. I hope that the media, who occasionally watch our proceedings, will grasp the significance of how close the Government came to defeat on a simple point of justice and law. The Government have got it wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.779.2/6">The Government should not simply pass the buck to the House of Lords. They should come back before this House and test the arguments again. They should reflect on what the Select Committee has suggested. I hope that they are strong and brave enough to improve the Bill through proper debate and agreement. They need to secure the best possible protection against terrorism without throwing justice and the tenets of democracy out with the bathwater.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.780.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/885" speakername="Mark Fisher" colnum="780"  time="023:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-46.htm#50228-46_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.780.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly in the debate. I want to say that none of those who voted in favour of the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/927" name="Win Griffiths">the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths)</phrase> and against the Government on various other provisions are unaware of the dangers of terrorism. Indeed, I do not believe that a single Member is complacent or soft on terrorism. We are all, frankly, frightened and concerned about it. The idea that any one of us cares more about the security of this country than anyone else is a wrong-headed mistake. Every Member cares deeply, on behalf of constituents, about the security of this country and would do nothing to put it at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.780.0/2">Nevertheless, as the Home Secretary has seen, many of us remain unconvinced by the Bill or the way it has been conducted. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/851" name="John Denham">the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase>, whose contributions on both days have been distinguished and extremely thoughtful, was typically generous to the Government in saying that the detention orders did not really amount to Executive action. Whether my right hon. Friend is right or wrong, the Home Secretary has moved some way today. Given that he has done so, many Members are baffled   about why he cannot go the whole way and move on both derogating and non-derogating orders. It is incomprehensible.</p>
	<p pid="a.780.0/3">The Home Secretary was wholly unconvincing in his answers today, and it is not at all brave of me to predict that the Bill will be changed in the other place. I do not know why the Home Secretary insisted on resisting that change here, in the democratic Chamber of our Parliament, when he must know that his position is illogical and will not do. It will be thrown out, and we will back here again in a few days' time. He will then have to explain to the House why he has had to think again and why the Executive will not be involved in the decision on either type of order. It baffles me why he has not given way on that today, but I am sure that that will change. There is no point in getting heated about it, because it will change.</p>
	<p pid="a.780.0/4">Many of us have been so distracted by that issue today that we hardly noticed that we did not have a chance to express our grave concerns about evidence in these matters. That part of the Bill has not even been explored. I would have thought that every Member of this House, regardless of party politics, must be concerned about somebody's liberty being put at risk without their even knowing of what they are accused. I accept that the Home Secretary will say, &quot;Ah, these are very difficult matters. These are very dangerous people.&quot; Well, we came across those issues in Northern Ireland and nobody pretends that there is an easy call to make, but surely we can do better than we have done with this Bill? There must be avowals that we can put in place to allow a judicial process to hear the evidence and let the accused know of it&mdash;even if only in the most general way, as my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> said. It is essential that someone on a charge that threatens to remove their liberty should have the right to hear the evidence against them.</p>

	<p pid="a.781.0/1">Is not there also a danger to our security if one of these orders is imposed too early on, say, a junior member of a network, before the intelligence services have learned as much as they might do and before they have evidence to bring a charge of conspiracy? We would then be in a worse position because the other members of the network would be alerted.</p>

	<p pid="a.782.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, because that is a very good point. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen made a similar point. That is a concern that is shared across the House, and it is a valuable contribution to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.0/2">The issue of evidence, and the accused's right to hear it, is difficult, but we must be able to do better than the present Bill. The same applies to intercept evidence. It is a difficult issue, as the Home Secretary rightly pointed out to us, but we have not really attempted to grapple with it at this stage. We must do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.0/3">Parliament has been bounced. We have had three years to think about this issue and we have failed to do so. That is not only the fault of the Government, because Members have not bombarded the Government with demands for debates or further legislation. Many of us, on both sides of the House, knew that this issue was simmering, but we, just as much as the Government, failed to do anything. However, we have undoubtedly been bounced in the past week. The Bill was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-22">22 February</phrase>, and only six days later we have had a rushed Second Reading and&mdash;to the huge discredit of this Chamber&mdash;a farce of a Committee stage, in which we have not properly considered the Bill. That is what we are sent here to do by our constituents. We are sent here to scrutinise legislation and to try to make our laws good, sensible and workable. We have failed tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.0/4">The Government did not help by bouncing the Bill through on a ridiculous programme motion, but we had the ability to throw that out. We could have said to the Government, &quot;Don't be ridiculous. On a Bill of this enormous constitutional importance, we cannot accept a ridiculous timetable like that.&quot; We can certainly warm our hands at the indignity of the Government, who have imposed the measure on us, but we, too, are to blame because it was in our hands to throw out that thoroughly discreditable programme motion. We are as much to blame as the Government.</p>

I made a short contribution at the end of that debate deploring the fact that so few Members were in attendance for such an important Bill.

	<p pid="a.783.3/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/897" name="Michael Jabez Foster">the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster)</phrase> misses my point. Of course, Members on both sides of the House are entitled to vote and to believe passionately what they believe. We are all honourable Members and we have serious views. I am not complaining that my hon. Friend does not feel the same way about things as me. I am saying that the House has not had time to go into the detail of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.3/2">There is a schedule that explains how control orders work, but we have not had a moment&mdash;not even a minute&mdash;to discuss it. These are serious matters, but we have not taken them seriously. I fully respect my hon. Friend's views and opinions, but we have not scrutinised a hugely important Bill. We have not done ourselves credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.3/3">We are sent here to scrutinise. I feel that on these Benches we have put too much blind trust in party and have not trusted enough in our own consideration. However, everybody comes to their own view. It is not yet beyond the wit of the House to get this right. The extraordinary thing about the debate is that beneath the criticism and, sometimes, the bad temper there is clearly a will on both sides of the House to get the Bill right. There were flickerings of that when the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary invited the other parties to Downing street. It is clear that everybody, because they are concerned about the threat of terrorism, wants to try to find a solution, but that will not be achieved by the adversarial process inherent in both our judicial system and the House; it must be through consensus and debate. Intercept evidence in court and other matters are difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.3/4">We shall not reach a solution by opposing each other. The Government must go into discussion with the other parties. I detect good will from all the other parties in the House to try to find a solution and a compromise.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.3/5">I do not pay attention to the opinion polls that the Home Secretary was shoving down our throats. I do not think that the public will take it kindly if we come up with ill considered, ill-thought-out legislation. They will not respect us. We should give ourselves the time to come up with the difficult and quite subtle things that are needed to sort out these problems. I believe that we can do that, but it is ridiculous that we are now dependent on the other place. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves, and we ought to learn from this and ensure that the House insists in future on its will to have time to debate important legislation and the wit, good will and respect for one another to come to difficult, but possible, compromises.</p>

	<p pid="a.784.0/1">The good hon.

Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase>. However, they are confronted by the same question as all other Members are confronted with: should the Bill, as unamended, have a Third Reading? That is the question. The Home Secretary's long exegesis about the dreams that he will have down in another place is irrelevant to the vote that we take tonight. Do we, the House of Commons, approve of the Bill that we have been discussing today? It is simple as that.</p>

	<p pid="a.784.2/2">If we vote for the Bill, it is an expression by the House that it believes in every clause and detail of it. All the arguments that we have heard today, including the exegesis by the Home Secretary, have demonstrated again and again in which way and what way the Bill is flawed. Some of us feel deeply and passionately that it is flawed because it touches on the very intimacy of the relationship of the British citizen to the British state. It suggests fundamentally and profoundly to many of us that the due process of law is that we should know with what we are charged, and we should be able to answer that charge before we lose our liberty. That is so profound and fundamental that the justification for change must be clear and overwhelming. That is not in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.2/3">What the Bill says relates to orders. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/892" name="Barbara Follett">the hon. Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett)</phrase> so compellingly told the House last Wednesday, the pass laws of South Africa stand out as a beacon of what we should not do. The actions taken by Mr. Mugabe in pursuit of his ends or by the Burmese junta are not appropriate for this country. That passionate belief has been expounded across the Floor of the House both last Wednesday and again today, but we come back to what we do when the vote on Third Reading is called.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.2/4">The Bill must not be passed even in the terms that the Home Secretary has presented us with this afternoon, when he says that this is not the Bill that the country will be presented with if it becomes an Act of Parliament. If that is the case, how can we be self-respecting and stand up for the rights and appropriateness of the House by voting for the Bill when we know that it is not the Act of Parliament that will pass? So we should, in our sense of being who we are as a Parliament, reject it.</p>

	<p pid="a.790.2/1">I am most grateful to the House for this opportunity to raise this important issue in my constituency. At the heart of this debate is the proposed closure of an elderly mental health in-patient unit with 16 beds at a facility known as the Alan Conway Court at Doddington hospital near March.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/2">I understand the situation in which the Minister finds himself&mdash;I am most grateful to him for replying to the debate&mdash;in so far as I have been in his position. I was the Minister responsible for health in Northern Ireland for two and a half years before 1997, during which closures of hospitals and facilities came up fairly regularly, so I am fully aware of such situations and sympathise with all those from the Minister downwards who have to deal with often difficult decisions. I also recognise that the Minister's response would normally be, &quot;That's all very well, but we devolve these decisions to the strategic health authorities and the primary care trusts, and the closure of a small hospital in someone's constituency doesn't really come within my ambit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/3">However, it is important that I raise the issue not just because it is very important to those in my constituency who are concerned, but because it reflects a more general situation in the health service, particularly in the provision of mental health services throughout the country. Lessons of a more general nature could be learned as a result of looking at and focusing on what has happened in this case, as there are mitigating circumstances surrounding the proposed closure. In microcosm it highlights some of the problems that are being faced and dealt with by many of those running mental health trusts throughout the country, and by those in the PCTs whose responsibility is on the one hand to deliver Government mental health policy and on the other to make extremely difficult decisions about their overall funding positions.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/4">There are two key players in the scenario. First, there is the amalgamated Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, which according to internal memorandums inherited a deficit of &pound;2.5 million at inception. After a very short period in operation, the predicted deficit for the current financial year had risen to some &pound;4.5 million. I have in front of me some notes from a board meeting held on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>, which state:</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/5" class="indent">&quot;The Trust has an underlying deficit of over &pound;4 million arising from an inherited deficit (&pound;2.5 million) and cost pressures associated with national mental health strategy and technical and fiscal policy changes. Recent surveys show that most mental health Trusts throughout the country face the same problems . . . local funding proposals do not enable the Trust to meet its statutory obligation to achieve financial balance and to address nationally determined priority service developments without reducing some of its existing services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/6">So, there are two points from the board itself: cost pressures in meeting Government targets and policy changes, and the fact that it does not have the financial resources to meet them without reducing some of the existing services.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/7">The trust's financial position was complicated by its history. Its services were formerly provided by seven predecessor organisations, some of which had dissolved, such as Lifespan Healthcare NHS Trust and North West Anglia Healthcare NHS Trust, but most of which have continued to provide other services&mdash;for example, Addenbrooke's hospital and Hinchingbrooke Healthcare NHS Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/8">The process of identifying the direct and indirect costs of mental health services in those organisations was extremely complicated and it was accepted that some costs could not be released in the short term and that some might never be realisable. In January 2004, at a key meeting with the local PCTs and the SHA, it was agreed that the trust had inherited a deficit of &pound;2.5 million and outline proposals were agreed for dealing with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/9">In a written answer, I was surprised to learn that the Department of Health does not seem to realise that the amalgamation to form the new trust included not only Lifespan Healthcare NHS Trust and North West Anglia Healthcare NHS Trust, but five other hospital trusts within the county. This is the written answer that the Minister signed off:</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/10" class="indent">&quot;I am advised that Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Mental Health Trust&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/11">a clever use of the word &quot;advised&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/12" class="indent">&quot;did not inherit any deficit from its predecessor bodies. Surpluses were reported in both 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-02-03.1118"><i>Official Report</i>, 3 February 2005; Vol. 430, c. 1118W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/13">With the best will in the world, my constituents might give a bit of fair wind to the local trusts in reaching certain conclusions, but when they see and read that the DOH does not know what is going on in Cambridgeshire, they are more inclined to think that the wrong decisions have been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/14">The second player in this scenario is East Cambridgeshire and Fenland Primary Care Trust. In the current year, it is &pound;7.9 million below its formula funding level, which is about 6 per cent. below target, and it is been well below its funding formula target since its inception. Initially, it was funded by the area health authority, and in the past two years the DOH has funded it, but it has always had a funding shortfall. Both the two key players making the decision are stressed financially. One has got a fairly substantial deficit and the other has been trying to deliver Government policy with a 5 to 6 per cent. shortfall in its funding formula since it was formed.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/15">I accept that the Government have recently addressed the problem of the underfunding of PCTs. It would be churlish for me not to welcome the substantial increase that the East Cambridgeshire and Fenland PCT will receive for the next two years, starting next year&mdash;our PCT has received one of the largest increases, which is welcome. At the end of those two years, however, the PCT will still be 3.5 per cent. below its funding level, which is better than 6 per cent. below, but I calculate that it will still be &pound;7 million in deficit by 2007. That ongoing funding shortfall will not help to fund current service pressures from providers such as the mental health trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/16">The reconfiguration of the area health authorities and the PCTs in my constituency meant that the new PCT inherited two in-patient elderly mental health units, one in Wisbech at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, King's Lynn, which was in the North West Anglia Healthcare NHS Trust area, and the other at Alan Conway Court, Doddington hospital, near March. Some of the problems have arisen as a result of Government policy and tinkering with the organisation of health care delivery in places such as Cambridgeshire with the development of PCTs and the reconfiguration of the Cambridgeshire Mental Health Trust. That has meant that the current PCT inherited two elderly mental health in-bed units, perhaps in the wrong geographical locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/17">The trust approached all the PCTs in Cambridgeshire to help fund its deficit. Without spare funds&mdash;as I pointed out, the East Cambridgeshire and Fenland PCT was well below its funding target&mdash;it was forced to consider service reductions to help balance the books of the mental health trust. That was confirmed to me in a letter from the chief executive of the Cambridgeshire Mental Health Trust in June 2004. The proposal was to close the Alan Conway Court facility, thus saving some &pound;500,000 in operational costs for the trust. The PCT would save some &pound;350,000 because it would reinvest &pound;150,000 of that &pound;500,000 to boost the community mental health service which, as the report pointed out, was under-developed in that part of Cambridgeshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/18">The report from the Cambridgeshire Mental Health Trust suggested that the decision to close the unit was predicated not solely on the requirement to save money, but on the assessment that the East Cambridgeshire and Fenland PCT area was over-provided with in-patient beds and under-provided with community mental health services. That is somewhat surprising, because a recent National Institute for Mental Health in England survey demonstrated that the trust as a whole&mdash;that is, the Cambridgeshire Mental Health Trust&mdash;has fewer acute beds than the average for the strategic health authority, and that the authority has fewer beds than the average for England. Even so, the number of people who need to be sent to expensive out-of-county placements, often outside the NHS, is comparatively low. Community staffing levels are also significantly below average.So the report from the National Institute for Mental Health in England states that although there might be more beds in one PCT area, the county as a whole is rather low on acute beds. I am puzzled why the conclusion has been reached that we could close a 16-bed unit when the evidence points in an entirely different direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/19">Another important consideration is the population profile, which in the case of East Cambridgeshire and Fenland is skewed towards an elderly population. After Greater Peterborough, the PCT area had the second highest population over 65 in the whole county. It also had the highest proportion of over-65s to total population of any PCT and was also the fastest-growing group of over-65s. Perhaps the decision was based on short-termism rather than looking at the future, even the immediate future. There is a fear that the facility may be closed this year or next year, and a few years down the line we will say, &quot;Pity we did that because we need such a facility for our growing population.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/20">The point is emphasised by the letter I received recently from Lord Rooker, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-18">18 February</phrase>. I quote:</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/21" class="indent">&quot;I am writing to you in relation to the Department of Health announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-09">9 February</phrase> about their revenue allocations to Primary Care Trusts for 2006/07 and 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/22" class="indent">I have been working closely with John Hutton, Minister for Health, and we are fully committed to establishing healthy sustainable communities in the growth areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/23">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/24" class="indent">      &quot;The Department of Health has now included a Growth Areas Adjustment in determining 2006/07 and 2007/08 target allocations to Primary Care Trusts in the Growth Areas that will shortly experience additional burdens from high levels of growth . . . The Growth Area Adjustment is of course one element in working out the final resource allocation for each PCT, but it is important that we give proper recognition to the needs of growing communities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/25">In population terms, Cambridgeshire is probably one of the fastest-growing counties in the country, with a disproportionately fast-growing elderly population. It is a very attractive area in which to settle. One can sell one's house in London or the south-east, buy a much cheaper house in the fenland area, and put the rest in the bank. Large numbers of people are retiring to the area, and they will eventually feed through into putting greater pressure on resources of this kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/26">Another ingredient in the equation is the fact that when East Cambridgeshire PCT amalgamated with Fenland PCT&mdash;there are so many amalgamations going on that one sometimes gets rather confused&mdash;an arrangement was made whereby elderly, mentally infirm patients, some with dementia or Alzheimer's, would go to Fulbourn hospital on the edge of Cambridge. It is felt in my constituency that were that arrangement not in place, the facility at Alan Conway Court at Doddington could just as easily meet the requirements of some of the people who live in east Cambridgeshire. In some respects, we seem to be robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Alan Conway Court facility is to close, while the Fulbourn unit in Cambridge is sustained by the purchasing of services from the amalgamated trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/27">Local people are very disillusioned with the so-called consultation process, because once it had begun they were told that they were not being consulted on whether the unit at Alan Conway Court should close, but on the implications and ramifications of such a closure. In other words, the closure seemed to be a done deal. It will therefore come as no surprise that this has left a very bitter taste.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/28">More recently, over the past year the county council's health and social care scrutiny committee and the four former area health and social care scrutiny panels have considered in detail the mental health services in the county. The scrutiny committee said:</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/29" class="indent">&quot;The Government's National Service Framework . . . for mental health requires the development of a range of specialist community services: early intervention, crisis resolution and assertive outreach . . . There are two key challenges associated with the development of these services in Cambridgeshire.&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/30">First:</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/31" class="indent">&quot;The need to maintain existing levels of acute provision until community services are developed, at a time of great budgetary pressure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/32">The second key point that it mentions is:</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/33" class="indent">&quot;The need to develop services which both comply with the requirements of the NSF and also reflect local needs and the diversity of the County.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/34">The health and social care scrutiny committee recognised that all health partners in Cambridgeshire&mdash;the strategic health authority, the mental health trust and the four primary care trusts&mdash;operate in a context of deficit budgets for 2004&ndash;05 and severe financial constraints in 2005&ndash;06. The committee will discuss the most effective ways of lobbying nationally and at strategic health authority level for the Government to give greater priority to mental health in their guidance to primary care trusts on the allocation of funding and more national health service resources for mental health in Cambridgeshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/35">A decision was made to close a relatively small in-patient unit, which is only a decade old, for dementia and Alzheimer's sufferers in the village of Doddington outside the town of March in a rural area. It was built partly with subscriptions from local people and was much respected and valued by them. More than that, it was loved by those people, who care deeply about the facility. Out of the decision to close it, partly to save money and perhaps partly to reconfigure the service with a greater emphasis on community mental health provision, we realise that there are problems nationally with mental health service provision, funding for mental health and setting centralised targets by the Government, which are not adequately funded through the system. That all creates the sort of difficulties that I outlined.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.2/36">I do not expect the Under-Secretary to leap up and say that he will intervene to stop the closure. I hope that he does but I do not expect it. However, I should like him to consider some of my points. After all, when the mental health trust amalgamated, the area health authority promised that any deficits would be made good. That has not happened. We no longer have an area health authority but somebody&mdash;hopefully, the strategic health authority&mdash;should honour the commitment. With an extra &pound;2.5 million, the closure need not go ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.794.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1124" name="Malcolm Moss">the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss)</phrase> on securing the debate and the courteous way in which he has marshalled his arguments. However, as he predicted, I must begin by disabusing him of one or two matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/2">Despite what the hon. Gentleman might believe to be the case, the Cambridge and Peterborough Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust has had a balanced financial position since its formation in 2002. I readily acknowledge that that was a significant achievement, given that, as he said, seven separate organisations were merged to create the trust. We should pay tribute to the staff who achieved that.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/3">&quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, which is the Government's policy to shift power to local level, means that the decisions are for the local primary care trusts and the local mental health trust to make. The hon. Gentleman cited a written answer from me in which I said that the local trust &quot;advised&quot; me of specific facts&mdash;that is precisely what it means. I was &quot;advised&quot; because the decisions are no longer a matter for central Government but for the local trusts. It is up to them to balance their books and decide how they will configure their services.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/4">By devolving funding to the front line, we have given the NHS the power to make decisions where they are best made and by the people who are best capable of making them&mdash;in the local area by local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/5">The hon. Gentleman said that, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-09">9 February</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that &pound;135 billion had been allocated to English primary care trusts for the financial years 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. The money will guarantee that the NHS continues to move forward. As a direct result of the &pound;135 billion, the hon. Gentleman's PCT&mdash;East Cambridgeshire and Fenland PCT&mdash;will receive &pound;179.2 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;203.9 million in 2007&ndash;08. Those figures represent a cash increase of &pound;48.5 million or 31.2 per cent. over the two years, compared with a national average of 19 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/6">It is worth adding that that investment is well in excess of what would have been available to the hon. Gentleman's constituents if NHS funding had been delivered using the distribution formula that we inherited from the previous Conservative Government. When he says that, even at the end of the two years, the PCT will be 3 per cent. behind target, that target is the one that this Government have set as the figure that we would like his PCT ultimately to reach. It is substantially more than the previous Conservative Government's formula would have allowed his local PCT and the local population to have.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/7">I turn now to the level of funding available for the provision of services for those with a mental illness in North-East Cambridgeshire. First, I want to stress that the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust has received an increase in its income of &pound;18.2 million since 2002&ndash;03, which means that its income this year is &pound;113.5 million. As I said at the start of my speech, the trust has achieved financial balance in its first two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned an underlying deficit of &pound;2.5 million, or &pound;4.5 million, depending on how people wish to express it. Since the trust has achieved, and is achieving, financial balance, I can only assume that his definition of an underlying deficit is the difference between the amount of money that the trust has to spend on services and the amount that it would like to spend on services. It is not an actual debt or deficit.</p>

	<p pid="a.795.1/1">Very briefly, as the hon. Gentleman has not given me much time to respond.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.795.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1124" speakername="Malcolm Moss" colnum="795"  time="024:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-50.htm#50228-50_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.795.2/1">This is an important point. A real deficit was inherited, and it built up. Otherwise, why would the mental health trust call in the PCTs and tell them that if it did not receive additional funding from them, it would have to cut services to save money, which is what happened in the East Cambridgeshire and Fenland PCT?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-02-28a.796.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1029" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="796"  time="024:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/debtext/50228-50.htm#50228-50_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.796.0/1">My understanding is that there might have been a notional inherited debt from the merger. However, it has accrued year on year, so it has not been necessary for the PCT to eat into that sum of money in any particular year. The fact is that the trust is achieving financial balance and it will relieve the debt of &pound;2.5 million&mdash;or &pound;4.5 million, whichever it is&mdash;by disposing of unwanted assets over a period of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/2">That is very different from suggesting that Alan Conway Court is part of the reconfiguration of the services. Indeed, the PCT and the trust have suggested to me that, irrespective of any saving that they might achieve from Alan Conway Court, they would still want to carry out the reconfiguration. That is because they want to put money into providing services for people in their own home. People do not want to be put into that type of facility nowadays, so the PCT and the trust want to increase the level of service available to people at home. That is why the reconfiguration is taking place, and the money that will be saved by it will be put to that purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/3">As I said earlier, it is our policy that local NHS bodies should decide the priorities for local services. They have the specific knowledge and expertise to make those decisions, and that is very much the case with Alan Conway Court's in-patient facility. I stress that Alan Conway Court is not closing; it is only the in-patient facility that is being closed under the proposals. It is my understanding that the PCT and the mental health partnership trust have conducted a 10-week joint public consultation process relating to the reconfiguration of mental health services for older people in the area, which concluded in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/4">The options included closing the Alan Conway Court in-patient facility and consolidating in-patient beds at Rowan Lodge. Doing this will allow investment in the community mental health team. This proposal is not driven by any cash limitations, real or imagined. I am advised by the mental health trust that, even if it had an endless pot of money, it would still be reconfiguring the services that it provides, in order to provide services in people's own homes&mdash;</p>
