<p>I beg, to move, "That this House do now adjourn."<br/>
The House will have learned with the deepest sorrow of the grievous news which has come to us from across the Atlantic, and conveys to us the loss of the famous President of the United States, whose friendship for the cause of freedom and for the causes of the weak and poor have won him immortal renown. It is not fitting that we should continue our work this day. I feel that the House will wish to render its token of respect to the memory of this great departed statesman and war leader, by adjourning immediately.<br/>
I propose that on Tuesday next tributes should be paid when we are assembled here, by the Leaders of the various parties in the House, and that we should afterwards proceed with the Business already announced. A further statement will be made relating to the Business for Friday.</p>
