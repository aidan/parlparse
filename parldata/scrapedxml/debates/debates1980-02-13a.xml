<p>The Government believe that the non-proliferation treaty is the best defence against nuclear weapons proliferation. As a depository Power, the United Kingdom tries to persuade others to adhere to the treaty, which now has 113 parties. We have fully observed our obligations under the treaty and the Nuclear Suppliers Group arrangements on nuclear exports.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that there will be widespread support for the proposal that the Government's main effort in this vital subject should be through the non-proliferation treaty review conference due this summer? Does he agree that there is a unique opportunity at present, in view of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the reappraisal of defence needs in that area, when some countries calling for help have not yet subscribed to the non-proliferation treaty? Does he agree that Pakistan and other nations that seek help at this time, from us and our Allies, should be encouraged to participate in the non-proliferation treaty?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. President Zia has said that Pakistan has no intention of acquiring a nuclear weapon or transferring nuclear technology to other countries. The best course, as my hon. Friend says, would be for Pakistan to sign the treaty. It has said that this would have to be accompanied by a signature from India. If there is anything that the Government can do to help forward that process, we shall do so.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman, who follows this matter closely, knows the measures that we have taken. They have been discussed in this House. As regards defence help for Pakistan, we are not involved in that proposal but we are discussing, as has been stated, with our partners and Allies, possible forms of help to that country.</p>

<p>This development on nonproliferation is to be welcomed, but would it not be realistic to accept that many countries, whether we like it or not, will develop nuclear weapons for the same reasons that we and other nations have done so? Is it not time to look again at the overall policy and, perhaps, consider examining regional agreements that might be more effective in stabilising the balance of power elsewhere in the world?</p>

<p>There is something in that. As the hon. Gentleman knows, some Latin American countries have come together in discussions on those lines. There will be the conference reviewing the progress of the non-proliferation treaty probably towards the end of the summer or early autumn. We intend to take a full part.</p>

<p>Will the Minister say what export licensing orders and arrangements are still in force restricting the supply of components that could be used in the manufacture of nuclear equipment in Pakistan and other countries?

<p>As the right hon. Gentleman knows, from his last office, these export controls are in being. They are looked at from time to time. We have recently tightened them to take account of the latest developments. The INFCE discussion to which he refers is still in being. I understand that there is a final meeting shortly. It has cleared the ground a good deal and removed some of the misconceptions. We believe that the final documents, when they emerge, will contain useful guidance for the future.</p>

<p>When the Secretary of State meets Mr. Vance will he convey to him the congratulations of the Government and of most hon.

<p>I shall certainly see that my right hon. and noble Friend conveys my hon. Friend's congratulations to Mr. Vance. Of course, we are disappointed, as are many people, that the IOC decided as it did. We remain of the view that it would be preferable to remove the summer Games from Moscow, because any other course would appear to condone Soviet aggression in Afghanistan and allow the Soviet Union a propaganda victory&#x2014;</p>

<p>Therefore, the Government will continue to consult the growing number of countries that, happily, share our view on this issue. We shall consider with them the options that are open to us as a result of the IOC decision. An important part of the consultation will naturally be the European Community ministerial meeting to be held in Rome on 19 February. After these consultations, and in the light of a study of all the possibilities, the Government will convey their views to the British Olympic Association, which is due to meet on 4 March</p>

<p>It would be silly for my right hon. and noble Friend to complain in any way about the transport of 1,800 American troops when there are about 70,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan.

<p>I agree very much with the drift of the first part of my hon. Friend's question, but I do not at all agree with the second part. The Soviet Union is the only country that has interfered internally in Afghanistan, and we want it to remain that way&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I should make clear that we deplore the Soviet action, but we have no intention whatever of following suit.</p>

<p>Does not the Lord Privy Seal agree that the danger of peace is in the lack of a co-ordinate Western response at a time of crisis, and that some of the events of the last few weeks have echoed the lack of unity that was apparent at the time of the Yom Kippur war? Does he agree that political co-operation seems to work only at times of calm, and that the West seems to fall apart every time there is a real crisis? Should not the right hon. Gentleman be talking to Mr. Vance about that?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is taking an unduly pessimistic view. It is not suprising that there should have been initial differences of perception about the dangers of what happened in Afghanistan, and a difference of reaction. There have been definite signs of convergence over the last few weeks, and I am confident that that process will continue.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend has no plans to meet the President of the Cuban Council of State. Her Majesty's Government's relations with the Republic of Cuba, which we would like to be more substantial, are constrained because Cuban foreign policy appears to be conducted in concert with the Soviet Union.

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. Does he not think that recent events in Afghanistan have perhaps turned President Castro into a Cinderella among the non-aligned nations?

<p>The size of the United States forces in Diego Garcia is around 1,900. As the hon. Gentleman knows,

the two agreements of 1966 and 1976&#x2014;signed by the then Labour Government&#x2014;provide for comunications and support facilities for the United States. In recent weeks the United States has asked for an extension of those facilities in order to improve the staging and handling capacity there. These arrangements are within the understandings reached between our two Governments and are perfectly in order. We have agreed to meet the request. As far as the Ilois community is concerned, the issue goes back to 1965 and 1966 when the then Labour Government decided that the inhabitants should be asked to move to Mauritius. In the 1970s the British Government gave compensation of &#x00A3;655,000. With accrued interest, that figure totals almost &#x00A3;1 million. That is compensation, in particular for resettlement of the Ilois community in Mauritius.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that, in the context of recent events in the Indian Ocean, the Gulf and elsewhere, there are strong arguments for increasing the facilities available to the United States in Diego Garcia?

<p>Is the Minister aware that what we do, or do not do, in Diego Garcia is a sensitive issue? Does not his statement supersede the clear statement made by the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the hon.

<p>I will take the latter point first. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman in that I did not complete my earlier answer. There is an outstanding offer of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;25 million, which is not for


resettlement since that is a separate issue. It is an ex-gratia payment for the removal of those people from the Chagos archipeligo to Mauritius. That offer is outstanding and has not been finalised.<br/>
As far as the provision of additional facilities is concerned, the hon. Gentleman knows that there have been additional serious developments since then. Talks have taken place at official level between the United States and Great Britain and the Americans have asked for additional staging capacity in that area.</p>

<p>I can confirm that, so far as is known, there is no question of the 1 per cent. limit being penetrated this year and that it does not have any immediate application to our budget problem. The House is aware of our approach to these matters. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said after the Dublin conference that progress had been made&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, it had. The inhibitions have been taken off the 1975 mechanism which was negotiated by the Labour Government and which was singularly ineffective. The Commission was invited to make proposals for increasing expenditure in the United Kingdom. It has now done so. After Dublin the Prime Minister said that our objective was a genuine compromise but she pointed out that we had little room for manoeuvre. That is still the position.</p>

<p>The House knows that the Lord Privy Seal has been spending a substantial amount of time on political philosophy as well as on his departmental duties in recent weeks. I should like to press him further on the reply that he gave earlier, when he said that he did not know whether any serious thought was being given to possible counter-measures that the British Government might take if we failed to reach a satisfactory solution on the broad balance of the budget. Is he, in effect, saying that no studies are being made inside the Foreign Office? If so, will he start them forthwith?</p>

<p>The problem of intimidation of voters in the rural areas, the scope of which has now been confirmed to the Governor by the British election supervisors, continues to cause great concern. The Governor has enacted an ordinance enabling him to suspend elections in any area where systematic intimidation makes it impossible for a fair election to be held. He has also listed a number of areas where intimidation is particularly severe. This should warn those of whatever party who seek to deprive others of the right to campaign freely and peacefully of the possible consequences of their actions.<br/>
The Government will also be taking positive measures to strengthen supervision of the elections by sending a large number of additional personnel from the United Kingdom to be present in polling stations in rural areas, to ensure that the arrangements for voting are scrupulously fair.<br/>
As the House will be aware, there has been a further deplorable attack upon Mr. Mugabe. Investigations are being pursued. The Governor will continue to take firm measures to deal with intimidation, violence and breaches of the ceasefire from whatever quarter.

<p>First, I thank the Lord Privy Seal for that statement. In particular, I welcome the fact that additional British personnel will be in Rhodesia to help supervise the electoral polling day arrangements, as I understand the right hon. Gentleman to say. I also strongly associate myself with his remarks about the second attempt to assassinate Mr. Mugabe. We are all conscious that intimidation, breaches of the ceasefire and assassination attempts are a great danger in the remaining two or three weeks of the Rhodesian elections.<br/>
We accept that the Governor and his small British staff are doing their best in difficult circumstances, but is the Lord Privy Seal aware that in all that they do they have not only to be fair but to be seen to be fair? That is not so easy. Is he also aware of the growing concern that the advice and information that the Governor and his British staff receive from the Rhodesian military and civil authorities is strongly biased? That is a major problem. How can the Government accept the treatment of the former Prime Minister, Mr. Garfield Todd? Surely, control of prosecutions is one of the powers vested in the Governor? Therefore, why does he not arrange for a <i>noble prosequi,</i> instead of allowing the case against Mr. Todd to proceed?<br/>
On the question of the powers for disenfranchising electors in the various districts, the question arises, who will give the Governor advice about the areas where intimidation is said to be most intense? What use is being made of the Commonwealth observer team? It is a pretty high-powered group of experienced people who have been sent to assist in precisely this and other tasks. On the question of publicly accepting the Lancaster House agreement and the outcome of the elections&#x2014;to which we all attach enormous importance&#x2014;will the Lord Privy Seal extend an invitation to Mr. Ian Smith to join the other party leaders in publicly reaffirming his commitment to the outcome of procedures at Lancaster House, thereby withdrawing his remarks of yesterday about not accepting the election results if they go the way that he dislikes?<br/>
Will the Lord Privy Seal make a major new effort to activate the part of the Lancaster House agreement which, in the absence of any third force for securing peace and the ceasefire arrangements, places the major responsibility for dealing with breaches of the ceasefire on the three Army commanders who are directly concerned?</p>

<p>The penultimate question of the right hon. Gentleman is a matter for my right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State. I shall draw his attention to the remarks and we shall try to find out whether or not Mr. Smith has been properly reported.<br/>
I am grateful to the right hon Gentleman for his earlier remarks. There is no doubt that the Governor and his staff have done a remarkable job&#x2014;they are still doing so. They have been unfairly traduced in many quarters. I do not accept the right hon. Gentleman's implications that they are acting on biased advice. He will appreciate from my statement that the advice upon which the Governor was acting when he promulgated his ordinance came from the British election supervisors, who are clear about what they have seen going on in the areas that they visited.<br/>
Let me tell the right hon. Gentleman and the House that Mr. Garfield Todd called on the Rhodesian Attorney-General yesterday and made a statement that brought to light circumstances that he had not previously disclosed to the police.

<p>In view of the widespread and worrying nature of the intimidation, is the Lord Privy Seal sure that the Commonwealth monitoring force is of an adequate size?

<p>The hon. Gentleman will be able to determine the issue on the spot. However, I think that he betrayed a slight misunderstanding of the duties of the monitoring force. However many monitors there are, they will not be able to prevent intimidation. Those who do not speak the language cannot detect guerrillas in a tribal village. Therefore, the problem would not be helped by an increase in the monitoring force. Such an increase would be impractical at this stage.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. It would be immensely helpful if you would make a statement as soon as possible about the applicability of the sub judice rule to actions pending before the courts in Rhodesia. The House should know the rules of sub judice as they affect potential litigation within the realm of the United Kingdom. There are special circumstances, because a Cabinet Minister is Governor of Rhodesia. Questions may arise that are subject to the sub judice rule. It would be helpful to know whether we may properly put questions to Ministers. We do not want to put questions that may be out of order.<br/>
Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, you will be good enough to give this matter your consideration.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to introduce measures for combating terrorism within the United Kingdom.</q>
The war in Northern Ireland has been going on for over 10 years. That is twice as long as it took to subdue Hitler's Germany. There are almost as many troops and police in the Province as the Russians used in their initial invasion of the whole of Afghanistan.<br/>
The Six Counties are still suffering from a campaign of murder and violence, dominated by a hard core of 300 to 400 known thugs and hit men&#x2014;men whose allegiance to their own self-interest, and to what Labour Members would call Fascism, is far greater than their commitment to Irish republicanism.<br/>
Last month, as many hon. Members before me have done, I visited the Province, and the visit left a very strong impression. For all our problems on this side of the mainland, the difference in Northern Ireland is very striking. Any person, as those hon. Members who have been there before me will know, following the road from the hills into Belfast feels that he could be approaching many similar industrial British cities. The difference is soon apparent when one perceives the desolate nature of the first terrace of stone houses with no curtains or glass in the windows but blind spaces, blocked up with breeze-block, their occupants having long since fled to safer areas. The buildings are bricked up to prevent vandalism and terrorist occupation.<br/>
As the road descends into the city, the similarities remind one that it could be Manchester or Cardiff. The differences are, therefore, vivid and chilling. Where there were shops, there are now crude car parks. Where there were pubs and warehouses, only fire-blackened and shuttered-off shells remain. The road is fairly wide, not unlike the main road in any of our major cities, with terraced houses on either side&#x2014;houses but no streets. Where the streets end, there are now 15 ft walls of corrugated iron, built by the local authority to prevent the two communities tearing each other apart. It is as if the two halves of an urban

precinct were opposing fortresses, glaring across at each other.<br/>
Further on, approaching the city centre, one comes to a fortified island in a sea of relative desolation, with 16 constantly manned "frontier" posts, where ordinary people, women and children, are frisked before entry.<br/>
In certain areas of the public imagination&#x2014;and I would say areas of limited imagination&#x2014;the IRA may stand for the ideal of a united Ireland. The reality is quite different. Years of violence have spawned anarchy. Legal authority has been replaced by a mafia of bullies. The way of power and influence in the Catholic ghettoes has been to join the IRA. That way people take notice. That way a young man can command the fastest cars, the girls and good living. Intimidation and protection rackets flourish. Local people are terrorised by the gun and blackmailed by the folklore of a united Ireland. Each enclave has its godfather whose tactics and legitimacy have more in common with the Gestapo than with the founding fathers of the Irish Republic.<br/>
The popular mass movement in the Catholic community in favour of republicanism has subsided. Less than half the Catholic population now want a united Ireland. They, too, are tired of the violence, poverty and serfdom imposed on them by a group of self-appointed gangsters. The IRA has already detached itself from its natural support, maintaining its domination only by the threat of violence and by the moral compulsion exerted by old loyalties.<br/>
These are our people and this is our country. For 10 years they have suffered. For 10 years inadequate Governments have not afforded them the protection and law enforcement to which they are entitled. In that time, 2,000 people, mostly innocent, have lost their lives. The intensity of killing is equivalent to 60,000 people being slaughtered on the mainland or 3,000 in a city the size of Birmingham.<br/>
In such circumstances, it is impossible to imagine that we should not adopt more realistic measures in suppressing the terror. Surely we should be as resolute in Ulster as we should certainly be on the mainland. Surely the separation of the two parts of the kingdom by water in no way absolves those in power from grasping the nettle that public opinion would


force them to grasp were it growing on their own doorstep.<br/>
I am glad that my right hon. Friend has grasped the political initiative. I am glad that, according to reports, it is meeting with success. I anticipate that, in association with the Irish Republic, we shall grasp the military nettle even more firmly.<br/>
This is a vile war, and we should not be squeamish. We should use all the weapons at our disposal. I should like to concentrate on one such weapon, which in the hands of the enemy has been of major effect&#x2014;publicity and propaganda. Terrorism thrives on publicity. Why do terrorists claim responsibility for their gory crimes of which no one could possibly be proud, unless they think that it is to their benefit to do so? Terrorists surely want to be known about. They want credibility. They want credibility to justify their actions so that they can work on the weak-minded, such as the "Troops Out" movement. Why do they have a political branch? Why do they have Sinn Fein unless they want a political campaign to educate the public?<br/>
Why help them to do it? It gives them a kick and boosts their morale when their actions are blazed across the newspapers of the world. Will it not be disheartening, if, after an energetic campaign, they are confronted with blank screens? Do they not want to enlarge their presence by banner headlines throughout the nation about future bombing campaigns? It does not matter whether they take place; they have had the publicity and gained the benefit.<br/>
Why set up mock ambushes for gullible enthusiasts from the BBC if no benefit will accrue? Why parade to the cameras and claim with pride the murder of such noble people as Airey Neave unless they felt there was a useful purpose in doing so? Why do we play their games? Why, as is often the case in newspaper coverage, are IRA apologists given space equal to that of the legal authorities? To take an example, I have here an IRA statement that describes the reactions of politicians as sickening and hypocritical. It says that it is their collective activity, in collaboration with the British Forces, which prolongs the war and the misery that it creates. It offers to all bereaved families deepest and heartfelt sympathy.

That appeared in a major newspaper. Why do we give money to such publications as this through the Arts Council of Great Britain?</p>

<p>My suggestion is that it should be an offence for any person knowingly to publish or distribute written material or to broadcast material that is likely to assist any organisation or person engaged in or contemplating acts of terrorism.

In that way, it would be on the shelf and unlikely to be used.<br/>
I have no intention or desire to suppress facts. Facts should always be presented but in such a way at least not to help terrorists.<br/>
I fully appreciate the problems of definition in such a Bill, but they are not insuperable and no doubt could be dealt with in Committee. The cry of "Censorship" will go up. At present we have libel laws. I am asking for self-censorship and for a law that would be on the shelf. It would be a law that could be used, but I doubt whether it would ever need to be. It would be a law that would reflect the will of the people, outraged as they are by some of things that they have seen on their television screens.<br/>

<p>I shall put my opposition to the Bill very briefly. It has a great many charms, but it has one defect. It contravenes one of the basic canons of British criminal law. It is a general principle of English law that a person should not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that person intended the prohibited act. In other words, there must be a criminal intention and that element is built into English law in order to protect innocent people from unfair conviction.<br/>
There are a number of exceptions to that general proposition. There are the exceptions of absolute liability, and strict liability and there are also classes of offence where the court will assume that people intend the consequences of their actions. But these are exceptions to a general proposition that people should not be found guilty of a criminal offence unless they intend the prohibited act.<br/>
This House should be very careful not to extend that basic proposition unless there is a clear and compelling reason to do so. I am bound to say that I do</p>

<p>not think that at this time there is any such clear and compelling reason. Judged against these criteria, what we know of my hon. Friend's Bill fails&#x2014;and we know remarkably little because he did not trouble us with it at any great length. Clause 1 fails because it makes certain acts an offence if they are likely to have certain consequences. There is no requirement that the accused person should contemplate these consequences or that he should have foreseen them. Far less is there a requirement that the accused person should have intended these consequences.</p>

<p>Amendments Nos. 80 and 81 simply pave the way to the amendment of the schedule by amendment No. 82.<br/>
The House should be aware that the system of discretionary grants to students in higher education is chaotic. A farcical situation exists, where students apply to various colleges and are selected on a competitive basis. When some students are awarded a place, they attempt to obtain a grant. Many students fail to get a grant, but often some students who fail to obtain a place manage subsequently to obtain a grant. It often happens that the least attractive students, as far as the colleges are concerned obtain a grant and a place in a college, and sometimes a student who appears to the college to be more worth while fails to get a grant.<br/>
The problem that I should like to highlight is one that has been brought to my attention by the British Association of Social Workers and the directors of social service departments, because it concerns the certificate of qualification in social work, where the problem is particularly

acute. There are several ways in which people can gain a qualification in social work, some involving a mandatory award and some involving a discretionary award.<br/>
I ask the Minister to make a modest provision in the Bill so that if and when money is available he can change a discretionary award to a mandatory award. I should prefer the Minister to make that change immediately, but I suspect that if I were to press him his answer would be "Absolutely, No". However, in simply asking him to make the regulations, I hope that he can do something about it as soon as resources are available. I am asking for a very modest measure, which I hope the Minister can accept.<br/>
In Committee the Minister went some way to indicate that he was sympathetic to the problem. I stress that although I emphasised the certificate of qualification in social work I am aware that the problem exists in many other qualifications, particularly for people who have a degree and who then want to obtain a professional qualification. I hope that the Minister can give an assurance that either here or in another place he will accept the amendment.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1721427" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-02-13a.1546.0" hansard_membership_id="10228" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28948" speakername="Mr. Christopher Price" colnum="1546" time="16:10:00">
<p>May I add my support to the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett)? This is not a party matter, but it is a very serious matter for many students who, in the old days, would have automatically qualified for discretionary awards when a reasonable amount of money was available. Now that money available to local authorities is so limited, it is incumbent upon the Minister to take more seriously the national needs when fixing mandatory awards.<br/>
The Minister will be aware that the Select Committee is currently studying the matter. One conclusion that I have reached is that the pattern of mandatory awards fixes what happens in our higher education institutions more than anything else. I hope that the Minister&#x2014;whatever the final outcome of these amendments&#x2014;will be as helpful as possible. I assure him that it is a real problem for qualified manpower, which the nation needs. It is absurd to waste qualified manpower in this way, simply because the Department has not assembled the machinery to add


the social work qualifications, and perhaps others, to those awards which qualify as mandatory.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1721428" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-02-13a.1547.0" hansard_membership_id="1550" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12709" speakername="The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science (Dr. Rhodes Boyson)" colnum="1547" time="16:10:00">
<p>I take the point made by the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) about the difficulty of mandatory and discretionary awards. There is a need for a clarifying and strengthening measure.<br/>
Similarly, I take the point made by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) that where mandatory grants are automatically paid it obviously conditions the courses that are retained and expanded. The whole matter will have to be examined at some stage. I welcome the fact that the Select Committee on education, science and arts is examining the matter. The problem has grown up over the years, and, particularly at a time when local authorities are under pressure due to lack of resources, there is a risk that courses that should exist could be cut back.<br/>
The amendment would empower the Secretary of State to designate any course for a mandatory award at whatever level and whether part-lime or full-time, the only condition being that it would be provided as mentioned in subsection (2) (<i>a</i>), at a university, a college or an institution.<br/>
Clearly, to designate all such courses would be prohibitively expensive at the present time, but presumably the intention is for my right hon. and learned Friend to be selective in regard to the courses that he chooses to designate. I appreciate that. Nevertheless, the amendment would raise the expectations of many groups. Reference has been made, for example, to social workers, particularly in view of the fact that some courses are mandatory and others are discretionary in regard to the awarding of grants. The training procedure for lawyers is expensive, and there have been a good many letters on that question. We have to consider the Open University students. We have to remember all these matters when we are thinking about mandatory and discretionary awards. The problems of part-time students will also have to be examined.<br/>
There is also the question of what is called lifetime or continuing education.

This is a non-party matter. The whole question of part-time students and how they are to be financed must be examined. I hope that the Select Committee is looking at this question.<br/>
In view of the present need to restrain rather than expand public expenditure, there is not at the moment any possibility of meeting such claims. Our estimate is that it would cost about &#x00A3;8 million to accept the amendment. Some people might suggest that it is a negligible amount. Perhaps so, but such sums, taken together add up in the end to a considerable amount.<br/>
We are aware of and concerned about this matter. It is being made more acute because of the problems associated with the resources of local authorities. I am aware that some people accept that at present the resources are not available to enable additional courses to be designated for mandatory awards but who nevertheless&#x2014;I am sure that the two hon. Members who have spoken come within this category&#x2014;wish to see a reserve power in the Bill, to be used only when resources can be made available.<br/>
I cannot say any more at the moment than I said in Committee. I am aware, as we all are, of the strength of the case on this issue. I listened carefully to the arguments put forward in Committee. I acknowledge, as do other hon. Members, that genuine cases have been put to us. The Government will take due note of the views expressed in Committee and this afternoon. Note will also be taken of the discussion when the Bill is dealt with in another place.</p>

<p>We come now to another very important stage in the Bill&#x2014;that which deals with the provision of school milk and school meals.<br/>
The amendment seeks to ensure that all local authorities shall have to provide free school meals for pupils from poorer families where the family is not on family income supplement or supplementary benefit, those categories being covered by the Bill as it stands. We feel that the Secretary of State should lay down income levels and that local authorities should abide by them in regard to the provision of

free school meals. Grouped with the amendment are several other amendments which also deal with the question of entitlement to free school meals.<br/>
The clause that we are seeking to amend does several very important things. Overall, the effect of clause 22 will be to dismantle the school meals system as we know it in this country. The Government will be doing this under the guise of giving new freedom to local authorities, but it will happen nevertheless. The clause is a very serious one because it removes all nutritional standards from school meals provision. The idea is that in future, in regard to the school meals, the policy is to be one of "anything goes". A local authority will be free to provide whatever level of school meals it sees fit to provide. That is in contrast with the present system, under which certain nutritional standards are established by the Secretary of State and local authorities are obliged to abide by them.<br/>
The clause goes even further, in that it also removes the provision and the guarantee that all children from low-income families can get free school meals.<br/>
The clause will lead to a reduction in school meals provision, to higher charges for school meals throughout the country, and to many redundancies among the staff who at present are employed in the school meals service. We believe that the clause and the Bill will have a very serious and detrimental effect not only on the school meals service but also on the educational opportunities of the children.<br/>
When the clause was discussed in Committee, the Minister did not say at any time that he thought that school meals were a bad thing or that they should not be provided. Indeed, the Government are not seeking to cut this form of provision because they think it is wrong to make it. They are cutting it because they want to make savings in the education budget, and have decided that this is a vulnerable area in which local authorities should be free to cut as they wish.<br/>
Local authorities will take advantage of this clause in the Bill as a means of reducing their expenditure. They will also take advantage of it in increasing the price of school meals. The House should be clear about the kinds of prices that


we are talking about. The price of school meals has already been increased once this month in anticipation of the passing of the Bill. The Under-Secretary of State will recall the debate that we had on that occasion. He will also recall the statement made by his right hon. and learned Friend, when the price increase was announced, that the increase had been made pending further increases in the price of school meals which will follow very shortly.<br/>
It is important also to remind the House that we now know the kind of level of prices that local authorities are proposing to charge in the very near future. Some authorities, such as Devon and Warwick, have already announced that they intend to go for a 45p charge immediately the Bill goes through. We know that the Government hope that the Bill will be passed in April. Northampton shire has already said that it intends to charge 55p in April. Other authorities have announced similar levels of charges. Some authorities have gone further and said that they intend to introduce a 60p charge from September of this year or from January 1981.<br/>
The increases in prices that we are talking about are not insubstantial; they are significant and very important. The Minister cannot simply shrug the issue to one side and say that the increases do not matter, or say, as he has said in the past, that when we talked about 50p or 60p school meals we were being alarmist and spreading fear and despondency. Our predications have been proved right, for proposals of the sort that we mentioned are now being adopted by many councils in this country. By this time next year the price of school meals in most areas will have more than doubled as a result of the Bill, at a time when the Government are giving no extra help to families in need and are refusing to increase child benefit or give extra family support.</p>

<p>It is against that background that we have tabled our amendment. Our aim is to minimise the effect on those worst hit by the provision. We also wish to emphasise that there should be a national policy introduced and maintained by the Secretary of State, both in terms of the pricing and the nutritional value of school meals.</p>

<p>Children who receive free school meals in future will not be guaranteed a meal of any particular nutritional value. It is important that we do not shrug off the fact and say that nutritional values do not matter because everyone is well fed these days and children do not need a meal at lunchtime.</p>

<p>In Committee the Under-Secretary almost fell into the trap of saying that it did not matter what sort of meals were provided. He said that there were good reasons for including nutritional standards in the 1944 Act, but he implied that perhaps it did not matter if nutritional standards were now abolished.</p>

<p>However, the Under-Secretary also acknowledged that the changes and the abolition of nutritional standards would cause hardship and problems. Indeed, he even acknowledged that the Bill might bring about a little malnutrition among some children, but he shrugged that off and said that it did not really matter because only a few children would be affected. It is important that the hon. Gentleman was at least honest enough to admit that the Bill and the clause will cause problems.</p>

<p>In Committee many of my hon. Friends pointed out to the Under-Secretary much of the recent evidence about the importance of school meals in children's diets. Has the Minister looked up the articles and surveys, in <i>The Lancet</i> and elsewhere, which prove that school meals are necessary for the children who need a sheet anchor for their nutrition? If the Under-Secretary has not done so, I suggest that he should.

<p>We have only to look at a typical family with two children to see what will happen. When the Bill was introduced in October the price of a school meal was 30p.

<p>The hon. Lady is taking the maximum situation under all the circumstances. There will be alternative provision. Only one-third of the cost of school meals is represented by food; the rest is catering, administration and all the other bits and pieces.

<p>The hon. Member would do well to read the Committee <i>Hansards,</i> because he would see that much evidence was brought before the Committee about the proposed charges that many local authorities have decided to introduce. If the authority charges 60p for a school meal, that will involve a cost of &#x00A3;3 per week per child. I know that the hon. Gentleman has reservations about the new transport charges proposed by the Government&#x2014;he has tabled an amendment on that matter and perhaps the Government will take notice of it&#x2014;but if the new charges are introduced the average family will have to pay &#x00A3;5 a week for each child. That is not an exaggeration. Indeed, depending on what happens to transport charges, it may be an underestimate.<br/>
The new charge of &#x00A3;5 a week simply to send a child to school will obviously cause hardship to many families, but

some families will suffer even more than those who are paying the current rate for school meals. I refer to the families who are entitled to free school meals because they are low-income families.<br/>
Many such families will face an increase not from the current price of a school meal, but from nothing to 50p or 60p a day for each child. They will suddenly have to find &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 or &#x00A3;3 a week for each child. Those families where a parent is working, but not claiming family income supplement or supplementary benefits, will be severely hit by the Government's proposals. They will be forced deeper into the poverty trap. The balance will be tipped in favour of those families being better off not working.<br/>
Over the years we have heard a great deal from Conservative hon. Members about the problems of the poverty trap and how it is wrong that people should be better off on social security than in work. Yet this one measure will ensure that many more families are forced into the poverty trap and made worse off because they are working than they would be if they were on social security.<br/>
There has been some dispute about just how many families and children come into that category. When we first discussed the matter last year, the Secretary of State said that 500,000 children at present entitled to free school meals would lose that right as a result of the clause. In Committee, the Under-Secretary revised that figure. He said that only 300,000 children&#x2014;I emphasise "only"&#x2014;would lose their right to free school meals. What he failed to point out then, but has since acknowledged in a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock), was that the real figure is 450,000, because 150,000 children entitled to free school meals on income grounds do not take them up. Many of us know why. It is because there is a stigma attached to that entitlement. But all of the 450,000, on the Minister's now confirmed figures, will lose that entitlement if the clause goes through as it is.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady said that the additional 150,000 was accounted for in part by the stigma that often attaches to children being "free school meals children". Will she remind the Minister that


under the Bill there will be a double stigma? The Government are to make it really hard for children to have free school meals, even if they are entitled to them. They will have to prove not merely that they are financially entitled to them, but also that they are in need of special provision, because the obligation to provide free school meals applies only where the local authority thinks that such provision is appropriate or necessary for the children.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has made a valid observation. It was confirmed by the Minister in Committee in an interesting discussion about what made up a good breakfast and what judgments the local authority should use in determining who should have a free meal.<br/>
It is clear that many children will be at a disadvantage because of the Bill. Many families will be hit by the increased charges. Many thousands of children will be hit because their right to a free school meal will be removed. As the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) pointed out, those entitled to free school meals in the future will be put at an even greater disadvantage, because there will be a completely new category. Only children on family income supplement or supplementary benefit will be entitled to free school meals. That means singling out those children even more and increasing the stigma that often discourages children who need free school meals from taking advantage of their entitlement.<br/>
What do the Government want to happen as a result of the clause? Does the Minister want to see the break-up of the school meals system, the dismantling of all the present provisions? Does he want to discourage families from allowing their children to have school meals, or does he want to encourage them to pay the economic cost of the meals? If he wants them to pay the economic cost, he must be prepared to provide the income for them to be able to do that.<br/>
If the Government refuse to give more family support through child benefit and similar measures, the Minister should expect all those wage earners who have responsibility for children to make increased wage claims simply to cover the kind of increased charges that the Government are imposing on them. How-

ever, I strongly suspect that he and his right hon. and learned Friend will continue to say, as do their right hon. and hon. Friends, that those who make large wage claims to compensate for increased charges are acting irresponsibly. All that the Government are concerned about is cutting public expenditure, not maintaining family support and the education service, which should be their first responsibility.</p>

<p>I rise to support the amendment and to speak to a number of the amendments grouped with it&#x2014;amendments Nos. 36, 38, 39, 40 and 54, all of which are in my name and the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) or my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston).<br/>
The school meals service has a record to be proud of. It is a service of very high standards, a service that can point to a proven record of improved nutrition. It is one of the few parts of the education service that can be demonstrated to


have had a precise improving effect. Therefore, we should be cautious about making drastic changes in it.<br/>
I do not deny that it is desirable to experiment both with the way in which meals are provided and served and with how we cater for those whose income does not allow them to use the system. Therefore, there are two kinds of experiment that I am anxious to encourage. One is in the establishment of better, more flexible income scales for help with school meals than exist under the present, rigid free school meals system. The other is in the provision of more choice of food, perhaps related to the purchase of individual items.<br/>
A great deal has been done on those lines, and a great deal can be done, within the framework of the present law. Some easing of the statutory provision may be necessary, particularly to develop cafeteria systems and to ensure that local authorities generally can operate a proper incomes scale, instead of the present free school meals system.<br/>
However, the provisions of the Bill do neither of those things. They very much worsen poverty trap problems presented by the way in which help is given to those who cannot afford schools meals. They go far beyond what is necessary to enable local authorities to run an efficient and inviting cafeteria system of meals for children within their areas. The Bill does a number of damaging things that these amendments are designed to prevent.</p>

<p>Even if these experiments in the provision of cafeteria services are pursued, has the hon. Gentleman been able to find out whether the Government will make extra allocations to enable local education authorities to meet the enormous capital cost of moving their school meals service from the current provision to a new space-age provision? Is he aware that the required equipment is costing West Glam organ county council &#x00A3;16,000 without putting even a slice of bread before any pupil?</p>

<p>The Government have no intention of putting more money into the school meals service. They are trying to take out as much as possible. Any experiments conducted under the present

Government's arrangements must be of a limited nature. Any local authority that pours money into expensive new systems is likely to be making a great mistake. There is scope for limited experiments within capital investment already made. Most local authorities have made substantial capital investment in the school meals service in the post-war years. One has only to tour schools in one's constituency to see well-equipped kitchens, maintained to the highest standards of hygiene, that would be envied by any commercial concern and by any public health inspector who know the standards that exist in some commercial restaurants and cafes. We should be loth to waste or disregard what has been achieved.<br/>
Unless the Bill is amended in the ways that have been suggested, much damage will be caused. We shall leave the way open for local authorities to provide no school meals at all, except for a limited number of children. We shall place no limit on the cost of meals. We shall create a terrible poverty trap problem.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman mentions a matter with which I had not intended to deal, but it is a fact, particularly in a constituency such as mine, that a great number of people, who are not very well paid, do a very good job within the school meals system and contribute a great deal to the welfare of the school. In Committee, the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Brent, North (Dr. Boyson) testified that the school meals staff often played as big a part in educational welfare and pastoral work in schools as any of the teaching staff. These people will be put on the scrap-heap as a result of some of the Bill's proposals.<br/>
The Bill would leave the way open for a situation in which there would be no school meals at all for the vast majority of children. Meals would be available only to those of families receiving supplementary benefit and family income supplement. The effect will be severe in certain circumstances. Families with both parents working who have hitherto relied on the school meals system to ensure that their children get a decent mid-day meal will he especially hit. These are often the families that depend on two wages. They are families on low wages.<br/>
Single parent families will be badly hit. The single mother depends on her child getting a hot meal at mid-day so that when she returns home after a hard day's work she is not obliged to cook a full meal for herself and the child. The Government now seem to be saying, through this and other aspects of the Bill, that single mothers should not worry and that instead of going out to work and trying to pay their own way, it would be better if they received State benefit.<br/>
By accepting State benefit, the Government seem to say, the school meal will be free and the single mother will be better off in every way. If the mother goes out to work there will be no school meal provision for the child as her earnings will be too high. Why should the Government say this to people who want to exist by their own efforts and not depend on State benefits?</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has left local authorities in an extraordinary position. He should not open that issue. Local authorities are told to plan their school meals provision next year on the basis of a Bill that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has not yet got through Parliament.

Some local authorities have announced terrifying proposals that will put school meals far beyond the reach of families earning any ordinary country working wage.

<p>I have said that the Bill leaves the way open for a local authority not to provide any school meals except for those on supplementary benefit and

family income supplement. Some authorities, including mine in Northumberland, have said that they do not want to do that. Nor do they want to get rid of free school transport. The Secretary of State, replying to a question from me, has said that authorities that fail to achieve the massive savings for which he asks must find savings in the mainstream of education to make up for indulging in the luxury of providing children with school meals and enabling them to get to school without paying large fees for transport.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman cannot tell the House that authorities can disregard what he is asking them to do and make all the provisions for which the Opposition are asking and at the same time deny that he intends to penalise those authorities by ensuring that they pay for their savings in the mainstream of education. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is saying to authorities, particularly those in large rural areas and those with large numbers of families just above the family income supplement level, that their general education standard must be lower than those authorities that find it easier to comply with what he asks. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has left authorities in an absurd position.<br/>
If school meals provision is either removed or made prohibitively expensive in large scattered rural areas, a whole series of further problems arise. Children in those areas face an enormously long school day. They leave for school at 7&#x00B7;15 am or 7&#x00B7;30 am and do not return home until 5&#x00B7;15 pm or 5&#x00B7;30 pm. Their journey often means changing buses or waiting at the end of a farm track for a car or bus to pick them up. They often arrive at school cold and wet having waited for transport in cold and adverse weather conditions. They, above all, need a hot meal at school to sustain them.<br/>
These same children have to attend schools in distant towns. Ministers seem unable to appreciate the concern of parents whose children, in the absence of school meals provision or where school meals are too expensive, go out into the town to get something suitable to eat in cafes and restaurants. The right hon. and learned Gentleman should understand that this may be all right in Runcorn. But, in an area where children


are attending schools 20 miles from their homes, in a town that they visit only for the purpose of attending school, parents do not want their children wandering around that strange town in the middle of the day looking for cafes, restaurants or, if they can give the impression they are over 18, pubs, to get something to eat. Parents would much prefer an adequate and cheap school meals system for their children.<br/>
More should be done to safeguard the school meals system. One of my amendments tries to ensure that a basic school meal continues to exist at some maximum charge. The Bill provides no limit to the cost of a basic school meal. I have tried to word the amendment in such a way as to leave open to the local authority the chance to offer a variety of foods, perhaps some more expensive, while still recognising what the Government seek to achieve. I refer to amendment No. 40.<br/>
There must be some way in which the Government can set a maximum for provision of a reasonably priced meal. So far, however, that is not the Government's intention. The Government's intention is that there should be no compulsion to provide anything and no maximum cost for what is provided. That could spell disaster for parents in many areas.</p>

<p>The other main aspect of the Bill with which I wish to deal is its creation of a class of children much smaller than those at present receiving school meals&#x2014;a class I have called the statutory poor and whom the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), in an evocative phrase, called the people who earn their poverty. His description goes far too wide, and I want to concentrate on the "statutory poor" those who qualify for free school meals under the Bill because they are entitled to family income supplement or supplementary benefit. These children do not merely have to prove that they are within that category. The local authority's obligation to them is to make for them
<q>such provision&#x2026;as appears&#x2026;to be requisite.</q>
The authority could therefore say of any child whose parents were not on family income supplement or supplementary

benefit" We need do nothing for you because we know perfectly well that your mother gives you a good breakfast in the morning and that you will get a decent tea when you get home." But when they inquire into the case of another child, they find that he is not getting a breakfast and that the mother comes home very late and probably does not provide a meal when the child gets home from school. In such a case the authority knows that it will have to make some provision.</p>

<p>Any local authority that strictly interpreted the intention of the Bill would find itself investigating the particular circumstances of every individual child. Why else should that phrase be included? Why else does the Bill not simply say that school meals have to be provided for the children of parents on family income supplement or supplementary benefit? Instead the Bill makes a case-by-case provision. The local authority must make
<q>such provision&#x2026;as appears&#x2026;to be requisite".</q>
In that way the Bill adopts the old poor law approach whereby the local authority will decide in individual cases whether children are getting enough food at home.</p>

They will lose free school meals and free school transport, and they will find themselves paying a massive rate of tax&#x2014;perhaps a marginal rate of 250 per cent.

<p>They are saying to hundreds of thousands of families that it pays not to work. They are telling them to stay on State benefit and under no circumstances to get a job. To those with work their message is to stay below the family income supplement level because once they exceed that level they have too much to lose. They are telling these families that they will be better off as beneficiaries of the State than by aiding themselves by their own efforts.</p>

<p>The curious thing is that the Government have adopted a different approach to the assisted places scheme. They have devised a generous incomes scale for that scheme which would enable people on substantial incomes to obtain at least some benefit. But it is beyond their wit and imagination to devise any such scale which would bring benefits on school meals or school transport to families that are just over the supplementary benefit or family income supplement levels. That must be absurd.</p>

The amendments deal with a much narrower issue, one upon which we would hope for some support from Conservative Members who are also concerned about the poverty trap.

<p>The Goverment's proposals have been badly thought out. There is no evidence that Ministers have listened to the pleas and advice from many quarters, including people who are not unsympathetic to


some of the things the Government are trying to do on school transport. There are people in the local authorities who are terrified of having to implement the Government's plans. Why on earth cannot the Government apply some thought to the matter? Is it too late, or are they still prepared to listen?</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mrs. Taylor) and the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) have justly identified a significant problem in the case of school meals and school transport charges. However, the remedy they suggest is quite insufficient and will only add to the expense and to the bureaucratic problems that local authorities would face. In their speeches we have heard a requiem for the Labour Government's failure to continue to introduce tax credits or negative income tax which is the vital clue to this and many other problems that we face. I accept that that would be complicated and expensive, but until we reach that target we shall always have to face the poverty trap.<br/>
I have no wish to be rude to the hon. Lady, but in the case of school meals she reminded me somewhat of Mary Poppins. On the one hand Mary Poppins nannied us into the fact that we must have a full nutritional value of each school meal laid down by the State, just in case the child did not get the necessary vitamin on a particular day at a particular time. Having dealt with that, Mary Poppins then explained to us that meals were very expensive because of the conditions she had so carefully and exactly laid down.<br/>
We live in a real world, however, where the economy is totally out of kilter. We must urgently adapt the economic folly of the school meals system no matter what our political philosophy. We must prevent the situation where the food content of the meal is 16p or 17p of the 50p total value. That is a matter of urgency, because that is where the waste occurs. We must also remember that many of the pupils qualifying for and receiving free school meals&#x2014;I know this for a fact&#x2014;sell their vouchers and go to the chip shop. Forty per cent. of pupils do that in one large school in Kent. They prefer fish and chips and Mars bars.<br/>
The advice of Mary Poppins is not suitable for 1980. It is not good economic

advice. I believe that school meal charges will not rocket as dramatically as the hon. Member for Bolton, West has suggested because there is an economic takeoff point where, as has been suggested, parents provide instead of pay.<br/>
Every time school meals charges are raised we shall find that there is a cut-off point where money is not recouped. That is why, in Kent, we are fully aware of the situation and are limiting rises in charges accordingly. Let us have tax credits as soon as we possibly can&#x2014;</p>

<p>If there is a diminution in the marginal propensity to consume as a consequence of the rise in school meal prices how much of a loss is the county of Kent prepared to sustain on each school meal by under-charging for nutritious or even non-nutritious meals?

<p>I believe that these parts of the Bill are absolutely central to the Government's economic and political philosophy. The clauses on school meals, milk and transport are the meanest, most rotten and most evil pieces of legislation. I believe that thousands of people throughout the country are now in open revolt over these proposals. It is important therefore that the House gives serious consideration to the amendments.<br/>
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) properly raised the question of the social usefulness of school meals and the problem of the poverty trap. If one defines the usefulness of school meals in our society and asks why these amendments should be carried into legislation, one must take account of the social usefulness of school meals to the children themselves. At


mid-day children should have the opportunity to sit down to a communal meal.<br/>
In talking about the value of school meals we must consider them important because they provide nutritional support for the poorest children. When we consider the cost of the school meals service we must remember that the Government are not acting in a vacuum but in the context of the wider economic problems that they face.<br/>
I challenge the need to cut the school meals service at all, given the fact that Government revenues from North Sea oil will be substantial in the next four years. By 1984 North Sea oil will be bringing in probably more than income tax&#x2014;something to the tune of &#x00A3;25,000 million a year. Against that background should the Government not be saying that they will spend some of those revenues to support the poorest families and provide a service regarded by many people as essential to the welfare of children?<br/>
The school meals service is important for a child's educational and social development. The proposals in the Bill which the amendments seek to rectify have been put forward against the background of falling consumption&#x2014;according to a national food survey&#x2014;of meat, cheese and milk. That consumption was falling during the first years of the last Labour Government. Unfortunately that is as far as the figures go.<br/>
It is absolutely monstrous that the Government should pretend that, somehow, economic circumstances have so changed that we must abolish the school meals service in many parts of the country or allow it to continue only in such an attenuated form that it benefits the smallest proportion of our children.<br/>
The Government argue that the cuts in the school meals service can be achieved by reorganisation and changes in nutritional standards. The Secretary of State is fond of saying that local authorities have been given the power to vary the school meals service in order to provide more choice. That argument is completely at variance with previous advice issued by his own Department and is totally at variance with reality. In 1975 the Department of Education and Science published a report "Catering in

Schools". Dealing with infants and younger school pupils, the report said
<q>We believe that the school catering service should not normally offer any daily choice of menu to these children. The exercise of even the simplest choice can be a difficult matter for young children&#x2026;The meal for this group should be the set two-course type, and include a variety of suitable combinations of meat and vegetables and main dishes built around other animal protein foods&#x2014;fish, eggs or cheese.</q>
The report went on to describe the problems of choice affecting children in the 9&#x2013;14 age group. It stated:
<q>We recommend that the middle years' age group should be offered a set meal with some choice in each of the two courses provided&#x2026;We considered whether the older pupils in the age group&#x2026;should be given the option of an a la carte meal, but we decided against this. These particular pupils are at a critical stage in their physical development, and they have an enhanced need for both energy and nutrients. It is particularly important for them to eat a midday meal which meetts the recommended nutritional standard and an a la carte system would provide no guarantee that they would do so.</q>
Savings cannot be made by introducing such an a la carte system without cutting the nutritional standards for children under 14 and causing substantial harm to their health. A number of local authorities are engaged in experiments with cafeteria and a la carte systems. Examples are Leicester, Cornwall, Red bridge, Hillingdon, Surrey, Devon, Somerset, Lancashire, Berkshire and North Yorkshire.<br/>
Savings on school meals will be made by introducing a la carte systems, not because the authorities want to extend choice but because they want to cut costs by lowering nutritional standards and by reducing the number of workers. Earlier the Secretary of State asked for examples of local authorities which are taking action to remove the school meals service completely. If a local authority increases the price of a school meal to 60p that is the result of a political decision. Such an authority is saying to its electors "We do not really want to run a school meals service. We want to ration the number of school meals provided by price". If local authorities seriously want to phase out the school meals system in an area, all that they have to do is to raise the prices, because parents will not be able to afford them.</p>

<p>My local authority is Labour-controlled and I hope that it will do nothing of the kind. However, I am sure that many Conservative-controlled authorities will do it because they have said that they will. Many Conservative-controlled authorities will reduce the nutritional standard of school meals. That is wholly deplorable.<br/>
For example, the Lincolnshire county council school working party has agreed to a simplified menu pattern which will cut food costs, by 2&#x00B7;3p per meal, at November 1979 prices, and reduce the food value of the meal by approximately 13 per cent. That is a far cry from the attacks by Tory Members on the high marginal costs of the school meal service. That authority has been given the freedom by the Secretary of State. It is not cutting manpower costs but cutting nutrition by 13 per cent. That is the name of the game for the Tory-controlled local authorities.<br/>
Liverpool plans to save &#x00A3;1 million by using frozen meals prepared by outside contractors. Essex county council plans to cut the cost of food in primary schools by 2p a meal to produce a &#x00A3;700,000 saving. That authority plans to use convenience foods at such a level that staff can be cut by 40 per cent. A number of other authorities are planning similar cuts.<br/>
If we are serious about providing meals for children at school it is no good assuming that local authorities will, under the terms of the Bill, be prepared to provide proper meals of set nutritional values. The whole purpose of the Bill is to remove that obligation from local authorities and to enable them to save money as part of the Government's public expenditure programme.<br/>
The current cost of a school meal is 54p of which only 16&#x00B7;5 is spent on food. The implication is that the rest is wasted or frittered away in administration. That is not so. The rest of the cost goes to pay the wages of the workers who are relatively low paid, although they are paid more than the catering wages council rates. If Tory Members are critical of the amount spent on the meals service simply because the workers are paid

slightly more than poverty-line wages, they should say so openly.<br/>
The school meals service is efficient. That is not only my view, it is the view of the local authority employers. When they were examining the prospect of reducing the number of workers in local Government under the last Labour Government they examined the possibility of introducing a bonus scheme in the school meals service. They discovered that the prospect of doing that wasnon-existent because the school meal workers were so efficient that the majority of them were working at above the bonus performance. The authorities did not want to pay out money on a performance level which was already achieved. To say that waste is incurred on a vast scale is the biggest load of garbage that I have heard in the House since I was elected.<br/>
It is clear that a reduction in the school meals provision will affect women at work. The Equal Opportunities Commission has said that such a reduction and attacks on other items such as nurseries will affect working women. The Government have an appalling record for making provision for women. The Government have said that they intend to remove the statutory requirement to supply school meals and milk. They have said that they intend to remove other supportive measures for women in work, such as the return-to-work provisions in the Employment Protection Act. They are also reducing the number of nurseries.<br/>
It is nonsense to say that the Government are providing incentives, as they promised in their election manifesto. Children are being asked to perform better at school while going hungry at lunch time and doing without the protein and calcium now provided to the under-seven-year-olds in school milk. The amendments are necessary. If they are not carried a generation of children will grow up many of whom will be under fed and some of whom will have been deprived of the nutrient of school milk. That will store up many problems for the future.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of the debate to explore the economic position of the country. Nevertheless, the clause is included in the Bill because of the


economic position. For the better part of the past decade public expenditure cuts have been the order of the day. Successive Governments have urged local authorities to cut back on their expenditure.<br/>
Unfortunately, because of the statutory overload that has been placed by Government legislation on local authorities, the areas that could be considered to make substantial savings have been narrowed. That has resulted in many of the services, in an overall sense, becoming depressed. Consequently, we have many three-wheeled wagons rolling along the road. We have done many things rather badly because we have been slicing off the top.<br/>
What the Bill attempts to do, in response to the tremendous pressure from local authorities for many years, is to give them greater discretion. It will allow them to consider larger areas of the expenditure that they incur and to use discretion. We hear much in the Chamber&#x2014;and lip service is paid to it by hon. Members on both sides on occasions&#x2014;about that essential ingredient of our democratic system, local authority freedom.<br/>
As I said on Second Reading, freedom carries with it its own responsibilities. Local authorities must not be afraid of exercising those responsibilities. By proposing to reduce by about 50 per cent. the amount contained in the rate support grant settlement for the school meals service we are giving to local authorities a greater area of discretion.</p>

<p>I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's argument. Local authorities have proper means to consider areas that are of great importance to many people. We have heard many points of view this afternoon about the validity of the argument about the poverty trap. As I said in Committee, hon. Members on both sides share many worries about that problem. However, the validity of that argument does not make invalid the reason for putting the clause in the Bill. Unless we are further to depress overall

levels, we must find areas where greater discretion can be applied.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesend (Mr. Brinton) touched on the present inequities that exist within our social security system. That has to be considered in the context of where we are today. The Act was framed in 1944, and when considered against the background of 1980 it is clear that social conditions have changed. It is perfectly fair to say that there are still many in this country who are, by any definition, deprived. But it is equally true to say that the position is not as bad, and that the demands for a public and expensive umbrella in the school meals service are not as great in 1980 as they were in 1944.<br/>
While I accept the points made by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) about the poverty trap, so eloquently expressed by the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) in the debate last week, the validity of the clause being in the Bill still exists.</p>

<p>From the point of view advanced by the Conservative Party, is it not the case that it is almost irrespective of whether people are poor? One of the questions that he should be asking is whether they would be better off working. The effect of the Bill is to make sure that that is not the case.</p>

<p>That may or may not be the case. It is not a point to ne argued in an education debate. I stand by my statement that it is the function of the education service to educate. We have to consider the issue in the context of 1980 and ask "Are we getting value for money that we are putting into education?" We must consider all areas of education expenditure.<br/>
Five per cent. of the total budget for education is spent on the school meals service. It is an expensive service, especially at the top end where it might be top heavy. A cutback to 2&#x00B7; per cent. of that in no way can be construed as abandoning the service. It is merely fixing it at a more realistic level.<br/>
I wish to make two more points. One relates to an issue that concerned all Members in Committee, namely, the stigma upon those in receipt of free school meals. It must be the concern of everyone in the House, and of every


responsible LEA councillor, to ensure that whatever scheme is put into force in individual local authorities to provide children with free meals&#x2014;those whose families are in receipt of family income supplement or supplementary benefit, or fall within the provisions of a later clause in the Bill referring to local authority discretion&#x2014;is operated in such a manner that the individual child is in no way singled out.<br/>
To continue, regrettably, with the position that has existed in the past is totaly indefensible, and I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will support me in saying that.<br/>
Secondly, I should like the House to consider a small point in the drafting of the Bill. I refer to Clause 22(2), which appears to contradict itself. It begins in a mandatory form by stating:
<q>A local education authority shall exercise their power under subsection (l)(<i>a</i>) above.".</q>
it finishes by stating:
<q>so as to ensure that such provision is made for him in the middle of the day as appears to the authority to be requisite".</q>
There appears to be a conflict in the drafting on that point. I should be glad if the Minister would turn his mind to that matter when he replies.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1721497" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-02-13a.1573.0" hansard_membership_id="4474" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30439" speakername="Mr. Martin Flannery" colnum="1573" time="17:30:00">
<p>Hon. Members who served on the Committee were briefed by practically every possible organisation. I wish to make one or two fundamental points, as one who has lived all his teaching life with the school meals service. Clause 22(3)(<i>a</i>) states that a local education authority
<q>may make such charges as they think fit for anything provided by them".</q>
That is the position that the Bill will bring about at a time of developing mass unemployment, strikes, industrial struggles and so on. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was a teacher, and I pay tribute to the way in which he has fought valiantly, both in Committee and in his speech in the House today, against the Bill. He pointed out the contribution to the health and education of our children that has been made by the school meals service. I wish to speak from that viewpoint.<br/>
I remember the dinner woman and the ancillary staff in the kitchens of

schools. Teachers and, in my case, a head teacher visited the kitchens every morning and saw how clean they were and how well fed the children were. It meant that teachers were able to teach children that much better.<br/>
There is one sentence in the brief from the National Union of Teachers of which everyone should take account:
<q>Large numbers of children now go to school without breakfast, so that they have depended on their school dinner and milk to keep them going through the day. This lack of adequate nourishment would threaten all those children in local authorities which could, as a result of the proposed legislation, choose to discontinue a nutrionally adequate meals service for the majority of children.</q>
The NUT makes the educational point:
<q>Teachers recognise the pre-lunch-time slackening of effort and attention which is due to poor concentration resulting from hunger. How much worse a problem this would become if there was no midday meal provided and children tried to get by on a bag of crisps and a fizzy drink. The teachers' efforts to assist their pupils' learning would be wasted in the afternoons.</q>
That is the essence of what would occur in education in view of what the Government, in my view unwittingly, are about to perpetrate on our children. Five million children&#x2014;there used to be more&#x2014;take school meals, and about 1 million of those have free school meals.<br/>
The heading of the Advisory Centre for Education's brief is:
<q>How LEAs will he free to demolish school meals service.</q>
This is an all-out attack on the school meals service, just as the Bill is a demolition attack on nursery education.<br/>
The ACE states:
<q>If the Government's proposals to alter the school meals service go through, education authorities will be able to provide meals of any nutritional standard they like, charge any price, and offer free school meals only when they feel it is 'necessary'.</q>
Having mentioned the educational point, I want now to refer to those children&#x2014;in some areas it is as many as five or six out of every 10&#x2014;who go to school without breakfast. In the 1930s there were centres in every area to which children could go for breakfast. A mug of cocoa and a slice of bread and dripping were provided for many children. A Birmingham school has recently started giving breakfast and it is trying to continue to do so because the headmaster saw the need for this provision.<br/>
I turn now to a recent experiment in providing free school meals for children. Many more children will soon be in need of free school meals, but, under the provisions of the Bill, fewer children will get them. Therefore, rickets will begin to creep back. That is the reality.<br/>
Recently, the <i>Lancet</i> produced an analysis of the heights of children receiving free school meals compared with those receiving subsidised school meals. The
<q>analysis of the heights of 10,000 primary children from 28 areas of England and Scotland showed that children receiving free school meals were significantly shorter than those children in the other two groups after making allowances for differences in father's social class".</q>
That analysis is saying that these children, before they got the free school meals were already deprived and smaller and were suffering more than other children before applications for free school meals were made.<br/>
I know many proud, honourable working people whom I had to ask to apply for free school meals for their children, but who were too proud to do so. I asked them to apply for free clothing for their children, but they were too proud to do that. Even when it was proved that they had a right to these benefits, many of them still held out and would not apply for them. They would hear on the television and so on about slackers and dodgers, and these honourable people would not avail themselves of their rights. Therefore, as I said in Committee, there is a submerged one-tenth of people who are too proud to apply for and accept these benefits even when they are offered.</p>

<p>On 26 October last year the Secretary of State for Education and Science held a press conference to introduce this miserable Bill. He is reported to have admitted that of the 1,100,000 pupils receiving free meals, 500,000 will no longer be eligible as a result of this legislation.<br/>
I take it that these figures refer only to England and Wales. But, as we now have the Secretary of State for Scotland here on one of his rare appearances, perhaps he will clarify that point. At any rate, in reply to a question, he told me that in Scotland out of 430,000 pupils receiving school meals, 143,000 were receiving free meals. I should guess that if the proportion is roughly the same as in England and Wales, about 70,000 children in Scotland will no longer qualify for free school meals as a result of this legislation.<br/>
The parents of those children do not receive supplementary benefit or family income supplement. Their children qualify for free school meals because the scale rates of income for free meals, as laid down by the Secretary of State, are more generous than the scale rate of income for supplementary benefit or family income supplement. Therefore, the parents of those children will, in the first instance, face an increase of 35p as a result of the increased approved a fortnight ago. But already I hear that certain local authorities in Scotland and elsewhere are to put prices up far beyond the 35p for the coming financial year. The whole aim of the Bill is to give them discretion to charge what they like. I have heard of some authorities which charge 40p and others 50p and others as much as 60p. The whole thing will escalate in the months and years to come.<br/>
Those who will be penalised most will be the working poor on low incomes. They will be deprived of the incentive to work by a Government who claim that they were elected on a manifesto that would increase incentives to work. What incentive is there for low income people to work if by so doing, taking into account the social wage, they will have less than they would have if they were not working? This clause will make the so-called poverty trap deeper and wider and more people will fall into it.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery) referred to the article in the <i>Lancet.</i> I should like to emphasise one point in that same article:
<q>These results suggest that a large proportion of the children who received free school meals were of lower nutritional status.</q>
It sums up by stating that surveillance indicates
<q>that free school meals are going to the right group of children and that withdrawal might well prejudice their future development.</q>
That is backed by a circular, which we received, from the Advisory Centre for Education referring to another survey by Baker and others reported in the <i>Lancet</i> on 29 September 1979 supporting the previous survey. The circular from the Advisory Centre for Education goes on to say:
<q>It is perhaps worth pointing out that both of the above studies were set up and funded by the DHSS Sub-Committee on Nutritional Surveillance&#x2026;Mrs. Thatcher herself announced in the House of Commons that these studies would be undertaken: the government thus has within its possession information strongly suggesting that the proposed changes in eligibility to free school meals are not a good idea.</q>
Yet, the Government continue to propose such regressive ideas. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough pointed out, we should be aware of the possibility of the return of rickets as a result of the lack of nutrition to children, through the deprivation of their rights to school meals and milk.</p>

<p>I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman as we are short of

time. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman was present for the early part of the debate.<br/>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Brent, North (Dr. Boyson) is not here. I have a report of a survey of schoolchildren in the London borough of Brent which shows that a substantial number of children there go to school having had no breakfast. That number consisted of 4 per cent. in the infant classes, 9 per cent. in the junior classes and 21 per cent. in the senior classes. Therefore, the Minister is clobbering not only all our constituents but his own as well. It is no wonder that there has been such universal protest from parents, teachers, teachers unions, teachers associations, family service unions, the Child Poverty Action Group and even from the National Farmers Union about the proposals. The Scottish National Farmers Union sent a circular to hon. Members who had the privilege or otherwise of serving on the Committee. On the subject of clause 24, "School meals in Scotland", the circular stated:
<q>Mr. Dennis Canavan has already put forward amendment 85 to substitute 'shall' for 'may' in line 31 on page 22 of the Bill. We would recommend this amendment for your attention.</q>
Contrary to rumours, I am not sponsored by the Scottish National Farmers Union.</p>

<p>In some cases, there may be an element of parental blame. However, part of the historical reason why the school meals service was instituted was that the school, although it should never be seen as a replacement for the home, should be a complement to the home as far as education and other aspects of looking after children are concerned.<br/>
I understand that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is opposed to the proposals. It expressed its opposition as long ago as October when the


Scottish Office sent out a secret confidential memorandum to it which stated:
<q>Under the present regulations education authorities are required to provide meals free of charge for children from low income families. In line with the Government's policy of allowing greater discretion to local authorities, the intention is to let education authorities decide entirely for themselves what provision should be made in future for children from low income families.</q>
In other words, not only will the number of eligible children be reduced but also the standard of the meals will be reduced. That is completely contrary to a Scottish Education Department recommendation that was published as recently as 1975. Recommendation 16 of the document "Catering in Scottish Schools" stated:
<q>The Scottish Education Department should, from time to time, give general guidance to education authorities on the minimum nutritional requirements for nursery and primary school children and should also give such other guidance on nutrition as may be considered necessary".</q>
Yet, so soon after that publication, the Government are giving local authorities carte blanche about the standards of nutrition of the school meals. Their only justification, if there is one, is that it will save public money. The sum of &#x00A3;220 million is mentioned in the Bill&#x2014;it is &#x00A3;20 million as far as Scotland is concerned. Yet, the figures in the financial and explanatory memorandum of the Bill&#x2014;although they are being reconsidered&#x2014;state that the sum of &#x00A3;55 million is being set aside for the assisted places scheme for fee-paying schools&#x2014;an extra &#x00A3;5 million for fee-paying schools in Scotland.<br/>
At the same time, it looks as though the Government will reduce the school meals service by half. The Secretary of State for Scotland has said that the school meals budget is about &#x00A3;39&#x00B7;3 million per annum. Perhaps employment will be reduced by half as well. That will involve about 8,500 or 9,000 jobs in Scotland at a time when unemployment there is already over 200,000. This clause will cause a reduction in children's standards of health and education. It will increase the poverty trap and unemployment. If the clause is not withdrawn by the Government, I hope that they will accept some of our amendments. This is one of the most miserable clauses in one of the most miserable pieces of legislation in the history of education in this country.</p>

<p>I am sure that the Scottish National Farmers Union will be grateful for the clarification given by the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan).<br/>
In as short a time as possible I shall try to deal with some of the many points that have been raised during this all-too short debate. The hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mrs. Taylor) referred, as usual&#x2014;indeed we have been over this ground so much over the last 120 hours or so, but I am happy to argue the case again&#x2014;to the dismantling of the school meals service. I reassure the House that there is no such intention. What depresses me is the fact that so few Opposition Members have faith or confidence in their local representatives. They do not exhibit much confidence in locally elected representatives from their party, local officials or local school governors.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bolton, West also took me to task for the apparent suggestion in Committee that I indicated at some stage that I was less than caring about nutrition and nutritional standards. I should like to verify, for the sake of the debate, that at 6 pm on 30 January 1980 I said:
<q>There is a risk that a small number of children may be less well nourished as a result, or by general withdrawal of milk, but that is no argument for continuing the obligation on local education authorities to supply free milk to large numbers of children who do not need it."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D;</i> 30 January 1980; c. 1824.]</q>
I shall not bore the House by continuing with that quotation. Suffice it to say that, subsequently, Opposition Members have indicated that I said that there would be malnutrition. That is certainly not what I said. I said that some children might be less well nourished. I hope that that clarifies the point.<br/>
The effect of amendment No. 34 will be to empower the Secretary of State to prescribe by order, exercise able by a statutory instrument under clause 34(1), an income level below which parents would be entitled to have such free provision made for their children at school at mid-day as appeared to the authority to be requisite. The intention behind subsections (2) and (3) is that, although any local education authority will have wide discretionary powers under the rest of clause 22 as regards what to


provide and charge, there should be a statutory safeguard for children from the poorest families, namely, those receiving supplementary benefit or family income supplement. However, if an authority considered it appropriate to remit charges for other classes of children it would be bound to do to sunder subsection (2)(<i>b</i>). In that event, it might well make use of an income scale similar to the present statutory scale but with different income levels.<br/>
Although I am aware of the arguments put forward in favour of uniform entitlement to free provision in order to preclude inter-local education authority variation, I do not find convincing the arguments that have been put forward this afternoon.</p>

<p>I should prefer to finish my speech as time is tight. The circumstances of local education authorities vary, as do the circumstances of the populations and communities that they serve. However, local authorities must be given the maximum scope for making reductions in expenditure. Therefore, the only national prescription of entitlement to free provision should be the national poverty levels. Beyond that, it must be for the local education authorities to determine their expenditure precisely. If they consider that inter-local education authority variation is undesirable, they have the means&#x2014;through local authority associations&#x2014;of reaching agreement on a scale that could be used or adapted by all local education authorities.</p>

<p>The Minister has made a telling point. He said that the purpose of the clause was to give maximum scope to local authorities to reduce their expenditure. The Government will maintain that pressure. Therefore, local authorities will have no opportunity of using such discretion in any substantial way, because the Government will continue to twist their arms. They therefore will be unable to get the resources.</p>

<p>We shall leave 50 per cent. of the school meals subsidy in the budget for 1980&#x2013;81. The hon. Lady knows that. It depends upon the view

that one takes of local authorities. It depends upon the chief education officer, the chairman of the education committee and, above all, the attitude displayed towards head teachers. Head teachers, form teachers and pastoral heads must know where discretionary powers should be exercised.<br/>
This is relevant to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Thornton) and to amendment No. 37. There is no inconsistency between the phrase "shall exercise" in page 20, line 27 of the Bill, and the phrase found in lines 31 and 32,
<q>as appears to the authority to be requisite.</q>
The first requires the local education authority to exercise its power under subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) in respect of those pupils. The second requires them to consider what is requisite in each case, and to provide accordingly. The two are linked by the words "so as to ensure". That phrase relates the exercise of the power to the performance of the duty to the pupil. If hon. Members have a copy of the Bill they will see that clause 22(2) makes that perfectly clear.</p>

<p>From the hon. Gentleman's words, it appears that he wants to make the poverty trap official. He has accepted that only nationally recognised poverty levels might require local authorities to make particular provision. If that is the case, why can he not accept amendment No. 39? At least that amendment ensures that someone who is poorer than a person on family income supplement and supplementary benefit will not suffer unduly as a result of the clause.</p>

<p>I shall come to that amendment shortly. However, I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point. We discussed the amendment in some detail in Committee. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) referred to the poverty trap. He propounded amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 40 which stand in his name, and that of the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells). The theme of his speech surprised me. He did not exercise much confidence in local authority representatives. He seemed to think that most metropolitan authorities and county councils were dominated solely by representatives from the last century, who take no interest in the life of the community. That is


depressing. I am concerned, because I judge from his remarks that many schools in his constituency will dismantle the meals service immediately. He therefore appears to consider that schools are incapable of acknowledging the problems of the community.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman painted a picture of the problems facing children in rural areas. He referred to the long distances that they have to travel and to the fact that the Bill will have the effect of turning them on to the streets at lunch time. That does not display much confidence in the schools' understanding of the local community. If he thinks that so many schools in his constituency are incapable of understanding the needs of parents and of children, he should talk about those schools so that we can understand his precise problems.</p>

<p>The schools are perfectly capable of understanding such problems. However, the Government are telling them to do this or that. The Government have said that, if the authorities do not make such changes, they will have to make cuts in the mainstream of education. The Secretary of State has admitted that.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman surprises me. He does not owe such alarm and despondency to his constituents. I beg him not to send a copy of <i>Hansard</i>to the local papers. If he did so, he would create gloom and despondency. One can only conclude that the hon. Gentleman has not looked closely at the legislation. That is the last thing that the Bill does. He does not owe that behaviour to his constituents.<br/>
I shall speak to amendment No. 39. In doing so, I hope that I shall answer some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock). There must be hon. Members from all parties who are sympathetic with the intentions of the amendment. The poverty and incentive traps provide serious problems for the low-paid. Several hon. Members made that point when referring to the recent speech of the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). I am surprised and disappointed that the hon. Member for Birkenhead is not here, but perhaps there are good reasons for his absence.<br/>
Some of those who receive supplementary benefit or family income supplement will be worse off if they lose their entitlement as a result of increased income. Others, who do not receive supplementary benefit and family income supplement may be better off if they forgo some income and thereby become entitled to the benefits.<br/>
Nevertheless, the amendment could involve a local education authority in assessing family income according to two sets of rules, namely, those for supplementary benefit and those for family income supplement. The local authority is not familiar with either. The Department of Health and Social Security deals with both of those categories. It is familiar with the current free school meal regulations.<br/>
Under subsection 3(<i>b</i>) a local education authority is required to consider whether it would be appropriate to remit the charge for a class or description of pupil. That is in the Bill. It therefore has power to mitigate the poverty trap problem. Several authorities recognise the importance of doing so. I commend their policies to those that do not have full regard to local circumstances, and the needs and problems of families in their areas. However, to introduce a statutory safeguard would involve statutory regulations, whereas we have to decide that regulations relating to the provision of school meals and milk should be abandoned. That must go some way towards pacifying those Opposition Members who are justifiably concerned.<br/>
Many points have been made during the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesend (Mr. Brinton) spoke about the disproportionate cost of administering the school meals service. He also spoke of the low proportion that is spent on food. We know from experience that under existing legislation many local authorities have adapted their school meals service. They have adapted the type of storage used. Some authorities have central freezing units and have effective means of distribution. Some authorities may also use local private enterprise. I agree with the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. Race), who paid tribute to those who work in the school meals service. I freely and fully acknowledge the enormous contribution that


that service makes to the life of schools. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Local education authorities, officers and chairmen of county authorities are responsible people. They know what is needed within the school community and they acknowledge their duties. Hon. Members should not be so disparaging about local government. They have no confidence. I am delighted that I attract such a lot of sedentary fire. However, I do not wish to inflame the situation further. I am always mindful of the words of the righthon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). He said that a Minister must be a peacemaker. I hope that I shall always fulfil those words.<br/>
Over the past five or six months I have communicated with local authority representatives from Devon, Somerset, Sheffield, Liverpool, Merseyside, the North-East and Northumberland. I have been in touch with many local education authorities and I have discussed their plans with them. In every case I found a mood of confidence and enthusiasm for the clause. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry if the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) feels that derisive laughter is the order of the day. If he does not know what is going on in his local authority or in his local schools, he should get out and about and quickly find out.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman mentioned that he went to Sheffield. I was a member of the Sheffield education committee for many years.

<p>The local authorities with which I had discussions expressed approval for the theme behind this clause. They welcome it. The Association of County Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities have expressed approval for the Bill. During the past 10 or 15 years there has been a change in catering on school premises. That aspect of nutrition does not hold good in 1979&#x2013;80. Opposition Members know that that is the case. The diet and eating habits of children have changed and that is what children want.<br/>
It is right to let local education authorities have the freedom to adapt to local community needs. We are confident that local education authorities, chief education officers, chairmen of education committees and parent-teacher associations are responsible bodies and that they have the community interest at heart. The clause will not undermine or demolish the principle of the meals service. It is right that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has concentrated far more upon the preservation of educational services than on ancillary services. With that in mind, I urge the House to reject the amendments.</p>

<p>We were anxious to hear the Minister's reply in the hope that he had learned something from the Committee proceedings. However, we heard the same speech in Committee, and our doubtful pleasure in listening to it again tonight demonstrates that the Minister does not have it well rehearsed. We are no more convinced tonight than we were in Committee.<br/>
I have seldom heard such facile arguments as those put forward by Ministers and Government Back Benchers. We have put down amendments about nutritional standards of school meals, and all hon. Members know, no one better that the Secretary of State for Education and Science and the Secretary of State for Scotland, that this clause and the accompanying Scottish clause, clause 24, are concerned purely with saving money. They have nothing to do with nutritional standards and the need to make sure that our children are adequately fed.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) says, the clauses are about saving money. The Minister replied to the hon. Gentleman by saying that if local authorities do not make the cuts imposed by the Government in respect of school meals, milk and transport, other educational services will not necessarily have to be cut. That denial is a clear indication that he has no idea of the content of circulars from the Scottish Office.<br/>
I have a report of the meeting between the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and officials from the Scottish


Education Department. I shall not name the officials as they were speaking for the Minister, and he will want to accept full responsibility for what they said. They said:
<q>the percentage savings in meals, milk and transport would have to be proportionately greater if the main education service was not to undergo severe cuts".</q>
It is the cruellest deception for Ministers to seek to present the proposals as a better way of feeding our children at school. [<i>Interruption.</i>]<br/>
The hon. Member for Rochester and Chatham (Mrs. Fenner), who had responsibility for prices in the previous Conservative Government, between 1970 and 1974, was once described by me as the most expensive hen in Great Britain. She will be well advised to sit quietly in her seat tonight.<br/>
This proposal is the cruellest deception on children and parents since education Acts were introduced.<br/>
Last night we saw the beginning of the end of nursery education. Tonight it is the beginning of the end of the school meals service. It is a service entrenched in legislation since 1945. Since then local authorities have been under a duty to provide mid-day meals. Children have been entitled to those meals for 35 years. We are suddenly told, in a blinding flash by the right hon. and learned Gentleman and his colleagues, that these meals are not as good for children as we have been led to believe over the past 35 years. The Government give that service no credit for our children's improved health standards.<br/>
The hon. Member for Gravesend (Mr. Brinton) says that the alternative to reducing expenditure on school meals is a negative income tax system. I can imagine his constituents saying "We do not have negative income tax, Mr. Brinton. What do we do in the meantime?" He will reply "I just go to the House of Commons and tell fairy tales about Mary Poppins". I am sure that his constituents will be impressed.</p>

<p>I wish to mention mainly the Scottish provision. I referred earlier to a meeting between the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and officials from the Scottish Education Department. Expenditure on school meals in Scotland is to be cut by 44 per cent. in the coming financial year. Let us assume that there is no drop in the uptake of school meals. Those paying for meals, and not having them free of charge, will have to pay an extra 24&#x00BD;p a day to make good the 44 per cent. that is being filched from Scottish local authorities by the Minister with responsibility for education at the Scottish Office.</p>

<p>If the normal pattern prevails, and the uptake drops by 25 per cent., the increase for those still taking school meals will be 40p a day. I asked the Minister to quantify the likely increase in October of last year, and he then gave me a figure of 30p a day. That was assuming no drop in the uptake. He said that he could not give a figure, assuming a drop in the uptake. My calculation comes from a good source. We already see signs of substantial increases. Grampian regional council has decided to increase school meal prices, when it is free to do so, to 42p.</p>

<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) said, we are talking of an increase of from nothing to 42p for children whose families receive neither family income supplement nor supplementary benefit, but are just above that level. The Minister should not authorise his officials to say to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that it will be left to authorities to define what a low income family is. What we shall have in Scotland will be 10 different definitions of "low income families".</p>

<p>We have heard a lot of nonsense today about Labour Members not trusting local councillors. That is the biggest smokescreen that has ever been cast across any


proposition by any Government. Of course we trust local councillors. But if we trusted them we would give them the money. The Government claim to trust them but at the same time they tell them that they will not give them money. When the local authorities exercise their discretion and decide to maintain the school meals service in its present form, the Minister from the Scottish Office, aided and abetted by the Secretary of State, holds press conferences to castigate local authorities because they have taken this decision.</p>

<p>The truth is that local councillors cannot win. On the one hand, the Government say that they have complete freedom and total discretion. On the other hand, they refuse to give them the money. When the local authorities decide to exercise their complete freedom, they are confronted by the Secretary of State for the Environment, who wants to vet all their speeches. Then the Secretary of State for Scotland calls them "rogue elephants".</p>

<p>We are seeing the beginning of the end of the school meals service. There will be no savings by the Government. Instead, they will incur the wrath of parents and children, and they will have to meet the expenditure incurred as a result of the redundancies. If the school meals service is dismantled, obviously there will be redundancies. The contracts of employment of those who work in the school meals service have not been considered. There will have to be discussions with the trade union movement. No Government should get the idea that they can just alter a contract of employment without discussing that alteration with the trade union involved. There will need to be discussions about the necessary changes in the contract of employment of all those employed in the school meals service.</p>

<p>No estimates have been made of the offsetting administrative costs. The kind of system that the Minister wants to see introduced, whereby local authorities have all this discretion will not mean what the Government claim it will mean. If the local authority wants to exercise its full discretion it will be able to do so only if the Government allow it to employ more administrative staff in order to operate the rather complex and compli-

cated scheme. Local councillors are on a hiding to nothing. They have been placed in an impossible position</p>

<p>The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities summed it up in a letter to the Minister on 15 October. The letter said:
<q>We view with extreme disquiet the Government's intention to achieve through this legislation a substancial saving in public expenditure amounting to a 40 per cent. reduction".</q>
The local authorities say they are in favour of discretion but they are not in favour of being placed in the position of possibly having to abandon the service. If the Minister wants evidence of local authorities worrying about having to abandon the service, that evidence is contained in this letter. The letter was written after the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities had been advised, first on 2 October and then by letter on 9 October, that the Scottish Office was thinking about introducing these clauses into this Bill.</p>

<p>There was a meeting on 9 October between officials from the Minister's Department and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to discuss one of the most radical changes that has been wrought on the local authorities since 1945. The convention was told that it had to submit its views within six days. That means that 35 years' history was turned upside down in six days by a Government which could not care less about children, old-age pensioners or anyone else.</p>

<p>Then we had the Bill published, presented to Parliament and read a Second time on 5 November. It is very difficult to avoid the suspicion that the Bill was drafted before the Minister went to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. From my experience I would say that it would have been nearly impossible to put together a Bill on 15 October and have it presented to Parliament and read a Second time by 5 November if the convention's views were to be taken seriously. But of course, there was never any intention of taking the convention's submissions seriously. The whole purpose of this exercise is to cut expenditure and save money in order to make more tax concessions to those who do not need them.</p>

<p>We are getting a little sick of being lectured about the nutritional needs of


children by people who never see the inside of a State school except during a meeting at election time. Some of them would not know a school meal if they saw one. This is a disgraceful proposition and I invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote it down.</p>

<p>Hon. Members will be aware that the purpose of clause 23 is to allow local authorities to charge for transport to schools, whereas at the moment they have a statutory obligation to provide such transport free of charge. The

purpose of my amendment is to remove the clause from the Bill and to leave the law as it stands, so that the free transport provision will remain as it now is.</p>

<p>The reasons for my doing so are manifold, and they are based on the principle that to change the provision in the way that is suggested would be most ill-conceived and inequitable. I say that it would be ill-conceived because, first, it would put a charge on to people who have no way of avoiding that charge, as it is a charge upon them for fulfilling their statutory duty. They have a duty, which they cannot escape, to send their children to State schools. In many cases, with those who have to travel a long way to school, that duty is already a heavy burden in terms of convenience and of time.</p>

<p>To add to that burden a further burden of finance would, in my view, be wrong. It is different from those circumstances in which people are having to pay higher charges for many things. Inevitably the economy forces that upon us, and in those cases a choice can be made. But somebody living in a rural village has no choice but to send his child to a school that is in many cases miles away. To put a charge upon that is to discriminate between those who live near a town or in a town and those who live out in the countryside.</p>

<p>I have been listening to my hon. Friend's argument with great care. Is he advancing the proposition that the parent has a statutory duty to get his child to school and that it is wrong that he should be faced with a charge in order to fulfil that statutory duty? What about the position of the parent who is, say, 2&#x00BE; miles or 2&#x215E;miles from a school who has a similar duty to get his child to school, and who receives no assistance of any kind?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1721553" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-02-13a.1600.4" hansard_membership_id="1437" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31966" speakername="Sir N. Bonsor" colnum="1600" time="18:45:00">
<p>I do not, with respect to my hon. Friend, think that that is a very good point. I am not here to defend the idea that somebody living 2&#x215E; miles from a school should pay a transport charge or should not. I am saying that it


is wrong to make the provision in much broader terms so that people have to pay when they are living far away from the school and have no choice in the matter.<br/>
I consider it to be iniquitous that over the years we should have enticed people into not objecting to the abandonment of their own village schools on the ground that the leaders of the nation, in both major parties, said to them, in effect, "We are removing the village schools from you but we shall take your children to the nearest available State school." Now we are saying to them "We know that you have not got your village schools but we intend to impose a transport charge upon you."<br/>
Many village schools would have been fought for with far greater vigour had it been known by the inhabitants of many villages and market towns that they would have to pay a charge to send their children to another school.<br/>
For those reasons, I consider it to be an ill-conceived idea to make this imposition. It would lead also to the closure of many Roman Catholic schools. [HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."] My hon. Friends say "Nonsense", but they can argue that with the Catholics who say so. Those who run these schools and send their children to them are best able to judge the consequences of having to pay a charge to get their children there. I say that it would lead to the closure of Catholic schools. I am not a Catholic, but I have the greatest sympathy with those who wish to see their children properly and fully educated in the school of their own choice.<br/>
I look with some despair at some of our own schooling systems in which the whole concept of religion seems to be part of a humanist theory and has nothing to do with religion. The Bible is treated as a textbook on a par with the writings of Karl Marx. Some hon. Members may think that that is an excellent thing, but I do not. I therefore feel that it is quite wrong that Roman Catholics should find that they can no longer afford to send their children to a Catholic school of their choice, and will have to take them away and send them to a school which may in many cases not have any kind of religious instruction.<br/>
The principal ground upon which I object to a charge being made is that poor families, living in rural areas and in villages, and working on the land&#x2014;and very often in industries which are small and cannot afford to pay high wages&#x2014;are the very people who will be hit the hardest by the measure.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware, in the context of his argument, that although the provision concerning Catholic schools, under the 1944 Act settlement, is being threatened by the Government's proposal in clause 23, the problem is not confined to rural areas? I can give him figures for the urban area of Newcastle upon Tyne, which is a very small city. They were provided to me by the education authorities. St. Mary's school in Newcastle has half of its pupils on free transport. Under the present proposals the proportion will be less than one-fifth.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to the point. It is true that the clause does not affect only people in rural areas. The whole idea of making a charge of this nature is widely discriminatory and divisive. I shall therefore ask hon. Members to support the amendment in due course.<br/>
I consider that the proposal is inequitable as a concept and as a law because of the wide variations in local practice that will result from it. It will be possible to find people who are living within 100 or 200 yards of somebody in another area, and who will be paying a vast sum, whereas those in the other area are paying nothing. Where somebody lives out in the country and finds himself faced with a transport charge of &#x00A3;6 or &#x00A3;7 a week or more to send his child to the nearest State school, what does my


right hon. and learned Friend suggest that such a person should do? The farm worker&#x2014;</p>

<p>With regard to my hon. Friend's last point about a payment of &#x00A3;6 or &#x00A3;7 a week per child, I ought to point out to him that the county that he and I both represent is proposing a sum of 20p a day.</p>

<p>My right hon. and learned Friend is right, of course, but I did not say "per child". If I did, that is not what I meant; I meant to say &#x00A3;6 or &#x00A3;7 per family.</p>

<p>I wish that my right hon. and learned Friend would do so. Perhaps he would like to indicate such an intention when he replies to the debate.<br/>
I had hoped that my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) was about to remind me that the original plans of the Kent county council were to charge &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;50 a week for the first child and &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 a week for the next. Indeed, it may have been &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;50 for each child. That would produce the &#x00A3;7 per week per family which I mentioned earlier.<br/>
There will be a wide inequity if two children are charged &#x00A3;7 a week to go to school in some areas, 20p per day each in areas such as Cheshire and nothing in counties such as Essex.</p>

<p>They will indeed. There is widespread concern about the proposals.<br/>
One of my objections to the clause is that there are no upper safeguards against the irresponsible use of the provisions by local authorities. Had the Government introduced an upper limit that would overcome the difficulty of poor families facing charges that they could not afford,

I should be much more inclined to support the clause.<br/>
What explanations are we given of the inequities and the injustice? How are we reassured that the consequences of this measure will be acceptable and fair? I regret that the only answer that I have received is that we must have blind faith that local authorities will act reasonably and properly and that we should pass to them all authority and power in this matter.<br/>
Of course I have faith in my local authority&#x2014;but not blind faith. The Kent county council was prepared to put in &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;50 as the charge for one child and I do not consider that to be a reasonable way of exercising the powers provided in the clause.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has twice mentioned that Kent had "put in" plans to charge &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 and &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;50 a week. Those were always proposals and the present plan, which has still to be put through, is for &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;50 and &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50. It would be helpful if my hon.

<p>I appreciate my hon. Friend's concern, but my information was that Kent's original plan was for &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;50 per child per week.<br/>
I have looked through the newspapers for reassurance that local authorities would exercise properly the untrammelled authority that the Government propose to give them. I have found some interesting examples of the sheer irresponsibility of local government spending.<br/>
For example, the West Midlands county council proposes to spend &#x00A3;30,000 on a new members' bar. Hon. Members who were in the House when I presented my Private Member's Bill may expect me to show sympathy for that, and indeed I do, but that sympathy is tempered when I see that the county council has also budgeted &#x00A3;19,000 for a new lavatory for the chairman.<br/>
The London borough of Brent has budgeted &#x00A3;38,000 for a new mayoral car, which has all the necessary appurtenances of a mayoral car including a cocktail bar and a colour television. Not satisfied with that, the council immediately spent a further &#x00A3;20,000 to make sure that the car was up to standard. I do not have a bottomless faith in the


way in which local authorities spend their money.</p>

<p>Let me give an example from another Labour authority, the London borough of Southwark. It planned to spend a puny &#x00A3;50 million to build a new council building, though, to be fair, it has now scrapped that plan.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary made great play of the fact that we must show faith in local couucils. Of course we must, but we must also have a residual power to make sure that when our faith is not justified we can prevent abuses.<br/>
The second argument against the removal of the clause is "Where else can we find the money that is to be saved?". My right hon. and learned Friend will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the sum that we are talking about is &#x00A3;20 million and that it is based on the assumption that many local authorities will charge. However, we have already discovered that many authorities will not charge and I doubt whether &#x00A3;20 million will be brought in&#x2014;in this extraordinarily unfair way varying from one region to another&#x2014;when we consider the net benefit gained to the State after deduction of the additional administrative expenses involved in the introduction of this tax.<br/>
I do not believe that it will work. I do not often agree with the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South-East (Mr. Callaghan) but, as he said, &#x00A3;20 million will not make or break the Government&#x2014;and it will be gained at great hardship. That is why I pull away from the Government's line.<br/>
Some people have to live on the minimum agricultural wage of &#x00A3;58 per week and out of that they have to pay for rent, electricity and gas charges, living expenses and clothes. Those on small, isolated farms already face heavy transport charges. The imposition of an additional burden would be absolutely wrong.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I agree with him. Further cuts could undoubtedly be made within the education system without attacking the transport provision. Of course local government will tell us that it has pared to the bone, but I do not accept that that is so.<br/>
A CBI report on the efficiency of Cheshire county council was, in general, extremely favourable, but it made the grave criticism that the education service was overmanned. The main evidence offered for that statement was that for every 100 people who teach there are 75 providing ancillary services.<br/>
I do not accept that that is the right ratio on which to run our education system. I had hoped that in the light of that report there would have been some self-examination by the county council to see whether changes were needed. Not a bit of it. The letter that the county council wrote when these points were raised was, if anything, self-congratulatory. It said:
<q>If the facts of this bald statement"&#x2014;</q>
that for every 100 teachers there are 75 ancillary staff&#x2014;
<q>are examined, it will be found that of the 75 in support'70 are actually working in and with the schools and colleges, that is they are at the 'sharp end' of the service, directly helping the teachers and working with students and pupils. They are either clerical, laboratory or workshop assistants or employees of the school meals service.</q>
There is no question of saying "Yes. We shall look at the ways in which our expenditure is made up." The council is not prepared to examine its own system. There is a self-satisfied acceptance that the criticism is wrong and that the council's expenditure is absolutely right.</p>

<p>The first reason for my opposition to clause 23 is one of principle. I consider it to be wrong.

There would be a big difference between one area and another in the ways in which the provision would have an effect.</p>

<p>Speaking on behalf, not only of the Opposition but of many Conservative right hon. and hon. Members, I congratulate the hon. Member for Northwich&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Nantwich".] I apologise to the hon. Member for Northwich (Mr. Goodlad). I congratulate the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) on moving the amendment and speaking to it as he did.<br/>
The amendment is exactly the same as an Opposition amendment that was moved in Committee, when we were able to have a short debate, though I am sure that that amendment was not the source of the hon. Gentleman's inspiration. The importance of the matter has been greatly heightened by the fact that we now have the hon. Gentleman moving the amendment, with the support of his hon. Friends the Members for Northampton, North

(Mr. Marlow) and Aldridge-Brown hills (Mr. Shepherd).<br/>
If the Government take the advice of the hon. Member for Nantwich and his hon. Friend the Member for Bodmin (Mr. Hicks), who gave similar advice with equal sagacity last night, they will save themselves a great deal of trouble. Much more important, they will prevent a great deal of difficulty for the people whom we in this House represent. Even now, some of that difficulty is unimaginable in terms of the extra impositions on the family budget and the other problems, educational as well as social and domestic, that the clause will cause.<br/>
We are having a real debate, because there are votes to be gained. People will be listening to the arguments, and Conservative hon. Members will make up their own minds. There are votes to be gained not only here but elsewhere.<br/>
Conservative hon. Members do not adopt a defensive attitude because they fear for their parliamentary lives if they support the amendment. They are moved by the view of the hon. Member for Nantwich that the proposition in clause 23 is ill-conceived, inequitable, discriminatory and divisive. The hon. Gentleman spoke as a true British Member of Parliament He did not want to see great disparities between different parts of the country growing. He recognised that it was the ultimate responsibility of this House and the Government to ensure that people's difficulties did not exceed certain levels of difficulty and that they should not be expected to bear impositions of more than a certain amount. I hope that the hon. Gentleman's attitude and the responsibility that he puts to the House are acknowledged by the Government.<br/>
The Secretary of State insists that he is releasing local government from some of the obligations that it has had since 1944, but his proposal is almost universally deplored. There is opposition from the Standing Conference of Rural Community Councils at one end to the Council of Head Teachers at Voluntary Schools at the other, from the National Association of Health Authorities to the National Farmers Union, and coupled with them the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers. The opposition comes from bishops and bus conductors.<br/>
Even in a Bill that has been as hotly contested as the one before us, which has drawn so much critical comment, it is difficult to find any other part that has so united so many disparate sections of the community&#x2014;people of religious persuasion, people seeking to represent rural interests, people concerned about the future of education in our great cities, people with a professional interest, people with a parental interest, people with an interest that goes beyond the view expressed in education.<br/>
The Government must recognise the breadth and the depth of the opposition to their proposal. There are good reasons for the breadth and depth of that opposition. The clause will mean a negation of choice, brought about by a Government supposed to espouse choice in education. It means reneging on promises solemnly given by local education authorities seeking to reorganise education provision in their areas since 1944. It will have an effect on parents who permitted their local schools to close, agreeing with the local education authority to send their children to particular schools on the basis that they were completely assured that no extra payment would be imposed on them as a consequence of accepting the local education authority's proposal.<br/>
A further grave possibility, probably the saddest of all, is that the clause is a truant's licence. Most families will face the difficulties and do their best to ensure that their children have the money to go to school, regardless of the cost. They will be in contrast with that minority, regrettable as this fact of life may be, who will use the major financial burdens imposed on them to avoid their responsibility for getting their children to school. Any disincentive added to the disincentives that currently worry us, any addition to the level of truancy, which already concerns hon. Members on both sides of the House, must secure the unreserved hostility of us all.<br/>
The breach of trust and the negation of choice are of particular consequence for those parents who wish to send their children to denominational schools. As I said in Committee, possibly unnecessarily, I have no religious convictions. But it is self-evident to anyone who has

libertarian views that those who wish to have freedom to worship and freedom to secure the education of their children within the beliefs that they espouse should have that freedom. It is a time-honoured tradition, won at great cost to the people, throughout the history of this country, and cherished among those who have religious convictions and those who, like me, have none.<br/>
The power that the Government offer in clause 23 imposes a burden and constitutes a significant threat to the effective fulfilment of that denominational choice.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's argument is sincerely put. I was not a Member of the last Parliament. I am not certain about the hon. Gentleman's responsibilities. I do not think that he spoke on, or was responsible for, education in his party in the last Parliament. But he will, perhaps, recall that the previous Government took steps to impose upon local authorities such as Trafford, in part of my constituency, the obligation of comprehensive education, which struck at the root of the existence of Catholic schools&#x2014;[HON.

<p>The best answer is for the hon. Gentleman to visit the Catholic Educational Council and ask its views on comprehensive education. In those benighted areas, such as Bolton and one or two in the South-East that still retain 11-plus selection, the only parts of the seconlary sector that are comprehensive are those run as voluntary schools by the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church has an extremely good record of abolishing the inane system of selection at the age of 11. It was not the superimpositions of the 1976 Act that brought that about. It has been a continuing process, regardless of the Government and regardless of the proddings of legislation, for many years past, in the schools of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Knutsford (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) has hit the nub of the issue without realising it. The Roman Catholic authorities voluntarily negotiated with the local education authority in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne a comprehensive scheme. The local education authority pledged, as part of the new system, that free transport would be maintained for Roman Catholic schools. I have received a letter from the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle in which he sets out his fears that even an authority such as Newcastle, with the best will in the world, may be forced to charge if the clause is carried.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I, too, have seen the letter from the bishop and, indeed, letters from one or two other bishops drawing my attention to the possibility of huge impositions being made if parents seek to fulfil their choice on a denominational basis. Because of the wide distribution of details from every diocese in the country of the consequences of making impositions of charges, not only on the family pocket but also on the possible viability of schools in the secondary sector, I shall not exhaust the House by making extensive reference to the effects of charges where no charge has previously been imposed.<br/>
But the House should know that there are whole schools whose existence is threatened if pupils have to meet substantial charges for getting to school. There are some Catholic schools where 80 per cent., 90 per cent., and even 95 per cent. of pupils travelling on buses would have to pay substantial fares if they were to continue attending those schools after the date of which subsidies were withdrawn.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for that intervention. It makes my next point for me. Without the requirement of Government, the possibility of unanimity among all the local education authorities and a uniformity of provision among those authorities, let alone an equity of provision, is extremely remote. That is what unitary Government is for&#x2014;to seek to lay down conditions and to set upper and lower limits. It is not a derogation of local democracy to do so. It is the fulfilment of responsibility of national government to do so. I only wish that the Secretary of State would listen to the advice that he is getting from his hon. Friends on these matters.<br/>
The loss of trust is taken further by the fact that hundreds of thousands of parents whose children are currently in schools will now have to pay what I have called this new tax on parenthood. They had never expected to do so. The point has been made by hon. Members in interruptions and by the hon. Member for Nantwich that people accepted the idea of putting their children in particular schools on the absolute trust that they would never be required to pay to get those children to school.<br/>
The least that the Minister could do is to say that, wherever people have accepted a change of school, or the closure of a school, on the basis of the acceptance of a free school transport pass, then, by law, the local education authority will be required not to impose a charge and the Government will compensate them. Otherwise a midstream,


unheralded, major change in responsibilities is imposed on parents. That must be most unfair and totally unsupportable.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has highlighted a valid point with which I find myself in considerable sympathy. What information has he received from local authorities that have given such commitments that the commitments were open-ended in the sense that free school transport would be available for ever to children and children's children because of the closure of a village school? Or was an assurance given merely for the period during which the children already at that school would remain at school?</p>

<speech hansard_id="1721587" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-02-13a.1613.1" hansard_membership_id="6898" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11456" speakername="Mr. Kinnock" colnum="1613" time="19:15:00">
<p>I do not think that it helps anybody to put upon the matter the kind of legalistic interpretation sought by the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that if parents had been told that at some future date free transport was to be removed, or had been given a direct warning of that possibility, their attitudes to closure would have been dramatically different. I do not think that consideration of a debating point such as that introduced by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) will get us much further in this consideration.<br/>
The attitude of the rural communities is probably best enunciated by the National Farmers Union in its circular of 24 January. With commendable brevity it says
<q>The withdrawal of transport services and/or the imposition of charges will lead to parents in rural areas becoming disadvantaged in comparison to their urban counterparts in terms of the range of choices available to them and their children as regards schools, means of transport and the cost of transport.</q>
I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House have seen the circular and I am sure that they know that the NFU is giving a most direct and categoric warning that the consequences of this important change will be very serious for rural communities.<br/>
The kind of costs that will be imposed on parents are now being discussed and presented by local education authorities all over the country. For instance, the removal of subsidies would cost parents in the city of Birmingham &#x00A3;50,000. That is a sum they never had to find before. In Coventry the sum is &#x00A3;70,000, in the

city of Oxford &#x00A3;77,000, in Was all &#x00A3;89,000, and in Cardiff &#x00A3;50,000. That is the kind of transfer of wealth&#x2014;to borrow a phrase from the Labour Party manifesto&#x2014;that will take place. Instead of the whole community assuming responsibility for assisting parents with the cost of getting their children to school, the imposition will now be made direct upon the parents. That is what characterises the charge as a tax on parenthood.<br/>
Devon county council is expecting to save &#x00A3;26,000. The figure for North Yorkshire is &#x00A3;400,000, for Northants &#x00A3;800,000 and for Northumberland &#x00A3;26,000, and the list goes on. That list indicates the money that will be taken from the pockets of the parents of these children.<br/>
Subsidies are being stopped in Surrey, Hampshire, Cambridge shire, Wiltshire, Redbridge, Avon, Dorset and Doncaster. In Shropshire the charge is expected to be 20p a day or &#x00A3;40 a year per pupil. In Staffordshire it will be 25p a day except for families on supplementary benefit or family income supplement, or for children receiving special education. That amounts to &#x00A3;50 a year. In Hereford and Worcestershire the figure will be &#x00A3;15 per term per child up to a maximum of two&#x2014;that is &#x00A3;45 a year for one child or &#x00A3;90 a year for two. In East Sussex the charge will be 35p a day for children at secondary and further education, up to a maximum of two, which is &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;75 a week or &#x00A3;70 a year.<br/>
We then come to Kent. I am glad to see that the continual representations and advertisements about the position in Kent appear to be having a desirable effect. Whereas the county was previously planning to charge even more extortionate sums, it is now down to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;50 a week for primary school children and &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 for children at secondary schools. If we could keep talking long enough on the Bill we might reduce the charges to a civilised level. However, it still amounts to &#x00A3;60 a year in respect of primary school children and &#x00A3;100 per year for a secondary school child. As Kent is not placing any poverty limit on these charges, the normal-sized family with two children, one in primary school and one in secondary school, will have to pay &#x00A3;160 a year, an outlay that it did not previously have to face.<br/>
If that is not a disincentive, a broadening of the poverty trap, a tax on


parenthood, a derogation of responsibility and a negation of choice I do not know what is. Yet the Secretary of State is prepared to sit in the Department and preside over this kind of occurrence.<br/>
We have heard from him and from the Under-Secretary that it is a choice of transport of classrooms. If the choice were that stark, I am sure that the debate would go a great deal wider than it has gone. But if he wants evidence that his policy is not an alternative to cuts in the classroom, but a precursor to them, and that the most that can be claimed for his policy of cuts is that they absorb some of the initial impact of the classroom cuts, he has only to look at the report of the Educational Publishers Council produced yesterday, showing reductions of up to 25 or 30 per cent. in real terms in the amounts being spent by education authorities on books.<br/>
So the right hon. and learned Gentleman's policy is not a serious alternative, certainly not to the extent of &#x00A3;20 million a year, which is the saving that he is expected to make under clause 23 if it remains in the Bill.<br/>
The question arises of whether a vote for the amendment seeking to remove clause 23 is a vote of no confidence in local government. I say that it is not. It is a vote against the enormous dilemma, the tortuous position into which the right hon. and learned Gentleman is putting local government by his action. I said in Committee that there was no good democratic reason for local or any other form of government not being faced with difficulties and invidious choices. That is what democratic government exists for. But it is totally unsupportable for impositions to be made upon local authorities and then for the national Government to desert their responsibility for providing those authorities with the means of meeting those burdens. The authorities are being faced with a hopelessly invidious choice involving how they make the cuts and who shall suffer as a consequence of them. They are being given freedom without the means of exercising it, and new responsibilites without new powers. That cannot be supported.<br/>
It is not good enough for Ministers to give the replies that they have given. I have two here, but there are many of

them. The first is given in a letter to the Transport and General Workers Union&#x2014;my union&#x2014;which states that the Government expect that local education authorities
<q>will make sensible use of their powers.</q>
The other is in a letter to my right hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Mr. Freeson). It reads:
<q>Accordingly, the legislation we have introduced will give LEAs discretion to charge for providing transport, but we have no reason to suppose that LEAs will not continue to give sympathetic consideration to families whose children attend Church schools.</q>
Of course there is no reason to suppose that. The LEAs will do their level best, but they will be &#x00A3;20 million worse off next year than they were last with the same or even greater responsibilities in some respects. They will certainly have the same responsibilities to meet the desire of parents to exercise their denominational choice. So the Government are taking a very insular attitude and are deserting their responsibilities.<br/>
Let us consider the realities that face the local education authorities. They have enjoyed discretionary powers over many years in many spheres. They have exercised such powers over school uniform allowances, educational maintenance allowances for the 16-plus category, and on the statutory limits for assisting with free school transport. The disparity of treatment of pupils and parents from authority to authority makes us believe that in all these matters the Government should seek to give guidance and direction, and the means of fulfilling obligations. Rather than expanding the area of discretion without providing the means effectively to exercise that discretion on behalf of and to the advantage of the children in the care of those LEAs, the Government should be narrowing the degree of discretion.<br/>
The clause will make it more difficult for the LEAs to reorganise education. It will make administration massively more expensive. It is invidious, insidious and entirely odious, and we shall be glad to support the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) in the Lobby later.</p>

<p>No, not racing.<br/>
We have a strange phenomenon in the country now. There is a mixture of classes in the villages as country people move out. There are rich whites and poor villagers and those features which were formerly the basis of village life are being pushed out. That fact is demonstrated by remarks by Ministers both of this Administration and of the Labour Administration to the effect that village halls were of no importance.<br/>
Conditions in rural areas could deteriorate. There is the probable rise in the price of oil which would mean that something like 30 per cent. of rural transport over the next few years would vanish. That is why I support my hon. Friend's amendment.<br/>
Roman Catholics and people of other denominations will face problems such as the distances children will have to travel to school. Roman Catholics in this country may be better off than Roman Catholics in the United States who must pay for the whole of their education but English Roman Catholics still put down 15 per cent. more than anyone else for their children's education.<br/>
What is happening to our rural schools? The admirable education authority in Staffordshire is discussing the closure of 33 schools, many of them rural schools. If those schools are closed, it will mean not only that a pledge has been broken but that insult will have been added to injury for those people whose children have lost their school. They will have to pay to transport their children to another school.<br/>
It has been said that we must strike a balance between economics and politics. I regard the two as combined. What is at stake here is a comparatively small sum of money in relation to the damage that

will be done. I hope that when the Secretary of State replies he will deal with all the problems described by my hon. Friend who so bravely and properly tabled this amendment. I hope that he will win the confidence of the House which, I regret to say, he does not enjoy at the moment.</p>

<p>I intend to stick to educational matters in my speech. There is no doubt that this clause is part of a Bill which sets back the educational clock. Writing in <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday, John Fairhall said:
<q>there is still just time for&#x2026;Conservative MPs to put country before party and save us from the worst effects of the Education Bill&#x2026;concerned with money raising rather than an educational motivation.</q>
There is no doubt that any impoverishment of public services affects children. It particularly affects children from families least able to look after themselves. This clause will have that direct effect.<br/>
The Roman Catholic Bishop of Hex-ham and Newcastle has written a considered letter to local Members indicating that between the Tweed and the Tees there are 50,000 secondary schoolchildren in Roman Catholic schools. Of that number 12,000 travel to school free on subsidised transport. He estimates that if the Bill is passed as drafted 10,000 children will have to pay to travel to school. The cost per pupil has been given as &#x00A3;1 a week by the Secretary of State who believes that that is a reasonable figure.<br/>
The bishop reckons that on that estimate the cost to the Catholic community of his part of the Northern region will be &#x00A3;400,000 a year. That is money that families did not previously have to find.<br/>
I spent most of my life in education trying to persuade parents that it was important for their children to stay on at school. We all have colleagues who had to leave school for economic reasons and this clause will be a deterrent to a boy or girl of 16 wishing to stay on at school. They are mature enough to know that the cost of school bus fares will be a terrible burden on the family finances. The incentive to leave school at the statutory age will be all the greater for them. That is another backward step.<br/>
There is now ample evidence&#x2014;and everyone in the education service agrees


&#x2014;that parental motivation, interest and involvement has a greater influence on the child than does the school. I have always said that the home is a more powerful influence than the school. I do not think it can be denied that there are families, certainly in my constituency, in Catholic communities where 80 per cent. of children travel to school by bus. If this Bill goes through, some of those families will not be able to afford even 20p a day for school bus fares. In <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday, John Fairhall wrote:
<q>This Bill is sentencing such families to years of grinding poverty.</q>
The educational features of the Bill bother me even more than the financial aspects. We need to increase the numbers of people who wish to take the opportunity of full education and any deterrent to that aim must be closely examined by the House, since the Bill will be a deterrent to parents doing the best for their children. The expense for some of those parents will be so great that they will encourage their children to leave school at the earliest opportunity.<br/>
I feel strongly that we think about education in too narrow terms. Education is far more than the achievement of O-levels and A-levels. Parents who choose an education in a denominational school for their children are saying that there are more important things in education. They are saying that other values are as important as academic attainment.<br/>
The Bill will deny the legal right of parents to choose a school for their children. Parents may not be able to afford to send their children to a particular school because they live too far away from it. In the last nine months the divisions in society have increased. Society is more divided than it was a year ago. The Bill creates even greater divisions. I beg the Secretary of State to have second thoughts and to seek to withdraw the clause.</p>

<p>So many hon. Members wish to address the House that it behoves us to be brief.<br/>
I start with a proposition which I think will command the support of the House. Of all the provisions with which I, as an ordinary Back Bencher, have to deal, few are more unpopular than the present system of imposing a two-or three-mile

limit for charging. Few issues cause deeper resentment. Although that has not been spelt out today, it has been in the debate generally. There is a reaching-back attitude that the present system is perfect and an essential part of the British way of life. That is a curious attitude of mind. I cannot believe that many hon. Members actually want the proposition which was so ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor), which would permanently put us back in that position. At the end of his able speech, my hon. Friend made it explicitly clear that he was not against charging. He and the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) want an upper limit but in principle they are not against a charge across the board.<br/>
Reluctantly I must be harsh. The House knows my personal commitment to a particular denominational form of schooling. I stand second to none in my total commitment to that. However, I have to say, reluctantly, that some of the arguments put to me from outside by my friends in the Roman Catholic Church have verged on the unscrupulous. I carefully exempt from that my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby (Mr. Pawsey), who has been the Roman Catholic spokesman on this side of the House. He has fought his corner with courtesy, good humour and vigour&#x2014;as he has the right to do&#x2014;and with total fairness throughout.<br/>
I am totally committed to Anglican schools and my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby is committed to Roman Catholic schools. We must remind ourselves that such schools receive 85 per cent. of their capital costs and the whole of their running costs. They have a special position which is totally different from that in the maintained sector. A real moral problem is involved. We should ask whether those figures are becoming so large that we are claiming from our friends in the State rights which morally we can no longer justify. It speaks volumes for the general approaches of the House and the nation that in their tolerance they are prepared to grant the denominations and the Jewish community that special position, in spite of the comparatively small amount of effort financially which they contribute.<br/>
I place it on record that I resent the assertion by some that there is a


deliberate act by my right hon. and learned Friend and other Ministers to undermine the 1944 settlement. No good has come from making such assertions. Of course, in Anglican schools at secondary level, as in Roman Catholic schools at secondary level, the catchment area tends to be wide. Of course, there are anxieties in country districts. I have deep roots in a country district and I think that I understand the problem, even though my constituency is no longer as agricultural as it once was.</p>

<p>The fear is that some local authorities will positively discriminate against denominational schools and those attending them and against those who have to travel long distances. The costs of attending a denominational school can be high if one lives 15 miles or 20 miles away from it. It is almost unbelievable that there has been so little mention of another of the amendments in the group which we are discussing&#x2014;that which provides that any charge should be across the board. That would remove the greater part of the legitimate and well-understood anxiety of those involved in denominational schools or who live in country districts.</p>

<p>In an age of inflation I cannot believe that we can honestly say that a figure should be written into the Bill. If it is not written into the Bill it would have to be provided for by order. If it is provided for by order it can be changed by order, and we are back where we started. I am convinced that the Secretary of State's strategy is right. For too long expenditure has not been directed at what happens in the classroom. My right hon. and learned Friend's strategy is coupled with a trust in local authorities. I am prepared to go all the way with his strategy.</p>

<p>Perhaps I misunderstood some of the comments by the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Strubenzee) but I thought he said that the Catholic Church was unscrupulous. If I am right, I take him to task. Not only the Catholic Church, but the local authorities, the Church of England and all those organisations which are trying to provide a good education service are anxious about the proposition. It was most unfair to use the term unscrupulous.<br/>
I give credit to the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) for his courage and sincerity. Many of us are concerned&#x2014;not in a political sense&#x2014;about the effect of the Bill on the education service.<br/>
I pay tribute to the Under-Secretary of State for the courtesy he showed to a deputation that I brought to London last week to discuss the matter with him. I am sure that an interpretation of our discussions has been passed to the Secretary of State.<br/>
There is a general concern within local authorities and denominational schools about the impact that the imposition of clause 23 could have on the education service. We must recognise that in rural areas it will create a massive problem. I represent Leeds, which is a compact area, but we will face difficulties also.<br/>
I am speaking as a former Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science. One issue that has not arisen in the debate is that, because of the drop in the birth rate, within the next two or three years the school population will drop by about one-third. That will cause great problems for the local authorities and the denominational schools. Instead of children travelling from point A to point B, they will have to travel from point A to point C. We are discussing the present costs to parents, but in three years' time those costs will be increased considerably because they will have to pay for their children to travel to point C instead of to point B.<br/>
The Secretary of State, his Ministers, and those who sit behind him, have to be reminded that on political platforms at local and national level their main argument has been the right of parental choice. If the Bill is passed in its present form the consequence will be that parental choice will no longer exist, except for the wealthiest section of the community. What about the remainder of the community?<br/>
I declare my interest as a Catholic. Although I am speaking mainly on behalf of the Catholic community, I am speaking also on behalf of the Church of England. The Churches feel that they and the children who attend their schools will be adversely affected by the Bill. It would be impossible for me, my wife, or any other Catholic parent in the lower income group to send their children to


the school of their denomination. That is vitally important to many people in this country. There is a large section of parents who are anxious that their children should be able to attend the schools of their choice.<br/>
If the Bill passes unamended, it will create grave problems for those parents. I hope that the Government will reflect very seriously before pushing the Bill through unamended.</p>

<p>I attended the debate this evening with an open mind. I have listened carefully to the contributions of all hon. Members. I look forward to the contribution of my hon. Friend the Minister, and would like clarification on a number of points when he replies. I wish to place on record my thanks to him and his colleagues for listening to the representations of right hon. and hon. Members on clause 23.<br/>
I was interested in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee), who pointed out the dilemmas faced by those with strong connections with the Roman Catholic Church and by Roman Catholic pupils. There are two ways of considering the argument. It could be argued that the position of Roman Catholics is a privileged one. It would be argued also that the Roman Catholic communities subsidise the places of their pupils to the tune of 15 per cent. per place.<br/>
I have received interesting correspondence from a gentleman named Father Devaney, who lives in Coventry, South-West. In his letter, he told me that there are 219 children in his parish attending the Bishop Ullathorne school. He pointed out the difficulties that families will face if transport charges are introduced at &#x00A3;1 and upwards per head. He said:
<q>it is often overlooked what the parish contributes to education; we give&#x2014;4,800 each year to the general diocesan fund, &#x00A3;438 per capita levy of &#x00A3;2 per child for Ullathorne, and last year we spent &#x00A3;2,000 on painting the junior school of which we received an 85 per cent. grant".</q>
Roman Catholic and other denominational schools are our friends in the education system. They pay their way. I hope that the Minister will in his reply give some indication of his views on the contribution from denominational schools.<br/>
I listened equally carefully to the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) and found myself in agreement with much of what he said about the use of resources inside the education service.<br/>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for answering a written question on the matter. I am dismayed to find there is plenty of leverage inside the education service for finding cuts of at least &#x00A3;20 million, starting in 1980&#x2013;81, in addition to those for which we have already asked.<br/>
The figures given to me by my hon. Friend are that in 1978 there were 671,000 non-teaching and administrative staff employed in the service. They were distributed between 201,000 full-time non-teaching and administrative staff, and 470,000 part-time staff. If that is reduced to full-time equivalents, that gives a figure of about 550,000 non-teaching staff in England and Wales. There are 480,000 teachers in England and Wales. That is a ratio of more than 1 to 1.<br/>
If we are to give guidance to local authorities&#x2014;and the Lord knows that we are giving guidance to them, especially under the clause, on the manner in which charges can be made if they were to use discretion&#x2014;surely we can say that it is about time that the gravy train in administration in the education departments of local authorities is at least slowed down.<br/>
In Coventry we are facing a reduction of about 210 teachers. There is a disproportionate cut in the number of teachers in the coming year compared with the cut in non-teaching and support staff. I appreciate that we cannot control local authorities, and that we cannot dictate the policies that they must pursue. But we, as the Government, must say to local authorities "Here is guidance on how you cope with a reduction in the resources in the light of falling school rolls. You may cut your non-teaching staff and accelerate the natural wastage programme in line with falling school rolls."</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Coventry, South-West (Mr. Butcher) was right to suggest that, if we must look for savings in education, one of the last areas should be transport costs.<br/>
I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) for the way in which he moved the amendment. It must have been difficult for him, because no one enjoys differing from his party. However, we have to do that from time to time to represent our constituents properly.<br/>
I am sad to notice that there are no Scottish Conservative Back Benchers representing rural constituencies present in the Chamber. Indeed, not one has appended his name to the amendment. I hope, however, that they will in due course join us in the Lobbies and thereby represent and protect the interests of their constituents.<br/>
The provisions of the Bill will have far-reaching effects on virtually every local education authority area which embraces, even in part, a rural area. The Secretary of State for Scotland&#x2014;and presumably the Secretary of State for the. Environment&#x2014;has jumped the gun on this issue. He has taken away from local authorities the money that he anticipates they will he able to save as a result of implementing the provisions of the Bill. He has taken away the money by a reduction in the rate support grant.<br/>
The Secretary of State is right when he says that local authorities will have the freedom to do what they like. They will have freedom to clobber the people that they represent in either of two ways. The Secretary of State has issued them with two boots&#x2014;a left boot and a right boot. I have one of each operating in my constituency. The left boot is in the Lothian region&#x2014;a Labour-controlled authority&#x2014;which has decided not to cut services. In order not to cut services, it has to put up the rates by up to 40 per cent. The


Borders regional council at the other end of my constituency is not Labour controlled. It has decided to impose cuts. It has already declared that it intends to impose charges for school transport under these provisions.<br/>
The hon. Member for Nantwich was right to say that it is important not to take these charges in isolation. We must also bear in mind local authorities which have in the past closed village schools and those which are doing so now.<br/>
There are four village schools in my constituency which are at present under the axe: St. Abbs, Whit some, Millburn and Mertoun. If the regional council fulfills the policy on which it has embarked, we shall have only 11 primary schools in the whole tract of the former county of Berwick shire where there are now 25. If the closures go through, besides losing their schools, the people in these communities will have to pay for transport to the next nearest primary school. They will have insult added to injury in that respect.<br/>
I should have declared two interests. First, I am the father of a baby boy who in due course, if the school is still open, will need transport to a village school. Secondly, I am a member of the National Farmers Union for Scotland. I am not a sponsored Member, unlike my hon. Friend, the Member for West Stirling-shire (Mr. Canavan). However, it is worth pointing out some of the comments that the NFU has made to Scottish Members of Parliament. It is to its credit that it sought to represent all people in rural agricultural areas. It states that its basic cause for concern over clause 25 remains.<br/>
The union was accused of exaggerating the potential problem of charges for transport of schoolchildren following the calculations in its previous letter. It states:
<q>In the event, our worries have been shown to be perfectly justified. We understand that one English local authority (Kent county council) proposes to introduce from 1 April flat rate charges for school transport.</q>
We have already heard about this matter. I understand that the authority has now revised the rates downwards. However, I understand that in the current financial year the average cost of transport of pupils within the Highlands regional council area is &#x00A3;145 per head. Taking that into account, it is not diffi-

cult to imagine that in due course families in rural areas could he paying up to &#x00A3;185 per head per year.<br/>
I pay tribute to the National Farmers Union for Scotland for representing all people in rural areas and joining the representatives of farm workers on this occasion in this worthwhile campaign.<br/>
Having studied the amendment, I have come to the conclusion that the hon. Member for Nantwich is right that the clause is not amendable. The truth is that no amendment can redeem this clause. The Government's fundamental objective is to make some families, particularly those in rural areas and those whose children attend denominational schools, pay for what has hitherto been provided free by the State.<br/>
Finally, I should like to point out the basic dishonesty&#x2014;it is not unfair to say that it is dishonesty&#x2014;of the Secretary of State's amendment No. 151, which refers to flat rate charges being imposed. He knows well that the charges are not flat rate. They will apply only to children who need transport to school. By no means does that cover all children. He also knows that they will apply only in regions where a high proportion of children have to be transported&#x2014;in other words, in rural areas and places where children are sent to denominational schools.<br/>
It is dishonest to imply that a flat rate will mean equal charges for people within a given area. The clauses are designed to discriminate, as the hon. Member for Nantwich has pointed out, against a large proportion of families in this country. That includes virtually every family in my constituency. I sincerely hope that the House will reject the clause in due course.</p>

<p>I should like to turn to another unsatisfactory aspect of the clause. Bus operators in this country are concerned that the protection under the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1953 is removed by the clause. We have already heard about the problems of rural England. A real problem for rural England is the decline of public transport. I do not wish to trespass into the area of a Committee that has been sitting upstairs this week, but, if the clause goes through as it stands, the law which protected many rural bus services will be rendered nugatory. There


is a real danger that the present protection for many of these services, which is still recognised in the Transport Bill which is going through the House, will be removed.<br/>
Therefore, I have put down certain amendments, which are conjoined with the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor), to draw the attention of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to the real danger of a deterioration because bus services will not be protected. At the moment, a local authority can put on a service provided that it obtains the consent of the Traffic Commissioner. In my amendments I ask simply that the protection should continue.<br/>
I should like to say one or two words in support of tonight's main debate. I admit that before Christmas I held roughly the same line as my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State. I am now willing to admit that I was wrong. I should like him to admit that he and the Government have made a mistake in pressing ahead as they have done. The reason why I reached my decision is that I felt, like my right hon. Friend the Member for Stafford and Stone (Mr. Fraser), that the issue had moved away from the simple one of school transport. It concerns the quality of life in rural England.<br/>
The resistance in my constituency to the proposal has been one of the most remarkable upsurges in feeling that I have seen since I have been a member of this House. In one of my villages only eight children use the school bus but virtually everybody&#x2014;old-age pensioners, farm workers and those with no connection with children using the school bus&#x2014;has signed a petition. They regard the proposal as a direct threat to the continuing life of their community. We in the Conservative Party will ignore that feeling at our peril. Once we have alienated our bedrock support in those areas, we shall find it difficult to get it back. The people have gradually felt betrayed over the years. The last people that they expected to betray them were those in our party.<br/>
Therefore, with great determination, I shall join my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich in voting for his amendment. I also advise my right hon. and hon. Friends

on the Front Bench that, should that vote fail, I am afraid that I cannot support the Government on Third Reading.</p>

<p>The strong and courageous criticisms that have been made of the clause by Conservative Back Benchers come as no surprise for we tied on the issue in Committee on an amendment which attempted to bring about some change.

I venture to suggest that the Government would have been defeated on a subsequent amendment in Committee if it had not been said then that further consideration would be given to the matter and that a new amendment would be brought forward.</p>

<p>However, the new amendment does little or nothing to allay the fears of those who were concerned on all sides of the Committee. It is true that the Government amendment provides that the rate for any one age group shall be uniform and flat but it places no limit on the rate. We have seen the enormous range of possibilities. Therefore, we must come back to the Government and say that this will not do. The most effective vehicle for doing that has been brought forward by the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor). In effect, he has dug a hole in the Bill and said that the Government cannot have the Bill as drafted and unamended.</p>

<p>The effects of the provisions would be to discriminate severely against groups in our society that the Government should not discriminate against. Whatever the intentions of the Government, there is an inherent discrimination in charging those who, for the reasons that I am about to state, have to make use of school transport. Large numbers of people are able to get their children to school for nothing or at minimal cost because they live within a reasonable distance of the school. However, for certain groups of people that is not so.</p>

<p>Many children in rural areas who live at considerable distances from schools&#x2014;setting aside the question of school closures and reorganisations to which I shall return&#x2014;particularly children of farm workers and so on and those in remote settlements, have no choice but to travel


long distances to school. Incidentally, long distances apply to every aspect of their lives: whether it is entertainment for teenagers or shopping for housewives, their cost of living is more expensive than those of people living in towns because of the distances they have to travel. Therefore, in practice, they are discriminated against because they have to pay for school transport. Likewise, the proposal discriminates against those who send their children to denominational schools because they believe that to be important. The sense of indignation and shock in the Roman Catholic community is genuine. It is based on the practical fact that in most cases their children have to travel further than the statutory walking distances to school. They have been encouraged to build their schools on the basis of operating a wide catchment area for many years.</p>

<p>Other groups are affected by the proposal. People in Wales have sought to make provision for education through the medium of the Welsh language. In such cases, local authorities have encouraged the schools to serve a wide catchment area. They, too, will be discriminated against because they will have to pay a price to get the children to the schools.</p>

<p>Perhaps the keenest sense of grievance is felt by those put into those categories by education decision-making. The hon. Member for Nantwich pointed out that such people would have fought to the death for their village school if they had known that the price of its closure would be not merely to lose the benefits of a school in the community but to have to pay transport charges to attend a school miles away to which they never wanted to send their children. That will go on for generations. Even some people without children fight against village school closures because they have every intention of sending children to the school in subsequent years.</p>

<p>Many people have been affected by the reorganisation of education. I do not refer simply to the secondary reorganisation of the last few years of comprehensive schools; I refer right back to 1944 and the creation of secondary schools as opposed to the old all-age school in each village. In times past, all the children attended the local school. The expansion of secondary education has taken them further away. People have

been critical of that sort of development and they will be the most aggrieved of all at having to pay transport charges.</p>

I shall not deploy at length arguments that I have used on previous issues, but unless people receive family income supplement or supplementary benefit they will suffer under the provisions. That means that a farm worker who is earning enough to raise him just above the family income supplement level will suffer heavily. A person will be better off if he remains out of work, because if he gets a job he will have to pay heavy charges. If someone is asked to work overtime, he should refuse because it will not pay him to do so. If he works overtime he may have to pay school transport charges.</p>

<p>The Government use two arguments against me. First, they argue that there is an anomaly in the present law. They say that the present law is unsatisfactory, because many people live just within the two-or three-mile limit and they have to pay quite heavy charges for school transport. However, there is nothing in the Bill to help those people. The Bill will merely provide for their discomfort to be shared. Equality of misery is a new Tory policy.</p>

<p>I pay tribute to my local education authority in Cumberland. It has tried very hard to take up those who live just inside the two- and three-mile limits, by using its discretionary power. It has filled empty places on the school buses. It has tried to help those living on the outer limits. As a result of Government pressure such authorities are increasingly unable to continue such discretionary activities. The Bill does not help those people. Secondly, the Government argue that local authorities do not have to make these charges. In several debates Ministers have said that local authorities are reasonable and that they will not impose such harsh charges. However, with every other breath the Government tell local authorities to levy such charges.


How else can the Government's savings be made, in the absence of alternative provisions? The Secretary of State has repeatedly said that authorities that do not make savings by imposing these charges will have to pay the price of cuts in the mainstream of education. Rural authorities and those in which, for historical reasons, many children travel long distances will have to lower their educational standards more than other authorities, if they do not impose the charges. There is no way out.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will contain himself for a minute.

He may get excited about what I am about to say.<br/>
One must look at the Government's strategy on the PSBR. I subscribe to that strategy. It is essential to get our PSBR down. Every hour of every day we spend just over &#x00A3;1 million more than we have earned. Someone must pay that back. My right hon. and learned Friend's amendment is reasonable, as regards our school transport. The Conservative Party has always been in favour of giving autonomy to local representatives. The Secretary of State has done that.<br/>
Opposition Members may laugh when I mention democracy. They probably have a different understanding of that concept. I do not believe in the democracy of the Labour Party's NEC. However, local authorities should have the right to do as they wish with their money. The Government are merely stating that they can choose whether to charge. Local authorities and local health athuorities sometimes take up an emotive issue, such as that of closing a casualty ward or an old people's home. However, they never tackle administrative over manning. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) mentioned, because of present anomalies 85 per cent. of parents are already paying the transport costs of their children.<br/>
If we cut public expenditure, we must make local authorities responsible for economising in their administrative staff and so on. However, if the Government of the day succumb to pressure because it is an emotive issue, local authorities will think that they need only kick up a fuss for the Government to give way. As a result, the PSBR will go up.<br/>
There is much hypocritical talk about public expenditure and school transport. My hon. Friends know that Opposition Members are making a political issue out of that, and we should not fall into the trap. We must stick to our strategy. It was agreed in the manifesto. We should not give way simply because it is an emotive issue. We must put the responsibility on local authorities to economise in other sections of their education vote. If they do not, let the local Member of Parliament press them and let local voters see that they are not returned next time.</p>

The reasons put forward for not opposing the clause entirely ignore that fact.<br/>
It has been suggested that some people now have to pay for transport for a distance of less than three miles, and, because they are miserable, others should also be made miserable. The hon.

<p>I take it that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that the great majority of local authorities are under no obligation to provide transport for the Roman Catholic community?

<p>In many cases, including my area, local authorities are providing that transport. Since the 1944 Act, it has come to be expected and welcomed by the Catholic community and by other parents who are able to send their children to the school of their choice, not necessarily the nearest school, as a result of these payments.<br/>
The imposition of these charges will hurt precisely those parents who are least able to afford it. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock)'quoted from the Minister of State's letter. He could have continued the quotation:
<q>We continue to attach great importance to parental preferences for the education of children, but this general principle has to be applied with due regard to what the public purse can afford.</q>
That was the point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. However, the private purse will now determine which children can go to the school of their choice and which cannot.

<p>I appreciate that the intention of clause 23 is twofold. First, it is to assist the Government in the overriding need to reduce public spending. Secondly, it is to devolve power to local authorities.<br/>
I am in general agreement with the Government's overall strategy. We were elected on the basic premise that we should reduce public spending and borrowing. It is fair to remember, however, that the saving envisaged under the


clause is &#x00A3;20 million out of a total of &#x00A3;120 million, amounting to about 17 per cent. That is not a significant part of the education budget and it is an even smaller part of the national budget. The difficulties caused by effecting such a saving will be out of all proportion to the distress caused.<br/>
The intention of amendments Nos. 42 and 92, and withdrawn amendment No. 91 is basically to protect the large family from the effects of clause 23. I make no apology for my defence of the larger family&#x2014;very often the larger family is the poorer family. Large families are often derided, but there is nothing funny in having to feed and clothe several children and transport them to school everyday.<br/>
Amendment No. 42 makes 25p the maximum figure, and quite clearly there will be the discretion for local authorities to charge less. Even assuming that 25p is accepted as a reasonable transport charge, it means that a family of three children will still have to pay an additional &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;75 a week over and above every current charge that family is experiencing. That is a new expense, and for the larger family it is an unacceptable and unreasonable expense. Therefore, I hope that focal authorities, when they read the report of this debate in <i>Hansard,</i> will take note of the views that have been expressed and interpret them in an appropriate and civilised manner.</p>

<p>Had my hon. Friend allowed me to develop my theme, he would have received a complete answer to his question.<br/>
I have heard it said in this House and elsewhere that child benefit should be used to defray the cost of getting children to school. That is just not equitable. Child benefit was introduced long before this charge was thought of. If we should decide to use child benefit as a method of defraying transport costs, that benefit must be increased. Therefore, where is the point? There is none.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 42 and 92 do nothing to damage the principle or the fabric of the Bill, but they build in a safeguard for the large rural family. I cannot believe that parents should be penalised simply because of their address and the fact that they live in the country. Once it may have been argued that those living in the country were compensated by lower rates, but successive adjustments to the rate support grant to the detriment of shire counties has altered the balance, and the difference, if any, is now much smaller.<br/>
In supporting the amendments, I do not seek to denigrate local authorities. I have been involved in local government as a councillor for 23 years and I am well aware of the virtues of local authorities. I am convinced that, should we give these new powers to local authorities, they will not suddenly go berserk and seek to impose highly expensive transport charges on parents. But there are exceptions to every rule and already those exceptions are becoming apparent. We have heard a lot about the exceptions in this debate this evening. The hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) produced a comprehensive list of them. Other Members have referred to several counties which are being grossly unfair and discriminatory.<br/>
Another argument that has been used to justify clause 23 is the need to remove the anomalies that are inherent in the present system&#x2014;particularly the two-mile and three-mile limits. It has been said that the limits are disliked by parents. For example, in the same street there may be one child who travels free while there is another who pays. I accept that that is an anomaly. But in my 23 years as a councillor I have found that very few people have complained. That does not mean that they do not dislike it&#x2014;of course they do&#x2014;but they accept it because it has existed for so many years.<br/>
I believe that the basic premise on the question of anomalies is wrong. The effect of clause 23 will create, not reduce, anomalies. The county of Warwickshire is proposing a rate of 20p per day per child. Solihull, which until the county was reorganised, was in Warwickshire, is proposing 10p per day. Children in Birmingham, adjacent to Warwickshire, will receive free transport. Oxford shire, which also adjoins Warwickshire, is giving


no help to denominational pupils. Leicestershire is deferring any charges for 12 months. In a small geographical area there are five different schemes. If the decision on transport charges is left to the discretion of local authorities, it will result in a great unevenness of transport provisions. We are not reducing the number of anomalies. We are building them into the system. For local authorities, ideas will differ enormously. I do not doubt that individual Members of Parliament will receive representations from constituents. They will protest that in one local authority area transport is free but in another a certain price will be fixed. In the removal of one anomaly we create another. Hon. Members with far greater experience than I have will be aware of the furore which has been created by old-age pensioners protesting about the anomalies in concessionary fares. We have all received demands that a national charge should be levied to remove the anomalies from the system.<br/>
The protest by the elderly will be as nothing compared to the protests that we shall receive from parents. Parents have a statutory duty to get their children to school. For them, that journey is not a pleasure. It is a positive and absolute duty.<br/>
The Minister is clearly anxious to allow local authorities to use discretion. The inference is that we should trust the local authorities because they are supposed to be responsible to the electorate, as are hon. Members. Yet the Minister is careful to undermine that very point. He has put at least one safeguard into the Bill: children and parents in receipt of family income supplements will travel free. We already distrust local authorities to that extent.<br/>
I turn now to the question of denominational schools, particularly Catholic schools. I declare an interest. I am a Catholic. Now I have heard two clear and very conflicting views expressed: first, that the Catholic bishops are not really concerned; secondly, that the fuss that is being created about clause 23 is a Catholic fuss and is merely an example of Catholics maintaining their traditional reputation for awkwardness.<br/>
I quote from a letter from the Bishop of Portsmouth, who is also the chairman

of the Catholic Education Council. He writes:
<q>Our Catholic school system in many local authority areas is dependent upon the provision of transport to school. Very many of our schools have been sited, built or reorganised on the understanding or agreement that there would be free transport. The bishops of England and Wales are very concerned indeed about the whole question. I am writing on their behalf as well as for the Catholic Education Council to ask for all the help and support you can give us at the Report stage of the Education Bill which could have grave consequences for Catholic education.</q>
There is nothing ambiguous in that statement. It is a clear cry to this House to defend the principle of denominational education.<br/>
I should like to emphasise my ecumical reputation to be impartial and to quote this time from the Anglican Bishop of Coventry. He says:
<q>The dual system in this country is a unique partnership in education between Church and State and this clause puts it into jeopardy. If the Government's proposal to allow greater discretion to local education authorities on school transport results in the withdrawal of subsidies then the aided schools could be very hard hit indeed, particularly in rural areas. This may well mean in many cases the withdrawal of a freedom of parental choice for a voluntary school, which would not only appear to deny the Government's declared intention to widen parental choice, but also deny the opportunity of Church school education which the dual system makes possible. In not a few cases it would mean the closure of schools.</q></p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman, having quoted statements from an Anglican bishop and a Catholic bishop, aware that this simply emphasises the fact that when the agreement was made with Lord Butler, just before the 1944 Act, it was not simply about the dual system and about voluntary schools? The free transport element was an integral part of that agreement made with Lord Butler between the two great Churches in this country and the State system.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I should like later, with the permission of the House, to touch gently on something that Lord Butler said.<br/>
I turn now to my second point concerning the argument that the whole of the fuss is a Catholic fuss. I believe that it would be a grievous error to identify the uproar so far caused by clause 23 as a purely denominational uproar. It


would be an even greater mistake for this House to assume that it is a Catholic uproar. It is true that denominational schools are greatly concerned about the effects of the clause, but all the denominational schools are involved, as I have sought to prove from the two letters from which I have quoted.<br/>
The reason why perhaps the Catholic Church has been the most vocal is simply that it has the most denominational schools and has the largest school population likely to be affected by the clause. It is therefore entirely reasonable that we should have heard the Catholic voice being expressed very loud and clear.<br/>
Catholics rightly maintain that denominational schools have larger catchment areas than most. No one can argue with that. It is also worth while recalling that Catholic parents, as has been said elsewhere in the debate, find 15 per cent. of the cost of those denominational schools. In round figures, that is about &#x00A3;6 million a year.<br/>
The current Catholic school population is about 800,000 children. That is the number attending Catholic aided schools. That is a fairly sizeable minority. Interestingly, the last complete transport survey taken was in 1972. It showed that 21&#x00B7;5 per cent. of all secondary pupils travelled over 3 miles, but that figure rose to 40 per cent. for denominational schools. Again I emphasise the date&#x2014;1972. Would any hon. Member argue with me that the number of such children has increased enormously since that date?<br/>
The Catholic contribution to education is a sizeable one, and that is over and above the contribution that is currently made by Catholics as individual tax and rate payers. I am well aware&#x2014;and here I come to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee)&#x2014;that it is not the intention of the Government, and certainly not the intention of my right hon. and learned Friend or of the Bill, to discriminate against denominational schools. But again I put it to the House that the impact of clause 23, in charging for transport, must be to push families to the nearest school, irrespective of conscience or religious belief. That is not the intention but it will be the effect.<br/>
Government amendment No. 134 provides for a flat rate charge and that any

charges made must be uniform, but it does not make it mandatory for local authorities to provide transport in the first place. While I welcome the cart in the amendment, it is a pity that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has not put a horse between the shafts.</p>

<p>I was hoping that the hon. Member for Rugby (Mr. Pawsey) had power to talk out the clause. The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) referred to Conservative Members campaigning on the theme of cutting public expenditure, but complaining when they got down to detail. It would have been more honest of them if they had campaigned on the detail and told the people what would result from the election of a Conservative Government. Conservative Members have an opportunity tonight to put that right.<br/>
It was significant that the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee), in one of the rare speeches in defence of the Government, talked about the Church as a corporate body, while other hon. Members, including the hon. Members for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) and for Rugby have talked about a group of people whose standard of living would be cut if the clause went through.<br/>
We all have experiences of the anomalies of the three-mile system. We all know about children going to the same bus stop and some getting free transport while others have to pay, but local authorities have always had the power to use their discretion to get rid of those anomalies. It is a criticism of some authorities that they have not used that discretion. We have a minimum standard plus local authority discretion.<br/>
If the Government were simply trying to get rid of the anomalies we would have some sympathy for them, but that is not the purpose of the clause. Its object is to cut Government and local authority expenditure on school transport. Almost every clause in the Bill, with the significant exception of the provisions on public and private schools, is intended to cut public expenditure. I once called a previous Conservative Government's Education (Milk) Act mean, messy and miserable. That description applies equally to this Bill and a number of


others going through the House at the moment.<br/>
What will happen if a local authority uses the powers that the Bill is supposed to provide and maintains expenditure on school transport or even increases it, because of the growth of population? It will have the Secretary of State for the Environment breathing down its neck. He will be looking at not only the rate poundage, but at the speeches of councillors.<br/>
The Government intend to save money and to transfer it to someone else. They are not saying that the expenditure should stop or that children should not go to school on buses. Who will pay? It will be large families, mainly on lower incomes and above FIS and supplementary benefit level. They will be asked to make too much of a sacrifice for the Government's policies.<br/>
Those families did not get the income tax cuts that others received. They have had to bear the burden of big increases in mortgages, and the child benefit has been frozen. Families with children at school are having to make unduly large sacrifices.<br/>
The problem with school transport is mainly in the countryside, but my constituency falls within two metropolitan areas&#x2014;Manchester and Tameside&#x2014;and the Catholic schools in Tame side, which have gone comprehensive, have free transport provided for 25 per cent. of pupils. It is not just a rural problem, though the rural areas will suffer, just as they will suffer from other Government policies.<br/>
Therefore, the existing system, under which local authorities have duties and powers, is much better, despite its anomalies. I urge the Secretary of State to accept the view of the vast majority of his hon. Friends who have spoken, and to get rid of the clause.</p>

<p>I have given the Secretary of State an undertaking that I shall sit clown at 9 o'clock. I want to use this brief opportunity to put on record the Scottish position. I take it that the Secretary of State will give an undertaking that the decision of the House on the amendment to delete clause 23, whatever the decision be, will apply equally to clause 25, relating to Scotland.<br/>
The issue that we are debating split the Committee right down the middle. Although the amendments to delete the clauses were not selected, the Committee divided after the clause stand part debate, and the result was 11&#x2013;11, with the Chairman giving his casting vote in favour of the Government. Rural communities in Scotland, just as in England, must be preserved. If the provisions of clause 25, which are similar to those of clause 23, are enacted, the rural communities will undoubtedly be seriously affected.<br/>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) on moving the amendment. I wish that some Scottish Tory Back Benchers had the same courage as the English Tory Back Benchers have shown in tabling the amendments. Not one Scottish Tory has had the courage to table an amendment to clause 25, despite the fact that it will drastically affect every Scottish constituency represented by a Tory.<br/>
I must join issue with the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee). I do not believe that the Catholic Church or the Catholic education authorities would distort the argument in the way that he suggested. In Scotland there is the problem of the Catholic schools, the effect on children travelling to their denominational schools if clause 25 is allowed to remain in the Bill.<br/>
If the Government honestly believe that clauses 23 and 25, the transport clauses, will have no effect on children's ability to attend school, why are they relaxing the provision on acceptable excuses for nonattendance? There is a clear indication that that is being done. I am led to think that the Government accept that if the clauses remain in the Bill more children will be absent from school. There may be some other explanation for what they are doing, but I strongly suspect that it is because the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows the effect that the transport clauses will have, particularly on rural children.<br/>
The Secretary of State, with his eloquence, will no doubt seek to persuade his hon. Friends not to vote for the amendment. My guidance is to the contrary. I advise hon. Members not to accept an undertaking that the Government will seek to do something in another


place. The Bill and the amendments are before this House. We have an opportunity to impose our will.<br/>
Although I have agreed to give the Secretary of State half an hour for his speech, I really need give him only two minutes, because it would be sensible for him to say gracefully "We have got it wrong" and agree to withdraw these clauses. Then we could move on to the next amendment.</p>

<p>I should like first to deal with the two points raised by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grange mouth (Mr. Ewing). I am grateful to him for sitting down when he did. If there is a vote, it will be on the first of the amendments, applying only to England and Wales. The result of that vote would clearly have ramifications for Scotland.<br/>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that it would not be possible in this House to have a vote on the Scottish amendment. But the Government would have to take into account the result of the first vote in deciding their attitude to Scotland. I have not got the answer to the second point that the hon. Gentleman made. It is a technical point. I will make sure that he receives the answer.<br/>
Anyone who has listened to this debate, running to over two-and-a-half hours, will have been impressed by the sincerity and the seriousness of the speeches that have been delivered on both sides of the issue. I have listened with interest and concern not only to the speeches made from the Government Benches but also to the contributions of the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) and his right hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong). These are important amendments and this is an important clause.<br/>
This is a matter, as many of my hon. Friends have indicated, of substantial political sensitivity. The reason for that sensitivity is that this part of the Bill implements the decision of the Government to allow local authorities to charge for school transport. This means, in many cases, that local authorities will be allowed to impose charges when, at the moment, people are receiving a free service. I accept that the imposition of a charge where the service has been free is a matter of sensitivity and of concern.<br/>
I hope to show the House, particularly my right hon. and hon. Friends, that the proposal to provide freedom for local authorities to charge for transport, with the one limitation covered by the amendment, in my name, imposing a flat-rate basis of charge for children of the same age and the same area, to ensure that there can be no possibility of discrimination against any particular type of school and no discrimination over the different distances children have to travel, are not ill-conceived and inequitable, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) described them, but are necessary, just and fair.</p>

<p>I understood that my right hon. and learned Friend's original amendment on this subject made a uniform charge right across the board, irrespective of the age of the child, the school the child attended, or the distance travelled. I was concerned when I subsequently read that the amendment now differentiates between schools. If there has been a change, I should like to know the reason.</p>

<p>There was a sensible reason. Many of the authorities intending to charge have specifically proposed lower charges for primary schools than for secondary schools. To allow for that, I drafted the amendment in the way it appears. So far as the other amendments we are debating&#x2014;</p>

<p>Before my right hon. and learned Friend leaves that narrow point, which is of great interest to many of us on the Government Benches, will he say something about our concern that four out of five children in rural areas need public transport to get to school whereas in the cities the proportion is only one in five? As a result the country-dwelling children will be worst hit.</p>

<p>Of course I accept that if charges are imposed where there were none before, the people who inevitably will be affected are those who were not paying before. Of course, I realise that children in rural areas tend to go greater distances to school than children in the towns. But my amendment is an attempt to ensure that in any charging policy the local authorities pursue they shall operate on a basis that does not discriminate against any type of school and is


not related to distance. I believe that in that amendment I go substantially towards meeting many of the fears that have been expressed.<br/>
All of the amendments that we are debating tonight attempt in different ways to restrict local education authorities' discretion as to the level of those charges. The amendments in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby (Mr. Pawsey) and the hon. Member for Bedwellty, seek to impose a figure. The hon. Member for Bedwellty is also seeking to relate the charge to the cost of public transport. The Liberal amendment is designed to limit the provision to certain groups of people. Other amendments attempt to raise the basic limit.<br/>
I hope that I can persuade the House that all these amendments should be resisted, since they seek to impose shackles on the discretion of local authorities to decide ways in which to make their economies.<br/>
Since the whole issue is the correctness or otherwise of the clause I must tell my hon. Friends that the clear reason for it is to enable local education authorities to make savings in public expenditure in this area. We have told the local education authorities that for the year 1980&#x2013;81 we are looking for a cut of 5 per cent. in proposed expenditure. I do not think that I have to persuade my right hon. and hon. Friends that cuts in public expenditure are essential. I do not think that any of them would doubt, as my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) has said, that we have as a country been living beyond our means. Public expenditure has been increasing at a time when there has been no increase in wealth. The result is well known. It is over-high taxation and a lack of adequate resources in the private sector.<br/>
Faced with that and a request to local authorities to make savings, the Association of County Councils specifically said that if savings of this kind were to be made the authorities should have the freedom in this area and that of school meals. The reason is simple. It is that by today the cost of the subsidy on transport has already risen to &#x00A3;125 million a year. If we are to make savings of the kind I have described it is only reasonable that local authorities should have the opportunity of choosing in which area they

wish to make them. It is consistent with the Government's philosophy of giving local authorities the maximum freedom to decide their own policies in accordance with their local circumstances.<br/>
Since local authorities are having to make difficult decisions about where they make savings in other forms of expenditure on education, it is right that if they wish to make them on transport rather than on nursery schools, adult education or something of that kind, they should be free to do so. We have to widen the area of expenditure out of which these savings can be made. I must, therefore, ask my hon. Friends to trust the local education authorities to act responsibly and to decide where the savings should be made.</p>

<p>My right hon. and learned Friend has ruled out charges for nursery education. Many people welcome that and many people do not. However, if it is right to impose on local authorities a policy for the sale of council houses, surely it is equally right to say that they shall not charge more than a certain sum for transport.</p>

<p>We debated that issue yesterday. I have many points to answer and I should like to be allowed to proceed. It was said that only &#x00A3;20 million was involved. That does not appear to be a large saving in the context of a total budget of &#x00A3;8 billion a year for education. But if we start knocking away at different parts of the edifice the whole structure crumbles. If we say that on every individual piece of education expenditure we can save only a small amount we have to look for savings elsewhere. I listened with care to what my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry South-West (Mr. Butcher) said about non-teaching staff. The numbers of non-teaching staff have fallen by 10,000 in the last five years. In the same five years the cost of education administration fell by &#x00A3;40 million, or 10 per cent. I do not believe that there are any easy answers when looking for the savings that are required.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman should remember that the financial and explanatory memorandum states that the so-called savings on school transport would amount to &#x00A3;22 million. That is less than half of what


the Secretary of State proposes to spend on the assisted places scheme. If he is intent on cutting public expenditure, will he scrap completely the assisted places scheme?</p>

<p>The hon. Member knows that that is not true.<br/>
I was saying that there are no easy answers in making savings of this kind. I repeat that if local authorities do not make savings in this area savings have to come from elsewhere in their budget. I am desperately anxious to ensure that we can preserve the level of expenditure in the classroom consistent with our election manifesto pledges on education.<br/>
I take up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee). The present situation is illogical. There is no obligation on an authority to provide transport up to the walking distance but beyond that distance to provide it free. No account is taken of the circumstances of the person who on the one side of the dividing line pays the full price, and subsidises the person on the other side of the line who pays less.<br/>
This problem has caused great concern to Governments for many years. In some communities one side of the village pays for transport and the other side does not. However, overall only 10 per cent. of people get free transport and only 20 per cent. get free transport to secondary schools. The hon. Member for Bedwellty quoted suggested charges in the region of &#x00A3;1 to &#x00A3;2 a week. I accept them. My right hon. Friend the Member for Stafford and Stone (Mr. Fraser), referred to a charge of 25p a day for children in Staffordshire. I remind him that the equivalent journey of just under three miles by public transport would cost them 43p a day in Staffordshire.<br/>
Kent originally proposed a charge of 35p and withdrew it. That was because many people in that county were already paying that amount. Essex charges between 12p and 36p a day, East Sussex charges 34p, Wiltshire 28p, Hampshire 30p and Dorset 25p. I earnestly beg my hon. Friends to remember that many people, irrespective of their financial positions, pay similar sums and out of their other pockets they subsidise free transport for others.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State making a threat or a promise? Is he saying that, because some people have to meet those costs, everybody should? Who will be advantaged by that? A manageable system for school meals payments is now changed because of the feeling that the full cost should be met. Is that not likely to happen to transport so that it becomes totally prohibitive?</p>

<p>When we are trying to reduce public expenditure, and knowing that people are already paying certain sums, it is not unreasonable for local authorities to consider introducing a modest charge for transport.<br/>
I turn to the question of Roman Catholics. I listened with interest to what was said. The availability of an appropriate school that is nearer than the Catholic school to which a pupil already goes means that much of the present provision is not statutory but discretionary. I fear that if local authorities do not have the opportunity to recoup some of the money which is being spent on free transport they may decide to withdraw the service. That is a greater threat to the Catholic schools than asking for a modest charge to be made. For example, Oxford shire proposes to do that under the present law.<br/>
We are not against denominational schools. I fully recognise their importance but the principle is that those attending denominational schools should be treated in a similar way to others. That is why I propose a flat rate, non-discriminatory charge.<br/>
I shall explain briefly why I am not able to accept any of the amendments. I have explained why I cannot accept that the clause should be deleted. I urge my hon. Friends who wish a figure to be inserted in the Bill to remember that any one figure would not take account of local circumstances. The cost of transport varies enormously in different parts of the country because of various subsidies. A maximum charge would not lead to fairness. Many people in the same area would still have to pay different sums.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that different figures would be charged in different parts of the country, taking account of local circumstances. I pose the question to hon. Members on both sides of the House: who is best to decide what that charge should be&#x2014;we in central Government or the local councillors who are sensitive to the local view and are themselves elected representatives? I hope that none of the amendments will be accepted.<br/>
Although I do not wish to see on the face of the Bill any of the amendments that have been proposed, nevertheless the Government and the House should express a view as to what should be general good practice. It should not be allowed, in any way, to discriminate between types of schools or distance.<br/>
Local authorities, in using their powers, should take account of the total effect of their proposals on family budgets. They should take account especially of the size of a family. Many counties are limiting their proposals in that way. They should consider the effect of their proposals on poorer families.<br/>
I have much sympathy with the second amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby, and with some of the views expressed by the hon. Member for Bedwellty. I hope that local authorities, when considering their schemes, will take into account the problems of the poverty trap, and the possibility of adopting an income scale test of entitlement, as previously existed in the schools meals service and which was a reasonable and fair practice.<br/>
Having considered carefully all the proposals that have been made by local authorities&#x2014;although some have not made their final decision&#x2014;I feel that the sort of sums that they are proposing are reasonable and fair in the economic position that we face. Their proposals in limiting the number of children and the types of sums that they have in mind are reasonable. We ought to trust the local education authorities to make the savings in the way that they wish.<br/>
I say to the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) that I am getting somewhat sick of the irresponsibility of the Liberals on this matter. They claim to be a party that believes in local Government, yet they do nothing but attack the responsibility of local councillors.<br/>
During the debate on education expenditure last week, they complained about the savings that might be made by closing schools. Yesterday, the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed called for more money to be spent on nursery school provision. This afternoon, he complained about the savings to be made in the school meals service. This evening, he complained about any savings that might be made in the transport service. Next week, he will be going around the country complaining about the rises in the rates and the taxes&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;that he, by his votes, his speeches and his unwillingness to accept that savings in expenditure have to be made, will have been largely responsible for bringing about. Any bandwagon is good enough for the hon. Gentleman, provided he feels that it has a vote in it somewhere.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State is forgetting that I went into the Lobby with him to vote for the increase to 35p for school meals only a fortnight ago. Is he now saying that if all local authorities took his advice and did not impose the charges that we have criticised, they would be able to make the savings that he has referred to in the memorandum to the Bill?</p>

<p>In making the savings for which we are looking we have assumed that the savings for the year 1980&#x2013;81 can be &#x00A3;20 million, which is about 25 per cent. of the expenditure on transport now. I have clearly said, and I repeat, there can be no going back on the savings. Therefore, if local authorities choose not to use their powers here, the savings have to be made elsewhere.</p>

<p>Since the right hon. and learned Gentleman is always berating us about our alleged lack of confidence in local education authorities compared with his alleged great confidence in them,


why has he found it necessary to table an amendment laying down that flat-rate fares have to be charged?</p>

<p>I tabled it because I was requested by many people to do so. I tabled the amendment to meet fears which I believe to be groundless. Other than one Socialist council&#x2014;Mid Glamorgan&#x2014;no one was proposing discriminatory charges. However, as that fear existed, I decided to make the amendment.</p>

<p>I understood my right hon. and learned Friend to say that he had examined the many schemes which have so far been submitted and that he thought them reasonable. Is he not therefore saying that the Kent proposal, which for secondary school children is currently &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 a week, is reasonable? If so, is not that an open invitation to every education authority in the country to put up rates to that kind of level at some future date?</p>

<p>The vast majority of proposals that I have seen appear to be reasonable. It is for local councillors to justify the figures to their own local electorates. It is not for us to impose them.<br/>
I have made it clear that savings in education have to be made. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said, if we do not make savings in public expenditure, if we go on living beyond</p>

<p>our means to the extent that we have done, we shall continue with higher interest rates and mortgages. Those who are being asked to make some contribution towards the expense of getting their children to school must consider in their minds the alternative ways in which the money may otherwise be spent.</p>

<p>We have given authorities the widest freedom to choose where and in what way they believe it is right to make the savings for which we are asking. As I have said on many occasions from this Dispatch Box, it is far better to protect the classroom than to continue with increasing subsidies in all other areas. Yet I believe that would be the corollory of what some of my hon. Friends have been advocating tonight.</p>

<p>I heard what was said in this debate, and some of my hon. Friends made similar remarks in the previous debate. I believe that when considering what is a reasonable charge to make, taking account of local transport and the effect on the family, the local councillor is more sensitive and better able to understand and react to the views of people on the savings that we are seeking in this area.</p>

<q><ol><li>'(5) The Minister shall not make regulations under section 31 and Schedule 6 to this Act before he has consulted an Advanced Further Education Commission as set out in subsection (6) below.</li>
<li>(6) An Advanced Further Education Commission shall be set up, consisting of not less than 25 persons whom the Secretary of State shall appoint, after consulting bodies representing local authorities, governing bodies of further education institutions, principals of such institutions, and teachers and students in such institutions.'.</li></ol></q>
The last amendment that we debated concerned the small matter of &#x00A3;20 million. Even though that will place a major imposition on parents, the amendment I now move concerns &#x00A3;375 million. As we lost the last amendment by only 23 votes, we can confidently expect to win this one, given its additional importance.<br/>
The great sadness attached to this debate is that, because of the guillotine, we did not have the opportunity to discuss clause 31 in committee. Indeed, the only contribution was a learned one from my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price), who is one of the four people in the country who understands the mechanism for the capping of the pool. We concluded our Committee sittings when my hon. Friend was on his feet speaking on this matter. It is an issue of considerable importance and I hope that in the course of this short debate the Minister will provide some answers.<br/>
We want to stress the need that is widely felt for accepting this amendment, which requires the establishment of an advanced further education commission in order to deal with finance in the advanced further education sector.<br/>
We hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, because every representative body in advanced further education has endorsed the recommendation of the Oakes committee, which was chaired so ably by my right hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) when he was Minister of State, Department of Education and Science. Not only has the recommendation received endorsement and agreement from that source, it

has been supported by all the representative bodies of students, teachers and other workers in the advanced further education sector.<br/>
At the beginning of this year the council of local education authorities met and, in the absence of any kind of undertaking from the Minister that he would set up the AFEC, it decided to form a crypto AFEC of its own to manage what might otherwise be a totally unmanageable area of educational expenditure which will be subject directly to the whim of Governments and to no other influence.<br/>
I know that the Minister has the greatest respect for the judgments of local education authorities and a close interest in advanced further education. Therefore, it is difficult to understand how someone with such a commitment and experience has been so far unable to give an undertaking that the AFEC will be set up. I hope it is not that the ideological commitment of both the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State is so inflexible that they consider the AFEC to be yet another quango and consequently they plan to avoid the recommendation of the Oakes committee. There must be more profound reasons, and I hope that we shall hear them tonight.<br/>
The Oakes committee intended to promote efficiency and equity in local government finance and in educational provision in the advanced further education sector. The capping system proposed by the Oakes committee was systematic and fair. It met the financial needs of advanced further education. It gratified the interests of local education authorities that do not have institutions of advanced further education within their boundaries and it provided a reasonable procedure for local education authorities that have such institutions in their areas.<br/>
In order to meet those needs, and in order to gratify and to provide for those interests, it was necessary that the national body should be set up. An advanced further education commission&#x2014;or a similar body with a different title&#x2014;is a prerequisite of the efficiency and equity which characterised the recommendations of the Oakes report, and which has commanded the support of all bodies of opinion and representation concerned with furtther education. It is necesary because


it is the only means of effectively ensuring that we have the proper management, control, co-ordination and opportunity for improvement of provision in the polytechnics and colleges of further and higher education.<br/>
The system adopted by the Government, of appointing a person, however well-intentioned, talented and knowledgeable, to sit in the Department of Education and Science and, by the use of the Civil Service mechanism, perform the task which should be performed&#x2014;according to the Oakes recommendations&#x2014;by a national body that is representatative of local authorities and other interests in advanced further education does not provide an adequate substitute.<br/>
In place of the widely supported and gradual means of rationalising and managing the finance of advanced further education, the Government now offer a crude mechanism&#x2014;the proposal contained in clause 31 of the Bill. It has been outlined by the Under-Secretary of State in public, but, as far as I know, never in Parliament. It is not a system of control or co-ordination. It is a vehicle for cuts&#x2014;and it is an extremely crude and blunt system of performing those cuts. It involves financial cuts of great severity, so much so that they jeopardise the existence not only of courses, but of some institutions in the advanced further education sector. It would also lead to curriculum cuts. That is a matter of particular sensitivity, especially in the advanced further education sector.<br/>
If the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State were looking for a sector that would meet the technological and scientific demands of the country, they would be well recommended to look at the advanced further education sector, among other places. However, because of the system they propose, one college of further education&#x2014;I shall not name it because it will cause undue alarm, but if the hon. Gentleman would like the details in private later, I shall be happy to supply them&#x2014;will have to meet cuts of 13 per cent. in the amount of money necessary to maintain its current provision. In another college the cuts will be 17 per cent. Kingston polytechnic will have to meet cuts of 10 per cent., Newcastle polytechnic, 10 per cent., Leicester polytechnic, 10 per cent. and Middlesex polytechnic, 9 per cent. The

city of Manchester college of higher education&#x2014;which has the delightful title "Comanche"&#x2014;will have to meet cuts of 7&#x00B7;5 per cent. These are in relation to total available facilities of &#x00A3;10 million to &#x00A3;12 million. Cuts of that nature are not shavings off a great fat body but they are cuts straight through the flesh and into the bone at the level of 10 per cent.</p>

<p>It is an interesting development in a new era of Select Committees that we are having a debate on the Floor of the House immediately after a Select Committee has taken evidence this morning from the committee of directors of polytechnics. Is my hon. Friend aware that it was made clear that the average 10 per cent. cut was only a basic cut? On top of that cut, the matter of overseas students' fees turns a basic 10 per cent. cut into a cut of 16 per cent., 17 per cent., 18 per cent. or even 19 per cent. in individual institutions.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has done me and the House a service by enabling me to abbreviate my remarks. He has referred to a point that I was about to make. The basic cuts in the very nature of education generally, but specifically in higher education&#x2014;because of the wide dispersal of courses and the small number of staff in some of those courses&#x2014;can begin as cuts of 10 per cent. and, because of the multiplier effect, can easily end up as cuts of 15 per cent. or 17 per cent.<br/>
It was proposed that a 6 per cent. cut be made in the case of the universities. The effect of that will be to produce a 10 per cent. cut in the finances available and in the number of courses available to students. The position is exactly the same in the advanced further education sector and, indeed, in the maintained sector.</p>

<p>; Will my hon. Friend agree that these cuts&#x2014;never mind the initial finance&#x2014;will be more adverse in terms of their engineering and technical potential?</p>

<p>My hon. Friends are greatly helping me. I hope that my speech is not that stereotyped and that all they are doing is to endorse the fact that there is a central argument to be made. It is a very simple argument and has


been made by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education and by the other bodies representing polytechnic teachers, by the Association of Scientific, Engineering and Managerial Staffs, by the National Union of Students, and by the Standing Conference of Principals and Directors of Institutions and Colleges of Higher Education, a conference of which body the Under-Secretary of State addressed while I attended it. All those bodies have put forward the straightforward argument that I have been making, although obviously in more detail, and covering the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Jones), my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West and everybody else interested in this area.<br/>
The greatest irony of all in regard to the cuts is that it is the institutions that have been most obedient to previous bouts of public expenditure restraint that will suffer most. So crude and so blunt is the Government's proposition in clause 31 that the virtue that these institutions have shown in complying with previous demands for cutbacks in the use of finance demands has meant that they are the ones that will suffer most. In addition to the crudity of the Government's mechanism&#x2014;I suppose that we dignify what they are doing even by the use of the term mechanism&#x2014;there is the fact that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley clearly recognised, these are institutions with a very strong vocational orientation and a very strong commitment to technology, to science and to the industrial arts.<br/>
In a country that is daily being reminded of its increasing dependence on imports and of the way in which it lags behind in so many technological and scientific races, for a blow to be dealt at the very base of our means of shortening the distances between ourselves and other industrial nations is lunacy of the most profound nature. It is being committed at a time when we have a Government who earnestly remind us at frequent intervals of the need to encourage the development of our scientific and technological education and training.<br/>
The further bad news, as has already been suggested, is that the effect of the Government's proposals to increase the

fees in the advanced further education sector, as in every other higher educational sector, and to charge full cost fees for overseas students, will mean that in addition to the blows resulting from the crude cuts wrought by clause 31, there will be increasingly a dramatic fall in the number of overseas students seeking places in advanced further education in Britain, with the additional and crucial loss of the revenue necessary to keep those institutions viable.</p>

<p>Taking together the way in which the Government are cutting the commitment of finance to the advanced further education sector and the impact of the reduction of overseas students, because of the full-cost fees strategy, it is clear that the Government are dealing a mortal blow to some courses and institutions and a deep wound to the provision of advanced further education in this country.</p>

<p>The Council of Local Education Authorities has already offered the Government a way out.

<p>We cannot help thinking that nothing of which we warn in the advanced further education sector is occurring by accident. It is not because of the haste with which the Government have approached the question that we are left with these difficulties. It may be because of the way in which the Under-Secretary has expressed himself that our suspicion, which is shared by many others in advanced further education, is well-founded.</p>

<p>For example, the Under-Secretary has said:
<q>We are looking at the rationalisation of all courses in higher education. The universities are doing their study now and this will be done for the maintained sector as well.</q>
If the hon. Gentleman were speaking as a convinced missionary on behalf of the Oakes proposal, we would recognise that as a benign attitude, as a matter of need and as a way of carefully husbanding the country's resources while seeing that we


got the best value for money out of the higher and advanced further education sectors so that the interests of local education authorities, students and staffs in the institutions could be served.</p>

I hope that the hon. Gentleman will answer a few other questions. What will be the total amount of the advanced further education pool for the financial year 1980&#x2013;81? How does this compare with the total for the last financial year for which figures are available? That is probably 1978&#x2013;79. The figures will not yet be available for the most recent year.<br/>
What is the allocation of the pool to individual local authorities? What were the hon. Gentleman's estimates of the individual local authorities' claims upon the pool?<br/>
If the hon. Gentleman can answer those questions, it will have been a useful debate, but we would much prefer a full and well-deserved reward, not for ourselves but for those engaged in advanced further education, in the form of an assurance about their future, the curriculum that they provide and the future of the students for whom they care.</p>

<p>It is a characteristic of our debates that when we discuss &#x00A3;20 million the Benches are full, the officials' box is full, the whole House is full of heat and yet there are abstentions. We even see strange faces in our lobby. But when we discuss &#x00A3;375 million the Chamber empties and not one functionary decides to serve the Department. I see that two are now arriving. Professor Parkinson and others have commented on this phenomenon that afflicts us in public affairs.<br/>
Owing to a curious arrangement of the guillotine, under which time was very limited for the discussion of the question of transport, we suddenly seem to be able to discuss this subject at our leisure, and it is worth devoting a moment or two to it.<br/>
We now have a system of Select Committees that can examine, in detail, complicated matters that hitherto have flowed through Standing Committee with no scrutiny whatever. I am sorry that when the Government, rightly and properly, introduced Select Committees they did not at the same time introduce the Procedure Committee's recommendation that Standing Committees should be able to spend one, two or three sittings taking evidence from experts before proceeding to line-by-line consideration of a Bill. This subject, called capping the pool, which has nothing to do with what we were discussing last Friday and will be discussing again this Friday, is an esoteric subject&#x2014;</p>

this Bill if it could have interviewed witnesses about the Bill's technical aspects before proceeding to debate the legislation.<br/>
It is appropriate that we should be holding this debate on Report. When we reached this part of the Bill in Committee, I was discoursing on these matters but, because of the fall of the guillotine, the Under-Secretary of State did not have time to reply. Some words from the hon. Gentleman on Report would be apposite.<br/>
The amendment seeks to insist that before the Under-Secretary makes regulations under the clause he should appoint a representative body of all the interests in the public sector of further and higher education rather than operate bureaucratically through his functionaries in the Department of Education and Science. We want open government, not closed government. It is important that the House should understand the issues.<br/>

<p>The House should realise the effect of the Government's doctrinaire activities. For nearly 18 months before the general election, on a completely nonparty basis, all the interests involved had entered into difficult negotiations. The interests were difficult to reconcile&#x2014;the


local authorities, further education, metropolitan and county authorities, the people in the polytechnics and the Department itself. Eventually they reached agreement. Not everyone was wholly satisfied, but there was broad agreement with what the Oakes committee, as it was christened, had done. I am not sure of the wisdom of attaching names to these committees. Perhaps it would be better to give them a completely inanimate label&#x2014;</p>

<p>It was named after my right hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). It seemed that whatever the result of the general election that committee would have been set up and been allowed to carry on its work as a sort of counterpart to the University Grants Cornmittee. Those who worked in polytechnics and other higher education institutes could then have known that the distribution of resources to them was carried out by their professional peers and colleagues as happened with the universities and the UGC.<br/>
However, the election saw the victory of the most neurotic and manic Government for some time and their mania was against quangos, particularly quangos with the wrong names attached to them. A ludicrous decision was therefore taken, without consultation, to chop this quango so that the distribution of the &#x00A3;375 million should go unsupervised.<br/>
I am not speaking for the Select Committee of which I am the Chairman and which is examining this matter. I believe personally that the Government will live to regret their decision. An extraordinary situation has arisen. When the Select Committee was appointed, we received a letter from the Secretary of State saying that he was very concerned about this issue. He was not seeking to dictate to us what we should do, since he recognised that we were an independent Committee, but he suggested that we might look at the whole system of applying broad subject guidelines to higher education and consider some sort of mechanism under which those guidelines might be implemented.<br/>
We decided to accept that subject, although we had many other alternatives.

Mr. Alan Thompson, the deputy secretary in charge of higher education in the Department, gave evidence to the Committee and he sketched out in rather greater detail&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall not follow my hon. Friend down that road, except to say that if members of the assessment and performance unit had sat in on that seminar I believe that they would have made even more severe strictures than they recently made on mathematics teaching throughout the country.<br/>
I wish to compare the responsible way in which the Secretary of State and the Department have approached this matter with the attitude of the hon. Member for Brent, North (Dr. Boyson) when he spoke to a conference of principals of higher education colleges and institutes just before Christmas. In what was obviously a prepared speech, he made the clear statement that it might be that no mechanism was necessary and the whole matter could be dealt with by the Department.<br/>
The Minister made the point to me in Committee that there was a time difference between the two events. He said


that his speech was made at the end of October and that the other event of which I have spoken took place later. Since few people are listening, perhaps the hon. Gentleman can be more frank than other Ministers have been. If there has been a change of heart and the Department is moving towards acceptance of the fact that there will have to be some mechanism of an Oakes committee sort, will the hon. Gentleman tell us about it? That would help everybody in the House, not least those members of the Select Committee who are struggling with these problems and who want to know the Department's present policy.<br/>
I know that policy changes constantly, but I want to know whether the Department has reached a conclusion on this matter. Is it in favour of managing the matter wholely within the Department, or will it set up a broadly representative body to distribute money in the public sector of higher education? It is an important question because the capping of the pool imposes a severe cut on every college in the land.<br/>
I fully understand the reason for cash limits being imposed on further education. The previous situation, which I liken to an <sub>.</sub>ever-fattening goldfish spin- ning out the water until it takes up all the space in the bowl, could not continue. Cash limits had to be imposed. However, once cash limits are imposed, one consequence is that the money must be distributed in a coherent fashion.<br/>
The capping of the &#x00A3;375 million in the pool has, without any consideration of overseas students' fees or other consequences, involved something like a 10 per cent. cut in further and higher education institutions. There is no real quarrel about that in the institutions. However, following the cuts, we now have a new system of funding the cost of overseas students, about which there has been much discussion.<br/>
Unless an institution recruits the same number of overseas students as it recruited last year, its income will be cut even further. No one knows how much will be involved and nobody can know until later in the year. Some polytechnics will have to find as much as &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; million by October 1980, or October 1981 at the latest. Enormous savings have to

be made, and the Government must give some guidance about where they should be made. Without such guidance there will be complete chaos. Courses which the country needs desperately will be cut and courses which are not needed will continue.<br/>
We were given examples this morning in the Select Committee. The principal of Leicester polytechnic said that his knitwear engineering course could disappear by October 1981. Half of the students on that course come from overseas. There are few courses of that kind in Britain.</p>

<p>I do not wish to be inaccurate. Knitwear engineering is an example of a type of course, of which there are only two or three, which is in jeopardy. The Government should not simply stand back and watch what happens for two years, but that is exactly what they have decided to do. They are talking in terms of a &#x00A3;375 million capped pool. They say that they will fix the pool on the basis of a Treasury diktat. They do not intend to have consultation about what should be invested in higher education. Instead, someone will pull out a piece of paper from a bran tub. The means by which the figure is arrived at is shrouded in bureaucracy and is not subject to open government.<br/>
The means by which the &#x00A3;375 million is to be distributed in the next two years is the worst of all possibilities. I am no great supporter of the University Grants Committee, but it tries to distribute its money in a coherent manner. It distributes it after consultation with the universities, local authorities and industry. The system has the confidence of the institutions.<br/>
However, the money about which we are talking will be distributed on the basis of a balance between historical expenditure and forecast&#x2014;on what institutions received last year and what they expect to receive next year. The House should pause and understand the implications. If in 1980 an institution such as that involved in teacher training


is winding down, it will be given money that it does not need. The expenditure of other institutions, particularly in the development areas where new courses have been introduced, will be chopped and they will be unable to cope with the need.</p>

<p>The great tradition of further education is that it has been immediately responsive to regional and national needs. If a course is needed, it is provided. If it is unnecessary, it is taken away.

<p>If the capped pool is not overseen by some body such as the Oakes committee, the great danger is that public money&#x2014;the distribution of which is meant to be supervised by the House&#x2014;would be spent in ways that no one in the House would wish to defend. It would be spent in those ways simply because of the Government's obstinacy in scrapping an agreed procedure for the distribution of that money because they have an obsession about having no more quangos.</p>

For the Government to restrict spending on technical education seems almost suicidal folly. Is the Minister aware that for 35 years, despite unemployment rising with almost disturbing regularity, we have always been short of skilled employees? Any economic recovery in an industrial society must depend on that element being stimulated.<br/>
I ask the Minister to pay attention to some practical matters which any Government&#x2014;Labour or Conservative&#x2014;would neglect at their peril. The Prime Minister has repeatedly, but wisely, said that this is an interim period and that eventually we shall recover our economic balance and develop the economy.

<p>All right, so we agree. But people do not usually show agreement with such a smiling countenance.<br/>
I have had personal experience of the period to which I have referred. This factor has had a remarkably disturbing impact on our economy. Only two years ago we had a great debate in the House about paying skilled men the rate for the job. Indeed, we had strikes during that period because it was not applied.<br/>
If lads are prepared to serve apprenticeships by going to work during the day and going to school in the evening, that must bring its own reward. But where are they to get the finance? The Government are proposing to cut down on this financial help. In the process, they will cut the wherewithal that produces the talent that we shall require more in the future than we have in the past. The Government are proposing to cut the stream of money that will enable this talent to be brought out. I cannot understand their reasoning.<br/>
The Minister is from the education profession. There must be a spirit of fraternity amongst its members. He could expect to believe that fraternity rather than those who are here.<br/>
I speak from a background of practical experience. I ask the Minister to believe that I know what I am talking about in practical, not theoretical, terms. Is it not possible for the Minister to call a meeting of the heads of all the technical colleges in Wales, England and Scotland, and, for that matter, Northern Ireland&#x2014;it would take only a couple of hours&#x2014;and ask them, the specialists in this area, to give him the benefit of their experience and beliefs and their promises for the future and be guided by them? He could ignore the Opposition as being prejudiced but seek the views of those who are knowledgeable and know full well what they are talking about.<br/>
If the Government continue to make these inroads into the finance of our technical colleges, the country will pay a very heavy price in future. I beg a teacher&#x2014;for such the Minister is&#x2014;to acquaint himself with the views of the teaching profession on this important matter.</p>

<p>We have had an interesting debate. We all agree with the

strong feelings expressed by the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Jones). His constituency is very near the valley of Rossendale in which I was born and in which I lived for so long. No hon. Member would disagree with the importance that he placed on technical education. We all wish for its recovery, irrespective of party. We were privileged to hear the hon. Member speaking with such conviction.<br/>
This debate has been more relaxed and has crossed party boundaries. We are concerned with the distribution of money in the maintained sector of advanced further education. In shorthand, we refer to this as capping the pool. The situation is reminiscent of Schleswig-Holstein in the nineteenth century. Of those who understood that complicated situation, one was dead, one had gone and the other had forgotten. Few of those concerned with advanced further education in the maintained sector would disagree that formerly we had no means of limiting the amount of money spent. That is why we had to cap the pool. Colleges could spend and subsequently draw money from the pool.<br/>
Once courses had been established, there was little control on the money spent. As a result there was greater financial than academic drift. We are all grateful for the work that the right hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) put into the Oakes committee. Most hon. Members will have read the proceedings of that committee. The capping of the pool may be likened to student union finance. Charges could be fixed without undertaking any responsibility for payment. Colleges established courses and levied the cost of those courses on a nationwide pool. The local authority paid only a minimal sum towards the cost. That system obviously had to end. Therefore, we decided in June that the pool would have to be capped. I shall deal presently with the percentage differences as regards previous expenditure on further education. I shall also deal with the budget for this year and next year.<br/>
Something had to be done about the distribution of money. I am aware of the remarks of the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) concerning long-term control. However, during


debate on the Labour Government's Education Bill of 1979, which fell when the Government fell on 28 March, we opposed the Oakes committee. It was no surprise that we did not put that committee into operation when we came into office. My hon. Friend the Member for Ripon (Dr. Hampson) and I said in Committee that the arrangements were too bureaucratic. The Opposition did not agree. We accepted the need to cap the pool. We said that we would look at the distribution of resources when we would consider whether a national body was needed.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman presumes that it will always be a body of bureaucrats. I have not yet mentioned future control. It is not a static situation, and new proposals are evolving.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) said, &#x00A3;375 million has been put into the pool for this year and distributed. It was a blunt distribution, as we said from the beginning, to enable the machinery to continue functioning. When we met local authorities, we agreed that until we established a more selective method of distributing the pool it should be based this year half on historical costs&#x2014;what has been spent by polytechnics and colleges of higher education over the past few years&#x2014;and half on an intelligent estimate of what local authorities needed to fulfil the requirements for the year. It is a mixture of historical costs and the dip that local authorities want. That was the blunt arrangement for this year.</p>

<p>In using that rough and ready formula, as the hon. Gentleman called it previously, has he anticipated that some institutions will lose 10 per cent.&#x2014;an important chunk&#x2014;of that which is necessary to keep them going? The hon. Gentleman's view was that in the third or fourth year he might consider setting up a national body, but only in an advisory capacity. Is he now prepared, first, to make means available to overcome the problems caused by the major shortfall in resources for particular advanced further education institutions,

and, secondly, to change his view of the status that that national body should have in the immediate future?</p>

<p>I shall deal with all those points. If I miss any, I shall be grateful if the hon. Gentleman will raise them again.<br/>
We first have to consider how to distribute the resources next time, not in the long term. <i>The Times Higher Educational Supplement</i> reported on its front page last Friday that discussions are taking place in the Department. An advisory committee has been set up to consider how to distribute on-course resources. The worst thing possible, as the hon. Member for Bedwellty suggested, would be for colleges to spend money on courses that are cheaper to run but which are not necessarily fulfilling needs and to cut back on engineering and science. We need a national course resource estimate, which we do not have at present. It would be useful to know that engineering costs 3x, another course 2x and a classroom course x.<br/>
It is an ad hoc committee, with six members from the Department and 14 from outside, including people from local government and higher education. The purpose is
<q>To pursue work on unit costs in AFE and to study the possibility of using a range of cost unit indices in the context of regulating authorities' claims on a limited AFE pool.</q>
If we are to have a sensible distribution, we must decide on numbers. First, we must know the cost of these courses compared to others. We shall then know how to allocate resources.<br/>
On 8 February a letter went out to local authorities, which has been reported in the press. It says that at present, since the pool is limited, it is vital that no new courses should be started unless they fulfil a vocational need or provide a specific employment opportunity. I expect that the hon. Member for Burnley will agree with that. If new courses can be started within the distribution of the pool as a result of what is being done in individual colleges, that is fair enough. However, if colleges want to do something specifically different which they find that they cannot do on their own, they must come within the category that I have described


before they may ask "May we have more money for this?"<br/>
We had a meeting with the local authorities. We said that it was not for regional staff inspectors alone to say how many should be on a course and the criteria that should apply. We said that the courses must also be approved by the local education authorities. That does not mean the tick of an advisory officer. These matters should be considered by the committees of the education authorities so that the authorities may be aware that the courses are being established.<br/>
In many instances that has not happened. On occasions it did not happen during the rapid build-up, which we all welcomed, when the polytechnics were being developed. We are now static. If there is development in one area, another area will have to cut back. That means that it is essential that those who have been elected and who hold responsibility have some say.</p>

<p>We are talking about advanced education, which is poolable. The capping of the pool is AFE&#x2014;advanced further education&#x2014;as against FE. I have the advanced further education figures. In real terms we are spending slightly more on FE this year than last year. That may bring delight to the Rossendale male voice choir and any equivalent choir in Burnley. In real terms, slightly more will be spent on FE next year than this year. The technical colleges should have the money to do the job.<br/>
During the past few years the colleges have asked for 9 per cent. more than they have spent. The pool was large and everybody went out with his bucket to get as much as possible. However, there were not enough buckets in which to collect all the water. There was 9 per cent. left before it ran away at the end of the year. There is much

talk about cuts, but every year the spending was overestimated. If we include all spending on AFE, 9 per cent. less than the sum requested was spent. It is right to remember the degree of under spending in previous years.<br/>
I am informed that in real terms we shall be spending as much on home students during 1980&#x2013;81 as we spent last year. I am informed that there has been no cut. That does not mean that in the pattern of distribution no college is worse off. If some colleges are worse off, that must mean that some colleges are better off. That which is taken from one side of the balance finds its way to the other side.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman, with whom I battled for so long in Committee, lost weight, I should not be fitter. I should be sad for him if that affected his health in any way. I say that in all cordiality. I was talking about overall cuts. It may be that I was speaking loosely. However, no one can say that we have cut back on provision for home students.<br/>
What provision is being made for foreign students? We do not know how many foreign students will be enrolled in September. Many statements have been made, some of which are far from the mark. This year 86,000 students are attending colleges of further education and universities. The universities and colleges receive money for only 67,000 of those students, either from the UGC or from the maintained sector. They do not receive any money for 19,000 students. Thus, if there were 19,000 fewer students next year, not a penny less would go to the universities and maintained colleges. That is why the quota system does not work. When the previous Labour Government were in power, they tried to bring control by the quota system. They


put the money in, but every year colleges and universities were enrolling more students than they could afford.<br/>
The latest figures show that universities&#x2014;I do not have the figures for polytechnics&#x2014;are 12 per cent. down on applications from foreign students. Last year, for every four foreign students who applied for a university place, only one was accepted. The figures do not indicate that there will be a total dearth of foreign students entering our universities this year.</p>

<p>The estimates which many hon. Members have seen indicate that the figure for foreign student applications is more like 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. down in the universities. I agree that it is far too early to give figures for the other sectors.<br/>
Will the Minister answer one point before the guillotine falls? If courses in which half the students are overseas students and the other half are home students are threatened, will the Government do anything to protect those courses if the overseas students disappear, or will they simply let them disappear from the curriculum?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has quoted the figures of UCCA. They are not my figures.

The hon. Member for Lewisham, West asked about long-term plans. I said that we had no long-term plans; we were not committed to setting up a national body, and we were not against the proposal. The fact that we asked the Select Committee to examine the matter indicates that we are prepared to listen to the arguments. We shall consider its advice carefully.<br/>
Overall, it is simply a question of planning and capping of the pool. It is also a matter of the money which is spent in the University Grants Committee. We shall have to consider the amount of money which is spent in the maintained sector as against the UGC. Last year an agriculture economics course was closed down at a university, and a polytechnic started it up.<br/>
It is not just a question of long-term planning of polytechnics. We also want long-term planning of the whole of higher education in this country so that it can serve the needs of the individual and of this country. We do not feel that a body of 25 people is adequate or necessary in relation to what we are doing, and I ask my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
It was pleasant, over the last hour, in slow tempo, to discuss the capping of the pool, following the excitements earlier in the evening. I should like to remind hon. Members, especially on the Government side, of some of the matters contained in the Bill and to commend the measure to the House.<br/>
In the early clauses, there is a considerable increase in the right of parents to state a preference for a school. We believe that parents, as far as possible, should have the right of choice of school, whether denominational or non-denominational, mixed or single-sex, and the type of academic and social discipline that exists in them.<br/>
We have put in the Bill the right of a parent to state a preference for a school and the need for schools to issue information on the academic and other sides of the school. People can exercise a choice only if they have the information on which to base that choice. We have also introduced an appeals system under which parents who do not get the school of their choice have the right of appeal to a statutory committee of the local authority, where they can state a case for their son or daughter to go to that school.<br/>
I had hoped that in the last hour we could have discussed the fourth action we have taken on parental choice, but the relevant amendment was not moved. That action was to introduce automatic recoupment between neighbouring authorities so that parents could choose for their children schools in the areas of neighbouring authorities and would not


need the permission either of the authority in whose area they lived or the authority in whose area the school was located.<br/>
I commend not just the provisions on higher education and the capping of the pool but the effect of the Bill in providing a considerable extension of the right of parents to state a preference for their children, to go to appeal and to have the information upon which to base their choice of school.</p>

<p>The Minister concluded by speaking of parents having a right to choose. He was more accurate earlier when he said that the Bill would provide a right to express a preference. There is a world of difference in the grammar and the results of those phrases. I want to draw attention to some aspects of the Bill should it become law which are buried in schedule 7, the repeals schedule. It repeals sections 11, 12 and 13 of the 1944 Act.<br/>
That Act, much of which will remain, was a great deal more than a provider of compulsory primary and secondary education for everyone. It was the compact between Church and State in education in Britain, achieved after many years of squabbling and disagreement. I am sorry to say, however, that the Bill, particularly clauses 1 to 16, will rip apart that basic agreement. The delicate relationship between Church and State, voluntary and statutory, will perhaps be broken by the Bill.<br/>
Clauses 6 and 7 give parents the right to express a preference and to appeal. Clause 30 does not compel local authorities to engage in free trade&#x2014;that implies a willing buyer and a willing seller&#x2014;but enables parents to cross county boundaries without requiring the consent of the authorities concerned. Clauses 12 to 16 enable new voluntary schools to be launched with greater ease and make the closing of existing maintained schools easier.<br/>
The result will be that competition will hot up because the repeal of section 11 means the repeal of the statutory duty of a local education authority to have what was called a development plan. The proposals in the Bill will therefore be without framework. The future provision or planning of education within any LEA area will depend upon the results of appeals or even of court findings upon those appeals. The local authority will not be able to set out a plan under which all the elements&#x2014;parents, pupils, voluntary schools and governors and the interests of the community&#x2014;are brought together and considered.<br/>
The Bill will set pupil against pupil, parent against parent, teacher against teacher, Church against State, and LEA against LEA, and will destroy the coherent national character of education, locally administered, which was the sign of the 1944 Act. It will create administrative problems at local authority level and it will create problems for parents who do not get their choice and who do not have the brighter children who will be chosen for the more selective schools and perhaps for the assisted places scheme.<br/>
The temptation will be for the voluntary sector to cream off at every level of the pyramid of prestige from the pukka private school at the top down through the direct grant grammar school to the voluntary maintained and controlled schools and then to the county schools at the bottom. That temptation will be intensified and some schools will have first pick of parents, pupils and teachers.<br/>
The physical wounds inflicted by taking away the power to authorise payment for travel, meals and the provision of nursery schools may be healed. However, much deeper wounds will result from the "Boyson-Carlisle" Act. The Act will rip education apart at the seams&#x2014;seams that were welded together by Lord Butler in 1944. It will disrupt the delicate tripod of a national service locally administered in partnership with the Churches and the voluntary organisations.<br/>
The Act will be the work of an irresponsible Government who are ignorant about education in the maintained sector. I only hope that the Churches will act more responsibly in the


way they use the freedoms that are now given to them.<br/>
In 1943 the White Paper, Cmnd. 6458, produced by a Government elected in 1935 with a majority of 250, said:
<q>It is just as important to achieve diversity as it is to ensure equality of educational opportunity. But such diversity must not impair the social unity within the educational system which will open the way to a more closely knit society and give us strength to face the tasks ahead.</q>
Unfortunately, this Bill will rend asunder what the 1944 Act created. It is not worthy of the House, and any hon. Member who votes for it will be undoing the work of the 1944 Government.</p>

<p>I support the Bill wholeheartedly. I believe that it is important that local authorities should be given greater discretion. I am fortunate that in my constituency we have been able to continue with our very good grammar schools during the difficult years that have just passed.<br/>
I am delighted that the Secretary of State has brought forward a measure that will increase parental choice, and I welcome in particular the new appeals procedure. One of the difficult elements of constituency correspondence has concerned disappointed parents. In the past, all that one could do was to push them aside and hope for the best. I believe that the new appeals procedure will improve matters.<br/>
I have one sad reservation about the Bill, however. I have no objection to clause 23 in principle, but I deplore the way in which my own county council set out to act before it had been given the power so to do. It jumped the gun by taking a public decision about what would be charged for school transport before it had authority to do so.<br/>
I believe that my right hon. and learned Friend's amendment will be helpful to my constituents, but I fundamentally distrust the attitude of Kent county council, not only in respect of the Bill but in many other matters. However, I would incur the displeasure of the Chair if I were to stray towards those issues. The Kent county council has implemented school transport charges, asserting that it can make no other savings in education. Frankly, that is codswallop. I invite my right hon. and learned Friend to come

to the Kent education authority headquarters on the coldest day of the year. He should bring his bikini, because the place is so overheated that it is a disgrace.<br/>
The authority asserts that it has saved &#x00A3;600 on administration and that that is all that it can save. It organises special coaching for fencing, sailing, karate and other choice activities. The cost is about &#x00A3;100,000. The authority has managed to save only 20 per cent. in that direction. The Kent county councillors have behaved like ostriches with their heads in the sand. The House is right to trust local authorities, but&#x2014;</p>

As a result of pressure from some of my Kentish hon. Friends, including my hon.

<p>The Secretary of State criticised Opposition Members for not placing our confidence and trust in the elected local education authorities. We have just heard the hon. Member for Maidstone (Mr. Wells) make a most searching criticism of a Conservative-controlled authority. The Secretary of State must now realise what the Bill means.<br/>
This is a miserable Bill. It is the worst piece of general education legislation that the House has seen in more than 50 years. It contains an extremely damaging provision which will discriminate harshly and unfairly against children who, for good reason, must travel long distances to school. It will discriminate against rural


children, Roman Catholic children and those who attend Welsh-speaking schools. The savings that it makes through those provisions and on school meals will result in a substantial injection of funds into the private education sector and the assisted places scheme. That scheme has been greeted with uncertainty by many involved in the private sector. It is seen as a divisive measure.<br/>
The better provisions in the Bill are diminished by various deficiencies. The provision to reform the school governors and managers system is a mere token compared with the Taylor committee recommendations. The clauses dealing with admission and the reduction in the size of schools are hedged with an army of bureaucracy which is so extensive that before the Bill is on the statute book for long Government Members will join us in objecting to the amount of money that it will cost.<br/>
The House will make a great mistake if it gives the Bill a Third Reading. A heavy price will be paid politically. My party will not pay. The Bill will be of benefit to my party because many Conservatives will feel bitterly betrayed by the Bill. I am not looking forward to that with as much enthusiasm as I would wish when I know that the sort of people I represent, those who are on low wages, will suffer most from the Bill's provisions.</p>

<p>I rise briefly to register my final protest against this disgraceful Bill. I said on Second Reading that we would fight the Bill to the bitter end, and it has proved to be a very bitterend indeed. The Secretary of State for Education and Science and the Secretary of State for Scotland&#x2014;who, as usual, is not present to see the damage he is doing to Scottish schoolchildren&#x2014;have made few, if any, concessions during the progress of the Bill. They are still hell-bent on depriving children of their legal rights to school meals, milk and transport, thereby hoping to save &#x00A3;252 million.<br/>
The children who will suffer most from the Bill will be those in low income families, those living in rural areas and those attending denominational schools. Yet the Government have the brass neck to talk about parental choice. What they are doing is reducing whatever choice

currently exists, especially the rights and opportunities of parents to send their children to denominational schools. That is a right which has existed in England and Wales since 1944 and in Scotland for more than quarter of a century before that. The 1918 Act in Scotland provided a more generous settlement than the church schools received in England and Wales. The Government are attacking the very spirit of the 1944 Act and the very spirit of the Education (Scotland) Act 1918. They are interfering with whatever freedom parents have to send their children to the school of their choice.<br/>
While, on the one hand, they are cutting public expenditure by more than a quarter of a billion pounds, the Government are proposing to increase public expenditure on the other hand to promote their doctrinaire, divisive, nonsensical assisted places scheme for the fee-paying schools. The original figure of &#x00A3;55 million has, I understand, been somewhat reduced.<br/>
I am pleased to see that we now have a Scottish Minister responsible for education present in the shape of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher). Perhaps he will go one stage further than the Secretary of State for Education and Science and abandon completely any proposal to introduce an assisted places scheme in Scotland. There is no educational, moral or financial justification for it. The Government ought to be ashamed of themselves for cutting back on educational expenditure and redistributing what is left not to the children most in need but to a few privileged parents who want to buy extra privilege, real or imaginary, by sending their children to fee-paying schools. As a result, the needy children will be deprived of meals, milk and transport.<br/>
Even some of the Government's supporters have doubts about these proposals. I hope that they will join us in the Lobby tonight to oppose what is one of the most disgusting, prejudiced and reactionary Education Bills since the birth of public education in this country. Any hon. Member who votes for the Third Reading ought to be thoroughly ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>For at least three years there has been a need for a major Education Act. Fourteen months ago the then Labour Government introduced a Bill which was a most disappointing measure. The only distinction of this measure is that it makes the mistakes of that Bill even worse and adds many more of its own.<br/>
Let us examine the clauses. I believe that we shall find that, in years to come, the provision relating to governors will be found to be unsatisfactory. The Bill spends a great deal of time talking about who should be governors and little or no time in talking about their powers, duties and responsibilities. The Bill contains much reference to parental rights, which sounds good but will, in reality, serve only to raise parents' expectations, which will then be dashed.<br/>
There are provisions relating to falling rolls, which are totally negative and offer little positive guidance to authorities. There is a good deal about which schools can be opened, or, more likely, closed, but there is little which gives parents the opportunity genuinely to participiate in decision-making. There is the assisted places scheme, which is educationally indefensible. It is an administrative nightmare and socially unjust. We have clauses dealing with meals, milk and transport. These represent a major attack in particular upon the working poor. Although the Tory Party talks a great deal about the poverty trap and its attempts to remove it, the Bill will make that trap much worse.<br/>
The Bill is a gross insult to higher and further education. The new clause which has been added is a major blow to nursery education. We should do much more than simply attack the Bill. I should like my right hon. Friends to give clear undertakings that they will put the matter right at the first opportunity presented to them. I hope particularly that they will give firm undertakings that the assisted places scheme will be abolished&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House for more than a few seconds.<br/>
I want to re-emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing).The transport, assisted places scheme, nursery education, meals and milk provisions of the Bill are the worst part, to such an extent that they undermine and almost reach the point of destroying the 1944 Act, which was a historic procedure in Britain for imposing notional standards of provision throughout the country. The Government decide to strip all that away for the phoney reason of giving local authorities so-called freedom without the funds to exercise that freedom. The fact that that is phoney is demonstrated by the protests we have had from local authorities right across the country, from Cornwall through Wakefield right up to Northumberland. It is quite clear that the Government's pretension that they are giving local authorities greater freedom and power is complete hypocrisy and utterly bogus and that they will live to regret this day. I believe that they will regret electorally the fact that they have introduced this poisonous Bill.</p>

<p>It is time that somebody on the Conservative side of the House made it plain on Third Reading that the Government are right to take the view that there should be local democracy and that the local man knows best. [AN HON. MEMBER: "Council houses?"] That is a different issue. We shall debate the question of council house sales on another occasion, and on that issue, too, the Government are plainly right.<br/>
I want to deal briefly with the interlocking matters of how the Government achieve a cut in expenditure by local authorities against a very difficult background. We in Kent thought it quite wrong to cut the pupil-teacher ratio. We thought it wrong to make other reductions in expenditure. So there were only two avenues left: one was to deal with school meals; the other was to deal with transport.<br/>
It transpired that we could not deal with school meals this year. I personally favour an increase not only in school meals, but in mobile canteens and many other modern ways by which we can bring about more cheaply an improvement in the services to children through the provision of school meals. Be that as it may, it cannot be achieved this year. Therefore, we were forced to consider the question of transport charges. As regards those transport charges, it was absolutely essential to ensure, first, that the denominational schools and, secondly, the villages did not suffer.<br/>
To achieve that for Kent and many other counties, now endorsed by the admirable amendment No. 134 moved by the Minister, we decided that it was essential to charge the same rate irrespective of distance, thereby protecting the denominational schools and the villages. It is essential to protect also the interests of large families. In Kent, only the first two children in a family will be charged.<br/>
Kent is to introduce an assisted transport scheme to help reduce transport costs. The scheme will enable people to take their chilren to school and receive back the subsidy. It is a first-class idea. It is essential that Kent should give a lead in that area to ensure that we achieve a cut in the level of expenditure while at the same time retaining control. That has been almost achieved. I believe that the present proposals will be reduced further, and there will be a scheme in which a moderate charge&#x2014;</p>

It is most important that it should be recognised that there is a solid, honest view on this side of the House that the Government are right to leave these matters to local authorities. Every Kent Member of Parliament is a Conservative. The overwhelming majority of those in Kent share my view that we should be able to accept and work out within the boundaries of Kent the future that we believe is right.<br/>

In the meantime, we have to bid farewell, for the moment at least, to this misbegotten Bill. Certain elements, to which attention has been drawn in very able contributions by my hon. Friends&#x2014;some of whom served on the Committee for the 100-plus hours of its deliberations&#x2014;will command the continuing enmity of the Opposition and of a large section of the people in education and more widely in the general public. I speak of the divisive and totally unjustifiable attack that is being made on the maintained sector of education through the delusion of the assisted places scheme. I speak, too, of the way in which the Government have made no response to the plea from local authorities for changes in the appeals system.<br/>
There and elsewhere we have seen an insularity that has been only slightly dented by the boldness of a few Tory Back Benchers in securing a minor amendment by the Government on the


provision of a flat rate for school transport and accommodation for the eccentricity of the Oxford county council. They showed that they were prepared to break a law, bend a law and then invent a law to bring the brigadiers of Oxford within the law on the provision of nursery education.<br/>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman says "Quite right." I am glad that he agrees with us. I only wish that the response from the Secretary of State for the Environment had been more alacritous. [<i>Interruption.</i>] However, his alacrity is probably retained and restrained entirely to his own self-advancement. If the hon. Gentleman on the Government Back Benches is not used to multi-syllabic words, I trust that he will make good his education, probably in consultation with the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Brent, North (Dr. Boyson).<br/>
We have just heard from a loyal Tory Back Bencher that the theme and purpose of the Bill are the creation of extra local democracy. What we have is a synthetic form of devolution which commends itself to me much less than the actual form of devolution with which we were confronted last year. There is a great deal of talk about freedom and discretion and trust in judgment at local level. But on the matter of appeals, the assisted places scheme, the membership of governing bodies of schools, recoupment and new regulations affecting many areas of education, participation by the local education authorities is conscientiously and legalistically excluded.<br/>
If anybody thinks that this is a major step forward for local democracy, he should do two things: first, read the Bill, and, secondly, talk to local councillors a year from now when they have been saddled with all the responsibilities of the idiocy of clauses 22, 23, 24 and 25, and much else, and are faced with an angry public who realise that they have

been robbed of facilities and rights that they have had since 1944 and, however they voted on 3 May, did not expect to lose in their lifetime or the lifetime of their children.<br/>
The Minister has this general commitment to local democracy. That is something of which I approve and which I applaud and would want to strengthen, and I share that opinion with my right hon. and hon. Friends. It may be that it will be more by accident than design that these disparities of treatment will arise from the application of the Bill.<br/>
Some local education authorities will see the Bill as a challenge. They will try, might and main, to sustain levels of care and of provision by raising additional rates and by changing their policies. The people of Britain have come to expect and enjoy such levels as a right. Other local education authorities, such as Kent, will take full advantage of the Bill. They will desert their responsibilities to the children and students of Britain. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) pointed out in his able contribution, such disparity will cause enmity.<br/>
Perhaps the Bill's effects are unintentional. However, I am reminded of the words of Plutarch. He said that when boys kill frogs with stones, they laugh. However, the frogs still die. The Secretary of State may have introduced the Bill from the highest motivation. It fulfils the demands of the Tory Party's strongest ideology. I appreciate his directness and honestly. However, he has created a monster without realising the effect that it may have.</p>

We shall pursue&#x2014;as we have since 1944&#x2014;the aim of high national standards of provision and performance. The contest will be decided by the type of country and economy that exists when the Labour Party is returned to power.<br/>
The country will be less capable of producing wealth than at any time since


the war as a result of the Government's policies on coal, steel and many other industries. They have depressed business confidence. Money is too expensive for small business men to borrow. The Government have conspired at the industrial rot of Britain. The public sector will be impoverished and robbed by looters who take money in the form of tax bonuses. As a result, we shall have a mandate for radical Socialist change in education and in many other spheres.<br/>
If Conservative Members do not realise the resentment and reaction that such policies cause, they do not understand the politics of Britain or the aspirations of its people. They do not understand that we shall secure freedom and high standards of provision only when Tory doctrine and the misleading nonsense preached by the Government have been replaced with the values, community spirit and the belief in the people that is characterised by the democratic Socialism of the Labour Party.</p>

<p>When I hear the intervention of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), I become even more surprised.<br/>
Although the Bill had to be guillotined, it had a full and complete Committee stage. It has also had a full debate in the House. The Bill is important, but it is also highly controversial in parts. I shall not go over the arguments about meals and transport. The hon. Gentleman may not accept it, but the Government have accepted that there is a need to reduce expenditure. Regrettably, education cannot be excluded from that decision. I repeat what I said in the debate. Faced with the need to make reductions in expenditure, it is preferable to give wider opportunity to local authorities to make those cuts in school meal and milk subsidies than to cut in the classroom and reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman appears to be defending to this day the frankly indefensible situation of a school meals system built up over 30 years, costing the taxpayer one-eighth of the education budget and yet of which less than 50 per cent. of children in secondary schools take advantage. I believe that substantial savings can be made.<br/>
There are wider concepts in the Bill than merely the parts necessary to enable local authorities to make savings. It is also based on our determination to ensure that parents have a wider involvement in running schools and, for the first time, puts flesh and blood in the provision of the 1944 Act that parents should have a greater say about the school to which their child goes.<br/>
It provides a preference for parents and a duty on local authorities to meet that preference. It does that realistically. It accepts that, in a period of falling rolls, there must be a right for local authorities to plan and that the right of a parent in the end cannot be absolute. It must be subject to the provision of education in the area but, nevertheless, should be as wide as possible in all the circumstances.<br/>
Listening to the speeches from both sides, I am struck by the fact that we believe that the school system is there to provide for the child and to provide the opportunity for parents to educate their children. From many speeches from the Labour Benches, it would appear that the child is merely there to provide for the system of the school.<br/>
I return finally to the other controversial issue&#x2014;assisted places. The hon. Member for Bedwellty has throughout objected to the proposals, but the restoration of what used to exist through direct grant schools will widen the opportunity for many children in this country. All the provisions for parental choice and parental involvement will help improve the standard of education in the maintained sector.<br/>
I am totally amazed at the suggestion of the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) that this is an attack on the 1944 Act. It gives wider opportunities for parents to cross local authority boundaries in choosing schools and gives an opportunity to encourage church schools. The combination of the church school and maintained schools has always been a


necessary part of the provision of education in this country and will continue to be so under the Act.<br/>
If Labour Members are not prepared to come to grips with the reality of the need to reduce public expenditure, I do not believe that there is any chance that they will have the opportunity to repeal</p>

<p>I welcome this opportunity to bring before the House the problems that the people of Caine face at the moment, when 450 of them have been made redundant at the factory of C. and T. Harris.<br/>
Perhaps it would help my hon. Friend if for a minute I went into the background of the problem that the bacon pig industry is facing. Much of it results from the period of office of the previous Administration when so much harm was done to the bacon industry by the failure to revalue the green pound and the problems caused by the MCA system.<br/>
As long ago as 1977, the industry was facing dire problems because of the losses that it was suffering. One of the directors of the company wrote at that time to my predecessor, Mr. Awdry:
<q>The grossly unfair distortions caused by the pigmeat&#x2014;green pound problem effectively subsidise imported bacon and ham into this

country, particularly from Denmark and Holland, by approximately 30 per cent. This has been going on to varying degrees for nearly three years and has so debilitated our entire industry that its future is in grave jeopardy. The plight of the processors was overtaken during the summer of 1976 by a producers' flight from pigs.</q>
Flying pigs!
<q>The resulting decimation of our pig herd now means that the hard-pressed processors are having to pay substantially more for their pigs whilst their end product is depressed by unfair subsidised competition from Europe.</q>
The problems caused by the actions of the previous Administration have meant that the level of investment has not been maintained. The gross margin on a pig coming in from Denmark over the past four or five years was &#x00A3;356, while on our pigs it was &#x00A3;232.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Minister who is to reply may say that perhaps the marketing of some pigmeat products and even the quality were not all that might have been desired, but it is hard to see how the industry could have done that much better when the unfair competition that it had to face as a result of the actions of Labour right hon. and hon. Members did such harm to the industry. With respect to the right hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Harrison), perhaps I should not have referred to him in the plural, as he is the only Labour Member in the Chamber.<br/>
Our share of the market has dropped from 37&#x00B7;7 per cent. in 1976 to 32&#x00B7;2 per cent. now. The problems caused by the failure to revalue the green pound have made it difficult for the industry to keep up investment and productivity.<br/>
I am glad that the present Government have done almost everything to put that right and we no longer have problems with the industry facing unfair competition from Europe and Ireland. However, there are two caveats to that. The high level of inflation, coupled with a strong pound, does not make matters easy, and nor do high interest rates, particularly when the industry has not had the profitability, and, therefore, the reserves, to allow it to replace and renew.<br/>
As a result, C. and T. Harris has had to rationalise as much as possible and has had to lay off half the work force of a company that is 200 years old and one of the oldest bacon industries in Europe, with a long and proud history in Calne.<br/>
We face two problems. The first is the 450 people who have lost their jobs. I urge the Minister to do what he can to ensure that those people are offered retraining facilities. At present there are 259 people out of work in the town and 237 vacancies. That indicates some mismatch in Caine, and I believe that much of it is caused by the problem of fixing training to meet needs. With another 450 people coming on to the job market, it is important that we find how the mismatch can be put right.<br/>
I also ask the Minister to look particularly at the problems of the middle aged and those over 50, who may have worked for a company for many years and who find it difficult to get jobs, particularly in rural areas where there is not a great deal of alternative employment. After last year's redundancies in the town, there are still many people who have not found jobs.</p>

<p>I have listened with interest to my hon. Friend's tale of how the Labour Party has, in a sense, been the enemy of the British pig industry. I am sure that my hon. Friend's constituents will wish to know that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is in the Chamber to hear the important points being put on their behalf by my hon. Friend.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend. The people of Caine will be greatly honoured to know that the Prime Minister is here to listen to the problems that they face. Not only is she here today, but she is to honour us with a visit on Friday. We are therefore doubly blessed. It will give a tremendous boost to the people of Caine to know that the Government are taking an interest, and it will also put the town on the map. It is important to encourage people to come to Caine, which can offer so much. In terms of communications, it is only one and-a-half hours from Exeter, Birmingham and London. It will be a great help, even at 70 miles an hour, for the people of Caine to know the interest that the Government are showing.<br/>
Reverting to the people who are out of work, I should like to indicate that the problem affects not only those who will find difficulty getting new work. There are also those in the villages who will no longer have transport previously provided by the company to take them to work. This indicates the size of the impact on rural areas when an industry in a town is decimated. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to announce a study into the problem to ensure the right answer.<br/>
We need to create new industry in the area. There is land available that the North Wiltshire district council would like to bring forward. No private developer has yet been found. But it would help if the council could bring forward the infrastructure, not on a speculative basis at the ratepayers' expense but only if people wish to start factories in Caine. There is reason to suppose that this desire exists.<br/>
One problem is that local councils also wish to bring forward land in Malmesbury, Crickland and Wootton Bassett and surrounding towns. If resources are switched to Caine, it means that resources, jobs, and industries wanting to go elsewhere will have to wait.<br/>
I now turn to the question of the remaining 450 jobs. There is need for the company to rationalise itself and for the work force to get together with management to improve productivity. Equally, the management invested &#x00A3;300,000 in a slaughterhouse last year but closed it three weeks later. There has been a history of decisions that might have been


better made. I hope that that situation is now behind us and that the management and the work force can get the plant going again. The board of FMC has said that, provided the company can break even, it wishes to build a modern, purpose-built plant in Caine capable of matching the best in Europe.<br/>
Because of events in the past and because money is not available, it is difficult to find the finance for the plant. I expect that my hon. Friend will be able to give me only a hope and a prayer, but soon, I hope, the climate will have changed and the company will be able to proceed with the new factory.<br/>
If we cannot produce sausages and bacon in Wiltshire, it is a sad day for Britain. I trust that this will be the final act of the saga and that we can look forward to a better atmosphere in which to work and compete so that in five or ten years Caine will once again be the booming bacon town of Britain. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to announce some hopeful, practical and positive Government plans for providing alternative work for those unable to find jobs in the bacon industry.</p>

<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) on having the good fortune to secure this Adjournment debate. I also congratulate him on the measure of support that he has generated among his hon. Friends. It is the second best Adjournment debate in which I have spoken, and it is only the second one to which I have had the good fortune to reply.<br/>
Of course, the presence of my right hon. Friend the Prime Miniser is a first for an Adjournment debate. The fact that my right hon. Friend is visiting my hon. Friend's constituency this week makes it a double blessing, although I suspect that there may be some relationship between the two events.<br/>
I share my hon. Friend's considerable anxiety at the effect that the proposed redundancies at C. and T. Harris will have, not only on those who will lose their jobs but on the general employment situation in the Chippenham area. As my hon. Friend well knows, the FMC Group, to which C. and T. Harris belongs, is not

alone in having to carry out rationalisation. Other bacon and pigmeat produce manufacturers have been under the same pressures. Their problems have largely arisen from the unfairly high level of monetary compensatory amounts paid in the past on imports of bacon and pigmeat products from other EEC countries.<br/>
Our industry has, on the one hand, had to pay relatively high prices for top-quality pig carcases and, on the other hand, it has been unable to sell bacon and other pigmeat products in competition with subsidised imports at prices which would give a reasonable return on investment. Low profit levels have led to a lack of investment in modern plant and buildings.<br/>
The Government came to power pledged to abolish the heavy burden of negative MCAs within the lifetime of the present Parliament. With three green pound devaluations in eight months, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has already achieved what he promised to do in five years. He has negotiated devaluations in the green pound which, with the strengthening of sterling, have led to reductions in the United Kingdom MCAs on bacon and pigmeat to nil. There are no longer highly subsidised imports, and home production now faces fair competition. My right hon. Friend is to be congratulated.<br/>
But it has long been recognised that even if MCA reductions could be achieved the industry would still have to face strong competition from, in particular, Danish bacon, which has established a reputation for quality and consistency. Well over a year ago, the sector working group of the Economic Development Committee for Food and Drink Manufacturing reported that
<q>United Kingdom bacon processors must without delay take positive action to improve the quality, marketing, distribution and promotion of its products if the industry is to maintain its present share of the home market, let alone gain a larger share</q>
The industry itself recognises that its marketing compares unfavourably with that of its competitors and I understand it is in the process of reviewing its marketing strategy in an attempt to put itself on equal terms. I am afraid that some rationalisation and readjustment in the industry are inevitable; and it is up


to individual companies to decide how to go about that.<br/>
I am only too well aware that none of this offers much comfort to those at C. and T. Harris who are about to lose their jobs. It is not for me to underestimate the effects of unemployment and redundancy. To the individuals concerned and to their families, it is a very distressing experience. But I can assure my hon. Friend and those at the firm who face this prospect that my Department and the Manpower Services Commission will do everything we can to find them new jobs or retraining.<br/>
The management at C. and T. Harris has said that it is anxious to co-operate fully with us. A mini jobcentre, with vacancy display facilities, has already been set up on the firm's premises. Two of our employment advisers have been working there full time since last Monday and will stay on as long as necessary. I understand that all the employees who are to be made redundant have been told about these arrangements. The Chippenham jobcentre manager and a representative from the unemployment benefit office have been at the firm since yesterday and will remain there for the rest of the week to offer any help they can to the employees concerned.<br/>
In addition, the training services division of the Manpower Services Commission is standing by to see what it can do. It is early days yet, of course, and we are still in the process of finding out from the employees concerned what their needs are. Training opportunities advisers will be available, however, to interview redundant workers and to give them guidance on the training opportunities available.<br/>
The nearest skill centre is at Swindon, where 128 places are available for 12 courses, two in construction trades and the remainder in engineering skills.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend will appreciate that one of the problems we face in the area is that the skillcentres are at Swindon and Chippenham. Swindon is 15 miles away and Chippenham is seven or eight miles away, and it is not easy to get there as a result of the problems we are experiencing with transport. Can my hon. Friend give any indication of how that particular problem can be got round?</p>

<p>The House will know that everybody has sympathy with the plight of the people of Caine, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Prime Minister's visit on Friday will not save the bacon? The only way to save the British bacon market is to get out of the Common Market.</p>

<p>What I am sure of is that the Prime Minister's visit to Caine will draw attention to English bacon and, it is hoped, will do the industry some good in marketing.<br/>
Places are also provided for Government-sponsored trainees on a variety of courses, mostly secretarial and clerical, at local colleges of further education, including Chippenham technical college. But the TSD has assured me that it will consider laying on special courses for retraining the redundant workers if these are needed.<br/>
As for the future employment prospects for the redundant workers, it is difficult to be very precise until we have more details of the people concerned, their skills, the type of jobs they want and the area in which they live. From the information we have so far received, we know that the redundant workers travel to Caine from quite a wide area. This will obviously make it somewhat easier for them to find new jobs. I am told that a large number are skilled or semiskilled, which, again, is an obvious advantage in the current employment situation. And I believe that some will probably want only part-time work.<br/>
Following the publicity about the redundancies organised by the Chippenham jobcentre, a number of local food firms have already expressed an interest in taking on redundant workers from C. and T. Harris. About 100 suitable vacancies have been notified within the last 48 hours, and there are currently over 300 other unfilled vacancies which have been notified to our Chippenham office. They are in a wide range of occupations, some in food processing, some in the service industries and others in electrical engineering and construction. Some are for part-time work, others are suitable


for school leavers and young people; and we must remember that the vacancies notified to our offices are probably only about one-third of the total number of vacancies available.<br/>
In the longer term, I understand that there is the prospect of at least 350 new jobs in the Chippenham area over the next year or so arising out of new developments and expansions which are known to be taking place. We must not lose sight of the fact that the Chippenham area is in a relatively better position than many areas. The whole of this part of Wiltshire has traditionally had below-average levels of unemployment, and that is the case today.<br/>
In saying all this about the job opportunities that are available in the area, I do not want to give the impression that I underestimate the problems facing the redundant workers. Nor do I want to suggest that the future will be all plain sailing for them or for the area in general. I recognise that some of those who are made redundant will find it difficult to get other jobs. But I hope those employees at C. and T. Harris who view the future with anxiety will take heart if I point out that, despite high levels of unemployment, jobs seem to be available, although the opportunities are not as evenly spread as we would like.<br/>
It is a fact that most unemployed people are able to find jobs reasonably quickly. I urge the people at C. and T. Harris not to delay in seeking the help of

the employment service and to be as flexible as they possibly can in the type of jobs they will take and the area in which they are prepared to work.<br/>
We live in an age of rapid industrial change, and it is a fact of industrial life that the labour forces of firms and enterprises will vary from year to year as the demand for their goods and services changes. In the process many people will be forced to change jobs. It is no good blinking at this fact. It is worse than useless to attempt to freeze the pattern of employment rigidly by opposing all closures, all restructuring and all redundancies.<br/>
My hon. Friend mentioned land in Caine available for new industry. I will draw the attention of the Departments of the Environment and Industry to that fact, because such development is clearly part of our overall philosophy. The Government believe&#x2014;and I am sure that my hon. Friend will support me on this&#x2014;that the only way to find a lasting solution to the problems of unemployment is to improve our industrial performance so that our industries are competitive in the trading community. That is the basis for providing more permanent jobs in Caine, Chippenham and elsewhere in the country. This is what the Government's economic policies are all about.</p>
