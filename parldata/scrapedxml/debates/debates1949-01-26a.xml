<p>All these men belong to two trades&#x2014;fitters and armourers&#x2014;and it is in these trades that we have a surplus of trained and experienced noncommissioned officers. It would simply be a case of not making use of their services if we were to retain them.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Air how many officers, other ranks, and civilians, respectively, are engaged in the technical training of air and ground trades; and what were the proportions between civilian and Service instructors in 1938, 1947 and 1948.</p>

<p>Ten officers, 2,137 airmen and 707 civilians are employed on


these duties. I regret that records kept in 1938 do not allow the proportion of civilian to Service instructors to be determined; in 1947 it was 1 to 3.1 and in 1948 1 to 2.75.</p>

<p>No material information or photographs obtained from either high or low level reconnaissance flights were handed over to the Egyptian authorities. I am informed, however, that on occasion photographic information was discussed with Egyptian officers because of the difficulty of obtaining

<p>As it is obvious from the Minister's answer that this photography was an act of intervention in the war&#x2014;not, of course, the fault of the Minister, but set on deliberately by the Foreign Secretary&#x2014;[HON.

<p>The latter part of the question, I think, might be put to my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary himself, but I would like to make it quite clear that I cannot accept any suggestion that there has been any intervention on the part of His Majesty's Government.

<p>May I ask the Secretary of State whether he does not feel that this is a very special case?

<p>The transfer of the British Overseas Airways Corporation's North Atlantic base to Filton was virtually completed by 31st December, 1948, although it will, of course, be some time before the new base is fully effective.

<p>It would seem an exaggeration to describe the radio building as being fortified. Some ground-floor windows are being fitted with shutters or bars, presumably to guard against any demonstration of the general hostility which the people of Berlin feel towards this radio station and its broadcasts.

<p>The people of Berlin may well feel that way. There are surely a lot of people in this country who feel the same. How does the Minister justify the fact that a Soviet-controlled radio station, pouring out the most bitter anti-British and anti-American propaganda, should be allowed to continue at all in the British zone; and would anything of a corresponding kind be allowed in their zone?

<p>As the hon. and gallant Member is aware, the Auxiliary Forces' maximum annual bounty was increased from &#x00A3;8 to &#x00A3;12 in August last year, and the greater part of it can now be paid at the end of camp. No further increase is contemplated at present.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence if he will provide for National Service men the new clothes they require for civil life, in view of the fact that many are not financially able on demobilisation to pay for them and have outgrown those they had before.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence if, in view of the prolonged service now required from National Service men enlisted between 1st January, 1947, and 31st December, 1948, he will restore for them the release benefits, including a civilian suit, provided for other National Service men called up since 1945.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that his reply is most unsatisfactory, and that there is a feeling in the Services over this matter that many of the men when demobilised are not able to afford to buy their clothes, and that their parents are not in the position to buy them for them?</p>

<p>No, Sir. This policy was announced a very long time ago. It has been in existence since January, 1947, and in view of the whole of the circumstances, economic and financial, it is not proposed to revise it.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend look at this matter from a commonsense point of view. Is he not aware that when a youth goes into the Armed Forces and engages in a healthy outdoor life for a year or 18 months, his physique is bound to alter, and his old clothes will no longer fit him? That being so, is it not reasonable for the Government to provide a suit for him on demobilisation?</p>

<p>It has already been announced in previous statements that certain items of clothing can be purchased cheaply. In addition, 60 coupons are issued for the purpose of obtaining new clothes.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the price of a gentleman's suit has so greatly increased, together with the fact that these men have had three months' extra added to the contract


without their consent, or even without their being consulted, is it not the least that the Government can do to give them a suit when they are demobilised?</p>

<p>Will the Minister consider that certain articles of clothing should go free to these men? It is a question of a suit of clothes. What is the good of 60 coupons if the men have no money with which to buy these clothes?</p>

<p>On a point of Order. I rise with your permission, Mr. Speaker, to correct a mistake that was made in the Debate on the Adjournment yesterday, a mistake made, I am sure quite inadvertently, by the hon. Member for East Islington (Mr. E. Fletcher) to whom I have endeavoured, I am afraid unsuccessfully, to give notice of this matter. He said, and he is reported at column 848 of HANSARD as follows:
<q>I think the country should know that apart from the literature which the Government sent to America through British Information Services they also arrange for a series of visits by Members of Parliament, to

tour the United States from time to time, and that those visits are not confined to Members from the Labour benches, but include visits by Members from the Opposition benches. The noble Lord himself"&#x2014;</q>
that is referring to me&#x2014;
<q>is one of the Members who have been selected since this Government have been in power to go to America to explain what is happening in Britain, and he was given a perfectly free hand in doing so."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th January, 1949; Vol. 460, c. 848.]</q>
I am afraid that at the time I did not realise the import of what the hon. Member was saying. It is, of course, quite inaccurate to suggest that, and I want to say to the House that I was in no way indebted to the Government for my visit to the United States last year.</p>
