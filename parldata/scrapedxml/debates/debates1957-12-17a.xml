<p>No, Sir. There are considerable practical difficulties in the way of Sunday afternoon opening, and while these can be faced during the summer months when attendances throughout the week are very heavy, I do not feel that I should be justified in continuing the necessary arrangements during the winter when daily attendances drop very steeply and the days are short.</p>

<p>Could not the Tower be opened for two hours in the afternoon? I gather that the British Holiday Travel Association takes the view that there would be a very good response to such an opening during the week-end.</p>

<p>I do not think there would be a very good response. The number of attendances last year fell from 142,649 in September to 44,000 in October, 27,000 in November and 13,000 in December. This indicates that the Tower is nothing

like as popular in the winter as it is in the summer. I do not think it would be a good thing to open the Tower of London on Sundays.</p>

<p>I very much hope that the need for any such considerations will not arise, but if it does, the university would have to ask the town council to consider the compulsory acquisition of the land which is required by the university for university development. It would then be for the town council to submit a compulsory purchase order for the approval of the Secretary of State. This would be subject to the usual procedure about advertising and objections.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.185.3" colnum="185" time="">
<q><i>Following is the statement by the Secretary of State for Scotland:</i>
<q>I realise that there is dissatisfaction with this decision in certain quarters both on procedure and on merits. On procedure, while the university's evidence at this inquiry was given after the evidence for the objectors, the lines of the university's case had been made clear in advance and their witnesses were subjected to Intensive cross-examination. In any case, the Government's broad acceptance of the Franks Report does not of course mean the reopening of proceedings already brought to a conclusion.</q>
<q>On merits, I would remind the House that the inquiry lasted for ten days during which all aspects of the matter were fully debated, with a further day inspecting sites. It was conducted by a senior and very experienced member of the Scottish Bar as commissioner, wholly independent of my Department, with the assistance of eminent and independent planning assessors. The decision was in line with the recommendations in the commissioner's report, copies of which were sent to all the parties.</q>
<q>The adequacy of the site for the future scientific needs of the university was one of the crucial points. What the university maintained was that the site was adequate and suitable for the foreseeable needs which St. Salvator's College, St. Andrews, would have for

basic scientific teaching and research. Peripheral sites were available if any specialised research of a character necessitating the erection of special buildings were to be developed in St. Andrews while further expansion in basic scientific teaching and research beyond that now envisaged in St. Andrews could still he undertaken within the university at Queen's College, Dundee. The university's view that the Westburn Lane site was suitable and adequate in this sense was upheld by the commissioner.</q>
<q>I am aware that this conclusion has been challenged, the Professor of Physics himself having recently criticised it as a short-sighted view, but the University Grants Committee is in full agreement with it. Nor is the impression correct that the university has now asked for additional ground at Westburn Lane. The Town Council have agreed to negotiate for the sale to the university of a small area not designated for use in the next ten years: but this area forms part of the whole Westburn Lane site allocated for university development and if it is available now it can be used to improve access to the part of the site due to be developed within that period.</q>
<q>As has already been made clear in correspondence and in replies to Questions both here and in another place, it is not open to me to review the decision; nor can I seek to alter its effect by fresh proceedings, because no new circumstances have arisen with a hearing en the merits of the decision.</q></q>

Does Ste realise that the people engaged in that industry will think that the sending of this contract across the Border is a disaster? Further, why could not the part of the contract which could be fulfilled&#x2014;as in any case it was &#x00A3;21,000 below the next lowest tender&#x2014;be accepted? Further, may I ask whether he himself, as Secretary of State, tries to exercise a general oversight over the placing of such contracts in order to make sure that work that can be done in Scotland is so done?</p>

<p>I would repeat my regret and my very real understanding of the feelings aroused by this contract going South. It would have been very much better could the contract have come to Scotland, but this is a highly technical problem. In reply to the latter

<p>No, Sir; the hon. Gentleman is very often wrong in his assumptions. The position is that discretion lies within the power of the Government in relation to the first part of the Question and, in relation to the second, we are ourselves of opinion that it is possible to have a period of notice. Therefore, it is possible to reconcile the two parts of the hon. Gentleman's question.</p>

<p>I should have thought that the Secretary of State for Scotland had plenty of powers and that he could use them. The right hon.

<p>We have deliberately extended the debate from four o'clock until five o'clock on Friday. We thought that that would be reasonable.

<p>I wish to make a statement to the House about the points of order which were raised last Wednesday when the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall) was moving to introduce a Bill under what we call the Ten Minutes Rule.<br/>
On Wednesday, the hon. Member for Wycombe was moving for leave to bring in a Bill to provide for the free supply of drugs to the patients of doctors in private practice. He proposed that his Bill should provide for the resulting charge to be borne by the Land Fund. His argument was that by this means he would avoid the necessity for the prior Queen's Recommendation as required by Standing Order No. 78 and a Resolution of a Committee of the whole House as required by Standing Order No. 79.<br/>
Technically, the hon. Member's argument is valid. The National Land Fund is a separate entity, not replenished from the Exchequer. Consequently, new expenditure charged upon it does not result in a charge upon the Exchequer and does not need the Queen's Recommendation or a Money Resolution. The matter is dealt with in page 763 of the latest edition of Erskine May. It is there instanced that the Historic and Ancient Monuments Bill, 1953, imposed charges on the Land Fund without either the Queen's Recommendation having been signified or a Money Resolution.<br/>
It may be thought that there is a certain congruity of purpose between the Land Fund and historic buildings, which is absent when it is proposed to charge the Fund with druggists' bills; but that consideration seems to me to bear rather on the merits of the Bill than upon the procedural point. We must remember that the hon. Member is proposing to proceed by a Bill. It is, I think, impossible to argue that Parliament is incapable of decreeing such a diversion of the Fund as the hon. Member proposes. Indeed, Section 48 of the Finance Act, 1946, which set up the Land Fund, states that the Fund is to
<q>be used for the purposes mentioned in this Part of this Act and for such other purposes as Parliament may hereafter determine.</q>
No limit is imposed or even indicated on those "other purposes". I therefore concluded that the hon. Member for Wycombe was in order in asking leave to introduce his Bill.<br/>
Argument was addressed to me, notably by the right hon. Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison), to the effect that the financial proposal of the hon. Member for Wycombe was, in fact, a subterfuge which would defeat the constitutional control of expenditure by the Government of


the day. There is great force in this argument, but I do not think that it is for the Chair to give effect to its conclusion. The subject was considered by the Select Committee on Procedure in its recent Report, when it was drawn to the Committee's attention by evidence and a memorandum from the Treasury.<br/>
Hon. Members will find the recommendation in the final paragraph of the Select Committee's first Report. It was:
<q>Your Committee do not consider that there is any reason for extending the Standing Orders to cover purposes other than those for which they already provide. From the evidence given to them they have not been made aware of any difficulties which have arisen in this connection. The number of Funds which might be affected is very small and Government expenditure is limited by statute. Legislation which resulted in the expenditure by the Funds of public money in excess of the statutory limits would necessitate new legislation to authorise such additional expenditure. This would involve the introduction of a new money resolution, and this, of course, would have to be introduced by the Government and would he debatable.</q>
The fact stated by the Committee as the first ground of its recommendation is that the Committee was not "made aware of any difficulties which have arisen in this connection." It may be that further resort to this device may raise difficulties of which the Committee was not made aware. If that happens the House may have to reconsider the matter. But that is not for me. The ability to use the rules of the House as they stand is important for the rights of private Members, and particularly for those of the party in opposition.<br/>
My conclusion, therefore, is that, as the proposal of the hon. Member for Wycombe is in order, he should be allowed to ask the leave of the House to introduce his Bill.</p>

<p>I am sure that the House will be much obliged to you, Mr. Speaker, for the careful Ruling you have given, and I admit that there is force in the number of the points which you have put before the House, but may I put this consideration to you? Where there is a recognised channel of expenditure provided by Statute, such as the National Health Service, is it not an abuse of the procedure of the House that somebody should, in order to bring in a Bill, invent another and really irrelevant channel for financing something? Is it not a serious thing to depart from the doctrine that

expenditure can be proposed only by Ministers? There are 10 or 11 Bills on the Notice Paper. Somebody says there are 13. That is unlucky. Would there not be a possibility that every day there might be a series of Bills proposed? I hope that it will not be necessary to consider these Bills today, otherwise our hon. Friends from Scotland will be embarrassed. However, these notices of Bills do indicate the extent to which this procedure can be abused and the ordinary business of the House held up.</p>

<p>Naturally, I considered all that in coming to the conclusion I came to. My experience, both in opposition and on the Government side of the House, is that private Members frequently exercise their ingenuity to get round this particular provision of Government control of expenditure so that they may air subjects which they feel should be discussed. It is a question, I think, of degree, rather than of anything else, whether that becomes such an abuse that the House has to take notice of it. I am reluctant to extend the power of the Chair so as to curb the proper exercise by private Members of such rights as they have under the rules.<br/>
If I may use a metaphor, I will put it this way. I do not think that it is for the referee to change the rules while the game is in progress. It is for that reason I have given the Ruling I have, but all these things depend very largely on the common sense of the House, and I think I can leave it safely in hon. Members hands not to abuse the spirit of our ancient constitution.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while for myself accepting respectfully your decision on a matter of procedure, and, indeed, regarding it, if I may say so, as inevitable in view of past decisions, may I take it that it does to some extent depend on the language of the Finance Act, 1946, which left this Fund for use for a specific purpose and
<q>for such other purposes as Parliament may hereafter determine</q>

<p>May I add to what was said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison)? We all appreciate, Mr. Speaker, the very careful consideration which you have given to this problem, but I should like to put to you a further thought. I know you appreciate the danger that your Ruling may mean for the procedure of the House. I do not think it is right that an hon. Member should try to abuse the rules in this way. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] It is quite correct that in this instance, relating to this Fund, the Queen's Recommendation is not required because it is not drawn upon the Consolidated Fund, nor is it supplied from money to be provided by Parliament. However, I think you will agree that funds are set up for definite and specific purposes, and that there ought, therefore, to be continuity in the proceedings of this House.<br/>
We ought to take note of what has gone before. Quite recently, some Members of the House, because they were not quite certain of the meaning of an Act of 1770, decided that it should be referred for decision to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. However, we know quite definitely what was in the mind of Parliament in 1946, and although the words of Section 48 of the Finance Act, 1946, are, as you say,
<q>for such other purposes as Parliament may hereafter determine</q>
I think that every hon. Member will agree that Parliament had in mind purposes similar to the purpose of the 1946 Act. When the Government, in 1953, through the Historic and Ancient Monuments Bill, raided the Fund, it was done by Ministers of the Crown and it was done for a purpose which was similar to that of the Finance Act, 1946.</p>

<p>I thought I mentioned all that. I remain of the opinion that these are matters which should be discussed on the merits of the Bill. I do not think that there is any procedural bar&#x2014;and that is all I am concerned with&#x2014;to the hon. Member proceeding with his Bill.</p>

<p>You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that it was because I was seeking information that there arose the little debate last week. I was then in some doubt and I am still in some doubt. In your Ruling you stated that you hoped

that in future hon. Members would not infringe the spirit of the Standing Orders. I want to know who is going to interpret, who will judge whether the spirit is being infringed. Suppose, for instance, that on the first Wednesday after we reassemble after the Christmas Recess I seek to bring in a Bill on the lines of the one about which I asked you last Wednesday, when I asked you whether it would be in order. Who will then determine whether my Bill infringes the spirit? If my Bill were to be infringing the spirit, how comes it that the Bill of the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall) does not also infringe the spirit of the Standing Orders?</p>

<p>I did not put what I said about infringing the spirit of the Standing Orders on a par with my decision on the procedure. What I mean to say is this: that if the rules of the House are used in a way which makes it inconvenient for the rest of the House then the House probably will take some action about it. That is what happens. Majorities can generally look after themselves in the House quite well, but as the rules stand I think it was my duty to find the Bill in order. The hon. Member for Jarrow (Mr. Fernyhough) cannot expect me to give an advance decision upon any future action which he may take, or upon any Bill which he may seek to introduce.</p>

<p>I May I begin. Mr. Speaker, by thanking you for the very considerable trouble to which you went in arriving at the very interesting Ruling that you gave a short time ago. I believe that it is said of the elder Pitt that he once addressed Mr. Speaker of his day as "Dear Sir". He must have done that after hearing a Ruling very similar to yours.<br/>
When I first tried to introduce the Bill, it was my intention to try to remedy a long-standing injustice which prevented private patients obtaining their medicines and appliances under the same conditions as those ruling for State registered patients, and above all, to guard against what I consider would be a threat to the standards of medicine if private practice disappeared altogether. I am very grateful to right hon. and hon. Members opposite for having helped me to gain the maximum publicity for my argument and my case and for having made it quite clear that, in their view, we should aim at a State monopoly in medicine.</p>

<p>Move the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.217.4" hansard_membership_id="5381" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30107" speakername="Mr. Hall" colnum="217" time="">
<p>Although I consider the principle behind the Bill of the utmost importance, nevertheless, in view of the large number of Motions on the Order Paper, which have been put down by hon. Members who had much more confidence in my judgment as to the correctness of the procedure than I had myself and also in anticipating your Ruling, Mr. Speaker; in view of that long list of Bills, which, if debated, would hold up Government business, and because I am not prepared to see my Bill used for that purpose, on the understanding that my right can be safeguarded to deploy my arguments on another occasion in this or in some other way, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.218.0" hansard_membership_id="11987" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31519" speakername="Mr. Speaker" colnum="218" time="">
<p>The hon. Member has not moved a Motion. Therefore, there is nothing to withdraw.</p>

<p>I do not believe that if the elder Pitt had been guilty of the same doubtful use of the procedure of the House and had found himself obliged to withdraw a Motion he would have done otherwise than withdrawn it quite simply, in which case he would have had much more of the sympathy of the House than has the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall). However, I have consulted my right hon. Friends and my hon. Friends whose Motions for Bills appear on the Order Paper after that of the hon. Member for Wycombe. I have had consultations with all of them except one, whom I was unable to find, and they tell me that in these circumstances, the hon. Member for Wycombe having withdrawn his Motion, they would not wish to move theirs.<br/>
My hon. Friends, however, would reserve their right, as the hon. Member for Wycombe has done, to put forward similar Motions on some other occasion, and particularly so in the case of the first of my hon. Friend's Motions on the Order Paper. It is that in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Blenkinsop), relating to National Parks, where my hon. Friend has a very good case and a procedural grievance of some standing. I might, however, make one exception. I regret that my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras. North (Mr. K. Robinson) has inadvertently had twins and that he might have to find another father in the next occasion for one of his offspring.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
The main object of this Bill, of course, is to give effect to the proposals contained in the White Paper on Scottish Local Government Finance, which was debated in the House last July. For many years there has been a lot of talk about the declining powers of local authorities. The usual analysis, I believe, has been that while their duties are heavy their powers of local decision have progressively been taken from them, largely because of the high proportion of their revenue which comes from the central Government for specific purposes and, therefore, with specific controls attached.<br/>
I believe there is general agreement that this process has not been in the best interests of local government. The underlying purpose of this Bill is to give local authorities more independence and, as a very important consequence, to encourage local electors to take a greater interest in local government affairs. The principal measures proposed towards this end are the replacement of a number of specific grants by a single general grant and the rerating of industry to 50 per cent.<br/>
Before examining these measures in detail it is worth looking at the position as it is today. At present, roughly two-thirds of the total amount of Government assistance is given in the form of percentage grants. On the one hand, the local authority spends the money knowing that it will not have to foot the whole bill; a fixed percentage of whatever it spends on the most important services will automatically be paid by the Exchequer. On the other hand, the Government, on the taxpayers' behalf, has to keep a vigilant check on local authorities' spending; this in itself can lead to frustration, if not to friction. Each specific grant carries with it its own purse string. There are now too many of these, and there is real danger of their strangling the life out of local government.<br/>
A further difficulty with which local treasurers and chamberlains are faced is that there is at present no logical justification for the way in which specific grants are now available. The grants came into being from time to time because of particular needs, but they do not apply to all services. For example, a local authority may be faced with heavy expense on a much needed service which attracts no direct grant. Water supplies in many areas are an example. If, however, it were considering spending money on another project which may be less essential, but which at present attracts a large percentage grant, there is a grave temptation to give priority to that project.<br/>
Particular services may look more attractive to some local authorities not for their intrinsic merit, but because they rank for a high rate of Exchequer grant. In short, it cannot be healthy when the percentage of grant determines whether a particular project is to proceed. Excessive reliance on <i>ad hoc</i> grants clearly has what I think one can call a corrosive influence on local authorities' power of decision.<br/>
Nowadays, I feel that members of town and county councils have too little say in spending their own revenues. In some cases they feel that they are merely agents for the central Departments and this does not encourage people to take a full and proper interest in local government affairs. This is not mere guesswork; the numbers voting at local elections in Scotland, as every hon. Member knows, have shown a continuous decline since the war, and there is no sign that this decline has as yet been arrested. Faced with this situation&#x2014;which must cause anxiety to any Government&#x2014;there are only two possible solutions.<br/>
The first is to do away with the whole paraphernalia of local government and run all services through the central Departments, or at least to treat local authorities merely as the agents of the central Government. The Government are not prepared to contemplate such a solution. The alternative is to give local government some form of blood transfusion in the hope that an added sense of purpose and responsibility will encourage local councillors and local electors alike to tackle local affairs with even greater vigour than at present.<br/>
With these objectives in mind, the Government propose, in the first place,


that industry should be rerated to 50 per cent., and that local authorities should thus be enabled to raise a bigger proportion of their revenue from local sources. I appreciate that this proposal has met with two kinds of criticism; on the one hand, from those who consider that industry is already bearing its fair share of the rates; and, on the other, from those who consider that industry should no longer have any preferential treatment. We agree that the percentage of derating introduced in 1929, at the time of a severe economic depression, is inappropriate in the entirely different economic circumstances of today. We feel, however, that the complete abolition of derating would cause too large an increase in industry's overheads at a time when they are faced with such severe competition in overseas markets.</p>

<p>I have not got the figures with me, but the hon. Gentleman will know that they are not difficult to work out. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman could quarrel with my statement that industry is faced with extremely severe competition throughout the world today. Our conclusion is that the best solution at the present time is to rerate to 50 per cent., and this is the proposal contained in the Bill. On 1956&#x2013;57 figures, it will make an additional rate revenue of about &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;3 million available to local authorities in Scotland.<br/>

<p>Before the Minister leaves that point, if it is true, as I would accept, that industry is facing a difficult time with international competition, why are we rerating at all?

<p>If the hon. Gentleman will wait for me to continue my speech, he will find that the point is fully dealt with later.<br/>
I said that this was an additional rate revenue of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;3 million as distinct from revenue from general grant. This point is picked up later in my speech to explain the actual figure received by local authorities. The net gain is &#x00A3;750,000. My point is correct as I stated it&#x2014;this is an additional rate revenue as distinct from general grant.<br/>
To come now to the grants system. The keystone of the structure of Exchequer aid will, in future, be a single general grant, although percentage grants will be retained where it is clear that they cannot, for good reasons&#x2014;technical or otherwise&#x2014;be replaced by the general grant. The general grant will replace the grants in aid of the expenditure set out in the First Schedule to the Bill; they were also summarised in paragraph 5 of the White Paper, and the most important of these is, of course, education. The distribution to individual local authorities will not be based on local expenditure; it will be calculated by reference to objective factors outside the control of the individual local authority but related to the needs of the area.<br/>
Perhaps it would be helpful if I gave an example of what I mean by "objective factors". In Table 1 in the Second Schedule we have a column of figures related to numbers of pupils per mile of road. The effect of this is that in sparsely populated counties, where there are long miles of road over which pupils have to travel to school, an addition is made to the weighted population for purposes of the distribution of the grant. This


addition may be as much as 50 per cent. In this way the distribution of the grant will reflect the additional cost in which the education authority is inevitably involved in sparsely populated areas. This distribution of the grant will also have the incidental merit of helping areas which will receive little or no direct advantage from the rerating of industry. The low rating resources of such areas are, of course, also made up through the equalisation grant.<br/>
The total general grant will be fixed in advance for periods of not less than two years at a time, but the grant will not necessarily be the same for each year of a period. The amounts for 1959&#x2013;60 and 1960&#x2013;61, for example, will be determined in the late autumn of 1958. The amounts will be prescribed in an Order which will be laid before Parliament.<br/>
The local authority associations must be consulted before the grant for each period is fixed. Its amount will be determined by reference to the latest information regarding the rate of expenditure on the relevant services, the level of prices, costs and remuneration, any probable change in the demand for the services which is common to the country as a whole, the need for development of the services and, at the same time, the general state of the economy as determining the amount of improvement which can properly be secured during the period. This will provide an orderly way of assessing the progress of local authority services and the help being given to those services from the Exchequer.<br/>
Paragraph 7 of the White Paper said that the Government would have regard to these considerations when fixing the grant, and we are required to do so by Clause 2 of the Bill. There seems, however, to be some impression that the Government propose to use the general grant to reduce the local authorities' income. This may perhaps have been caused by misreading paragraphs 17 and 18 of the White Paper, but the reduction there referred to is that which is compensated for by the additional revenue which, as I have already described, local authorities will get from the rerating of industry out of which they show a profit. In fact, it is estimated that the proposals

as a whole&#x2014;it is very important that this should be appreciated everywhere&#x2014;will give Scottish local authorities, on 1956&#x2013;57 figures, a net gain of &#x00A3;750,000 a year.<br/>
This will be their share of the additional revenue from rates on industry. Here I come to the point raised by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross), and I will go over it again to prevent misunderstanding. As already explained the gross addition is approximately &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;3 million. Against this, however, must be set the loss in tax revenue which amounts to about one-half and which must be made good to the Treasury. Of the other half of the additional net revenue, two-thirds will be retained by the ratepayers, that is, &#x00A3;750,000, and one-third by the taxpayers. The House will recall that in deciding to allow local authorities to gain an additional &#x00A3;750,000 a year the Government have had particularly in mind that there are difficulties inherent in changing from specific grants to a general grant. The grant for the first period will also include a refund to the local authorities of the minor grants which will be discontinued&#x2014;they are in Clause 4&#x2014;and an addition to offset any changes that the proposals may cause to the level of the Exchequer equalisation grant. The amount of grant so arrived at for the first period will be the starting point for the settling of the grants for all subsequent periods.<br/>
I should like to deal now with the two main criticisms of these proposals which appear to have been made so far. First, it is alleged that local authorities are being asked to pay too high a price for their freedom and that the general grant, fixed for a number of years in advance, will, in times of inflation, leave them worse off than they are now. This criticism, however, takes no account of the procedure laid down in Clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill for fixing the totals at the beginning of the grant period having regard to the various factors which are explicitly set out in Clause 2. No clearer undertaking could have been given.<br/>
We have also made provision for the exceptional case where there is a sudden rise in costs of such magnitude that local authorities cannot be expected to bear it in full until the next general grant order is laid. In that case there will be an interim review. In short, Clause 2 is a


straightforward statement of the Government's intention and should serve to allay any fears which were expressed before the publication of the Bill.<br/>
The second main criticism, which has come mainly from those concerned with education, has been that in future local authorities will be able to develop a particular service, such as education, only at the expense of other services, that there will be competition between services, and that education will suffer. The suggestion that certain services are bound to be unjustly treated under the general grant system is really a vote of no confidence in local government.<br/>
To suggest that local authorities are not able to allocate their expenditure in accordance with local needs is to suggest that in their present form they should be brought to an end. That is not our view. We have given assurances on more than one occasion that we regard education as an expanding service and we will ensure that the new financial independence given to local authorities will not be exercised in such a way as to undermine essential educational provision or to prevent the proper development of education services. In this connection, I should mention the powers contained in Clause 3, which enable the Secretary of State to fix standards and to withhold the grant where these standards are not achieved.<br/>
As for education in particular, the Secretary of State's ultimate power to require an education authority to fulfil its duties under the Education Acts will remain as at present in the power given by Section 66 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1946. Under that Section an education authority may be required to discharge any duty. If it does not do so the Secretary of State may discharge the duty himself and recover the expenses, or the court may be asked to order specific performance.<br/>
These powers have never been used in the past&#x2014;they have always existed&#x2014;and there is no reason to think that they will have to be used in the future under the general grant.</p>

<p>In my constituency, we are troubled no: only by many miles of roads but by many miles of sea which add considerably to our expenses. Would the

Minister say&#x2014;not now but at some point&#x2014;whether any provisions are made for this, because it is a point which is worrying local authorities.</p>

<p>I am aware of the amount of sea surrounding the hon. Member's constituency.<br/>
I will finish dealing with the point about powers which, if necessary, can be used for the maintenance of educational standards. I repeat that it has not been necessary to use them in the past and I do not think that it will be necessary to use them in the future, because I have complete confidence in local authorities doing their work in the best possible way.<br/>
I turn now to the Bill itself, which consists of four parts and five Schedules. Part I deals with the introduction of the general grant; Part II with the rerating of industry; Part III with miscellaneous financial provisions, which have been discussed with the local authority associations; and Part IV contains a number of supplementary and general provisions.<br/>
Clause 1 provides that from 16th May, 1959, county and town councils will receive a general grant in place of the specific grants for education, health services, fire, child care and certain other services described in the First Schedule. These were all mentioned in paragraph 5 of the White Paper. The annual aggregate of the grant for Scotland, which is to be fixed for a period of two or more years, will be distributed in accordance with the formula set out in the Second Schedule. This is not the same formula as is proposed for England and Wales. I have already given one example of how it will work. As I said during the debate on the White Paper:
<q>The formula which we propose to use in Scotland was worked out by a joint committee of officials of the local authorities appointed by the local authority associations, and officers of my Department: and I am satisfied that it is the best which can be devised in Scottish circumstances."&#x2014;[OFFICIAT RFPORT, 30th July, 1957 Vol. 574, c. 1079&#x2013;80.]</q>
I should add that the valuable contribution which the local authority officials made to the Working Party's deliberations in no way committed the local authorities. I am, of course, aware of the attitude of the associations to the Bill. We are confident, however, that the formula in the Second Schedule will stand up to scrutiny.<br/>
Clause 1 (3) and the Third Schedule provide for adjustments of the general grant to give effect to the pooling of expenditure on certain items in some of the services covered by the general grant. Clause 2, which I have already described, sets out the considerations to be taken into account in fixing the general grant for any period and allows for an interim review in exceptional circumstances. Clause 3 empowers the Secretary of State to prescribe standards of administration for the relevant services and provides a sanction&#x2014;on the lines of that already in existence for the purposes of Exchequer equalisation grant&#x2014;enabling him, subject to the approval of this House, to reduce the general grant where there has been a failure to maintain reasonable standards.<br/>
Clause 4 provides for the discontinuance of certain minor grants. As they are not very likely to be mentioned again. I should perhaps record that they are those for salaries of highway engineers and surveyors, portable wheel weighers, rodent control and compensation for loss of fees for the licensing of hackney carriages. As I have said, allowance for these will be made in the general grant. Clause 5 provides for the abolition of the Education (Scotland) Fund. This is a corollary to the introduction of the general grant. The Fund is used at present to hold the education grant for Scotland, which is, broadly speaking, 11/80ths of that for England and Wales. These arrangements will be superseded by the general grant and the Fund will no longer be required. Certain other payments now made out of the Fund, such as grants to central institutions and for the training of teachers, will be met from 1959&#x2013;60 out of voted moneys.<br/>
I should like to dwell for a moment on the effect of the Bill on the Goschen formula. The present application of Goschen to the English education grant will, of course, be reflected in the first aggregate total of the general grant. This aggregate will be used as a foundation on which to calculate the general grant in future years. Once the general grant is in operation, however, there will be no identifiable English grant in aid of education to which the Goschen fraction could be applied. It is also very important to note that if we were to calculate

the whole of the Scottish general gram on the basis of the Goschen fraction, the result, so far as I have been able to estimate&#x2014;it is a fairly complicated operation&#x2014;would be to make Scotland worse off to the extent of just over &#x00A3;1m. a year.<br/>
Clause 6 and the Fourth Schedule provide for statutory amendments consequential on the introduction of the general grant and on the changes affecting the equalisation grant system proposed in the Local Government Bill for England and Wales. What follows is rather technical&#x2014;I apologise to the House for this&#x2014;but I feel that it is necessary to have it on the record.<br/>
The present arrangements for the calculation of the total amount of the Exchequer equalisation grant payable to local authorities in Scotland are set out in the Sixth Schedule to the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act, 1956. This Schedule is designed to provide an equalisation grant which would leave Scotland with the same rate burden per head of actual population as would have to be carried in England and Wales outside London if the expenditure per head of weighted population were also the same.<br/>
Part I of the English Bill, however, contains certain amendments to the English equalisation grant system which are not being extended to Scotland at present. As there has been Scottish legislation on this subject in both 1954 and 1956, it is proposed that the Scottish arrangements for distributing the equalisation grant should be altered as little as possible in advance of revaluation in 1961. The problem therefore is to secure that Scotland continues to receive comparable treatment, in spite of the amendments contained in the English Bill, until there is a further opportunity to review the equalisation grant arrangements in Scotland. This is secured by the amendments of the Acts of 1954 and 1956 contained in Part II of the Fourth Schedule.<br/>
These provisions are, however, of a temporary nature. There must in terms of the Act of 1956 be further legislation to deal with the equalisation grant arrangements in Scotland before 1963, and the intention is to review them comprehensively as soon as the outcome of revaluation in 1961 is known,<br/>
Clause 7 rerates industry from 25 to 50 per cent. of net annual value. Since


rateable values in general are frozen under the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act, 1956, it also provides that there should be no appeal against the altered value in the valuation roll. The other points of detail in this Clause are more appropriate for the Committee stage, as are two minor changes in the 1956 Act proposed in Clauses 8 and 9.<br/>
It might be convenient at this stage to mention the transitional arrangements. Since the changes proposed cannot take place without causing some gains and losses to individual authorities. Clause 15 is designed to spread their effect over a period of not more than six years. Any increase in the rate burden of a local authority directly caused by the new grant system will be made up in full in the first year, up to 90 per cent. in the second, and on a diminishing scale thereafter from the gains of other authorities.<br/>
Most of the changes proposed in Part III of the Bill lime been discussed with, or asked for, by the local authorities.</p>

<p>"Discussed with". I would not go further than that. It was certainly not asked for. Consultation is a very important matter in all our researches.<br/>
Clause 10 raises to the product of a rate of 1s. in the &#x00A3; of rateable value or standard rateable value, whichever is the higher, the limit of expenditure by town councils on the provision of halls and certain other buildings. The existing 3d. rate limit, which was in force as far back as 1892, is now clearly out of date.<br/>
Clause 11&#x2014;I will come to this now&#x2014;makes permanent the Secretary of State's control over borrowing by Scottish local authorities for capital purposes. The present control was introduced in 1939 by the Defence Regulations and has been continued by Section 4 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1951, and by successive Expiring Laws Continuance Acts, the most recent of which has recently been considered by this House. The Government have no doubt that under modern economic conditions control must remain for an indefinite period

and should not continue to rest on temporary legislation.</p>

<p>It is in force at present.<br/>
Clause 12 increases the maximum period for which local authorities may borrow for certain purposes. Clause 13, which corresponds to Clause 50 in the English Bill, extends the range of local authority securities which are trustee investments. Clause 14 gives the Secretary of State power to increase by regulation fees payable to the Registrar-General and to local authorities for searches and certificates under the Marriage and Registration Acts. The present fees are long out-of-date. I think that hon. Members will agree that a number of these small matters that I have mentioned are welcome to local authorities.

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way. He said exactly the same thing in July. He said then that he had set up a committee to see how best this could be done. It would be more reassuring to us, after five months, if he could tell us the ways by which it can be done.</p>

<p>That committee is still working. It has a very wide range of things to cover on how to get relaxation of controls. Hon. Members know a lot about putting controls on and we are doing our best to take some off. I was coming to the particular point which the hon. Gentleman raised. We have undertaken to carry out a fresh review of the relationships between the central Departments and the local authorities.<br/>
The purpose of this review, which is now proceeding, is to ascertain whether


existing procedures can be further simplified to give all local authorities more discretion in the use of their resources. I say "all", because it does not apply just to particular grants changed over from an <i>ad hoc</i> to a general grant. The Committee has a big job to cope with. I assure the House that there is nothing sinister in this Bill. If the intention had been to reduce local authorities' income it could easily have been achieved by scaling down the <i>ad hoc</i> grants, and there would have been no need to introduce a general grant and a distribution formula.<br/>
In our view, the action taken by an individual local authority in deciding how to use the general grant is just as important to the area it serves as the action taken by the central Government in fixing the global sum. In future, we envisage that local authorities, when debating the programmes put forward by their various committees, will know in advance how much is available by way of Exchequer aid. It will, therefore, rest with them to decide which projects are most worth while and will bring most good to their areas. We are giving local authorities more discretion to use their own revenues as they think best, whether from the rates or from the general grant. We are convinced that this must result in more effective local administration and revival of interest in all the work of local authorities. This is the end which, I believe, all responsible persons desire, and it is with confidence that I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<p>There are two views about this Bill&#x2014;that of the Government and that of all local authorities, all associations interested in education and all independent local authorities. That, of course, does not necessarily mean that the Governments' view on the Bill, or that the Bill itself, is wrong. It does, however, cast a shade of doubt upon the protestations of the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State that this is a Bill to increase the independence of local authorities, that it is a Bill which will revive interest in local elections and make persons more interested in the work of local authorities generally.<br/>
If the Bill had been, as the right hon. Gentleman seems to think it is, such a great liberating Measure, a Measure that would strike off the shackles which have so long bound local authorities, I should have expected a hosanna of praise from every local authority in the country. He has not got that. He has got no praise whatsoever. Every independent local authority has criticised him.</p>

<p>I confess that for the moment I have forgotten that the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Henderson-Stewart) was a member of that Party. From his conduct in the House he displayed the characteristic of a typical Tory to such an extent that I thought that he must be a member of that party. If I offend him by suggesting that he has the characteristics of a typical Tory. I withdraw my remark.<br/>
I agree with the object of the Bill, as put forward so eloquently by the Secretary of State. What I disagree with is his method. It will not attain the object. We are all conscious of the fact that for very many years we have not had local government in Scotland; we have had local administration. Local authorities have been concerned with the application and local administration of plans which have been settled by Government and Parliament, not only in broad outline but in detail. For example, in the matter of education no local authority has any decision as to the standard of schooling, how many years a child shall remain at school, and what amount shall be paid to teachers. It has no say in education or in any other local service. It is all laid down in the most meticulous detail either by Parliament or by way of regulations made by the Secretary of State.<br/>
This distinction between local administration of Government Measures and local government proper is bad. We should do much better to have either proper local government or Government Measures administered not by local authorities but by the Government. Of those two alternatives, I prefer the first. Accordingly, I accept the right hon. Gentleman's thesis that it is advisable to put back some interest into local government.<br/>
Certain requirements are necessary for that. First, we must give back certain powers to local government. But there is only one minor provision in the Bill which gives local government any power, and that is Clause 10, which allows a local authority to spend 1s. instead of 3d. on town halls. That is the only extension of local authority powers. The Bill does away with none of the obligations which local authorities have&#x2014;and they have very many. It does away with none of the powers which the Secretary of State has to impose his will upon local authorities if they fail to measure up to the standard which he demands. Indeed, as he has so pointedly made clear to the House. Clause 3 gives him further powers.<br/>
So long as Parliament insists upon giving detailed orders to local authorities, and so long as the default powers of the Secretary of State are so extensive, we cannot possibly have proper local government. When I use the phrase "local government" I am distinguishing it from the mere local administration of Governmental duties. Although this may not be the appropriate moment to go into details, it is appropriate to say that we should think again about local government in its entirety.<br/>
There are other requirements. It is not only necessary to remove some duties from local government and to give it more powers; it is also necessary for local government to have some finance. Its dependence upon an outmoded method of financing itself is wrong. It was more than thirty years ago that a committee presided over by the first Lord Dunedin drew pointed attention to the inequalities and the inequity of the method of raising local finance by rates. The Sorn Committee drew pointed attention to the fact that local government financed by rates was breaking down, and said that that system of local government finance was

becoming overloaded. Since the present Government came into office increased burdens have been laid upon local authorities&#x2014;some imposed by Statute and others by general Government policy.<br/>
I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman noticed two very pertinent articles in the <i>Scotsman</i> published yesterday and today. The first concerned the difficulties which local authorities were having in raising capital sums&#x2014;particularly the difficulties which the larger ones had in having to join the queue on the money market and the difficulties which the smaller ones had in finding money either from the market or from the Public Works Loan Board&#x2014;and the second referred to the enormous burden which the very high interest rates now exigible were placing upon local authorities. We are now placing an intolerable burden upon ratepayers. It is intolerable, because the demand for rates depends entirely upon the assessed value of a house or industrial premises, and the variation in that assessed value does not compare to the variation of incomes as between one section of the community and another.<br/>
I believe that it was the Dunedin Committee which said, in broad terms, that it recognised that those in receipt of more than a very small level of income paid, by way of rates, a disproportionately small amount in support of local projects. We know that that is so from our own experience. I would say that the major block of dwelling-houses in Scotland is rated at between &#x00A3;20 and &#x00A3;45. That major block may be inhabited by persons with widely diverging incomes, but if they live in houses of the same value they will have to pay the same rates. If we are to have proper local government, as distinct from local administration, we must reconsider our system of local finance.<br/>
I am aware that the White Paper says that this has been done, and that a satisfactory way has not been found of raising local revenue other than by way of rates. I do not know what inquiry was made by the Departmental Committee, but I know that within the last few years an inquiry was undertaken on the Continent of Europe to ascertain the methods of local finance which operated there, and that that inquiry showed that numerous ways of raising local finance existed in various


countries. I am also aware that the Dunedin Committee said, in the most emphatic terms, that the Board of Inland Revenue should be told to work out a system of local Income Tax. It should not be asked what are the objections to it. Lord Dunedin said that the Board must be told to work it out and that the objections would, or would not, prove themselves.<br/>
As I said, the Bill in no way deals with the powers of the local authorities, other than to restrict them in certain particulars with which I will deal in a moment. It in no way increases the financial basis of local authorities. The Bill increases, or will tend to increase, the burden placed upon local ratepayers, and in this way. There will be a block grant. It is true that the block grant distribution depends largely on objective facts and figures, but the fixing of the total of the block grant does not appear, so far as I can see, to depend upon objective features at all. It appears from Clause 2 to depend entirely upon what the Secretary of State thinks is the right figure. Having got the right figure, it may be broken down according to certain objective features.<br/>
Let us take it that the block grant will be fixed for two or three years ahead. It will be distributed according to the formula to local authorities and they will then, according to the Secretary of State, have the power to take independent decision about how to spend that block grant. Is that true? Does any hon. Member really think that it is true? If he does, he has neglected to look at the Statute imposing duties on local authorities. For example, local authorities must provide a certain standard of education. They must provide a certain standard of fire protection, and this, that and the other thing. These are statutory obligations imposed upon all local authorities and to which they must devote the funds they have.<br/>
The scope of local authority "neglect"&#x2014;if I may use that word&#x2014;or the scope of local authority ambition, is determined entirely by the funds in their possession and by the over-riding power of the Secretary of State. These services must be provided by local authorities because the Statute says that they must. What moneys local authorities possess must be

devoted to these services. If not, the Secretary of State will step in and may ultimately bring to bear the sanction of Clause 3 of this Bill, or the provisions in various other mandatory Sections of other Acts.<br/>
I am unable to understand how it can possibly be said that any local authority has any power or any choice in the spending of the cash in its possession either under the block grant or under its general revenue; except that some local authorities may desire to do a little more or a little better than others. In that case, they may rate beyond the block grant. If they desire to do that, the limitation on their power is the rating capacity and the ability of the ratepayers to pay. If they desire to do less, they must face the anger of the Secretary of State and the sanction provided in Clause 3. The room for manoeuvre possessed by any local authority is very small indeed. To suggest that this is a great new concession is unworthy of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>I should like the right hon. Gentleman to develop that and to tell us in what way there would be room for manoeuvre. For example, he stated during the debate on the White Paper on which this Bill was prepared that it would increase the scope of the power of local authorities. He said:
<q>The principal freedom to be given to local authorities is a range of choice within the general grant subjects."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th July, 1957 Vol. 574, c. 1089.]</q>
If that be true, I should have thought that today the Secretary of State would have given us a catalogue of this range of choice. What is this range of choice? Can the right hon.

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has only to look at the Bill. I am not going through it again. It


explains that greater responsibility which comes from having a general grant plus the product of their own rerating, instead of a series of <i>ad hoc</i> grants tied to particular purposes with the restriction which that inevitably imposes. There is a whole range of local authority operations to be examined when considering how to make the best use of the total resources.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows quite well that he has not answered my question. He says that we should look at the Bill. I have read the Bill on numerous occasions, and today I listened with close attention to what the right hon. Gentleman had to say. I have no reason to believe that a local authority is given a range of choice within the general grant subjects.<br/>
Would it be proper, for example, for a local authority to spend money on fire services which otherwise it would spend on education? Of course it would not. It would be proper to do so only if the local authority was already providing a standard of education satisfactory to the Secretary of State. Is not that so? Of course it is. Only if the local authority is doing something more than the minimum can it cut down and transfer money, for example, from the education service to the fire service. Inevitably, that would mean that the standard of education would fall and the standard of the fire service would rise. But there is no real catalogue of range of choice within the general grant subjects given by this Bill.<br/>
I appreciate that the Secretary of State may know nothing about it, but I ask that between now and the end of the debate we be given a catalogue of, let us say, a dozen items in which a local authority is given a range of choice within the general grant subjects.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman knows that he is making a purely debating point which is not worthy of him. One could range over the whole of the operations in which local authorities engage, and if asked to pick out individual points, one could go on for ever. The whole substance of my argument is that if a local authority is tied to specific grants it enjoys less freedom in the spending of its money. That is self-evident. I am not pretending that the Bill does all that one would wish to do for local government, but I do suggest that it provides more freedom than exists at present.</p>

<p>I can only repeat that I quite fail to understand it. I am by no means satisfied that there is this range of choice within the grant subjects. I am not alone in that; I have yet to meet anyone engaged in local government who thinks that there is this range of choice.<br/>
I take an entirely different view of the Bill from that which is taken by the right hon. Gentleman. The purpose of the Bill is to transfer from central taxation to local taxation the substantial increases which are bound to come in the next few years. I am disappointed in the Bill, not so much because of its contents, which are what I expected, but at the fact that the Government should have thought so lightly of the Opposition and of the country that they could not have wrapped it up a little more, could not have tried to deceive us a little better. It is not flattering to our intelligence that the Government should not have tried to put these proposals over a little better than they have.<br/>
Let me continue for only a moment or two more. The bait, if I may so call it, which is held out to local authorities is of approximately &#x00A3;750,000 more per year. How much of that will ever find its way to the local authorities is another matter, and what value it will have by the time the Bill comes into operation I do not know. I am not only suspicious of the initial sum, but of what the Secretary of State prized so highly, the fixing of the annual aggregate amount of general grant from time to time. He suggested that if there were any increases in costs the local authority would get an increased grant, but Clause 2 does not say that at all. All that it says is that the Secretary of State shall take certain factors into account, including increased costs. It in no way obliges him to make a payment if there are increased costs.<br/>
The Bill is a grave disappointment to those who had thought rather better of the Secretary of State than this, who thought that he would stand up for the interests of Scotland rather better than he has done, and who hoped, perhaps rather faintly, that the Bill might mark a new advance in administration in local government in Scotland. The Bill consists really of the first five Clauses, and then there are these other odd Clauses. I can only


advise my right hon. and hon. Friends that this is a Bill which we must certainly vote against.</p>

<p>I found the arguments of the hon. and learned Member for Paisley (Mr. D. Johnston) somewhat different from what I had expected. The general criticism of the Bill inside and outside the House has been that education would suffer, but at the start of his speech the hon. and learned Gentleman seemed to regret the extra powers given to the Secretary of State under Clause 3, by which he can alter the grant if, in his opinion, a local authority is not providing the efficient education service which should be given.<br/>
It is a strange argument that because we allow local authorities to take more responsibility for the allocation of money to their services, the administration will cease to be efficient. In the administration of all money, whether it be in relation to one's household or to larger units, it can very rarely be said that the money could not have been more efficiently administered. That is why I support the principle of the Bill to give to the locally-elected body more direct responsibility. I would remind the hon. and learned Gentleman that George Bernard Shaw, who was neither a Tory nor a National Liberal, said that
<q>&#x2026; freedom means responsibility and that is why most men dread it.</q>
The merit of direct responsibility is an opinion we have held on this side of the House all our political life and on which we were elected. As far as possible we shall give local authorities discretion over their own affairs.<br/>
I am not worried about that. Local electors will see that local authorities discharge their functions properly. I am worried because I suspect that, Aberdeen, the third largest local authority in Scotland, will not get enough money under the Bill. [HON. MEMBERS: "Ah."] The interjections from hon. Members are based on the misunderstanding of what I mean. I have no fear that local councils Cannot spend their money economically but I want to ensure that Aberdeen will get enough of it. That is the purpose of my intervention this afternoon.</p>

<p>No doubt the hon. Member will have an opportunity of raising that point if he is fortunate enough to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. It is estimated in the White Paper that the general grant for Aberdeen, had it been in force for the period 1956&#x2013;57, would have been &#x00A3;1,276,342. With specific grants the city has to find about 30 per cent. of the expense. It is true that another &#x00A3;750,000 is to be made available to local authorities, but I suspect that Aberdeen will suffer a loss, for the simple reason that it has an advanced educational system which is due to much work over the years, even by Socialist-controlled councils&#x2014;</p>

<p>Does the noble Lady realise that the &#x00A3;750,000 additional money applies to the year 1959&#x2013;60, is an increase of 2 per cent. over a period of three years, and is not likely to take account of the fall in the value of money in that time? I think the local authorities will get much less.</p>

<p>I am always grateful for small mercies. I do not expect that the rise in the cost of living will continue, because this admirable Government will deal with that problem. Aberdeen is a delectable place for teachers and it happens that in our schools we have a high proportion of teachers to pupils and an extraordinary lack of capital costs in the form of buildings compared with the cost of remuneration and matters of that kind. While it is true that there is less need for Aberdeen Education Committee to spend in the future, because it has considerably advanced during the past years, it is hard that work done with the approval of the Government should apparently now be penalised. I hope that what my right hon. Friend called certain objective factors regarding education will be generously taken into account.<br/>
For instance, I appreciate the transitional arrangements whereby no local authority will bear any loss during the first year of this scheme. I also appreciate that it will bear only 10 per cent. of any loss during the second year and that


it is estimated that the scheme will take five to six years to come into effect. I want to find out what it to be the total sum allocated to Aberdeen, and I notice that there are to be discussions with local authorities towards the end of next year about the totals of the general grant for the years 1959&#x2013;60 and 1960&#x2013;61.<br/>
Aberdeen and other local authorities likely to suffer a loss&#x2014;this would be my reaction&#x2014;are likely to make a larger estimate of expenditure, whether they need it or not, and that must be taken into account if we wish to encourage saving, economy and thrift. I suspect, indeed, I prophesy, that Aberdeen will win for itself a higher proportion of the general grant than is laid down in the White Paper.<br/>
I appreciate what is to be done about revaluation and it may be that many of the considerations now before us will have to be revised. I place the bulk of my hopes in this matter on Clause 2 (2) which says:
<q>If &#x2026; any unforeseen change has taken place in the level of prices, costs or remuneration"&#x2014;</q>
that is very important&#x2014;
<q>and that its effect on the cost of providing the services giving rise to relevant expenditure is of such magnitude that it ought not to fall entirely on local authorities, the Secretary of State may by order &#x2026; vary the aggregate amount of the general grants &#x2026;</q>
I suggest that the Secretary of State will find that local authorities who may suffer heavy losses will take full advantage of the provisions of Clause 2 (2).</p>

<p>With their usual foresight, the Government are writing into the Bill, much of which will come into operation in future years, provisions against any possibility&#x2014;I admit a remote one&#x2014;of the return of a Socialist Government.<br/>
What is of importance in Clause 2 is the word "remuneration," because, as I have often said, I should prefer to see more spent on good sound salary structure than on buildings. Further education is very important and the provisions of Clause 2 (1, <i>c</i>) will apply in that case.<br/>
I do not wish to detain the House any longer except finally to say that I trust,

in justice to a combination of circumstances, due largely to the amount of progressive work done for education in the City of Aberdeen and in many cases to circumstances which are outwith its control, that the Secretary of State will use the powers given to him in the Bill both wisely and generously.</p>

<p>I can assure the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) that I am sorry for Aberdeen, just as I am sorry for a number of other local authorities which will find themselves in positions less fortunate than they had hoped. I was struck by the fact that during her speech the noble Lady touched on one of the key points in the whole situation. She talked about what Aberdeen had done for education under the existing r&#x00E9;gime, the r&#x00E9;gime of percentage grants. That is the best argument against the Bill. We are opposing the Bill because the percentage grant system has worked and because we are very doubtful about how the new system will work.<br/>
The percentage grant system has produced a partnership between local and central authorities which has led to a great deal of harmonious co-operation, as instanced by the progress in education in the City of Aberdeen. That is the position which we are now disturbing&#x2014;disturbing on pleas which are wide, general and specious.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State produced most of those pleas. The logic of his argument was often just a little difficult to follow. When discussing the existing situation, the percentage grant situation, in two, I think, consecutive sentences the right hon. Gentleman produced two arguments running completely counter to each other. The first was that it is possible in the present situation for local authorities automatically to get grants for what they want. The second was that Her Majesty's Government have to keep a vigilant eye on local authority spending.<br/>
I do not know on which argument he is basing himself, but I do know that in the past the considerations which he stated so briefly, so briefly that he did not express them fully or correctly, have merged together to produce a co-operative system. Local authorities do not get


grants automatically. They get them for approved schemes and projects. In other words, it is not simply a matter of agreement about the amount of money which changes hands. It is a matter of agreement about the nature of the project on which the money is to be spent. That is one of the crucial points of the argument about the Bill.<br/>
The Bill talks a great deal about money and on that basis the right hon. Gentleman produced a number of fine-sounding generalisations about independence and freedom and that kind of thing. In fact, the money is raised only because of the projects on which it is to be spent. The essential thing in local government is not money, but policy, and the question is not whether local authorities ought to be free to spend the money they have, but whether they ought to be free to develop policies of their own.<br/>
In the major subject with which the Bill deals, education, the biggest change which has taken place over the last generation is that policy has become much more a national matter and fewer decisions are now left in local hands. It is not simply a matter of fixing teachers' salaries and so on, but also a matter of major lines of development. It is a matter of national interest to people everywhere, in Aberdeen and in every other local authority, that children should stay on longer at school. It is also a matter of national interest that every education authority in the country should develop technical and scientific education more than it is doing at the present time.<br/>
No one is going to leave the decisions on these matters in local hands. These are matters of national interest, as are most of the major matters in educational policy, and it seems to me quite a false idea to talk about the local authorities having increased freedom in matters like education when, in fact, we know perfectly well that the major advance is to be along nationally determined lines.<br/>
I think that the right hon. Gentleman was probably wrong in making the point with which he started&#x2014;that because of this greater independence in decisions about spending, there would be greater interest on the part of the voters in the affairs of the local authority. He gave us no sort of reason at all why the change he proposes should have that effect on

people voting in local government elections. He said that as a result of the Government making this change we should get more people voting in those elections and more interest in what the local authority was doing. I do not think any greater interest on the part of the voters will arise because of this slight change towards what he calls independence, though it is not independence actually. There is no great freedom, but just a slight change in the way in which a local authority can handle its money. The right hon. Gentleman gave no reason at all for that suggestion.<br/>
When he reflects more fully upon the matter, and perhaps he has done already, the right hon. Gentleman will probably find that the reason there is less controversy about local matters than there used to be&#x2014;as expressed in the numbers of people voting&#x2014;is just that the main content of a local authority's work is now far more determined by national policy than before. There is far less controversial policy about which to clash than there used to be.<br/>
One of the arguments put forward in this connection in favour of a change has been that the proportion of grant to rates, which form the income of each local authority, has been too high. I noticed that the right hon. Gentleman did not lay any great stress on that, and I do not wonder. The proportion, as given by his colleague in the debate on the English Bill, was six to five&#x2014;six grant and five rates. The proportion in terms of policy decisions is, of course, immensely greater than that. In matters with which a local authority can deal, the ratio of central decision on policy to local decision must be not six to five, but twenty to one, or something of that sort. It does not seem to me at all unreasonable that the amount of income from grant should be greater than the amount of income from rates. There is nothing in the nature of the work done to make it necessary for the rates to be higher than the grant. It is a quite irrelevant consideration.<br/>
The whole business of the relationship between local authorities and the central Government, not on finance but on policy, seems to me to be a very important matter, and I think that in this Bill the Government are treating it too lightly. Under the present system which is about to be swept away a local authority receives for an approved project a certain


amount of grant, more, in most cases of educational expenditure, for instance, than it is to spend itself out of the rates. That proportion, as between the local authority and the central Government, is a matter of policy to be decided by the Government of the country as a whole.<br/>
It seems to me that, apart from administration, it is the function of a local authority to act as the local eyes and ears of Government as a whole&#x2014;the eyes and ears from the observations of which new lines of policy will be determined. The local authorities can push ahead here and there and try out schemes, this project and that, without necessarily committing the whole of the economy to a particular kind of thing; but if it is well considered, then they can get co-operation and friendly assistance from the central authorities.<br/>
Under the percentage grant arrangements, this has been done with mutual co-operation and trust between the central Government on the one side and the local authorities on the other. The local authorities can receive this co-operation, and can receive a grant in order to try out any properly considered and reasonable schemes. That seems to me to be the proper sort of relationship between the central Government and local government, and this is the kind of relationship which the present grant arrangements foster. It is the kind of relationship which the new grant arrangements will only endanger, if they do not in fact sweep it away.<br/>
I should like to make one other comment. I do not intend to speak for very long; since this is the kind of debate in which a great many Members will want to speak, I shall try to confine my remarks to about fifteen minutes, instead of the usual twenty. I should like to comment on the modifications or qualifications which have been put into Clause 2 (1), on which the Government have relied a great deal for their defence against the accusation that these changes in finance will lead to a failure to develop services properly.<br/>
Clause 2 (1), in spite of what Government spokesmen have been saying, seems to be an essentially weak safeguard. There is not nearly enough in it. It is not in fact any proper safeguard at all. Clause 2 (1) (<i>c</i>) deals with

<q>the need for developing those services and the extent to which, having regard to general economic conditions, it is reasonable to develop those services.</q>
One of my hon. Friends, in the debate on the Bill dealing with England and Wales, asked who would decide what was reasonable. Obviously it will be the Government. Who will decide whether there is a need? Again, the Government. Who will decide about general economic conditions? Again, the Government. What the paragraph means is simply "When the Government think fit"; nothing more or less than that, and there is no safeguard in it at all.<br/>
The same is true about the two earlier paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), though it is paragraph (<i>c</i>) which is important for developing services like education, because there is a great deal of fear on this side of the House that because of the tremendous developments which are needed in education in the next few years, the central Government, if it remains in its present hands, will try to get out of its financial responsibilities and pass the buck as far as possible to the local authorities.<br/>
There are two points I should like to make about Clause 3. One is about default. The Secretary of State touched on this matter, and I should like to have from the right hon. Gentleman or from his hon. Friend who is to conclude the debate an assurance on one rather serious point concerning the nature of the provisions regarding an authority which does make a serious default. The Clause states that the grant can be refused, and, of course, the right hon. Gentleman says that supplementary provisions for that are in the existing Acts. In the debate on the English and Welsh Bill, there was one rather horrifying moment when the Minister of Education, replying to a point made by an hon. Member from Birmingham, said that if Birmingham was short of a large number of teachers, it would still get its full grant. It would have a financial bonus because it had not appointed as many teachers as it should have done.<br/>
I hope the right hon. Gentleman will assure us that nothing of that sort will happen in Scotland, but that if there is a great shortfall in the number of teachers, the authority will be given help, but will not be given an uncovenanted financial benefit simply because it has not spent, or has not managed to arrange


properly to spend, the money which should have been spent on teachers, or on something else equally important.<br/>
I should like to have seen in Clause 3, or in another Clause, some provision comparable to those concerning default but providing an incentive. I should like to see some arrangement which would encourage local authorities to strengthen their teaching staffs so that they could decrease the size of classes and raise the level of their service. There does not seem to be any incentive in the Bill to do that. Under the present arrangements there is a fairly considerable incentive, as the noble Lady showed. I do not think there would be any difficulty in making provision for proper incentives on at least a number of the more important matters in which there might be development.</p>

<p>There were two points made by the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. M. MacPherson) with which I agreed. I thought that during the English and Welsh debate, and, perhaps, during our own talk on this subject previously, the idea was created that in these days local authorities could simply think up a scheme and get a 60 per cent. grant. Of course, that is not so; we know there has been keen and very helpful scrutiny in Edinburgh all through.<br/>
The second point raised by the hon. Member was with regard to the remark of the Minister of Education about the shortage of teachers in one area. It was felt that the area would be penalised thereby but the Minister said, "No, the calculation is made on the average staffing required." That gave the impression right away that there was a way of saving money, to cut down spending on education by employing fewer teachers. I hope my right hon. Friend does not agree with the Minister of Education in that respect.<br/>
Hon. Members must recognise that this is a Bill without friends outside the House. The local authorities are against it, the teaching profession is against it, and industry is against it so far as it effects rerating. We must realise that those bodies of opinion are not frivolous but are responsible bodies, and give

due weight to the quality of opinion that is arising against the introduction of this Bill. When I read what they send to me and hear what they say to me when I meet them, I wonder whether it is possible that those responsible people can be wholly wrong and the Government completely right. It is not some slight amendment for which they are asking; they are against the Bill almost completely.<br/>
It is up to us, perhaps more than usual because of that consensus of opinion against the Bill, to prove our case. I believe that case can be proven, but we must abundantly prove it. Arguments against the Bill which I have had brought to me and which I have heard in this House and outside are, first, against the claim we make for the underlying purpose of the Bill as described in the White Paper, that it will give greater responsibility, greater independence to local authorities and create greater freedom. That is looked upon as dubious and as something which will not amount to much in practice.<br/>
The second argument is that this is a sinister scheme to cut the cost of education nationally and raise the cost locally. I must admit that in this Bill we are erecting the apparatus to do that. The third argument is that the teaching profession, even though we operate this machinery properly, has no confidence in local authorities to apply the necessary funds to meet the expansion which we all know will be necessary in education in the years ahead. Some say that the re-rating provisions do not go far enough, and industry says they go too far. Those, roughly, are the headings under which the main complaints about the Bill have come to me.<br/>
On the local authority question, we should listen to what the teaching profession has said. It has not much respect for the local authorities' position in Scotland today. It says that local authorities are jaded, ailing and sick, that they have lost prestige and lost the appeal to young people to take part in local government; it is unrepresentative; and there are too many non-elected members.<br/>
That makes nonsense of one claim made by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) that local electors will check on these people who have to come back every


three years for election. That is not so, and I will give figures to show that it is not so. A member of the E.I.S. said that he thought local elections were becoming a farce. As we say that we believe local government is the lifeblood of liberty and liberty is the lifeblood of local government, we should look into this question and see if we can do more to bring in new life to local government.<br/>
I looked into the question of elections and found a rather alarming state of affairs. I found that in 1955, when all bodies had elections, 70 per cent. of the seats in Scotland were uncontested. That is not strong local government. If we take out the district councils, we find that 60 per cent. were uncontested and only 40 per cent. of the members were elected. In the counties of cities 14 per cent. were returned unopposed, in large burghs 23 per cent. were unopposed, and in small burghs 50 per cent. were unopposed. In the landward areas 75 per cent. were unopposed, and in the district councils, where elections are rapidly becoming a farce, 86&#x00B7;4 per cent. were unopposed.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. Member is raising this matter, because three years ago when a Labour candidate contested a ward in Bearsden, at the count the Conservative had 2,000 votes and the Labour candidate 600 and the Conservative said, "I hope we shall not have any of this nonsense again."</p>

<p>This is a subject, which obviously is of very great importance. Does my hon. Friend think that there is anything in the view that in modern times, with present taxation and so on and the difficulties of people finding time to take part in local government, there is the reason for people not presenting themselves as candidates?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.249.3" hansard_membership_id="4775" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31944" speakername="Mr. George" colnum="249" time="">
<p>I intended to deal with that matter later in my speech. I share the views of my right hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. J. Stuart). I say these figures show that some injection is needed into local

authority life to restore confidence to the public in that institution. In my time I have seen interest decline, and I fear that that is due to the increase in the amount of grants.<br/>
I do not share the view of the hon. and learned Member for Paisley (Mr. D. Johnston) who opened for the Opposition in this debate. I think this Bill will do something to help interest in local government and local activities. I think the part of the Bill dealing with rerating will also help, because a great gap was created when industry was derated and no longer had a stake in local affairs. Experienced businessmen did not come forward as candidates at council elections as they did before derating. I think the Bill will do something to restore prestige and increase responsibility, because it will increase independence of local government.<br/>
I can see in local councils far more active committees and far more elert finance committees&#x2014;finance committees were rapidly becoming rubber stamps for the others. Much more time will be needed for finance committees if they are to harmonise the conflicting views of the various services. I would stress that: much more time will have to be given to finance committees if they are to do that.<br/>
I turn to the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn about attractions for candidates. We have to look at this matter in a practical way. I think it is true that the amount of time consumed on local council work is more than many can spare nowadays; but we can offer some inducements. A higher share of Her Majesty's honours should go to people in local government. I know of excellent men who have served the public for thirty years&#x2014;county conveners, provosts and the like&#x2014;who have received no national recognition whatever. We should not under-rate the tremendous appeal that these honours have to men in local government, and if this work were better recognised nationally it would play some part in bringing people back. The office of convener of counties has not the status it should have. The holder should also be a lord lieutenant.<br/>
Then there is the cost of candidature. We know that this is growing. It can be more than ordinary people can bear, and we should think of paying, at least, for election postage. Who would ever have


dreamt that we would have seen the day when payment would be made to those sitting in another place? I think that ultimately we shall have to consider paying councillors, especially those in counties of cities and in the scattered landward areas. We have to do something to bring suitable people forward as candidates.<br/>
I have spoken of candidates; now let us look at the results of elections. They give great cause' for alarm. Here are the figures for 1952, when all bodies had elections. We should always remember that many people are not given the chance to vote because there are no contesting candidates, and that many people stay away because they have no desire to vote and have no interest in the issue. In 1952, of the people who were entitled to vote in Aberdeen, only 40 per cent. did so. Other figures are: Dundee, 52 per cent.; Glasgow, 45 per cent.; Edinburgh, 35 per cent. That was not a very good showing, but what has happened since? In 1952, 40 per cent. of the Aberdeen electorate voted. Last year, the figure was 9 per cent. Dundee dropped from 52 per cent. in 1952 to 36 per cent. last year; Glasgow, from 45 per cent. to 28 per cent., while Edinburgh showed a slight increase from 30&#x00B7;5 per cent. to 32 per cent.<br/>
Those are alarming figures and point to the fact that some campaign, some real effort, some change is needed to alter the outlook, first, towards candidature, and secondly, towards exercising the vote. This Bill will do something, but do not let us over-rate what it will do. It will not create vast changes. I am sure that more will be done for local government by the fact that tenants are now required to pay all the rates. That will bring at least a sort of angry interest into local government next year and in succeeding years. Some councils help themselves by opening their doors to the Press, but too many of them do their work in committee behind closed doors. In turn, the local Press could do much to create interest in local government affairs by better-quality reporting.<br/>
I should not like the impression to get about that the figures I have quoted present the true picture. That the position is not so bad as they indicate is largely due to the fact that in Scotland

we have a hard core of high-quality members who go on year after year doing first-class work for the country and are backed up by most able and conscientious officials. That hard core, aided by those officials, has made striking advances in local government work in recent years, but I see some grounds for the teachers' doubts about local authorities, and this and succeeding Governments should find out why this decline of interest has taken place.<br/>
I favour rerating of industry. When we last discussed this subject, the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. Hamilton) took me to task for not declaring an interest. That was one of many wild statements that he then made. I do not know whether I should declare an interest. I have read the whole of the English and Welsh debate, and no one declared an interest there. I certainly have an interest in firms that will be affected by rerating.<br/>
As I say, I favour rerating&#x2014;</p>

<p>Industry should pay its full share of local government costs&#x2014;and it should send its full share of representatives into the councils. My right hon. Friend's speech gave me the impression that he thought that as industry was derated in depression it should be rerated in prosperity. That seemed to put forward the idea that industry is still enjoying derating. Such is not the case. Had there been no derating, taxation on industry would have been less.<br/>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer certainly did not say year to year that there was a proportion of industry's income that was sacrosanct because of rating. Not a bit of it. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has long since consumed the benefit of derating. Industry has been taxed, and overtaxed, and I deplore the light-hearted approach to the taxation of industry which is made by some hon Members opposite. [<i>Interruption</i>.] I think that hon. Members opposite have, with unanimous voice, said that industry is not yet rated nearly highly enough. The Secretary of State tried to strike a balance of what he thought industry could bear.<br/>
Rerating should be carried out, and should be carried out up to 100 per cent.,


but it should be a combined operation between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and my right hon. Friend in order to see that industry is no worse off after it is rerated than it is now. But this is a new imposition put on industry, not justified at all by the fact that it has been derated. Rerating at 100 per cent. should be in this Bill, and should be introduced by ten steps of 5 per cent. each and paid back to the local authorities in full. At the same time, the Chancellor should see that industry is not penalised by this move.<br/>
I come to the general block grant, about which I have had many deputations, and have met some senior officials of the E.I.S. The teachers think that this is a sinister scheme to effect economy nationally, and to add to the local burden. This Bill certainly creates the apparatus to do just that, and there must be a sincere approach by Governments, of whatever party, towards education. If not, we are putting into the hands of Government the tools necessary to cut education as they think fit.<br/>
Local authorities undoubtedly prefer a percentage grant. It is quite a cosy little feeling to know that that money is always coming in and that if one can once get Edinburgh's approval of schemes those schemes will go through and there will be no restrictions on the amount. The teachers fear reaction on the part of local authorities in future. They fear that the local authorities might misuse the block grant. That grant seems to me to represent the introduction of budgetary control into local government affairs. By this system they have to work within a fixed budget, and I believe that that will excite a great deal of interest, and highlight possible savings in local authority work. If this leads to economies, what is wrong with that? If economies can be made by closer attention to the way the work is done, then let economies be made. I cannot believe that this great industry of education, spending so many hundreds of millions, is nearly 100 per cent. efficient. No businessman would ever claim that his industry is efficient to anything like that degree.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman must not put words into my mouth. I am saying that there is not one industrialist in this House or outside who would say that his industry could not effect economies. I am quite certain that within the &#x00A3;500 million there is room for economies, and I am quite certain also that, working within the framework of the block grant, authorities will pay more attention to costs and economies will result. That is certain as a matter of business. "Economy", in the view of hon Gentlemen opposite is a nasty word, but in mine it is not.<br/>
The argument has been put forward that what is proposed will penalise the progressive authorities and help those which are not progressive. The housewife who spends most is not necessarily the best housekeeper. I cannot see why we should assume that high spending means that a better education is being provided. High spending could also mean bad management. Low spending could mean an inferior education, but it also could mean good management. Why should it be suggested that high spending means progress and low spending means reaction?<br/>
Let us look at what may fairly be taken as a yardstick, namely, what authorities are spending per pupil per annum. That is a fair yardstick of education now, and, from a study of it, we may see whether there is any real fear for the future. Taking the counties of cities, I find that Aberdeen this year estimates an expenditure of &#x00A3;31 per head per pupil per annum. Dundee will spend &#x00A3;23&#x00B7;7. There is a difference of 28 per cent.</p>

<p>City. These are all counties of cities that I am taking at the moment. Aberdeen estimates that it will spend &#x00A3;31 this year, and Dundee estimates &#x00A3;23&#x00B7;7.

<p>No; it goes further than that. I am taking four counties of cities. Glasgow will spend &#x00A3;26&#x00B7;1 per pupil this year, and the figure for Edinburgh is &#x00A3;25&#x00B7;4. There is a great difference between Aberdeen and Dundee, and they are both Socialist-controlled. I leave hon. Gentlemen to make up their minds whether one authority is reactionary and the other is progressive. The average of them all is &#x00A3;26&#x00B7;2, so there is no great difference between any of them and the average in the counties of cities.<br/>
Looking at the counties, which embrace all the large and small burghs, I do not take the highest figure, which comes from a Highland county&#x2014;&#x00A3;51&#x00B7;4 in Sutherland&#x2014;but I find that Ayr is the lowest, with a figure of &#x00A3;20&#x00B7;5 per pupil. That also is Socialist-controlled. It is the lowest spender, yet I know that it is not a reactionary authority. Having lived and worked there, I know that Ayr is progressive in education and that its spending is good. The average for all the counties is only &#x00A3;23&#x00B7;4, so that Ayr, though the lowest, is not much below the average.<br/>
From these figures, I believe that all authorities are doing their best, at the moment, continuously to discharge their duty to their children, and I do not fear that they will suddenly change their outlook towards education after the Bill is passed.<br/>
There are many more points I should like to deal with, but I do not wish to detain the House. I will deal quickly with the question of the grant. I believe that authorities are trying honestly today, but the grant will be operated according to a formula, and the charge is made that we intend to cut education. I think that that charge has been ably answered already by my right hon. Friend. The other charge is that the grant will not take account of inflation. As to that, I share the view of my noble friend the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South that the Government will halt inflation. I believe that we are in for a period of stability in prices.</p>

<p>I saw that there has been a rise of 0&#x00B7;7, to be quite exact. I believe

that our policy is working, and I believe that it will succeed. It is my view that we shall succeed in halting inflation and that we are in for a period of stability.<br/>
Even though we did not halt inflation, the formula, if properly and honestly applied&#x2014;I admit that it can be misused&#x2014;will take account of all the facts, including the existing costs, need for expansion, trends of prices, and salaries and so on. It also makes allowance for any exceptional happening which a local authority is unable to deal with in the ordinary way. Of course, all must be considered within the ability of the economy to carry the expansion and the cost. What is wrong with that? In any event, I believe that if any depression did strike the country, education would, under this Government, be the last to suffer.<br/>
Turning to my last point, the fear of teachers that local authorities will fail to discharge their duty, I consider that the evidence I have given of past and present performance shows that the local authorities are indeed trying today to provide a good national standard of education. I cannot imagine any local authority rushing off to expand other services covered by grants at the expense of education, and I do not think that any local authority would be so reaction-minded as to neglect education in order to reduce the call upon the rates. I am confident that local authorities will play the game by the educational system and will provide for the expansion which we all know is needed.<br/>
Other countries have recognised the absolutely vital place which education must have in the years ahead. We have seen the majestic advance of Russia, and we realise the need for technical education among our own people. We must educate our children better. We must at some time raise the school-leaving age and do better with further education. There is a great task to be accomplished, and, for my part, I should never support any Government which neglected education or allowed anyone else to neglect it. The Bill is an advance, and I am happy with the position of local authorities under it. I believe that the Bill will help them and the country, and I support it.</p>

<p>We cannot get even that done within the present Bill unless the hon. Gentleman votes against the Financial Resolution. We must make a start. I am afraid that my experience of the hon. Gentleman leads me to think that we are not likely to have his support for any of these measures, and that his speech was concerned more with catching the Press in his constituency than with dealing with realities in the House.</p>

<p>I wish to return now to what I, like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. D. Johnston), regard as the real problem. I should have thought that one of the reasons, if not the important reason, why anybody with any knowledge or association with local government activities in Scotland was against the Bill was that it failed to deal with a problem which everyone has said in the past is the real problem of local authorities.<br/>
I do not know of one single person who has spoken about local authority administration during the past six or seven years who has not pointed out that the real problem is the ever-increasing rate poundage and the urgent necessity of finding means of supplementing existing

local government revenue. That has been the view of practically every body, association or organisation which has considered the matter, including the Sorn Committee. I have a whole volume of quotations, but I do not want to weary the House by going through them.<br/>
The trouble with the exceedingly narrow basis of taxation from which we get our local revenue is that it is unjust and that every time the rates go up, so the injustice is aggravated. When we consider that local rates have increased by about 300 per cent. since before the war, the injustice which was seen to exist pre-war has become increasingly obvious to almost everybody, except, apparently, the Government. That is the crux of local government finance, and the Bill does nothing to alter it.<br/>
When the Committee to inquire into local government finance was set up, it was some time before we could even discover from the Secretary of State that there was a Committee in Scotland inquiring into the matter. A considerable amount of probing was needed from this side of the House before we could discover that. Everybody expected that the problems of local government finance would be examined. We are told that they have been examined, but we have not been given a report by any Committee which examined any other system or form of adding to local government income.<br/>
We have been told that other methods were considered impracticable, but we have never been told why. It is not the way to treat the House of Commons, or to treat Members who have to deal with local government finance and to legislate for it, simply to say that somebody&#x2014;we do not even know who&#x2014;has considered the matter and has discarded any alternative suggestion. We know neither who were the people nor what their reasons were. That is not good enough.<br/>
The Government suggest that they will do some little thing about it and that they will rerate industry to the extent of 25 per cent. I found it difficult to understand the reasons for this partial rerating of industry. As I read the White Paper for England and Wales, it seemed to me that the argument of the Government was that the national contribution to the income of local authorities had increased to the point at which the ratio was now 6 to 5 when compared with the


sum raised locally, and that something had to be done to adjust that balance.<br/>
Where do these figures of 6 to 5 come in in relation to Scotland? I understood from the reply given to my hon. Friend that the Government contribution in Scotland is something like 40 per cent.</p>

<p>It is 38 per cent.</p>

<p>I was giving the Government the benefit of the doubt. I looked up the figures for Edinburgh, and I find that its total rating revenue is &#x00A3;9&#x00B7;3 million, of which Government grants account for only &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;1 million, or one-third. Where, then, does the ratio of 6 to 5 come in for the large densely populated local government areas? We ought to have some explanation.<br/>
The Government argue that they ought to do something about it on the basis of the 6 to 5 ratio and, therefore, they say that they will rerate industry another 25 per cent. to try to level up the balance as between local revenue and Government grant. If that is a sound argument, why should industry not be rated 100 per cent.? On that basis, I should have thought the two should be levelled up even more and that the Government should make it possible for the local authority to increase its rateable value by &#x00A3;6&#x00B7;9 million instead of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;3 million. The aim of the Government seems to be to increase the rateable value and to increase the income of local authorities from their own resources, to give them greater power. If that argument is true, industry should be rated 100 per cent. and not 50 per cent. Instead, however, it is rerated to 50 per cent.<br/>
In Edinburgh, the ratepayers will continue to subsidise industrialists to the tune of a 4d. or 5d. rate. I thought that the Government did not believe in subsidising people who did not need subsidies. That is what they always tell us. In Musselburgh, a small burgh in my constituency&#x2014;where, incidentally, we can manage to secure a poll of almost 70 per cent. at municipal elections, and where there is a very live local body&#x2014;the ratepayers will continue to subsidise industry to the tune of a 1s. 3d. rate. That is a heavy rate poundage by which to subsidise people who, judging by the condition of their accounts as I read them in the reports in

the Press, could quite well afford to pay their rate burden.<br/>
What is the burden that industry has to bear through the rates? The right hon. Gentleman dodged this question, but many years ago the Balfour Commission pointed out that it was 0&#x00B7;55 per cent. of costs. Everyone knows that because other costs have gone up far greater than the rates, the percentage burden of rates upon industry is now considerably below that level. I should have thought that the Secretary of State might have had some figures to give us about that. It cannot, therefore, be said that this is an immense burden to industry, but it would mean a very great deal to the local ratepayers and to the local councils. It would, of course, be in accordance with the traditions of Government policy, as professed, in not wanting to subsidise people who do not need a subsidy.<br/>
There is another point about this argument which is used in the White Paper for England and Wales concerning the distribution of income as between Government grant and local revenue. I did not agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) when he said that it did not matter where the money came from. By and large, there is the feeling that money which comes through the Government is money that is collected more fairly.</p>

<p>I do not recall the remarks to which my hon. Friend is referring. I do not think they were used in any context connected with his present argument. I certainly consider it extremely important where the money comes from, especially the money that may come from either of the two sources of taxation or rates.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.260.1" hansard_membership_id="8210" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29332" speakername="Mr. Willis" colnum="260" time="">
<p>I think my hon. Friend will find that that was what he said, although I agree that the context was different. He was dealing with a wider argument. The point I wanted to make was that people feel that money obtained through Government grant is at least collected in a much fairer manner than money obtained through the rating system.<br/>
I suggest that the Government have made no effort whatever to find any alternative means of supporting the local revenue of the local authorities. They have done nothing about the large


number of suggestions which have been made by a large number of people, some of which have been reported upon very favourably. If it is the object of the Government to enable local authorities to increase their own basis of revenue rather than to obtain money from the Government&#x2014;which, they argue, ties the local authority and destroys its freedom&#x2014;they ought at least to have given more favourable consideration to the proposal that the local authority might itself collect some of the revenue at present collected by the Exchequer. I should have thought that that proposal itself would have strengthened the Government's arguments. That would even achieve what the Government are telling us they want to do.<br/>
Nobody could argue that the Bill contributes to the financial strength of the local authorities, and so the only arguments about the Bill are about the degree of freedom it confers upon local authorities. As I said when we discussed the White Paper in July, I cannot see how the local authorities obtain greater freedom. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Pollok pointed out the great needs there are for an expansion of our education services. Who is deciding that? The Government. Who is seeing that the needs are met, and the policy implemented? The Government. As has been pointed out on this side of the House already, these things are being decided and implemented nationally. That limits the degree of responsibility which any local authority has.<br/>
Let us look at the services for the expenditure on which the local authorities are to get grant. It will not take very long to do that. There are the fire services. We cannot reduce the fire services. We are compelled to provide certain fire services. Indeed, there is a stipulation about that, and no local authority has any choice in the matter. Then there are the traffic patrols. We cannot cut those down. They are increasing. Then there is the registration of electors, and we cannot cut that.<br/>
There are health services under the 1947 Act. Of course, local authorities already have a certain amount of freedom now in their work upon them. A local authority can decide whether it will build an institution under the 1947 Act or whether it will build an institution under the National Assistance Act, 1948. The local authority makes a choice, but even

then it has to go to the Secretary of State for approval. However, in so far as a choice is permitted to the local authorities, they have that choice today. They cannot, however, choose to proceed with a scheme until it has been approved. The difference to be made by the Bill will be very small.</p>

<p>I hope my hon. Friend appreciates that, although the local authorities have freedom within the limits of the grant, by Clause 14 the Secretary of State will make regulations to force them to increase the cost of dying, of being born, and of being married.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.262.1" hansard_membership_id="8210" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29332" speakername="Mr. Willis" colnum="262" time="">
<p>The freedom of the local authorities is limited by the extent of the grant, and the Secretary of State himself told us that he thought it was necessary that we should continue to control local authorities, especially their capital expenditure, and the Bill makes permanent the control by the Secretary of State over borrowing by local authorities for capital purposes, even when a local authority does not get a grant for a service.<br/>
That is a funny way to set the local authorities free or to widen their freedom. The Government say that even when the burden is borne wholly by the ratepayers and not the taxpayers, when it is entirely the burden of the local authority, the local authority must get his permission to proceed, and that this requirement is to be made permanent. That is not freedom. I cannot see where the right hon. Gentleman gets his idea that there is any freedom about this.<br/>
I asked him how far he had proceeded with his review of the Report of the Committee on the way in which freedom could be given to the local authorities. He said that he had not got very far. It is five months since he told us the Committee was set up. The proposals in this Bill were announced at the beginning of the year. Surely by this time we ought to have been given some indication of what the Government have in mind, but we have still not the foggiest idea what the Government intend to do. They have given no indication at all. All they have said is, "We shall look at this."<br/>
This is a bad Bill for two reasons. It is a bad Bill because it does not deal with the financial problem, and it is a bad Bill because it does not even do what the Government say it does&#x2014;give freedom to local authorities. I am reminded


of the comments of the previous Lord Provost of Edinburgh. I would quote him because Edinburgh was mentioned while my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Paisley was speaking, and because Edinburgh is a great friend of the Government and never passes a resolution condemning them, but is always very favourably disposed towards them. Sir John Banks, addressing the Convention of Royal Burghs immediately after the publication of the Government's proposals, said:
<q>I am doubtful if the changes which will take place in the financial system and resources of local government as a result of the present review will go far enough effectively to solve the problem of local government finance and give a full measure of independence to local authorities.</q>
In other words, the Bill would achieve neither of those two things. I think Sir John spoke very mildly about it. I certainly do not think the Bill does those things, and for those reasons I think the Bill should be opposed.</p>

<p>Unlike hon. Members opposite, I applaud the Government for presenting this Bill because one of its aims is to strengthen the influence of local government. We all know that today local government suffers from a lack of candidates and a lack of interest. Any Bill which tends to restore interest in local government and so to attract more candidates into local government, and which strengthens the hands of local government, ought to be welcome, I should have thought. If we are to have lively and efficient local government we must give it responsibility and control over its own affairs. I should have thought that that was self-evident.<br/>
As I understand, what causes most dispute is the substitution of the block grant for the percentage grant. I personally think that it is an excellent idea. I favour it. My reasons are as follow. With the percentage grant there are various votes, and there is much delay in getting sanctions, and an enormous amount of paper work; there is also irksome supervision; and there is extra work thrown upon accountants and auditors. The cry on all sides today is for the Government to cut red tape and

act more quickly. Any Measure which will simplify administration must be welcome. I am reliably informed that by this substitution the amount of time and number of man-hours which will be saved will be enormous.</p>

<p>It is the only one I asked.<br/>
I had, however, experience of this matter when I served as a civil servant overseas. I was in an area which received a grant from United Kingdom funds. That grant was divided into various sections, into different votes under different heads, and out there we were not allowed to change from one to another without the approval of higher authority. To get such approval took a long time and much correspondence and sometimes loss of temper. I learnt from practical experience that the system was a bad one. I believe that if money is to be paid to local authorities they should be given a lump sum and they should be trusted to use it to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>As has been revealed, I have the honour to represent one of the Edinburgh constituencies. All will agree that Edinburgh has an excellent record in local government and a very progressive outlook. I think that it is the best governed city in Britain. Edinburgh has clearly said that it favours the Bill and welcomes it. It will be of benefit to Edinburgh. Indeed, the proposals are very similar to proposals put forward by Mr. Bell, who was Treasurer in Edinburgh for many years and was known as an expert in local finance. Edinburgh has


no objection to the formula for calculating the sums to be given. The formula was devised after considerable thought and work by the working party that eventually produced it. No local authority and, indeed, no person has produced a better formula.<br/>
There are, however, two points I should like my hon. Friend to touch upon when he winds up the debate. They are covered by Clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill. First, I should like him to say quite definitely that local authorities will not be burdened with extra expenditure for any unexpected thing that they have to take over. They do not want an unexpected burden laid on their shoulders and then to be asked to pay for it. Secondly, the amount of the grant should be calculated annually or perhaps every second year, and it should be fixed to cover a period not more than two or three years ahead.<br/>
Like other hon. Members, I have received a good deal of literature about the Bill. It has come from two sources&#x2014;teachers and certain local government authorities. The teachers feel that in some way education will suffer as a result of the Bill. I think that they are prejudging the issue.</p>

<p>That is not my view. I believe that by giving greater responsibility to local authorities eventually competition may be started up. In any event, in Scotland education has always held a high place in our hearts and I do not see that because of the Bill the interest in education will suddenly melt away. If local authorities are not up to the mark and are not running our schools properly, the teachers and parents can get together and remove the town councillors or others at the local elections.</p>

<p>I was thinking primarily of the cities, such as Dundee, Aberdeen and Glasgow, which are Socialist-controlled.<br/>
I can understand that, because they like central control and orders from the top.

This idea of centralisation and orders from the top going down the line is the pernicious doctrine which hon. Members opposite favour. I do not subscribe to it, and I believe that we shall have more efficiency if we give local authorities more power to run their own affairs. The Bill does that to a certain extent.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to follow the speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. M. Clark Hutchison) as far as I could, but I confess that he rather surprised me by some of his statements, particularly the statement about Socialist-controlled local authorities being opposed to the Bill. When challenged about local authorities he diverted attention to the cities. When he mentioned the cities he said that they are opposed to the Bill because they like central control.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman does not understand the set-up of Scottish local government when he asserts that the cities particularly like central control. Since I became associated with local government almost thirty years ago, the fight has been against central control. My hon. Friend the Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) once said that we might get rid of the idea that local authorities are merely


the stamping machine of the central government. That has been the battle all along and it is the battle in the Bill. It still exists.<br/>
I want to deal with one or two other points that the hon. Gentleman made. I listened with rapt attention to the Secretary of State. The entire theme of his contribution could be crystallised by saying that it dealt with freedom and liberty, greater responsibility, greater this and greater something else. It was nothing but a series of platitudes. The right hon. Gentleman went on to say quite categorically that it was not the intention, by means of the Bill, to cut down grants to local authorities, or in any way to cut or bring about a reduction of the services which local authorities provide. I cannot appreciate that point of view, nor do I accept it yet.<br/>
The position is set out very clearly in paragraph 17 of the White Paper on Local Government Finance in Scotland, which says:
<q>The Government's view is that this opportunity should be taken to make some reduction in the level of Exchequer grants. The reasons for this proposal, as explained in paragraphs 26 to 29 of the English White Paper, are briefly that local authorities now receive more from Government grants than from rates.</q>
It adds that since before the last war incomes, on an average, have trebled and rates have doubled.<br/>
I emphasise that the very first sentence is:
<q>&#x2026; this opportunity should be taken to make some reduction in the level of Exchequer grants.</q>
The right hon. Gentleman said that that sentence referred to the question of re-rating, When did derating or rerating ever become an Exchequer grant? Government spokesmen are trying to cloud the situation. They regret the inclusion of that sentence. It gives the whole game away. They assert that the sentence refers to rerating, but rerating and derating were never a matter of Exchequer grant. It seems to me, therefore, that absolute nonsense is made of the Secretary of State's assertion that it was not the intention to cut down grants or to reduce the services provided by a local authority.</p>

<p>"This opportunity" in relation to the question of the financial arrangements between the Government and local authorities. The heading of the paragraph in the White Paper is, "Reduction in Grants." Have the Government ever made a grant to local authorities in respect of derating? Will the hon. Gentleman answer that question?<br/>
It is perfectly clear that this proposal involves a reduction in Exchequer grants and that the block grant system is the instrument to be employed in achieving that reduction or that economy. If hon. Members opposite still assert that there is to be no reduction in Exchequer grant, the change-over from percentage grants to the system of general grant make sense only if it becomes the means of markedly reducing the Exchequer aid and thereby compelling local authorities to raise funds from their own resources. Only in circumstances of that kind does the change make any sense at all.<br/>
If no economies are intended, why did the Government specifically exclude from the Bill police grant and the Civil Defence grant? If the block grant system is an improvement, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South indicated, on the system of percentage grants, why not include the police and Civil Defence services so that they may have the advantage of this improvement?<br/>
Is not the position simply that it is perfectly clear that the Bill will compel local authorities to cut and carve and scamp services like education, health, road safety and the fire service, but that in respect of the police and Civil Defence the Government say, "Do not touch those because we have not included them in the block grant. You will continue to receive a percentage grant in respect of those services"? I am satisfied that there is no shadow of doubt that the introduction of the block grant is part of the Government's battle against inflation. The whole purpose of the Bill is to transfer the burden from the taxpayer to the ratepayer, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) has pointed out.<br/>
Paragraph 17 of the White Paper indicates that local authorities now receive more from Government grants than


from rates. I ask whoever is to reply to the debate on behalf of the Government to what extent that is really true. Would it not be more correct to say that a few local authorities receive more from Government grants than from rates? For example, the counties of Zetland, Orkney, Sutherland, Caithness and Inverness have received Government grants probably to the extent of 80 per cent. of their total expenditure. Indeed, in some cases the extent of Government grants to these county councils works out at &#x00A3;16 7s. 5d. per head of population.<br/>
When I take the reply which the hon. Gentleman himself gave to me in respect of Exchequer equalisation grants, I find that in 1953&#x2013;57 Government grants represented only 38 per cent. of local authority expenditure. In 1955&#x2013;56 the figure was also 38 per cent., so, in effect, local authorities had to find for themselves 62 per cent. of their total expenditure. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East, I fail to appreciate a figure of 65 per cent. for rates.<br/>
I want now to speak of the position of the city which I represent, to show the trend that has taken place in the last eight or nine years. In 1948, in Glasgow, Government grants represented 34 per cent. of the expenditure of local authorities, and local rates 49 per cent. In 1956&#x2013;57, last year, Government grants represented 36 per cent. and local rates 48 per cent. So there has been little or no significant change in respect of the ratio during the past eight or nine years.<br/>
Now I will deal again with paragraph 17 of the White Paper, the third sentence of which says that
<q>&#x2026; while rates have doubled since before the last war, incomes &#x2026; have on average nearly trebled.</q>
Reference was made to that in the speech of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Pollok (Mr. George). That is an extraordinary statement to appear in the White Paper. It simply reveals how slavishly we follow the phrases used in the English Bill, without giving any consideration to the question whether or not they apply to Scotland. In reply to the statement that rates have doubled and incomes has trebled, I say categorically that the rates also have trebled. I could name dozens of local authorities in Scotland where rates have trebled.<br/>
For instance, Aberdeen's rates in 1939 were 8s. 7d.; they are now 24s. 4d. I am sorry that the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) is not in her place. Taking a county council, Stirling, the rates pre-war were 9s. 1d. and they are now 27s. 1d. Taking a large burgh, Forfar, they were 8s. and they are now 23s.<br/>
Again, let me quote the figures provided to me by the Secretary of State in reply to a Question. I asked what was the extent of rates collected in Scotland. The information provided by the right hon. Gentleman was as follows: in 1939, &#x00A3;22 million; in 1950, &#x00A3;30 million; and, in 1956, &#x00A3;63 million. So, again, the amount of rates collected has trebled, and I suggest that when the figures for the recent financial year are available a few more million pounds will be added to these figures.<br/>
I do not want to confine my criticism merely to the Government's financial programme. There is a much broader background. There is the background of greater freedom, greater independence and a greater sense of responsibility being given to local authorities. The Secretary of State dealt with that almost exclusively, and I want to know how the Bill gives greater freedom, greater liberty and a greater sense of responsibility to local authorities.<br/>
We talk of freedom and liberty being provided by the Bill but how can we, in the light of what has happened in recent years, suggest that we are extending to local authorities this freedom, this liberty, this greater sense of responsibility? How can we suggest that, when in Bill after Bill we have restricted considerably the functions of local authorities in Scotland? I am thinking particularly of the Housing (Repairs and Rents) (Scotland) Bill, the Rating and Valuation Bill, the Rent Bill and also the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Bill.<br/>
For example, in this very Bill the Secretary of State is making permanent what at one time was temporary legislation. In Clause 11 he is now permanently restricting the powers of local authorities to borrow money. How, therefore, can this Government talk of freedom and liberty when the Secretary of State took unto himself default powers in the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act? What is the use of talking


about a greater sense of responsibility when, under the Rating and Valuation Bill, we denuded the local authorities of many of their functions and took away from them valuation appeals committees?<br/>
What do we mean by freedom and liberty? If I take the first three Clauses of this Bill, what do I find? That on eight different occasions in three Clauses the Secretary of State takes unto himself the power to do this, that and the other thing. There is to be no consultation with the local authorities, no consultation of any kind. The Secretary of State invests himself with all the power necessary to give effect to the Bill. It is nonsense and humbug for the Government to talk about freedom and liberty.<br/>
I will put a final question to the Minister. When replying to the debate tonight, will he tell the House of one statutory provision which the Government intend to relinquish in order to give local authorities that freedom and liberty? Will he tell the House of a single statutory provision that will enable the Government to justify their claims about freedom and liberty?<br/>
The Scottish local authorities, excluding Edinburgh&#x2014;and I exclude Edinburgh with the maximum pride&#x2014;are united in their opposition to this Bill as never before. Indeed, the three local authority associations were invited by the Minister of State to attend a meeting in Edinburgh to discuss with him the proposals contained in the Bill. They all turned up at the meeting in Edinburgh and the Minister of State opened the discussion. However, the representatives of the local authority associations said that they refused to discuss the Bill and were disgusted with it. They then left the meeting with the Minister of State shouting after them, as they went through the door, that they were an irresponsible bunch of local authority representatives. How reprehensible we would find the conduct of the Minister of State in matters of that kind if we went into his background&#x0021;<br/>
I regard the Bill as a powerful piece of plunder, unworthy of any Government, and I shall have the greatest pleasure in voting against it tonight.</p>

<p>I am very grateful for having caught your eye, Mr. Speaker, on this occasion, because I want

to make some comments on the Bill as a representative of an area which contains large sparsely populated tracts. I have had considerable discussion about the Bill both in my constituency of Banff and here in London. I have given evidence to those in high places about the very grave concern with which Banffshire views the proposals in this Measure. I hope that the House will forgive me if I pass from the general to the particular and deal with the Bill in some detail as it affects an area like Banffshire.<br/>
Had the new proposals been effective in 1956&#x2013;57, Banffshire would have been enduring a loss of grant of &#x00A3;54,752 in the first year. The grants to be discontinued amount to &#x00A3;423,505 and the total block grant, as per page 10 of the White Paper, is &#x00A3;368,753, a loss to us of &#x00A3;54,752 with a population of about 50,000. There has been considerable and somewhat optimistic talk about the gain of &#x00A3;750,000 on the overall picture. I estimate&#x2014;and I want the Joint Under-Secretary to confirm it&#x2014;that Banffshire will be the hardest hit of all Scottish counties as a result of the Bill.<br/>
In addition to that loss, there is another extremely disturbing factor. It is that there is no concrete plan for meeting, other than through the rates, any increased expenditure arising when the new school building programme is fully under way. My county does not go in for frills and non-essentials in its building and the provision of the amenities for which it is responsible. In 1962&#x2013;63, when our school building programme is fully under way, and if the present formula is applicable, we will have a further annual deficit of &#x00A3;32,298 on loan charges, which means that from two items alone, the decrease in the grant and the increased loan charges, assuming that the formula then obtains, will be &#x00A3;87,680 a year and that is not taking account of the natural increase of expenditure which must come along with the development of our education plans.<br/>
Despite the short-term transitional arrangements, I cannot find an assurance in the Bill that a staggering annual deficit can be avoided without a lowering of the standards for which our county council stands and for which the county has rightly earned a national and, indeed, an international reputation.<br/>
The Bill refers to recoupment&#x2014;and my right hon. Friend spoke about it this afternoon&#x2014;which will come from the rerating of industry. However, my right hon. Friend appears to have forgotten that the Banffshire coast is the very centre of the Buckie&#x2014;Peterhead fiasco, when all kinds of promises were given about industry being established. It is not the fault of those who own the factory concerned that the factory which we hoped would employ 200 people now, in fact, employs only about 20. That was unfortunate, it was just one of those things, but those are considerations which should be taken into account when the case of these sparsely populated areas is being considered when devising the formula.<br/>
We have been extremely successful with our shipbuilding industry, but largely on account of Government contracts for building Government vessels, inshore mine sweepers and the like, and a certain number of grant and loan fishing craft. That sort of business is tailing off and we cannot look for recoupment from rerating the shipbuilding industry. Our woollen mills in Keith are splendid organisations, but they cannot stand any more being added to their standing charges, because they have to face the tremendous disadvantage of transport costs which, all along the line, are much higher than those of the mills on the Border and further south. We do not have the industrial wherewithal for making up the deficit.<br/>
I want to refer to the formula for the distribution of the grant. Why did the Government resort to this device and why is there not a long-term safeguard against losses such as my county will indubitably suffer? A safeguard could have been written into the Bill. I cannot find such a safeguard. The whole cause of the trouble is the Second Schedule and I insist that I have an assurance from the Government during the debate that the Schedule will be re-examined by 1961 when all the facts are known. That is absolutely essential.<br/>
I want to examine the formula in terms of a county like Banffshire. We have seven small burghs in Banffshire which could be included in the landward population. As recently as 12th December, the Department of Health in Scotland wrote to the Clerk of the County Council:
<q>I refer to your letter of 6th December, 1957, and confirm that all the burghs in Banffshire with the exception of Banff, Buckie,

Keith and Macduff are regarded as predominantly rural and, accordingly, eligible for grant under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts, 1944 to 1955.</q>
Why could not those burghs have been regarded as rural areas when the formula in the Bill was devised? If that had been done, Banffshire would have come into the 60 per cent. rural population class and conditions would have been much better. That is a consideration which must be weighed in any revision of the formula.<br/>
I have many friends among the Banffshire teachers and I know full well that they are deeply concerned about this matter. Their concern does not originate in the feeling that the members of the county council who may not be university graduates are not qualified to deal with matters of education. They are concerned because it has been borne in upon them that Banffshire's education wings will be severely clipped if this formula is allowed to operate for any undue length of time.<br/>
Our teachers appreciate that in an area such as this, which is, naturally, devoid of industrial activity, education is the only door open to young people to make their way in the world if they are to realise their ambitions. They deplore any lessening of the educational standards, which is inevitable if the Government persist in this formula.<br/>
Decentralisation is a good thing, and no one could pay greater tribute than myself to the good that can come from decentralisation; but decentralisation must not be achieved at the expense of the range or quality of our education as we know it in Banffshire.<br/>
On the question of inducements for people to enter into local government with more enthusiasm, I think that it is not a very great inducement to the Banffshire County Council to realise that it has, perhaps, to do more work with less funds; more to do and less to do it with. The Minister must remove all these misgivings which we feel, and rightly feel. I sincerely trust there will be assurances from him concerning the Second Schedule which will enable me to support the Bill. If I cannot have those assurances, then I must take the other course.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Government can be particularly happy with the reception


that the Bill has had from their own side tonight. The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Duthie) has more or less repeated, in rather stronger terms, what the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) said earlier.<br/>
I want to refer in some detail to the case of Aberdeen, to show just what are its difficulties. Specific cases have been given concerning Banffshire, and I will give them for Aberdeen. If the Government have a case as strong on their side and they will give the specific figures, it would help us a great deal to see the picture in perspective. What we are lacking at the moment is a definition. No authority knows exactly where it stands on this question. I listened very carefully to the opening speech of the Secretary of State. He is the high priest of humbug. He talked about giving local authorities freedom, but later, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) said, he contradicted that by saying that if a local authority falls down on its job, then suitable provision is made in Clause 3. Presumably he does not trust local authorities. He does not allow them the freedom to do what he says the Bill allows them to do.<br/>
I shall confine my remarks to the Bill's effect on education. There is, I think, an amazing unanimity on this issue in the education world. Indeed, it is a remarkable achievement by the Government to get unanimity in the most unheard of places. I remember during the Suez debate when America and Russia actually came together against the British Government. This is a comparable achievement in the educational field, there being a coming together in opposing a Tory Government.<br/>
The Bill is a financial measure. Its title makes that clear. It makes Scotland wholly dependant on decisions which are made in England and Wales. Three times on page 2 of the Bill there is the expression that the Secretary of State will do this, that or the other thing:
<q>&#x2026; with the consent of the Treasury.</q>
That is bad enough with a strong Secretary of State, but with a weak one, as the <i>Scotsman</i> said some while ago:
<q>It is just too bad that so often there is a little evidence of a strong Scottish influence in the Cabinet or in any other Department in Whitehall.</q>

That is a typical masterpiece of understatement in which the <i>Scotsman</i> indulges.<br/>
Precisely because it is a financial Bill, the whole purpose of the exercise has to be seen in the context of the other financial measures which the Government have taken in recent months. It obviously involves a radical reduction in Treasury responsibility for education. I recall that when we had a Labour Government, the then Opposition made extravagant claims about what they would do to reduce Government expenditure when they got into power, and a lot of misguided people in the country believed it, and voted for them. When the Conservatives got into power, they found that they could make significant savings only by radical changes of policy, and this is one of those radical changes. If it does not mean decreased Treasury responsibility, then it runs counter to all the other financial measures which the Government have taken in recent months. If it does mean reduced Exchequer payments&#x2014;my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McInnes) quoted paragraph 17 of the White Paper which makes it clear that that is the object of the exercise&#x2014;then three choices are open to local education authorities.<br/>
First, they can continue development as before and finance the increased expenses involved exclusively from the rates; secondly, they can cut their service; thirdly, they can have a combination of the two. Clearly, the service most affected by the proposal is education and that, as has been said many times, is a developing service. We ought to have a statement from the Government that they are as determined as I hope this side of the House is to contribute a bigger proportion of the national income to education than has been done hitherto.<br/>
I have previously quoted these figures, and I repeat them. When we recall that in Britain as a whole we spend about &#x00A3;550 million on education and &#x00A3;1,800 million on drink and tobacco&#x2014;those were the figures last year&#x2014;I think that we have our priorities hopelessly wrong. Local authorities want more money, if only to pay the increased loan charges. In 1952&#x2013;53, the interest paid by local authorities for capital purposes was &#x00A3;683,000. In 1956&#x2013;57, the estimated figure is &#x00A3;1,903,000, which is very nearly a threefold increase in interest charges alone.<br/>
There are one or two specific points arising from the Bill with which I should like to deal. The first is that no authority can calculate accurately how much it will get. This is especially true in the counties. In the county burghs, more precision is possible. That is why I will quote Aberdeen. The figures were worked out by Aberdeen and some of them were quoted by the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South who has not been seen in the Chamber since. She said that last year under this proposal, if a block grant had been in operation. Aberdeen would have received &#x00A3;1,265,534. In fact, last year Aberdeen received &#x00A3;1,677,050 in respect of education alone, and in all, about &#x00A3;2 million from the Treasury.<br/>
Therefore, on the Government's own figures Aberdeen would have been &#x00A3;750,000 down. This year, Aberdeen's estimated expenditure upon education is up by &#x00A3;326,000, to a figure just over &#x00A3;3 million. The Government's estimated contribution to that is just under &#x00A3;2 million. Therefore, if Aberdeen is to continue to make the progress that it has been making, the net share of the additional cost chargeable to the rates must be &#x00A3;87,000.<br/>
Aberdeen will receive from the Exchequer Equalisation Fund the sum of &#x00A3;69,000&#x2014;I understand that this is the first time that the city has participated&#x2014;and a rate increase of 1s. has, therefore, been imposed. That increase would have been much bigger if the percentage grant had not been available. In fact, the more that Aberdeen expands its education service&#x2014;this argument applies to all other authorities which are progressive in education&#x2014;the greater will be the gap between the block grant and the expenditure, and, accordingly, the greater will be the rate burden. In fact, the laggards or wooden-tops will be rewarded and the progressive authorites penalised.<br/>
As the right hon. Gentleman will admit, Aberdeen has been one of the pacemakers in education. Its expenditure on education has been rising at an average rate of 10&#x2013;15 per cent. per year. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not deplore that fact; indeed, one of the arguments of the Government is that education has been making considerable progress under the existing system. If we compare the figures for Aberdeen with those for Edinburgh we find that in 1956&#x2013;57 the expenditure on education per 1,000 of the

population in Labour-controlled Aberdeen was about 40 per cent. higher than it was in Tory-controlled Edinburgh, it being &#x00A3;5,030 per 1,000 in Aberdeen as against &#x00A3;3,665 in Edinburgh.<br/>
I am asking whether Aberdeen or Banffshire is an exceptional case. If so, the Government should bring forward their own specific case to show the positive advantage to be derived from the operation of the Bill. The basis of the right hon. Gentleman's argument is that this is another version of the slogan, "Set the people free." That is indeed, the gist of the general argument advanced in support of the Bill.<br/>
Local authorities seem strangely reluctant to accept the freedom offered to them. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central asked why we should not extend that freedom to the other services; police, housing, roads&#x2014;the lot. Why do not the Government provide complete freedom in regard to those services? Or is this a transitional process? Shall we eventually reach the position when complete freedom will be given in respect of such services as the police and Civil Defence?<br/>
I say that, whether we like it or not, we do not have an informed democracy. Many people on local authorities are not fitted to control the education service, which I regard as being sufficiently important to be recognised as a national service. The central Government should provide increased finance and exercise increased control of the service.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's charge that we do not trust local authorities, and that he is giving them freedom, has no strength. The education service should be recognised as a national service and financed, upon an increasing scale, as such. I wonder how much control of expenditure on education Russian local authorities have. I am not saying that we want a comparable system, but we want comparable results if we can get them. The Bill goes the wrong way about getting them.</p>

<p>I am saying that the subject of education engenders very little political enthusiasm, and that there are people on local authorities who just want


to see this type of green light in order to take the opportunity of cutting back expenditure or retarding progress.

<p>The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. Hamilton) referred to two points which were mentioned earlier by one of his hon. Friends. He asked why the police and road services should not be included in this freedom. On reflection, I think he would agree that these are somewhat different problems. The police and the Civil Defence services, for example, cover a wide field, and it would be very difficult to find a common factor which could be applied in respect of grants. That question might well be taken up in Committee, but from what little experience I have had I feel sure that these would be difficult matters to divide up, as is done in the case of education and certain other services.<br/>
The subject that we are debating tonight is one of the most important that has come before us for a very long time. It raises a problem which affects the general life of Scotland and its government, and it is therefore one that we should examine with the greatest care. I do not regret the animated debate that we have had, and I do not suppose that my right hon. Friend objects to the criticisms which have been made, because they show that the House recognises the extreme importance of the matter.<br/>
In Scotland, we are concerned only with the finance of local authorities. England has the broader problem of the constitution of the authorities themselves. That issue does not arise in Scotland, and to that extent our problem is fortunately more limited. With us the issue is confined, broadly, to the question of the kind of change that we should make in financing local services.<br/>
It is no use belittling the anxiety which exists throughout Scotland about the growing burden of the cost of these local services. They have been expanding year by year, and have done so since

the war at a terrific and unprecedented rate. As we have heard, the burden of rates has doubled and trebled. The weight of the local public debt has grown to such a degree as to give responsible people cause for real anxiety.<br/>
When we add to all this the great increase in central Government taxation, particularly indirect taxation, we realise that it is a problem affecting every citizen in the country and may be regarded as one of the greatest problems of our time. The burden of taxation is so great as to be an encumbrance on industry which we cannot much longer sustain, and when we talk of the burden of rates and taxes we are discussing a matter of very great importance.<br/>
Naturally the question arises&#x2014;it was put by the hon. and learned Member for Paisley (Mr. D. Johnston)&#x2014;whether the resources of the local authorities are the right ones. The hon. and learned Member expressed what I suppose can be only a personal opinion when he said that he thought the present method of financing local authorities was outmoded and would have to be replaced by something else. Apparently the hon. and learned Member had in mind a local income tax. We must not take the hon. and learned Member's suggestion too seriously, because clearly it does not represent the considered view of his party. Speaking officially from the Opposition Front Bench in a debate last week the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren) was emphatic about this. He said:
<q>I agree at once with the Minister that the additional forms of income which have been examined&#x2014;entertainment tax, hotel tax, shopping tax and the rest&#x2014;do not fill the Bill. Each would assist the authorities which already have fairly substantial resources but would not help those with few resources. As the Minister said, we must stick to rates and grants."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th December, 1957; Vol. 579, c. 1018.]</q>
I take that to be the official policy of the Opposition, and if that is so hon. Members opposite must accept the general financial principles underlying this Bill; so upon that we apparently are agreed.</p>

<p>Would the hon. Baronet agree that that was said in a particular context, and applies to England and Wales? Regarding Scotland, we had the opportunity as did the Government supported by the hon. Baronet in the prescription of the terms of reference of the


Sorn Committee to ask for a wider inquiry. Had we taken evidence on a wider scale and gone into the matter more thoroughly, we might not now be discussing the question of rates, but some other matter allied to the raising of money.</p>

<p>That may be, and it is, a fascinating problem. I am stating now that, as I understand it, hon.

<p>I do not propose to be put off by quibbles of that kind.<br/>
I am concerned about the point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Paisley, whether local authority services should be financed by a local income tax or something of that kind, and I am saying that that is not the official Opposition policy. The official policy of the Opposition, and of the Government, is that the main sources of income for local authorities shall continue to be rates and central Government grants. That is all I am saying, and I stand by it.<br/>
The question really is, how do we determine the balance of grants and the rates between these two sources of income? I have been a Member of this House for quite a long time and I recollect a number of occasions&#x2014;particularly during the time of Mr. Tom Johnston&#x2014;when we considered that if there are two bodies, two sources, providing the finances of an undertaking&#x2014;the central Government and a local authority&#x2014;it is a good principle to throw as much responsibility for payment as possible on the body which actually spends the money. I do not think that anybody objects to that principle.</p>

<p>I think that the services with which we are here mainly concerned are services where that principle should apply. Education, which is the chief service, as we are all agreed, works on the principle that the local authority provides 40 per cent. and the central Government 60 per cent. of the expenditure and, of course, other services have other percentages of expenditure. We have all had experience, either as Members of the central Government or as members of a local authority, and I do not think that any of us would deny that if it is only 40 per cent. with which the local authority is concerned, the authority feels more free in proposing considerable expenditure than would be the case were it, for example, responsible for 60 per cent. So the principle of bearing a heavy responsibility for payment is important.</p>

<p>I will develop that argument, but before doing so I wish for a moment to examine the question of the actual amount of grant which will flow to the local authorities under the provisions of the Bill.<br/>
One of the main criticisms before the Bill was published was that the amounts to be provided by the central Government were to be cut down or frozen. I suggest that our debate so far has disproved that. When one examines Clause 2 with care it becomes plain that, in arriving at the grant to be given to Scottish authorities in bulk, the considerations which have to be taken into account are such that the grant cannot possibly be less than it is now; and there is every likelihood, as I read the Clause, that it will be greater and will meet the needs of expanding services such as education&#x2014;</p>

<p>If the hon. Member will allow me to make my speech, it will be quite short and, I hope, quite uncontroversial; but I have a view to put. I am suggesting to the House and to the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn), who has great experience in this matter, that if

he had this Measure as an Act before him and it insisted upon taking account of Clause 2, he would not find it possible to do the things his hon. Friends are afraid might be done.<br/>
I invite the House to examine these matters with greater care. I will not take up further time on this particular point, but I contend that Clause 2 contains so many carefully worded provisions that there should be no fear of a reduction in the grant for education. On the contrary, there is every justification and assurance, quite apart from the speech of my right hon. Friend, that that great, necessary, expanding service will continue to be supported in an expanding way.</p>

<p>Even assuming for the moment the attitude of the hon.

<p>I am surprised that the right hon. Member says that, because he knows as well as I do&#x2014;and as was repeated by my right hon.

I speak, I hope, as a patriotic Scotsman and I say I am not a bit sorry that the formula is not incorporated in this Bill. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will see, as would the right hon. Member, that we get our full share, but that share should be arrived at by consideration of our needs and not by the consideration of a dead formula. How often have I heard the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) talking about the road programme and saying that the consideration should be based on our needs. So it is with education and other services.</p>

<p>He is quite wrong and I invite him to look up the facts. By and large, and I include and specify education in my inclusion, we should be considerably worse off under the Goschen formula than now. I should like the hon. Member to check his facts, because what he said is quite wrong. It is clear, at least to my understanding of this matter, that the Government undertake in introducing this Bill that there shall be no freezing of Government grants for these services or any unwillingness to assist proper and well-considered developments in future. I do not think the run of the debate has challenged or overturned that view.<br/>
The main criticism in the debate has centred upon the twin issues of whether it is right and wise in the national interest to throw upon local authorities the full responsibility for spending all their income, and whether in so doing we will thereby increase the freedom and efficiency of local authority administration and in consequence stimulate and excite local interest in the work they now do.<br/>
In dealing with these matters we are dealing with human beings. The personal factor enters all the time into the composition of local authorities and the energy they apply. We all know that there are very different authorities throughout Scotland. Some are progressive, enlightened and responsible and some are not to the same extent. It is quite clear that as the Bill takes shape and action follows upon it there will be variations in the activities and successes of local authorities. Similarly, as in Aberdeen, the financial situation at first may appear different in one district compared with another. These are the growing pains of a new system, but I feel fairly sure from what little experience I have had that in future, as at present, we will see generally a steady rising of the standards of local authority administration as a result of this Measure.<br/>
What about the problem of freedom? Freedom goes with responsibility. To examine that I take the case of education, mentioned by the hon. Member for Fife, West, who is an educational expert and who, with respect, I congratulate on his knowledge of this matter. He knows as well as I do, although I do not think the hon. and learned Member for Paisley who opened the debate understands, that education and the education service in the County of Fife or anywhere else does not perform a single routine job. The service of education is an infinite variety of services, as everyone must know.<br/>
I will list two or three of the different things which are the concern of the director of education for the County of Fife. He is concerned with school building, school repairs, curriculum, methods of teaching, further education, classes&#x2014;a hundred and one different things which all come under the broad umbrella of "education". For years past the Secretary of State has had his code laying down the standards under which the administration is carried out in the schools. That code will continue, but with the general grant at the beginning of a one-year or two-year period, rather than a series of percentage grants after the work has been done, it seems to me that opportunity will arise for the expression in various local authorities of preferences for individual developments which at present they are not able to undertake.<br/>
I have a little knowledge of that and I ask the House seriously to consider it. I assure hon. Members that, so far as I understand the situation, if this scheme were in operation and a county council had the assurance at the beginning of the period of one year or two years that a certain amount of money was available to the county authority, the education committee would be able to undertake many tasks which it is not able to do now and, maybe, to hold back others. It would take a broader view. For example, inflation is a matter of supreme concern to county council convenors. Every convenor will be considering priorities. In Fife we have decided that that should be so, and Fife is not a Tory county council.<br/>
The Fife convenor had said that it is the duty of the county council to reconsider its priorities. Is not that right? Might it not be, therefore, that with this


block grant the authority will, for the first time, consider its services as one great undertaking and not as a series of separate, individual undertakings&#x2014;education, health, whatever it may be? I see the finance committee of the county council&#x2014;indeed, the whole county council&#x2014;for the first time getting this broad picture of its responsibility, and saying to itself: "What is the prime need of our county at this time?" If that prime need is hampered, manacled as it were by percentage grants, the judgment of the authority is bound to be warped: but if the authority has this general grant&#x2014;&#x00A3;500,000, &#x00A3;1 million, &#x00A3;2 million, whatever the sum may be&#x2014;and knows that it can spend it as it thinks right in its wisdom, it must be good for local government, and must stimulate interest.<br/>
I am sure that there will be tremendous discussion between one county council committee and another, but we should not be afraid of that. We should welcome it. If it were so now in Fife, the whole county would be much more interested in the work of the authority than it is today. It is because things so often go through county councils with so little interest or discussion&#x2014;tied as they all are to the present grants&#x2014;that there is so much apathy among electors. I believe that if they are given a chance to operate this scheme, those local authorities that are now so reluctant to see its advantages will thank heaven that they are being given the chance to undertake it. It may well be in fact that my right hon. Friend may go down in history as one of the great Scottish Secretaries for this work that he has done.</p>

<p>I believe that the hon. Baronet the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Henderson-Stewart) will, as long as he is alive, always epitomise the spirit of George Orwell. That is my impression after listening to his latest speech. I want to be respectful to him, but the amount of double talk there has been is confusing. If we take his point, not the one about the present Secretary of State being one of the great ones&#x2014;I would not be discourteous enough to discuss that at present&#x2014;but the one about priorities, he has tried to argue that these services, because of the block grants, will have committee against committee and that this is a good way of

getting local authorities to determine the priority of the services.<br/>
I should like to ask the hon. Baronet, as someone so much interested in education, whether he really believes that local government, with all its various interests, will find a proper place for education in almost every instance?</p>

<p>The hon. Baronet says that he does. In education in Scotland we have seen a substantial variation in practice between authorities, some advancing reasonable programmes and others very unreasonable ones.<br/>
I do not want to argue the generalities of this. I want to concentrate on a specific issue that the hon. Baronet and I know very well. If other hon. Members do not know about it, I am sure that they receive enough letters about it, and will, therefore, be able to follow my argument on this isolated point. I want to speak about student grants. I argue not whether the grants are good or bad, not their general level, but simply the practice in the award of student grants.<br/>
Under the present system in Scotland it is possible for two boys, coming from families with similar incomes and with similar family commitments, sitting in the same class in the same university, with precisely the same educational qualifications, to get different grants. One can get half as much again as the other, and the only reason is that they happen to live in different counties.<br/>
The present Regulations lay it down that, in awarding a grant to a student, a committee shall be guided by certain principles; and that within the seven categories of assessment, three are precise minimum categories laid down by the Secretary of State, and the four others are categories where the discretion of the committee can be exercised. The hon. Baronet knows this very well, because on many occasions he has answered Questions that I have put to him, and, indeed, when Joint Under-Secretary of State, he was kind enough to write me a very long letter in which he made it perfectly clear that the practice of education committees varied substantially, and, while one might hold one's own opinions of the awards that were made by committees, there was no doubt that certain students were getting a tiny grant, and certainly not


getting the justice that many of their confreres from other counties were receiving.<br/>
How will that be affected by this Bill? Will it mean that the members of the committees will be encouraged to make awards higher than the present ones? In other words, will there be a move towards justice? There might be, in the sense of an equality of misery, as committees seek to cut down the amount of money given. For example, when the committees sit to discuss the, various grants, and there is a discriminatory point, and they have to save money, clearly they will use that point to save money.<br/>
At one juncture I brought up with the hon. Baronet the question of certain textbooks, and he was kind enough to look into the matter of supplying textbooks for various students. The fact is that there are some authorities&#x2014;I think that he would agree with me in supporting those authorities&#x2014;which award the cost of certain prescribed textbooks to certain students. Some authorities do not, because the minimum Regulations do not necessarily prescribe in exact terms the awards that can be given in this regard. I think that, clearly, this is an educational matter that will be substantially affected by the Bill.<br/>
The Secretary of State tried to argue, in his opening remarks, that these minimum standards would be preserved by Clause 3. To a certain extent, that is true. It also means that the Secretary of State cannot do without Clause 3 because he recognises that certain authorities would not obey the minimum standards. Why should it be that local authorities have to have such a sanction Clause as that put against them? The answer is clear. It is because there are some local authorities&#x2014;shame on them&#x0021;&#x2014;which would not observe the minimum standards. Therefore, there has to be this sanction upon them. Surely he will be willing to admit the argument that follows from that, that since the minimum is not necessarily the only desirable scheme it follows that we are anxious to see that all authorities shall provide the desirable, where possible, and not just the minimum.<br/>
Perhaps the hon. Baronet believes, as he said, that there would be no difference here in the moneys given to local authorities, that this situation may not arise, but for one, cannot believe that local

authorities will be taken out of the wood financially by the passage of this Bill. I believe that in the oncoming years we have to face a margin of rising costs. As long as we have full employment, it appears at present that we shall always have a tendency for the value of money to fall. Although it is certainly the duty of Governments to stabilise it, I do not think that they can always guarantee a plateau&#x2014;the Prime Minister's ambition at one time&#x2014;of money value. We shall have this tendency for the value of money to drop, which means an increasing embarrassment for local authorities, particularly in the light of what is, in effect, the strait-jacket of the block grant. Even if the grant is reviewed in two years, it can, nevertheless, be a serious embarrassment to local authorities. If it is an embarrassment to these authorities, it means that, instead of being compelled by the nation, by the Scottish people themselves, to observe certain standards with the enticement of the percentage grant system, they have the freedom to select their own priorities. Does the hon. Baronet believe that there are not authorities in Scotland which will neglect the interests of education?<br/>
I want to make a very important point about education that has been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) in relation to this debate. The Bill, which concerns itself so much with local authority services&#x2014;and so much is affected in our system of education&#x2014;comes at a time when the Prime Minister is unable to be in the House because he is discussing in Paris, with fifteen member-Governments of the N.A.T.O. alliance, the question of technical advance and technical skill in the Atlantic Community. The Bill is a "pre-Sputnik" Bill, a Bill designed to face a situation which existed before the Russian technological advance made itself so demonstrably plain to us all ten weeks ago.<br/>
Instead of education being just one matter among the others in local government service, and the people in local government themselves being able to decide whatever priority they like to apply to it, education has suddenly become a matter of the greatest priority for the nation. It is now the greatest challenge which this or any other Government will have to face. I remember very well the


debate on the White Paper on Technical Education, and I am willing to accept that hon. Members on all sides believed what they said then, that the country has a tremendous challenge to face. Even the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his recent economy measures, did not touch the technical education programme; even he hesitated to cut down that programme, which we know is in many ways, even in Scotland, inadequate to our needs. The Bill now before us could, in Scotland, be very damaging to the number of students we have and, certainly, to the quality of education they receive.<br/>
In order to square its police account or its fire service deficit&#x2014;whatever it may me&#x2014;a local authority might well consider manoeuvring itself into a position where it received the full grant but did not have the requisite number of teachers or the number of obligations for certain other services within education. That might happen. There is no reason why the functioning of education could not proceed thus. It is reasonable to argue that the Bill transfers the control of education primarily from the nation and the education committee to the gentlemen of the county finance committee, and we know what niggardly little men some of those county finance committee men may be. We have only to look at some of the counties in Scotland to see that.<br/>
Reasonable arguments may be put forward, perhaps, for places like Ross and Cromarty, or Banff, as the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Duthie) himself mentioned; they have their own peculiar difficulties. But there are powerful authorities in the central belt of Scotland which have a poor record in education. The hon. Member for Fife, East knows that as well as I do, and he knows in his heart that he could name them. It is not because they do not have the money, but because they do not have the will. We see this kind of discrepancy in grants all over the country, in many other ways, which I am sure educationalists could cite.</p>

The hon. Member for Fife, East, in argument with my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser), said that the percentage grants were not being abolished. Surely, he means that they are not, in effect, being abolished. Clause 1&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes. That comment, from which I am glad to find that the hon. Member for Fife, East, if he did make it, now retreats, follows the same line of argument which he put forward about the Goschen formula. It is entertaining to hear all these pronouncements and then watch the retreats which follow them, but it does not do justice to the argument which is advanced at the particular time.<br/>
It seems to me a very great tragedy that a Bill like this should be before the House at this time, a tragedy not only from the educational standpoint but also in that the Bill will go to a Scottish Standing Committee which may well not include all the Scottish Members of the House. Whatever our views may be on this matter, there is no doubt that what is proposed in the Bill radically affects every Member of Parliament representing a Scottish constituency. I believe that there is not a single hon. Member who could not make a speech on this matter showing how it affects his own community and how, in the long run, it will


upset the balance of good local government. I cannot understand how it can be thought at all advisable for this matter to go to a truncated Committee which cannot represent the interests of all hon. Members who have these important matters to discuss.<br/>
Is it not unfair to claim that we have a crisis in local government finance which calls for a remedy of this kind when, in truth, the crisis has, to a large extent, been caused by Government policy? The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McInnes) talked about the rates being trebled since 1938, and the hon. Member for Fife, East spoke about the great alarm felt throughout industry and the community at the rising burden of taxation and rating. The fact is, however, that about &#x00A3;35 million have been added in the payment of interest on debts incurred by local authorities to the Government since 1951 as a simple consequence of the high interest rate policy pursued by the Government.<br/>
No matter how many Bills of this kind are introduced to try to solve the problems of local government finance in Scotland, we come back each time to the fact that the Government's economic policy dominates the scene, and in this, as in every other context, distorts the pattern of our democratic life.</p>

<p>Let us accept that straight away, that the hon. Member for Greenock and other hon. Members who spoke from the benches opposite this evening have taken the line that some

local authorities are both unable and unwilling to help education in the way that it ought to be helped. It has been rather striking that every hon. Member opposite who spoke has taken a line quite different&#x2014;I do not blame them&#x2014;from the line taken by the official spokesman speaking from the Front Bench opposite this afternoon.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Paisley (Mr. D. Johnston) said that not for years has there been proper local government in Scotland; that it has been only local administration. He deplored this, saying that it was a bad thing and that we ought to think again about local government, giving back some powers to local authorities. This from the spokesman of the party of centralisers. This from the spokesman of the party which took away the powers of local authorities in electricity and gas undertakings and all sorts of other ways. This from the party which has consistently maintained that the gentlemen in Whitehall know best.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, there has in Scotland, as there has throughout the United Kingdom, been a decline in the power of local authorities since the war and a decline in the interest taken in local government. There is not one of us in this House who does not know that it is becoming more and more difficult to get the right men and women to offer themselves to stand for local government bodies. It is a great pity. It is not only to do with the functions exercised by local authorities but is to do, to some extent, with economic pressures and difficulties of a private nature, and so on, but it is a fact. I was impressed by the statement of my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok (Mr. George) that in Scotland recently 60 per cent. of the local government returns were unopposed. That is not a good thing.<br/>
One remedy for the lack of interest in local affairs, for the lack of candidates and for the low polls at local elections, would be to grant to local authorities the kind of powers that might have had to be exercised by regions during the war had there been a complete break-up of the central Government administration owing to invasion or


intense bombing, against which we made plans.<br/>
If we were forced into a system of regionalisation, it would undoubtedly stimulate great interest in local government, because it would indeed be government which was local, and it would be the only kind of government known to the citizens of that part of Great Britain. None of us, however, wants to go as far as that, and for two reasons. Broadly, we want uniformity of service and we want the safeguards to progress which can only be ensured by Government oversight of the strategy of policy. An alternative would be to take the first step towards a substantial move over to treating local authorities as grown-up beings. That is what the Government are doing in the Bill.<br/>
I was very impressed by my right hon. Friend's revelations in his opening speech this afternoon that two-thirds of all the help given to local authorities in Scotland is in the form of percentage grants.</p>

<p>The figures differ, of course, between counties of cities and the counties. They differ very much between the counties themselves.<br/>
The figures were given in a Written Answer to a Question which is printed in the OFFICIAL REPORT of 25th November this year, from which it will be seen that of 31 counties in Scotland, no less than 13 had over 60 per cent. of their expenditure met by Government grants. In the case of three of them, the percentage of expenditure received in grants from the Government exceeds 75 per cent.</p>

<p>We are all aware of that. It is only fair that the hon. Member should name those counties so that the House should realise how exceptional they are.</p>

<p>The three counties are Zetland, Ross and Cromarty, and Sutherland. There is nothing extraordinary about that. These counties all happen to have between 75 and 79 per cent. of their expenditure met, or had it met in the last year for which figures are available, by Government grants.<br/>
In these circumstances, human nature being what it is, there is on all local authorities, and particularly on those which receive a high percentage of their expenditure in the form of Government grants, a temptation to spend lavishly so as to have the satisfaction of being thought to be progressive and enlightened. That was illustrated not many minutes ago, when the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. Hamilton) spoke about some local authorities being progressive and enlightened and the others being wooden-heads and laggards. The kind of test that the hon. Member would apply is, I have no doubt, the extent to which they spend other people's money in the service of the population whom they represent.<br/>
I would be against a system in which there is a general grant based on existing expenditure. In fact, what the Government propose is not that it should be based on existing expenditure, but that it should be based, first, on the needs of the area. These are set out clearly in Clause 2 of the Bill, of the contents of which we cannot too frequently remind ourselves.<br/>
First, the Government have to take into consideration the latest information available about the rate of expenditure in the local authority area and the current level of prices, costs and remuneration, together with any future variation in the level which can be foreseen. Secondly, in assessing what the total of the general grant should be, they have to take into account any probable fluctuation in the demand for the services; and, thirdly, the need for developing these services.<br/>
These factors are particularly relevant to the expenditure upon education, it has already been said today that it is no good blinking the fact that organised education throughout Scotland is against the proposals in the Bill. That is unfortunate and it is, I think, largely because insufficient weight has been given to the provisions of Clause 2. For example, in assessing the general grant, the Government have to take into account the present expenditure on education and the possible fluctuations in needs so that the "bulge"&#x2014;the raising of the school population&#x2014;is taken account of, together with the need for developing the service. We all know&#x2014;the Government have emphasised it time and time again&#x2014;how important it is that education should


develop progressively, particularly nowadays, as more than one hon. Member has said this afternoon, in its technical aspects.<br/>
I should like to ask these questions. Do educationists really think that education can be run better from St. Andrew's House than from the council chamber? The hon. Member for Greenock quite clearly believes that education is run better from St. Andrew's House. That is, again, the mentality of "the gentlemen in Whitehall know best". Secondly, is it the belief of educationists that locally elected representatives of the people are not capable of running the schools properly? If so, if they really believe that, they are condemning themselves for a failure to educate the people in the importance of education.<br/>
Are educationists afraid that in circumstances where local authorities will have the most animated discussions in the council chamber concerning the relative needs of education, housing, health, and so on, education will inevitably suffer? The majority of electors are parents. Do educationists really believe that they will put up with a council which neglects the needs of education for their children?</p>

<p>I have not that mistrust of local government which educationists are displaying at present. I want to give the local authorities more scope to decide how the proceeds of the rates and of the general grant should be spent. I want them to explain and to defend their proposals not only in open council reported fully, but to the electors who send them back to the council chamber. I believe that in that way local government will be government and will attract a lively interest in local affairs.<br/>
It has been fashionable tonight on both sides of the House, I am sorry to say, to criticise the Government for presenting this Bill. I do not do that, and I am sorry that so many of my hon. Friends have taken the occasion of this debate to make their criticism&#x2014;though, of course, it is right if they feel that way. For my part, I think that the Government have shown great courage and sound sense in going ahead with what they believe to be right in spite of opposition in influential quarters. If one has made up one's mind to do what the national interests require

it is right to stand up to sectional interests however respectable those sectional interests may be. So I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Government upon their courage and wisdom in presenting it.</p>

<p>It is surprising that the hon. Member for North Angus (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley) welcomes controversy about education in council chambers, but seems to deplore it when it comes from his hon. Friends in this Chamber. He made a fascinating speech, containing all the usual phrases about freedom and greater scope for this and that, but I began to wonder what it had to do with the Bill. I do not want to do the hon. Gentleman an injustice, for he is one of the few hon. Members opposite who read Bills, but I began to wonder whether he had read this one.<br/>
The hon. Member said that we on this side of the House are the party of centralisation, and he repeatedly posed the question whether education is better run from St. Andrew's House than from a local council chamber. Can it be? What does the Bill say? It says that the Government are going out of their way to amend Section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1946. The Fourth Schedule says that the head man at St. Andrew's House, the Secretary of State.
<q>may make regulations prescribing the standards to which every education authority shall conform in exercising their functions under this section.</q></p>

<p>Whether the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Henderson-Stewart) believes it or not, this is something new to be put into the 1946 Act, for the Fourth Schedule writes those words into the 1946 Act as a new subsection in Section 1.<br/>
That Schedule also proposes to write into the Act of 1946 default powers, so that if the Secretary of State does not think a local authority has done the right thing he at St. Andrew's House, the great centraliser, can require the local authority to do it. Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that a local authority can at present, if it likes, contribute to the expenditure of a university? But not after this Bill passes. After this Bill


passes, with this and other amendments which the Bill makes to the present law, the Secretary of State will decide whether and when and how much a local authority will contribute to a university. The great centraliser will do that.<br/>
There is one thing about which I do agree with the hon. Member for Fife, East, and that is that this is one of the most important Scottish Bills we have had in recent years; and we have had one or two important ones in the last Session or two. It will affect every person in Scotland, the ratepayers, the taxpayers, parents and children. It will affect even births, marriages and deaths.<br/>
I counsel my hon. Friends that this Bill will be considered by a Committee in which back bench Members will be denied their right to speak for their constituents. I am hoping to find a great wave of self-denial amongst some of my hon. Friends in opting out of serving on the Committee on this Bill; but we shall see about that.<br/>
I do not think that there has been an adequate analysis of the problems of local government, certainly not by the Secretary of State. We are told that one of the reasons for the Bill is that
<q>The total of grants has in recent post-war years for the first time overtaken the total of rates, and become the major element in local government finance. &#x2026; It is most important to reduce this dependence of local government on Exchequer grants if it can possibly be done.</q>
The hon. Gentleman was right when he posed the question about the Exchequer grant and the rates, but he did not go nearly far enough.<br/>
How has the matter arisen? Local authorities existed before a properly established central authority. The local authorities carried on and developed their traditional rights as almost independent governments within their localities. The growth of central Government has been such that the Government have had to find agencies to carry out work for national needs. The agencies they found were the local authorities. So the local authorities have had two functions. One is to carry on their old, traditional, independent local government, many of the functions of which have grown into national functions. For instance, the care of the sick has ceased to be a local responsibility and

has become a national responsibility. Thus the local authorities act as agents for the Government, the second of their two functions.<br/>
There are two aspects of the freedom of local authorities about which there is so much talk. There is the freedom from statutory control. It is no good the Government's passing Bills about education unless they take statutory powers to ensure that what they want done will be carried out throughout the country. If they take that very far they have to pay their share of the cost of it.<br/>
The same thing is true of the other services listed for Exchequer grant&#x2014;health services, fire services. There was no statutory obligation relating to fire services before the war. Will anyone say that it is not necessary? Let him come to South Ayrshire and to the town of Girvan. A few years ago there was not a town hall or a railway station because there was not a fire brigade. They did not believe in providing money for a fire brigade. Other services are for road safety, school crossing patrols, physical training&#x2014;but they are only some of them. The question arises how these are to be paid for.<br/>
Old, independent local authorities' revenues are not as they were. Once upon a time the wealth of a man determined the value of the property he occupied. The wealthier a man was the bigger was his house, and the local authority levied a rate accordingly. That is not so today. We have had this change in population, in the wealth of the country and in the revenue of the country. What has caused it? The tendency nowadays is not for the wealthy man to live in the biggest house because of the change in social environments. He lives in a house that can be managed. Directors of companies are living in much smaller houses than foremen.<br/>
There are parts of Scotland where people living in council houses are paying higher rates than the people who employ them. The point has been made that rates have only doubled and that national taxation, including indirect taxation, has gone up much more. That is because national taxation is based on national income and the national income has risen much more than the rateable values.<br/>
When we examine this matter what do we find? In one investigation it was


found that 88 per cent. of local revenue gained through rates comes from households where, after taxation, the income was &#x00A3;500. In other words, generally speaking the poorer people are paying the greater share of local taxation. The people who can afford to pay Income Tax and Surtax are not paying the most.<br/>
Contrary to what the hon. Member for North Angus has said, we have loaded the local authorities with tremendous powers and responsibilities, to such an extent that they are complaining about it and cannot possibly finance it out of an outmoded system of raising revenue and taxation. I think that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. D. Johnston) was right to deal with this point at the start, because it is fundamental. We accept that it has to be dealt with by rates and taxation. We do not say that the ratepayer should pay a higher share than at present. Everything goes to prove that national revenue should pay a higher share in respect of national services than ever before. This is the parting of the ways. If the burden is shifted, and legislation is passed which will enable the burden to be shifted, it means that local revenues will be raised in many cases for national purposes. Education is a national purpose.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock (Dr. Dickson Mabon), in a thoughtful speech, quoted the case of technical education, an expanding service. It is a national service and it is unfair to pass legislation which will enable that to be put on the shoulders of local ratepayers to the benefit of those who should bear the greater responsibility.<br/>
I expected this from the Secretary of State. There never has been a confidence trickster who proclaimed his confidence trick to the people he proposed to dupe. There have always been high-sounding phrases concealing the true purpose and this Bill is, to my mind, a cowardly confidence trick.<br/>
We are told that the Bill seeks to provide for the freedom of the local authority and for a greater measure of control. Two things determine that freedom&#x2014;the financing and the statutory powers. One can tinker as much as one likes with the finance and shift the burden from one side to the other, but the statutory powers remain and have been

reinforced by the Bill. If the Kilmarnock or Ayr County Council decides to build five new schools they will still have to go to St. Andrew's House and to the Minister, the great centraliser. He will still either authorise it or not. If we want to develop something new and something that has not been allowed before, would they be allowed to do it under this Measure?</p>

But it has always been proposed in order to save money; and that has been said. The May Committee, the Geddes Committee, and the rest have declared that the purpose was to save money.<br/>
When the White Paper on Local Government Finance in Scotland was introduced, I think it was <i>The Times,</i> in a leading article, which said that the White Paper meant sense only if the Government were determined to save money. Anyone who reads the White Paper and learns about all this manoeuvring as to what paragraph 17 says will appreciate that what is intended is to save money. This is a limited liability Bill for the Government, limiting their liability and not being concerned at all with what happens to local authorities.<br/>
As far as I can see, the only thing that can be saved to anyone by means of the Bill is the saving of a certain amount of checking up that is done in relation to the percentage grant, but we should not forget that in the calculation of the general grant there will be ever so much more checking up of details. The situation will be worse. All the fortune tellers in the country will be needed. A start will have to be made long beforehand on the calculations for the following year, but the grant determined by those calculations is to last at least two years and account must be taken of running costs.<br/>
How can those costs be calculated two years ahead? Those responsible will only know the cost for the previous year, and the cost for the following year will be based upon that. There will be a set of crystal-gazers in St. Andrew's House. I do not know how expensive they will be, but they certainly will be expensive for the ratepayers.<br/>
The Government, however, say that they have powers to make an interim payment. So they have. We shall see about that when we come to the Committee stage of the Bill. The Government

had better ask the farmers who have to haggle over and over again when the February Price Review comes round. Now we are to have a local authorities' price review, and how often have the farmers been able to persuade the Government that prices have gone up so much that they should have more assistance?<br/>
This is a really fantastic situation. It conceals the true intention to cut percentage grants, because this new scheme will limit the Government's liabilities. Why has the percentage grant always been favoured by the local authorities, and why have efforts to wipe it out been resisted even by Conservative Governments in the past? It is because percentage grants are grants for priorities. In an expanding service the only way of ensuring that a desired scheme is carried out is to give a percentage grant and to grade percentages according to priorities.<br/>
If we are really interested in education we must be concerned about this. We are dealing with &#x00A3;36 million of grants for Scotland, of which &#x00A3;33 million are due to education. Now all the facets of education are determined and controlled by the great centraliser and the high authority who used to be concerned with that kind of duty in another sphere. He is now back on this duty in St. Andrew's House.<br/>
Let us face the fact that money can be saved under the general grant system, but the only people who can save money are those who are doing more than the great centraliser lays down. And they can save money only by reducing standards. This proposal is a reward for people who reduce standards and a penalty for those who raise them. But the great centraliser himself will not be concerned with anything other than the minimum. He will be concerned purely and simply with saving money; and this at a time when education and its expansion is of such importance to the nation in increasing its preparedness and fitness for the new technical age.<br/>
Here we have a Government deciding in this sinister and underhand way to limit their liabilities and hand over to local authorities, saying to them, "You carry on with it. You increase your payments in relation to education", knowing quite well that, with the revenue-raising


structure which the Government have left to them, those authorities just cannot do it.<br/>
One of the reasons for the frustration in local government at present is the fact that local authorities cannot now finance the burdens which they carry. Hon. Members opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot say, "We are giving freedom to the local authorities; we can trust them", and at the same time, say to them, "You spend such and such an amount, knowing that someone else is paying two-thirds of it." The present situation is such that they cannot afford to increase their rates with the one-third which they will have to pay from the general rate.<br/>
This Bill is a confidence trick. It is a shabby confidence trick. I hope sincerely that those hon. Gentlemen opposite who have the well-being of Scotland at heart will unite with us tonight to determine that we shall have fair play for the local authorities of Scotland in the work they are doing in respect of education and all the other things that will be jeopardised by the Bill.</p>

<p>I have had the privilege of hearing every speech delivered in the House today, and I must confess that never in all my twelve and a half years' membership of this House have I heard a Bill so manhandled by both sides. On the Government side only two speeches have been made in unqualified support of the Bill, and if the Secretary of State were to give the least consideration to the attitude of the House and to the opinions which have been expressed on both sides, if he were to behave in a democratic fashion, only one course would be open to him, and that would be to rise when I finish and say that he proposes to withdraw this piece of legislation.<br/>
Earlier in the day&#x2014;and it seems more than a day; it feels more like a week&#x2014;I heard the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) saying that she would put the point of view of Aberdeen before the House and that it was one which, without qualification, was; hostile to the Government. I want to give the House also, so far as I have ascertained it, the point of view of my own local authority. It is imperative that hon. Members should take note of

the views of their local authorities and give expression to them here.<br/>
My own local authority submitted the consideration of this Bill to a subcommittee, which came strongly to the opinion that these proposals are completely unacceptable, in that they will greatly increase the financial difficulties already facing local authorities, and will operate to the serious detriment of the development of social and other services in the city. The sub-committee, therefore, called upon the Government not to proceed with legislation concerning the proposals.<br/>
In reaching that decision the special sub-committee was guided and helped by four local authority officials of distinction which I think is not excelled in the whole of the United Kingdom. The subcommittee had the views of the City Assessor, the City Chamberlain, the Director of Education and, perhaps chief of all, the Town Clerk. The views of those four distinguished officials were clear. They felt that the Bill would be detrimental in every aspect to the interests of the City of Glasgow. Those are views which this House cannot afford to ignore.<br/>
In the course of the debate a great deal of play has been made with the statement of the Secretary of State that the underlying purpose of the Bill is to give local authorities more independence. I take it that means more independence from the operations of the Secretary of State. I have taken the trouble to look through one or two other Bills in addition to this one. If one does it, even casually, it will be found that, in relation to the local authorities, the Secretary of State has power to direct them, to instruct them, to determine their course of action, to require of them what they shall do. He has power to decide what shall he done in certain circumstances. He has power to estimate and certify. He has power to make regulations and he has power to fix. My goodness&#x0021; He is fairly fixing the local authorities now.</p>

<p>Earlier today my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) inadvertently referred to Mr. Speaker as Mr. Scotland. Mr. Scotland, with a tremendous array of powers, sits opposite in the guise of the Secretary of


State. He can do anything he likes with any local authority in Scotland at the moment and he does not propose to divest himself of one of those powers and pass it to any local authority. Most of the arguments which he and other hon. Members opposite made about greater independence for local authorities were sheer humbug.<br/>
One of the fears which has been expressed by Glasgow is that the block grant will hinder the development of education. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) said, we are afraid of that because of our experience, because it has happened before. My hon. Friend mentioned the May Committee, and the Geddes Committee, but there was a third, the Ray Committee. Each of those used the block grant as a means of cutting expenditure.<br/>
As a result of the Report of the Geddes Committee, teachers in Scotland&#x2014;indeed, all over the United Kingdom&#x2014;suffered a 10 per cent. reduction in their salaries. That general cut was applied in Glasgow, which was then under a Tory majority which carried it a step further and imposed a further 3&#x00BE; per cent. cut. As a result of the application of the block grant in previous years, teachers' salaries and educational services were cut to a very serious extent.<br/>
That is one of the reasons why experience compels us to oppose this proposal. It is worth briefly enumerating some of the services which Glasgow educationists fear may be affected. I am now dealing not merely with the schools, but with the great services which are carried on outside ordinary school hours, the holiday camps, the residential schools, the junior clubs, the play centres, the further education centres, the adult education centres, the community clubs, the youth clubs, and services of that nature.<br/>
They are all absolutely essential in a modern community and yet they have been described by Glasgow Tories as mere fripperies. Those are the things which are absolutely essential to the growing and developing child. Those are the services which may be cut back by the introduction of the block grant. I ask the Joint Under-Secretary to say whether the milk and meals services will suffer any interference; whether the milk service

will continue to receive a 100 per cent. grant.<br/>
I should like to explore the position of nursery schools a little further, because the Joint Under-Secretary and I have been in communication on this matter. I want to say that he was quite helpful. These schools play a tremendously important part in the most formative years of a child's life. Viscount Falkland, a former governor of Wandsworth Prison, said that in his twenty years' experience of that great gaol he had come to the conclusion that the first six years of a person's life were far more important than the next sixty. He said that criminals were made in the cradle.<br/>
This is the service which we are now starving in our schools, because the City of Glasgow has 52,000 children between the ages of two and five and it has only forty-one schools to deal with them while their mothers are at work&#x2014;forty-one schools that have 1,600 of these children on the roll. There are 52,000 of them and if Glasgow had to deal with even half of that large number, it would need immediately 420 schools, assuming that the other 26,000 little tots could be properly cared for by other means. That is a service for which in the Report on Education, which we discussed recently, the Government could only say that last year one new nursery school was built. I do not want to go much further on that point, but it is an important fundamental service, and one that we ought to be thinking of expanding from its present inadequate state. Instead of that, it looks as if it is to contract it further.<br/>
I should like to deal briefly with another problem which has been mentioned tonight. That is the problem of technological education. I ask the Secretary of State again: what is to be the position of technical education in these new proposals? The first intention was altogether to exclude grants for technical education from the new arrangement. It had to be treated separately because even the Secretary of State realised the danger that lay in placing technical education within the block grant system. Therefore, the first intention was to take it out, but I understand that the latest proposal is that expenditure on daytime courses of further education in each area will be pooled and spread equitably over the areas which benefit from it.<br/>
To take the position in Glasgow, how big is the area to be? There are people who come to Glasgow's schools in the evening, the technical colleges and so on, from all over the west of Scotland. Is the money which Glasgow gets to be spread over the whole of the west of Scotland? I hope that the Secretary of State will make clear the position of technical education within the block grant, because the latest proposal will not ensure that the appropriate and necessary assistance which should be forthcoming will go to the areas where developments are actually taking place.<br/>
I pose the problem because at this moment Glasgow is planning an immense programme for the expansion of day-release colleges. We have been asking for these for years. Glasgow is now proposing to build three district and two central colleges which will deal with 2,000 students each per week. The whole scheme will cost million. Can Glasgow be assured by the Secretary of State tonight that that scheme&#x2014;which will take some years to complete&#x2014;will not suffer financially under this new arrangement for educational grants? I know that the day-release college is not necessarily a major contribution to the bigger problem which faces us on the technological side. Nevertheless, it is a beginning, at a lower level, and from that beginning we can expand.<br/>
The urgency of the problem is shown by these figures. The number of first degrees awarded in engineering in Great Britain in 1955 was 2,313; in the United States of America it was 22,589, and in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 53,000. In pure science, 4,999 degrees were awarded here; 23,600 were awarded in America, and 12,000 in Russia. We can also see the concentration in Russia upon the engineering side. Last year the number of engineering graduates put out by Russia from higher technological institutes was 71,000, and 35,000 of those were women. In America, the figure was about 50,000. In Great Britain it was 7,000&#x2014;and that figure included engineering graduates of all kinds; first degrees and higher degrees. If we had been merely keeping our place it should have been double that figure at the very least.<br/>
By 1960, Russia proposes to increase that 71,000 to 96,000. Has the Secretary

of State any comparable plans for Scotland along those lines? I am not thinking in terms of Sputniks. To some people these may be important, but to my mind the really important fact and the fact that should be of major significance to everyone, is that the lack of technicians capable of improving British living standards may become a very serious matter if we go on cramping education as is proposed under the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Pollok (Mr. George) shakes his head. He was not in the Chamber when I began speaking. He did not hear the reason I gave. Hon. Members on this side of the House, as well as some hon. Members opposite, have given figures to show how it will be restricted. We are pursuing this cramping policy at a time when we ought to be expanding in every department, not merely in the academic sphere, where I want to see expansion, but also in science and technology, where we are facing tremendous competition, and where I am afraid that we are falling very far behind.<br/>
I do not see anything in the attitude of the Government which gives hope that they have a policy to meet the situation in which we are now living. Their policy can be described only as a "phutnik", and I hope that hon. Members opposite who have expressed views not dissimilar to those of my hon. Friends will come into the Lobby with us tonight and vote against the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Although occasionally it was straggling, our debate today has certainly covered a field of great interest to us all. Undoubtedly, it has pivoted round the block grant. The hon.

<p>Well, I will prove it.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the Geddes Committee. I do not think that he can have remembered the precise circumstances of that time. They were


that the cut of 10 per cent. on teachers' salaries was not imposed as the of the block grant or, indeed by the Geddes Committee. It was imposed by the great Socialist Chancellor, Philip Snowden, who had been panic-stricken by the danger of inflation which was then so serious in the country that he and his Prime Minister broke up the Government because of it.<br/>
The cut then was certainly not part of any kind of attack on education. It was part of a general proposal designed for the purpose of arresting inflation. Therefore, I think that the hon. Gentleman chose a bad example when he selected that one. The fall of the Labour Government and the bringing in of a Budget under which these cuts were imposed was the work of a Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, who, as I said, had by that time begun to fear most terribly the danger of inflation. The danger before us today is not one of that kind at all.<br/>
I have many friends who are teachers. I remember well the arguments addressed to me on many occasions by my friends in the teaching profession. One always hears such arguments in every controversy. I remember when the education service was placed under the control of the local authorities. I remember this House being bombarded by resolutions and demonstrations against it of all kinds. At that time, education was under the control of the special education authority, which had been brought into existence in Scotland and to which education had been entrusted.<br/>
An eloquent plea was made today by the hon. and learned Member for Paisley (Mr. D. Johnston); but the logical consequence of his speech was that education should be removed altogether from the control of the local authorities. That is the logical consequence of many of the arguments which have been advanced in this debate. One can always bring out a good case for something being done by a central instead of a local authority. Anything is better done by a central authority than by a local authority&#x2014;except everything. If we destroy all the purposes of local authority, what is left for it to do?<br/>
Local authority has already lost much&#x2014;electricity, gas, the health services. It was, I think, a great severance when the

health service was taken from the local authority by a central authority, run entirely from central funds and administered by nominated committees instead of elected representatives. Strong arguments were advanced in favour of it, but I think that even right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite would not all uphold that solution with such vehemence today. But nobody is consistent in these matters.<br/>
The responsibility for looking after those out of work and on outdoor relief has been transferred to the local offices of the National Assistance Board. I remember that transference well. I was responsible for a good deal of it. At the time I was denounced in the most unmeasured terms by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite for transferring this responsibility, and making it a centrally financed taxpayers' burden instead of a rate burden. I am afraid that views on these matters vary a great deal according to which side of the House the hon. Member who expresses them is sitting.<br/>
I am not saying that this Bill is a perfect solution. I am not saying that it is the end of the story, but I do say that this is one of the last chances for local authorities. If local authorities cannot be trusted to administer education, what is it that they can be trusted to administer? The argument which has been advanced all evening is that local authorities are saying that they are not to be trusted with this responsibility, "Do not give us authority over this money, retain the control centrally". If that is so, what claim have local authorities to be entrusted with anything except simply administering the funds found by central administration?<br/>
Many of the arguments have been about raising funds. The hon. and learned Member for Paisley brought forward arguments which also took way from the suggestion of local raising of funds to central raising of funds. He referred to the question of a local income tax for which Inland Revenue machinery would have to be used, for administration of local revenue, and would have to be taken over by local authorities. I am not saying that under modern conditions it is possible for local authorities to survive, but I think that we should do our best to give them a chance. We should do our best to try.<br/>
This is a great voluntary service which, traditionally, has been associated with the locality aid administered and financed by the locality. It is a dangerous course to embark upon to say that to entrust authority over the finances of this service to local authorities is a retrograde step, a step which should not be taken in the interests of education but that it should be kept here and that here we can be trusted, but not in the Town Council of Glasgow, in the Town Council of Aberdeen, or of Edinburgh.<br/>
That is a very strange argument indeed. The hon. Member for Govan addressed to us an eloquent plea for education. Why does he think that his speech should be so much less effective if it is addressed to the Town Council of Glasgow, where there is a great majority of the Left, than if it is addressed here, where there is a majority of the Right?<br/>
I do not think that the hon. Member is consistent in the arguments he brings forward. These are <i>ad hoc</i> arguments which, perhaps, stem from the genuine fear that in some way or other education is to be cut and a diminuation is to be made.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn), who formerly had great responsibility as Secretary of State for Scotland, affirms that fear. How can he, in face of the record of this Government? Whereas the best figure for school places in a year that he could produce was 20,000, we have produced 36,000. How can he claim that the people who produced 36,000 places are cutting down education? It does not seem to make sense.</p>

<p>New facilities had to be found by us. It was part of the claim of hon. Members opposite that we would not provide facilities for the children who were growing up. At any rate, a valiant effort, a successful effort, was made to cope with the situation. The situation was coped with.<br/>
I am much more afraid of the figures which were given by the hon. Member for Govan, which we have very much in our minds. It is quite true that the figures relating to technical education in

Russia are far more than those in this country, even proportionately; so are the figures in the United States. The danger does not arise in the early years, but in the fact, as has been repeated again and again, that two-thirds of those who go into our secondary schools escape from them at the earliest possible moment when not prevented by the policeman.<br/>
That is the accusation that we should deal with. And I can give the hon. Gentleman the answer&#x2014;or, at least, the answer given in Soviet Russia. The answer is&#x2014;incentives. The incentive to someone who goes through the toil, the drudgery and the discipline of higher education is five, ten, fifteen, twenty times as high as in this country. Let the hon. Gentleman compare the wages of the manual worker with those of the teacher, the engineer, or the professor in this country, and then compare the wages of the manual labourer with those of the professor, a skilled engineer&#x2014;or even a ballet dancer&#x2014;in Soviet Russia. The multiple is many, many times. And there is, in addition, every kind of advantage given, advantages against which there would be the utmost outcry if they were launched in this country. The Soviet Union has gone all out for incentives&#x2014;it may be right or it may be wrong in that, but it is producing results.<br/>
As I know that the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) wishes to have time to speak, I will not speak at length on this now, but I really do speak with some experience of these matters. Many and many a time, when I was in the Administration, all kinds of people with whom I was working have said, "For goodness' sake, give us a little money and let us go away. We will use it far better than if every penny we spend is checked and counter-checked, accounted for, scrutinised, audited and summed up by the auditors in your Department."<br/>
I remember Lord Boyd-Orr, when running the Rowett Research Institute at Bucksburn, which we all know very well, saying, "I will take half the money if I can have it in a box, and not have to bother with all the checks and counterchecks that I have to go through with the Department of Agriculture." There is something to be said for that point of view.<br/>
I am not saying that this Bill is the ideal solution, but it is a solution that carries with it very important implications for the future of local government, and for the future of education. The House should think twice, and three times, before rejecting it, as I ask it not to do tonight.</p>

<p>I hope that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove (Mr. Walter Elliot) will pardon me if I do not continue the discussion on the salaries of ballet dancers or professors&#x2014;or even the humble labourers&#x2014;in the Soviet Union, but rather address myself to the Bill before the House. Until the right hon. Gentleman spoke, not one Conservative Member had given unqualified support to the Measure, and the right hon. Gentleman himself did not make it very obvious to any of us that he was, in fact, addressing his remarks to the Bill.<br/>
The Bill had unqualified support only from the National Liberals. There is complete unanimity amongst them that it is a good Bill. That is terribly important. We have the National Liberals saying, with one voice, "This is a good Bill." The Tories, however, until the right hon. Gentleman spoke, have, for the most part, been opposed to it.<br/>
The hon. Baronet the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Henderson-Stewart) was so full of praise of his right hon. Friend that I am sure the Secretary of State must have been somewhat embarrassed. The hon. Member for Fife, East said that he would not be at all surprised if the present holder of the office went down in history as the greatest Secretary of State there had ever been, because he had introduced this Bill.<br/>
What is the purpose of the Bill? I think it not a bad idea to look at that. The purpose is to continue the process of transferring a financial burden from the taxpayers to the ratepayers. That is what it does. This process has been going on for some years now, and is continued by this Measure. If that is not its purpose, it is, at least, the effect. It transfers the burden from the taxpayers, as I have said, easing the burden on those taxed according to the more equitable system and increasing the burden on those who con-

tribute under the less equitable system of taxation.<br/>
There is no hon. Member present when the percentage grants were introduced, not even the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove, who did not feel obliged to provide them to enable local authorities to maintain their service, and who did not always boast of the size of the percentage grant because it would be of such great advantage to local authorities and to the country as a whole&#x2014;always because national taxation is a more equitable system of taxation than local taxation. That has been the justification for the movement over the years towards a greater contribution to local services from central government, coupled with the fact, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. D. Johnston) said, that local government has more and more ceased to be local government and has become local administration. Because we here have been determining policies, we have not been leaving it to local authorities to decide what they would spend their money on but have decided what they should spend their money on, encouraging them so to spend it by giving them percentage grants. No one can deny that that is exactly what has happened.<br/>
Another of the purposes of the Bill&#x2014;we ought not to be mealy-mouthed, and there is no reason why the Secretary of State should not be quite honest about it&#x2014;is to steal back to the Exchequer the advantages local authorities would otherwise derive from the rerating of industry. Is that not so? The rerating of industry, to the extent provided for in the Bill, would yield to the local authorities of Scotland, so says the Secretary of State, an additional income of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;3 million a year. It is necessary, then, for the Secretary of State to claw back some of the money which would go to the local authorities. How could he do it? In one of two ways. He could reduce the percentage grants payable for the existing services, or abolish the lot and introduce a general grant.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State deny that, if he had not abolished percentage grants and had still insisted on clawing back to the Exchequer two-thirds of the advantages which would otherwise have gone to the local authorities by the rerating of industry to the extent provided for, he


could have done it otherwise than try reducing the percentage grants? The Government did not have the courage to reduce the percentage grants in respect of these many services, and they have, in fact, pretended that the Bill is giving additional money to local authorities.<br/>
The fact is that the Bill most definitely takes money from the local authorities. It gives nothing to them but takes something away. It is a shabby way of taking it back. The Government aught to have been more straightforward about it and said, "We intend to reduce the various grants". But not at all do they do that. 'They abolish the lot and steal back from the local authorities the money which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. George) says that the local authorities ought to have from the industrialists in their areas. Industrialists will pay a little more in rates under the present. Bill, but the central Government will claw back 2d. from every 3d. extra that the industrialists pay to local authorities. This is a shabby way to treat those in local government who had been led to believe that the rerating of industry would be of some advantage to them.<br/>
The Secretary of State repeated this afternoon that the underlying purpose of the Bill, so he says, is to give local authorities more power over their own affairs. This surely is hypocrisy. No additional power over their own affairs is given to local authorities by the Bill, and there are many examples, which have been cited by my hon. Friends today, of local authorities, under the Bill, having less power over their own affairs and less control than they have at the present time.<br/>
I have listened to the most utter nonsense being talked by the hon. Baronet the Member for Fife, East about the independence and the great new powers that are to be given to local authorities. "We on this side", was his theme, "trust the local authorities"&#x2014;</p>

<p>I would want to forget it, too, if I had made it.<br/>
In Clause 11 the Government are providing in permanent enactment that a local authority cannot even spend its own money on building projects for which it is a statutory authority. At least, when the borrowing of money is involved to carry out the capital projects, it must go cap in hand to the central Government and say. "Please may I do this?"<br/>
As I said when discussing this same issue on the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill in Committee, my own local authority found that it was now committing an offence under the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act, 1951, by putting sludge into the river. To save itself from committing this offence, it asked about a grant under the Distribution of Industry Act to erect the necessary works. It was informed by the Scottish Office not only that it could not get a grant to carry out the necessary works, but that it would not get borrowing powers to carry them out. The Joint Under-Secretary has since written to me saying that if my local authority applies again, it might get a better answer next time.<br/>
Why should the Secretary of State, who says that he wants to give more power to the local authorities, take from them the power, which they enjoyed until the war, of deciding by a two-thirds majority to borrow money for a capital project, whether it was the building of a library, a museum, public parks or a purification works? Why should the local authority not have the power to do that? It is not the wicked Socialists who are taking away this power. It is the National Liberals.<br/>
What the Socialist Government did was to provide, in Section 4 of the 1951 Act, that this power, which had been taken by the central Government at the beginning of the war under Defence Regulations, should be continued temporarily at that time when the Defence Regulation was expiring. We had always been honest with the local authorities, and we said, "At this time, when building controls are operating all round and there are certain shortages, and when we have to exercise controls and impose restrictions on others, we must be able to put restrictions on local authorities also." We therefore put, it into the Bill for a temporary period. But it is the hon. Baronet's party which has been continuing it year after year in


the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, and it is his Government who are now writing it into permanent statute.</p>

<p>The hon. Baronet says that the Government are following our example. If he has no greater understanding than that, I had better leave him alone.<br/>
The Secretary of State, who said that the purpose of the Bill was to give the local authorities more powers, has also written into the Bill Clause 3 (1), which gives him power to reduce the general grant when a service is not being carried through. Therefore, if he is not satisfied with the number of schools, with the public health service that is provided by the local authority, with the fire service equipment or the fire stations which have been provided, if he is not satisfied with what the local authority is doing in the matter of child care, school crossings or anything else, under Clause 3 (1), he can say "I shall withdraw part of the grant." What a great help that will be to the local people&#x0021; What a great help it will be to take the grant from them&#x0021; In subsection (2), however, the Secretary of State goes on to provide that he will specify the standards to which those local services have to be maintained.<br/>
Have not hon. Members opposite, including the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove who said that these local authorities were about to be liberated, seen that the local authorities will be worse hamstrung than ever after the Bill has gone through? We have become accustomed to the Secretary of State saying one thing and doing another, but we expect some hon. Members opposite to make a study of the Bill. Even though the Secretary of State said its purpose is to give more powers, if hon. Members opposite can see written in pretty plain English in the Bill that its effect will be completely the opposite, why on earth do they not say so? They did not have to read the Bill to see that. They had only to read some of the memoranda sent to them by their constituents, who identified for them those parts of the Bill by which new restrictions are to be put upon the local authorities.<br/>
The Bill provides for the introduction of the new system by the year 1959 to

1960. Hon. Members opposite have been rather proud of the fact that by then the local authorities will get &#x00A3;750,000 more money. This was made most clear by the Secretary of State. The services dealt with in the Bill, and listed more clearly in the White Paper, together accounted in the year 1956 to 1957 for &#x00A3;36&#x00B7;6 million in grant, and 90 per cent. of the total was taken by education. Quite apart from the change in the value of money, would there not have been by 1959 to 1960, three years hence, an extension of services that would have increased the total cost of the services by more than 2 per cent.? We cannot be certain that there will be no further fall in the value of money. It has fallen this month compared with last month. But would not the total cost of the services have increased by more than 2 per cent.?<br/>
What about the provisions for technical education of which we have heard so much? The new technical schools are included among the schools provided by the education authorities and listed in the Bill. Surely, the grant to be provided by the central Government in the next three years towards the cost of additional education services alone would have increased by more than this sum of &#x00A3;750,000. That is all that is being left of the &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;3 million additional money the local authorities get from industrial ratepayers.<br/>
This is surely a bit of sharp practice. It is not an increase. It is most definitely a decrease. We shall find, three years from now, despite the &#x00A3;750,000 more which the local authorities are getting this year, that the Exchequer contribution will be a lower percentage than it is now of their costs met out of Exchequer funds. Of course, that is the purpose of the Bill. Why do not the Government tell us the truth? Why do not Ministers say that is the purpose of the Bill? Why will they say one thing and do something quite different?<br/>
The hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) wanted to praise the Government, but said she would also have to speak on behalf of her constituency. Her constituency comes out of this very badly, because Aberdeen City has probably made more progress in education than any other education authority in Scotland since the end of the war.<br/>
It was the first education authority to get ahead with the building of new schools. It has provided more school places per 1,000 of the population than any other education authority in Scotland, and it has recruited staff. All that has cost money, of course, but the authority has received grants from Exchequer funds of about 60 per cent. of the total expenditure. At present, on a basis of per head of population, Aberdeen gets more money for education than any other city or urban authority in the country.<br/>
Aberdeen incurred this additional expenditure by building new schools, by recruiting staff, and making educational provision in fulfilment of the Education Act, 1946, on the understanding that there was a contractual arrangement by which the central Government would meet a little more than 60 per cent. of the cost. This contract has now been torn up by the Government, and not after discussion and negotiation. The reward that the Government propose to give to Aberdeen for the great advances which the city has made in education since the war is to reduce the amount of grant.<br/>
Renfrewshire, on the other hand, has done very badly in the provision of new schools since the end of the war. Renfrewshire receives at present less per head of the population than many other authorities in Scotland. The county has depended far too much on Glasgow to provide education, and particularly secondary education, for Renfrewshire youngsters. How do the Government punish Renfrewshire for failing to fulfil its obligations under the 1946 Act? Renfrewshire is to have increased assistance.<br/>
I asked, in a Parliamentary Question, whether the Secretary of State could give me a list of local authorities which would suffer decreases or receive increases of grant under the Bill, but he was unable to provide me with a list. He must prepare a list, of course, before he gives effect to the Bill, because provision is made for calculations. He could not prepare one for me, because it would have meant that he would have had to show that the financial benefit of the Bill goes to those education authorities which have not done their job since the end of the war and that those who will lose under the Bill are those who have done a good job since the end of the war.<br/>
I am not saying that Edinburgh is not a good local education authority, but the education authority there has a great deal of its education services made available or its needs fulfilled by public benefactors. Notwithstanding all that, we have said that Edinburgh, like any other city, should be reimbursed for 50 per cent. of the cost incurred by the education authority. But now the Secretary of State proposes that he should count heads in Edinburgh and give it a grant to cover services, including education, by reference to population. Therefore, Edinburgh is bound to receive advantage under the Bill.<br/>
If Edinburgh had to make all its provisions for education itself, as we do in the County of Lanark, and if the city had fulfilled all its obligations it would not gain by these new proposals, but public benefactors have met a substantial part of Edinburgh's education needs and the city will now receive not 60 per cent. of its education expenditure but very substantially more. That is the effect of these proposals. That is why this provision in the Bill is so very wrong.<br/>
We have heard a good deal about technical education. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove, called attention to the great advances made in the Soviet Union and the United States of America. Did they make those advances by leaving the provision of education to the local authorities, to be met out of local rates? Of course not, Does anybody think that the provision of technical education should be left to the education authorities without any drive from this end? Of course not.<br/>
I wish that the Secretary of State would be honest about this. None of us trusts the local authorities in this matter. We decided to raise the school-leaving age to 15. We did not leave it to be decided by local authorities. It is we who decide that there shall be secondary educational advantages for our children. It is we who will say that some day, in the not very distant future I hope, the school-leaving age will be raised. It is we who, in the very near future, will decide that there will be part-time technical education for all children who leave school at 15 years of age. We shall not leave that to local authorities.</p>

<p>I want to make way for the Under-Secretary of State who will reply to the debate.<br/>
It is our responsibility in this House to ensure that technical educational facilities are provided for the young people. I would dare anyone to say that he is willing to leave that to the local authorities. It is for us to do that. It is because we have recognised hitherto that there should be a partnership between central Government and local government in the provision of education and all those other services for which percentage grants have been given that we have had percentage grants.<br/>
We have recognised, up to now, that there has been a partnership. By and large, policy has been laid down in this House. Even in the administration of the policy there has had to be a partnership between central Government and local government. The paying of percentage grants was a recognition of that partnership. It is seen clearly now that the purpose of the abolition of percentage grant is to reduce the assistance given by the central Government to local authorities. This is a breaking up of the partnership. All that has been said by hon. Members on both sides about the need to increase and encourage a better educational provision for the young people indicates that this is not the appropriate time to introduce this Measure.<br/>
Let hon. Members bear this in mind. At the moment if an education authority

is considering whether it will build a technical school that will cost, say, &#x00A3;2 million it will do so knowing that more than half the annual burden will be met from central funds. If it has to decide the same issue after the passage of this Bill, it will know that 100 per cent. of the additional financial burden being taken on by the provision of the school will be borne by the local authority. This Bill is a piece of sharp practice. It is dishonest. I call on those Conservatives representing Scotland who have criticised the Bill for once to follow their arguments with their votes into the Division Lobby.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has asked me to wind up this debate because of the predominating interest of education in the services proposed to be covered.<br/>
In the course of our debate today we have had an advantage in that we have been discussing only the block grant and its effects. At the same time, if there is one thing that has emerged from the discussion it is the general feeling which started with the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Paisley (Mr. D. Johnston) that all was not really well with local government. I would be the first to admit that there has been no agreement about the cure to be applied.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) could have understood this Bill better. He could have gone into it more closely and understood what it seeks to do before he made the allegations he did. For example, he seems to be labouring under the misapprehension that the block grant is to be built up in the first place from the 1956&#x2013;57 expenditure, no matter what inflation has happened since. If the hon. Gentleman will look at Clause 2 he will see that this is not the case. The duty is laid upon my right hon. Friend to take into account the latest information available before fixing that grant.<br/>
Then the hon. Gentleman said that if a school is built in the future the cost must come out of the rates. Clause 2 (1, <i>c</i>) states clearly that my right hon. Friend must take into account the need for developing the services, so that is taken into account on a national basis.


However, schools will have to be built all over the country&#x2014;I should think in every single local authority area&#x2014;so it cannot be said that under this system any local authority which has to build a new school will have to find 100 per cent. of the money out of the rates.<br/>
Then the hon. Gentleman uttered certain generalisations about the position of local authorities and how the advanced and less advanced ones would be affected. Those generalisations are not justified. This formula was arrived at in a purely objective manner. It is inevitable that some local authorities will lose a bit and some will gain a bit. This happens when a formula is fixed on an objective level, but the object of doing so is to obtain a common measure of assistance for the maintenance of national standards in the services to which the grant relates.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) drew attention to the expansion of social services. Over the last twenty-five years or so we have had a steady growth of social legislation, much of which has laid duties on local authorities and has encouraged them to perform their functions by offering percentage grant of various amounts which have no logical relationship one to another. I suggest that there comes a time in the development of separate local authority functions when, instead of each being subject to a separate financial control by a separate Department of Government, it is opportune and appropriate to give them each a sum of money with which to carry out the whole group of functions. That is the philosophy of the Bill and I believe that it is right.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. George), in a most admirable speech, suggested that the Bill would result in a budgetary system being introduced into local government and he thought that that would be a good thing. I agree, but of course, such a system already exists. I believe that the Bill will strengthen it. I disagree with my hon. Friend when he said that the Bill had no friends outside the House. I admit that the local government associations in Scotland have expressed disapproval. It is wile that the E.I.S. has expressed disapproval, but many individuals in local government, even among those whose local authorities say that they are opposed to the Measure, have already indicated that they have

appreciated the purpose of the Measure and will support it.</p>

<p>Certainly. They have indicated that to my right hon. Friend, to myself and to my hon. Friends. We are in constant touch about this.<br/>
The question really is what the purpose of the Bill is and that is something about which there has been considerable discussion. Many critics have started from a preconceived idea of what a block grant is. Sonic still think that it is a sum to be fixed immediately by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for years ahead, limiting the liability of the Exchequer and throwing on the ratepayer the burden of expanding services and increasing costs. They conjure up the ghost of Geddes, complete with axe, and whisper knowingly "Geddes walks again." I say to the Opposition what was said in the case of a different ghost:
<q>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</q>
<q>Than are dreamed of in your philosophy.</q>
It is true that the purpose of the block grant introduced in 1922 was economy. Indeed, the Geddes Committee which recommended it was set up specifically to effect forthwith all possible reductions in the national expenditure. That Committee pointed out that the Board of Education Vote had grown from &#x00A3;19 million to &#x00A3;50 million over a period of three years. The avowed object of that Committee's recommendations was to check expansion and reduce expenditure and the critics have accordingly inferred that the real purpose of this Measure is the same. It is not. There has been no Geddes Committee.<br/>
One thing is quite clear and that is that we know better than the critics what our real purpose is. It is stated clearly and unambiguously in the White Paper which I shall repeat:
<q>A main aim of the proposed changes has been to increase the independence of local authorities in the raising and spending of their money so far as it is practicable to do so.</q>
We are not ashamed of our belief that an effect of strengthening of the financial responsibility of local authorities will be to encourage them to greater economy. There is always room for


economy, even with education. We believe that this reform will make for more efficient administration and more value for money. What we are doing is to give an opportunity for greater responsibility in determining the division of expenditure without having the distracting pull of a percentage grant.<br/>
How is that to be achieved? It is to be achieved by the block grant. Member after Member has risen to say that that is all very well, but that more powers are being given to the Secretary of State. I say to the House what has been said by my right hon. Friends in earlier debates, that in the Working Party we are now considering how to relax controls and what controls should be relaxed. The first stage was for the Working Party to reach a basis for the formula and to get the legislative background of the Bill in shape. The next stage is to see what the effects will be on the actual functions of local government.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McInnes) talked about the intention to cut the grant. The general trend of his argument, which was also advanced by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and others, was that there was to be a bigger burden on ratepayers and that the rates would bear more heavily than taxes on people with low incomes.<br/>
I think that was the general basis of their argument; but really this cannot be right because the net effect of the changes is to give the ratepayers in Scotland a benefit of something like &#x00A3;750,000. It is all very well for the hon. Member for Hamilton to talk about stealing back industrial rates. Industrial ratepayers will certainly pay more; indeed two-thirds is being used to reduce the block grant. That is the answer to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central and that is where the reduction in grant takes place and nowhere else. But the general effect on the local authorities as a whole, because they get the extra &#x00A3;750,000, is that they will be better off at the end of the exercise.</p>

<p>Would the hon. Gentleman make it perfectly clear to the House what Exchequer subsidies were given to local authorities in respect of derating?</p>

<p>In 1929, when de-rating took place, the amount of derating

was made up to the local authorities and a little more as well. On this point, the hon. Gentleman said that 38 per cent. of expenditure was met from grants in 1955&#x2013;56 and he asked from where the remaining 62 per cent. came. Of that 62 per cent., one-half came from rates and the rest from other sources of revenue, rents, bus fares, miscellaneous fees and so on. The figure given for England and Wales was six to five in the relationship between Exchequer grants and rates, and in Scotland the figure was five to four. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
I was asked why the police were not included if this was such a good thing. The answer is perfectly simple. It is because my right hon. Friend has a special duty as regards the maintenance of law and order.<br/>
I was also asked why roads were not included. The answer is because the responsibility for roads is one which is shared between my right hon. Friend and the local authorities in different degrees. It would be virtually impossible to include that in the grant. I was asked, why choose this moment to add additional control, to rivet on local authorities the control of borrowing as a permanency. The answer is, quite frankly, this. For the foreseeable future we see no prospect that the prospective excess of demand for capital investment will be equalled by the capacity of our resources to meet it. In fact the demand will be greater and therefore we have to exercise control.<br/>
I would say this to hon. Members opposite. Of all people they should be the last to bring this charge. They want to exercise control over all other forms of investment. Do they really want us to believe that local authority investment, out of all the rest, would be the one source of investment that they would leave alone?<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Paisley, said that local government had no say over education or any other service at all. The fact is that powers are conferred as well as duties. It is not just the actual national policy that local authorities have to interpret; there is an infinite variety of ways in which they carry that out.<br/>
He would have liked to find sources of local income tax. My


hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Henderson-Stewart) dealt with that point. The hon. Member was at variance with his hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren), and also with the Sorn Report in that respect. I would also point out that his argument would fall down even if there were new sources of finance or a new system of rating, because these duties would remain. We should not restore any more independence to local government even if we had a different system of raising finance.<br/>
I should have liked to deal with a great many more points, but I think that I should sum up the situation now, since time is rather short. The attitude of the Opposition can best be characterised as one of undue scepticism. They are sceptical about the amount of the general grant and the sums payable to each local authority; about the Secretary of State's power to maintain standards, and about the sense of responsibility of local authorities.<br/>
First as regards the total amount of the general grant. The Secretary of State referred to the explicit duty imposed upon him by Clause 2, as to the factors which he is bound to take into consideration&#x2014;the rate of expenditure on the services in question, together with any foreseeable variation in the cost and in the demand for those services. I say once again to the hon. Member for Hamilton that there is no fixity in this matter. My right hon. Friend must also have regard to the need for developing those services, together with the extent to which it is reasonable to proceed with development taking into account the economic conditions at the time.<br/>
The rate of progress must be related to the capacity of the nation to sustain it. In the face of such a clear and unambiguous statutory obligation, local authorities have no real cause for alarm as to the method of arriving at the total grant. In a very admirable speech the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) said that he thought that the powers provided by Clause 2 (1) were too weak. Hon. Members have implied that the Secretary of State is not bound to do more than take these matters into consideration and that, laving done that, he can do what he likes. But he cannot do what he likes.

Under Clause 1 the total amount of Government assistance towards the local services in question has to be set out in a general grant Order, which has to be approved by both Houses. The Government will have to satisfy both Houses that the total amount is neither too little nor too much. The fact is that under the present system of percentage grants Parliament has tended to lose control of expenditure. The present proposals will not only increase the financial responsibility of local authorities; they will restore to Parliament its historic, broad control of expenditure in the field of the Exchequer contribution to local government finance.<br/>
For 1959&#x2013;60 and thereafter the total amount will be set out for Parliament to approve or disapprove, and for all to see, in the general grant Order. That Order will cover two or more years. One of my hon. Friends expressed the hope that it would not be for more than three years. The money, however, will have to be voted year by year, just as the university quinquennial grant is voted annually now. There will be ample opportunity for Parliament to debate the amount both on the Order and the Estimates.</p>

<p>It will be open to Parliament to say, "Here are factors which we think will justify an increase." The hon. Member for Hamilton knows his Parliamentary procedure, and he knows how these things happen. He has the choice of what will be debated in the Estimates.</p>

<p>No, it is not intended that there shall be power to amend them.<br/>
I was asked about local grants by my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Duthie), and that raises the important question of those authorities which may be described as advanced. I say both to my hon. Friend and to the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) that it is true that the general grant to Aberdeen and to Banff will initially be less than the specific grants which it replaces. But in making his calculations my hon. Friend took no account of the effect of the proposals on the equalisation grant or of rerating or of the


considerations relating to revaluation in 1961, all of which are relevant. Therefore, I give my hon. Friend the assurance he seeks. By law we are bound to look at this matter before 1963 and that will certainly be done.<br/>
Because Aberdeen has reached a more advanced stage regarding educational provisions than other areas, it will have less need to spend money on development, whereas it will receive the general grant for a long time to come including a proportion of the total amount provided for development which will not be limited by this expenditure; so that the initial loss to the city should become less marked as greater uniformity is achieved among authorities in the standard and cost of education and other services covered by the general grant.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite have cast doubts on the maintenance of standards under this system, particularly with regard to education. They have also cast doubt on it with regard to technical education. Had they read Part II of the Third Schedule to the Bill they would have seen exactly what will happen, and so far as relates to education we shall be making regulations</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.332.0" colnum="332" time="">
<p>under this Bill which will cover that point entirely.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.332.1" colnum="332" time="">
<p>My right hon. Friend referred to the important safeguards provided in Clause 3 and to the powers contained there. Some critics have overlooked paragraph 6 of the Fourth Schedule where it is stated
<q>The Secretary of State may make regulations prescribing the standards to which every education authority shall conform in exercising their functions under this section.</q>
by that I mean Section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act.<br/>
Is it really suggested that local authorities will wilfully contravene such regulations, that they will break the law of the land to save money and cut down on standards? Surely such fears imply a strange lack of confidence in local authorities. This Bill is inspired by the policy on which we have fought and won two General Elections and on which we shall go on winning; that is a policy of a free democracy, in which responsibility shall be spread and not centralised and in which, accordingly, local government shall be as local as possible.</p>

<p>We ought to have some explanation of this Money Resolution. There is at least one point which intrigues me. Looking at line 16&#x2014;I am sure that the Minister will enlighten us&#x2014;there is to be paid into the Exchequer
<q>any balance in the said Education (Scotland) Fund at the coming into operation of any provision of the said Act of the present Session providing for the abolition of that Fund;</q>

The Bill will abolish the Education Fund. A point which interests me is that, at present, as far as I understand, any balance at the end of the year in the Education Fund is retained in that Fund and does not affect any future payments into the Fund in the following year. As I see it, Scottish education will be deprived of that balance by paying it into the Treasury, from which in future the general grant will have to come. Will the Secretary of State tell us what the position has been over the last two or three years? How much has remained in the Fund and how many thousands of pounds will Scottish education be denied by the change?<br/>
The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Henderson-Stewart) referred to the Fund this evening. I can well remember an occasion when he presented us with a Supplementary Estimate, and he could not give us any explanation at all about what it was. All he could say was that it came into the Education Fund at the end of the year because England and Wales had spent more money but that additional sum, that balance, was carried forward and devoted to Scottish education. Under the Money Resolution, however, any balance will be handed back to the Treasury.<br/>
This is a matter of considerable interest to every local authority in Scotland. We are told by the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) that, in the first years of the new dispensation, Aberdeen will lose a considerable sum of money. We are told by the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Duthie) that the local authority in his area will lose over &#x00A3;80,000 in the first year. I am sure that those hon. Members, like me, will be concerned that, in the coming into operation of this strange and devastating Bill, money will pass to the Treasury and will not be applied to Scottish education, the education authorities being put to a considerable loss as a result of the Bill. I do not see the Financial Secretary to the Treasury here, but we should be given justification for this and explanation of what it will mean in the loss to Scottish education.</p>

<p>I can answer briefly. This provision is necessary as a consequence of the abolition of the Education


(Scotland) Fund. I am advised that the sum involved is relatively small from year to year. [HON. MEMBERS: "How much?"] It cannot be worked out exactly. It may range from &#x00A3;20,000 to &#x00A3;50,000, but it is not a large sum and it may even be less than that. I understand that the matter is provisional for the future and that it should be a very small sum indeed.</p>

<p>It is wrong for the right hon. Gentleman to say that it must be done in this way. If that sum is available to be disbursed, it could be disbursed in many other ways. There is no reason why it should go back to the Treasury. It has been voted by the House of Commons for the purposes of Scottish education and for those purposes it should be applied. I am not concerned whether it is &#x00A3;20,000 or &#x00A3;20 million. The fact is that it was voted by the House for Scottish education and it should be applied for that purpose.<br/>
In Committee, if we are lucky enough to be on the Committee which deals with the Bill, we can certainly find many ways of using that sum, whatever it may be, for the benefit of Scottish education. Will the Secretary of State deny that it would be possible to disburse it in some other way?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) exaggerates when he says I am very anxious to address the House, although I am very willing to do so. It may assist hon. Members if I explain that these rather formidable looking Regulations have, nevertheless, a simple and felicitous purpose. They are to give the widows and children of certain deceased police officers the benefits of increases in their awards, which correspond to those provided by the National Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1957.<br/>
I do not propose to discuss the Regulations in detail unless any hon. Member has any question in particular which he wishes to raise, but I should like to say a word about their general background.<br/>
Since 5th July, 1948, police officers have contributed to the National Insurance scheme, like everyone else, and their widows and children can, therefore, qualify for the appropriate benefits. Before July, 1948, police officers were excluded from State insurance even as voluntary contributors, and, accordingly, some widows and children of deceased police officers are not entitled to National Insurance benefits. For example, an officer may have died before the introduction of the scheme of 5th July, 1948, or he may have been too old to enter the scheme on that date, or he may have died before he was able to pay sufficient contributions to qualify his dependants for an award.<br/>
Parliament, during the passage of the Police Pensions Act, 1948, took the view that the widows and children of such officers should not be left at a disadvantage, and police authorities were accordingly empowered to increase their basic awards under the police pensions scheme by amounts equivalent to the appropriate National Insurance benefits. Those amounts have from time to time been increased to take account of improvements in the National Insurance scheme.<br/>
The House will recollect that the National Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1957, has provided for increases in the rate of National Insurance benefits which are to take effect from 27th January, 1958. The purpose of these draft Regulations is to make it possible to apply corresponding


increases to these supplementary awards under the police pensions scheme. If the House approves the Regulations, the increases will also take effect from 27th January of next year.<br/>
The Home Secretary has consulted the Police Council in accordance with the requirements of the Police Pensions Act, 1948, and it has expressed its agreement with these proposals.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has mentioned the Police Council, but not the Police Federation. Was the Federation also consulted?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.341.1" hansard_membership_id="7377" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30065" speakername="Mr. Simon" colnum="341" time="">
<p>The Police Federation is represented on the Police Council. It is one of the three constituent elements, so to speak, on the staff side.<br/>
The Regulations take the form of amendments to three existing sets of Police Pensions Regulations, those of 1948, 1949 and 1955. My right hon. Friend regrets that it should be necessary to legislate by reference in this way, but the statutory safeguards which were written into the Police Pensions Act, 1948, providing for existing pensions, prevent consolidation in the normal sense of that term.<br/>
The most my right hon. Friend can do is to enact a fresh set of Regulations governing future awards. Each time he does this he creates a fresh tier of Regulations for police authorities to operate. It must, therefore, obviously be a power to be exercised sparingly. He appreciates that there have now been a substantial number of Amendments to the 1955 Regulations. He therefore proposes to introduce a fresh set of Regulations for future awards in the course of next year.<br/>
The purpose of these Regulations is to assist widows and children of certain deceased police officers. I believe that this is a body of pensioners who deserve well of the community and whose well-being the House has at heart. I therefore confidently commend them to the House.</p>

<p>These Regulations, as far as I

understand, give effect to the increases made to widows and children under the latest National Insurance Act. I, and, I am sure, all hon. Members on this side of the House, would have been pleased to see these increases greater than they are. Of course, I understand that the Home Secretary could not make the increases for these widows covered by these Regulations any greater than those increases given effect to in the National Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1957.<br/>
I take it that the Secretary of State for Scotland had consultations with the Scottish Police Council and that there was general agreement between the Secretary of State and the Scottish Police Council in these matters. We welcome the increases as far as they go, because many of the widows of these policemen and their children have suffered very greatly in the past. We welcome any increase, but we hope that in future the increases will follow a National Insurance Bill that deals much more adequately with matters like the cost of living.</p>

<p>This Order has already been formally introduced into the House and was yesterday given general approval in another place. Its object is to extend the powers of investment of the Commissioners of the four family pension funds established between 1873 and 1928 for the benefit of the widows and orphans of officers in the military service and Civil Service of the Government of India appointed by the Secretary of State.<br/>
Since 1945 Parliament has passed three amending Orders each of which has affected in one way or another the powers of investment of the Commissioners with the object of extending investment. Those amending Orders were passed in 1945, 1948 and 1950. In 1949 the Commissioners asked the Government whether they would approve the extension of their powers to include investment in equities, in ordinary shares. Unhappily the then Government, the Labour Government, refused to allow this, with the result that the beneficiaries were unable to gain the advantage which might otherwise have accrued to them if the Commissioners had had the increased scope for their powers of investment.<br/>
The amending Order which is before the House at the moment is designed to enable the Commissioners to invest a maximum of 30 per cent. of the value of each of the funds at their disposal in preference stocks or equities of sound United Kingdom companies which have regularly paid a dividend of 5 per cent. during ten years, or, if they have been in existence for a lesser period, 5 per cent. each ear during the period of their existence. In addition, it enables the Commissioners to invest in debentures in United Kingdom companies. It increases the scope of the field of their investment in Commonwealth

and public authority undertakings and it enables the Commissioners to purchase leaseholds in the United Kingdom.<br/>
The introduction of this Order enables us to make one other small amendment to the original Order of 1936. It enables the Secretary of State to appoint Commissioners or to re-appoint them for a period of less than four years, whereas at present all appointments have to be made for the full term of four years. We have had the request of the Commissioners for these additional powers. We have circulated the subscribers to all these funds and of those who have replied, the majority are very much in favour of the proposals. We believe that the beneficiaries will gain benefit from the increased scope of the powers of the Commissioners and that they will prudently use these powers within the restrictions which this Order lays down. For that reason I hope that the House will give this Order its speedy approval.</p>

<p>This is indeed a happy occasion for many of us on this side of the House, and our only regret about this debate is not the numbers present&#x2014;because there is a fairly good attendance&#x2014;but the absence from the Front Bench of some of the members of the Government who must have had a very anxious time when this Order went through the Cabinet preparatory to being presented to the House.<br/>
I hope that before the debate is over, we shall have some explanations. I understand that it is a little difficult to get the Chancellor of the Exchequer here, but I am sure he has a substitute who is prepared to explain how he is able to reconcile the proposals in this Order with the speeches that he has been making in the country and, indeed, the answers which he has been giving in the House pouring derision on the proposal of the Labour Party to make the sort of policy embodied in this Order the basis of the investment policy for a national superannuation scheme.<br/>
I should have thought it very odd that this debate should conclude this evening without a contribution from the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, who


again has been extremely severe both in the country and in this House. I am glad to see that the right hon. Gentleman has just arrived, and we shall look forward to hearing from him later in the evening&#x2014;[Hon. MEMBERS: "In the morning."]&#x2014;some of the reasons why he has been able to reconcile his conscience with support for this Order this evening. If he has been converted, perhaps he will take the opportunity of withdrawing some of the derisive comments that he has made about the proposals of the Labour Party when he considers that the terms of this Order go further than any that have been suggested in detail in the outline of my own party's policy.<br/>
One reads with astonishment that not only may the Commissioners invest their funds in public companies but that they may also take:
<q>Denbentures, debenture stock, bonds or other obligations of any company, public or private, incorporated with limited liability in the United Kingdom &#x2026;</q>
I suppose that if the proposals of the Labour Party had gone into such detail as this, the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance might have said even more to the discredit of the Labour Party, charging it with wanton speculation with the insurance funds and so on.<br/>
It is interesting that when one of the previous Orders was laid before the House it was the present Attorney-General, speaking from the Opposition Front Bench, who said it was much overdue and asked what the Commissioners had been doing playing around with gilt-edged stocks and losing the value of the money. The Attorney-General ought to be in his place tonight to give us his legal opinion of what caused him to remain a member of the Government, which, in the light of the Labour Party's proposals, is supporting an Order smuggled in at a late hour and without a great deal of preparation.<br/>
Where is the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster? What has happened to his Press conferences? Has Mr. Poole been sent for to have the scheme explained to him so that the whole country may know the implications of the Order as it affects the Conservative Party's policy of superannuation in the succeeding years? We should like to know what conclusions are being drawn and what proposals will he made.<br/>
I should particularly like to know. In the days before Christmas the hon. Member for Paddington, South (Mr. R. Allan) and I have to visit some old folk's parties which are held at this time of the year. There is not the slightest doubt that we shall be asked what the policies of our respective parties are with regard to maintaining the value of old-age pensions and the prospects of a better superannuation scheme. Can it be that we shall be put in the impossible position of saying that the Government are in favour of one thing for pensioners who depend on funds contributed from the Indian Government and another set of principles for the old people of this country?<br/>
I do not know where the hon. and gallant Member for Cheltenham (Major Hicks Beach) is. I hope he will shortly be turning up. It will be difficult for him at election time when he is asked, "Why do you support one set of proposals for your constituents who are pensioners depending on these funds and oppose the same set of principles when they are put forward as a sound and sensible basis for a superannuation scheme for the people of this country?"<br/>
We shall need to explain this to the old people. They have been thinking these things out. They have been coming to the same conclusions as those which motivated the people who have drafted this Order and drawn up this scheme. Assuming a simple case of a family living on the land in a country district, the old folks would expect to be maintained out of the products of the farm in their old age. But they would not expect to be told that they could get back the money that was spent on the young apple trees, plus 5 per cent. They would expect to get a share of the fruit, and the basis of the modern conception of a sensible superannuation scheme is precisely that.<br/>
That is clearly the thought that has been in the minds of those who have drafted the Order. We welcome it, and are very glad to see that a conversion to more up-to-date ideas has made a slight penetration into the minds of some members of the Government; but we feel a little uneasy at the fact that we have had no explanation yet&#x2014;although the night is yet young&#x2014;about how far


this principle is likely be extended into other spheres.</p>

<p>It is very kind of you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, to allow these negotiations to take place among back benchers.<br/>
What I had in mind was that although we do not need to know how many members of the Labour Party are in support of the principles embodied in the Order, because we have known for a long time&#x2014;through the sterling pamphlet issued by the Labour Party on the subject of national superannuation, with the subheading, "Labour's Policy for Security in Old Age"&#x2014;we should like to know how many members of the Conservative Party, if they are not prepared to talk with their mouths are prepared to talk with their feet and come into the open and let their names be registered in support of the principles behind this Order.</p>

<p>I do not think that the House

is in a condition to make up its mind to about this matter until there has been a very thorough examination of the implications of the Order. My hon. Friend has pointed out that the Government appear to be yielding a little to the overwhelming pressure of the Labour Party's ideas as to the investment of public money, but there are many aspects of the matter upon which we should like some authoritative Government reassurance. Many open-minded members of the Labour Party have been worried about one aspect of the Labour Party's proposals, and the Government should put their minds at rest if they wish for support for the Order.<br/>
I should like to know if the Government believe in buying ordinary stock in private companies, because we have been told by almost every reputable newspaper which supports the Tory case that if they do buy, an immense amount of uncertainty will result. Directors will not know where they are, and it will lead to improper political pressure, which is calculated to upset the admirable gentlemen who run these companies. I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that the newspapers which have spoken, apparently in sympathy with the Tory objections to the Labour Party scheme, have been talking complete balderdash and poppycock, and that when public investment takes place there is not the slightest danger of disrupting the efficiency of private companies, or of jobbery, or jobs for the boys, or any untoward political influence.<br/>
Unless I can be assured by an explicit statement that what the Government are proposing to do will not lead to any of those mischiefs I shall have to vote against the Order. None of us here wants to bring into effect any of these disconcerting and most disturbing consequences.<br/>
I am inclined to suppose that these nightmare illusions which have been fostered by the Tory Press have no real substance in them. This is a convenient moment&#x2014;I am sure he would do it with relish&#x2014;for the Minister to make plain to the House that these horrors are but the figments of the tortured imaginations of moronic leader writers and bear no possible relation to reality; that in fact there is no good, sound commercial reason why we should not have public investment in the ordinary shares of public companies.<br/>
The second point that worries me is that since this Government came to office we have had an alarming loss of confidence in public investment in gilt-edged. It is all very well for there to be moronic noises from hon. Members opposite which may occasionally be interpreted as, "What about Daltons?" or something of that sort, but that will not do as an answer to this very grave problem. The Government are responsible for the fact that gilt-edged have become a very uncertain market, and I am doubtful whether we can readily rush in to support an Order which in effect is a declaration by the Government that gilt-edged stock, trustee securities and the like are not a proper investment for public funds. That is the alarming implication which one is bound to draw from the Government <i>pronunciamento</i>.<br/>
When the Chancellor introduced his lottery bonds there was a considerable protest from the British Council of Churches. Having regard to the way in which the Government&#x2014;by reason of their crazy manipulation of interest rates in pursuance of financial theories which are as dead as the dodo&#x2014;have caused havoc in the gilt-edge market and among the savings of thousands of people who put their trust in Government funds, I am expecting that if at the time of the next Budget the Chancellor brings in an extension of his lottery bonds, the anti-gambling committee of the Council of Churches will congratulate him on bringing in a security which is the least speculative of all the Government holdings available to the public.<br/>
We have got into a parlous state where the Government, knowing perfectly well that the investments&#x2014;I said of thousands, but it is probably tens of thousands, or even of millions of people&#x2014;are invested in good faith in Government stock and Government finance, almost completely disregard their moral obligations to those people. This Government have done the things with regard to the savings of the people who had confidence in Government stock. First, they have encouraged and accelerated the tendency of the &#x00A3; to be devalued in purchasing power and, secondly, they have deliberately brought about a position in the gilt-edge market where War Loan and other forms of saving popular among most of the people in this country have sharply depreciated.<br/>
The Government are responsible and before we give the Minister this facility in respect of an Indian family pension fund, I want him to tell the House why we should acquiesce in this, while the Government do nothing on behalf of those tens of thousands of small savers whose f.'s have depreciated in value by reason of Government action. I hope that no one is under the illusion that when gilt-edge depreciates the Government look at the matter regretfully. The Government have deliberately brought that about. In the first place, they have misguidedly brought about an increase in Bank Rate, which automatically brings down the price of existing long-term Government securities. The small savers in this country tend to invest in these long-term securities such as War Loan, Savings Bonds and the rest.<br/>
The Government did all this without warning the people. Not only have they depreciated stock by raising Bank Rate, but they have deliberately manipulated the market in gilt-edged. The Government have been steadily selling down the price of gilt-edged. The long-term gilt-edged bond market in London is managed at the direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If there is a drop in the value of that stock the people of the country ought to know that it has been brought about by the deliberate intent and action of this Government.<br/>
That raises another important point about these Indian pensioners. Can we trust this Government to invest even 7 per cent. of the pension fund in fixed interest stocks when they are driving the market down in gilt-edged stock? How can we trust the Government to invest wisely in these fixed interest stocks? They have invested in debenture stocks. We have an outstanding example of how these gentlemen who are to play the markets with public funds had an excellent chance to invest in debenture stocks, because the Government would have had the right as shareholder in British Petroleum to subscribe half the &#x00A3;40 million convertible debentures. That gave to the subscribers the best of both worlds because they had the right to convert into ordinary shares and if, surprisingly enough, this Government stayed in for many years and the rise in the cost of living continued the pension trustees could have converted B.P. stock into ordinary shares.<br/>
If, on the other hand, the Labour Party comes back and keeps the cost of living steady and has an expanding and prosperous industry on sane fixed interest investment so that fixed interest stocks are desirable, they could keep the B.P. stock as it is. They could have had the best of both worlds, stock suitable to a Tory Government&#x2014;one which could be hastily converted into ordinary shares where the Government are saving at the expense of the old-age pensioner and all who live on fixed incomes, excluding the professional man and people who contribute in many directions to fixed incomes in other words, the Commissioners could convert into ordinary stock.<br/>
If, however, we got a sane Labour Government they could have the best of that world and remain on a form of 6 per cent. fixed interest security. Incidentally, if the Government got into one of their panics and did not know whether to convert or stay with a fixed interest security, they could sell the whole lot for several millions, because there is a fixed premium on the stock.<br/>
The people who tonight are asking for wide powers to play the markets are those who, with the right to subscribe to &#x00A3;20 million worth of B.P. stock or thereabouts, chose not to exercise that right so that it fell to a whole host of small investors and none came to the country. They could have made a profit on it, but chose to put it out as a kind of <i>bonne-bouche</i> to those who had time to fill in an application form for conversion stock. Those who were entitled to &#x00A3;2 million or &#x00A3;3 million had it thrown away by this Government. Why should we trust them when they have made a present to 2,000 speculators of &#x00A3;2 million of money? When they had a chance to change it into B.P. stock which other investors could take advantage of, this Government refused to take advantage of it and threw away their rights. A dreadful series of problems faces us tonight in this regard.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will reply to this question. Why should we give him power to invest in debentures when he had the power to subscribe &#x00A3;20 million in the best debenture issue that has been offered on the market in the last ten years&#x2014;according to the unanimous City

and professional opinion on the matter? Seeing that he has rejected the best debenture issue ever offered in the last ten years, with rights to convert into ordinary shares thrown in for nothing, is he now awaiting for "dud" debentures before subscribing? If he is not to invest in the best, we must take it that he is asking for power to invest in the worst.<br/>
Why did he refuse to subscribe to the debenture stock recently issued by B.P.? I hope he will not tell us what some of the newspapers have tried to tell us, that the public got half of the stock in any case, and that the public are the same as the citizens of this country. It is just not true. When the Government hold B.P. they hold it on behalf of the entire nation, but this &#x00A3;20 million which should have been public property in B.P. convertible debenture stock now belongs to quite a small circle of speculators who are busy catching their seven-point premium on the market today and tomorrow.<br/>
Why, therefore, should a Government, who reject the best investment in recent years that they could have had, in the debenture stock and ordinary shares of a fine company, which they themselves control and to which they appoint directors to represent them&#x2014;why should they be trusted when they are so inept in their handling of public money? Why should we trust such a Government? Why should they be allowed to have the powers sought here. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish) has said, however attractive it is from certain points of view to see the Government investing public funds in ordinary shares, we are not altogether satisfied that we should let this Order go through without recording our protest at the kind of Government that seeks these powers.<br/>
Another thing that worries me is this. As has been asked by my hon. Friend, how will we explain to our constituents that we voted for a form of trustee investment of pension funds for these widows and orphans which is denied to superannuation funds and to old-age pension funds in this country? But it goes further than that. At the present time, if an infant gets damages in court and those damages are invested by the court, the judge, however benevolent, however intelligent, or however progressive, might very well say


to himself, "Well, with this collection of fogey-ridden economists in power, who are performing extraordinary acrobatics with Bank Rate, it is obviously unwise for me to invest this injured child's money in gilt-edged. Until there is a saner Government, I should like to see that child's money invested in something suitable or safe." But he has no power except to put that money into Government funds.<br/>
How are we to explain this to the country's lawyers, who have to see to widows' and children's funds recovered in accident and damages cases? We have seen those funds forcibly put into War Savings at 100, and have then watched that War Loan being driven down deliberately by these peculiar financial policies of the Government to something like 61 or 62. So the injured widow and the injured infant have to sit trapped with their money in court. The judge is trapped. He may think that the Government are wise, but even if he thinks that they are foolish and that the invest also is foolish, he, too, is trapped.<br/>
Ought the House to take these measures, obviously necessary on behalf of the pensioners affected by this Order, while, at the same time, leaving this disparity in the treatment of the funds in court of injured widows and children?<br/>
I should like to know from the Minister- whether he is content, on the one hand, to say, as he does by this Motion, that there shall be this advantageous way of dealing with Indian pension funds, spreading the fund from ordinaries through debentures to gilts, and, on the other hand, to do nothing at all for those people who have funds in court as a result of accidents and who are under a legal disability which prevents them from using that money in those wise ways themselves.<br/>
I see that you have returned to the Chair, Mr. Speaker, and you may remember the words I addressed to the Chancellor about it in the economic debate. I pointed out to the right hon. Gentleman that, accepting a situation of continuous full employment and a slight tendency to inflation, it was possible to make prudent arrangements to invest funds. Of course, the Chancellor, with that alert. "Boy Scout troop leader" air which marks him on the occasions when

he is being pontifical and less confident, said that I may be able to contract out of inflation but the ordinary people of the country cannot. There is, he said, only one answer, and that was provided by the kind of Governmental intervention in financial and economic policy which he proposed.<br/>
This is not only a vote of no confidence in gilt-edged securities which we are asked to give tonight we are asked also to give a vote of no confidence whatever in the Chancellor's own policies. That I will readily do. When I said in the debate that the right course in dealing with inflation was to accept that there will be a tendency to currency inflation, and that proper steps must be taken to protect savers and victims of inflation, the Chancellor said that to attempt to contract out of inflation will only make it worse: what we must do, he said, is to stop it and then there will not be any need to contract out.<br/>
I see that the Commissioners who are responsible for widows and orphans do not believe the Chancellor. They think that the right thing to do is to contract out of inflation. I heartily agree with them. If any widow or orphan were honestly to place any confidence in the success of policies so muddled, misguided and contradictory as this Government have produced in financial matters, that would indeed be a piteous spectacle. I am glad to see that the Order shows that the Commissioners do not think very much of the Chancellor's bold assertions about what he will do to protect the country from further erosion of the currency.<br/>
Three weeks before the Government gave us what has been called a swingeing increase in Bank Rate, they assured us that the most important thing was not to keep the currency value steady but to keep full employment and prosperity. It is alarming to find that the same Government which then brought in the swingeing increase in Bank Rate, and all that flowed from it, including a very lengthy tribunal hearing, are showing now that they do not think that that Bank Rate will do much good. What is the Minister to say tonight to the people of the country who hold gilt-edged as their savings? Is the message to them to get out while the going is good and go into equities? Is it a message of no


confidence? If it is, it is rather belated. All this is really very shocking.<br/>
This selective intelligence is to be applied to a very worthy class of people. I should not like it to be thought for a moment that, because I compare the treatment which they are receiving with the treatment given to ordinary folk who have saved, who are pensioners, or who have had accidents and have had their funds invested in gilt-edged&#x2014;which the Chancellor then proceeds to bash down in value&#x2014;I am not in favour of doing the best possible for what is a very deserving class of people.<br/>
I am sure that it is the view of every hon. Member on this side of the House that we want to ensure that there is not a discrepancy between the intelligent selection applied to that problem and that applied to the ordinary people of this country. There might be such an affront to public morality that the gain to the Indian pensioners we are discussing would be outweighed by the damage done at home, and the dismay caused at the thought that they are investing in Government securities which are not protected in any way. I should like the Minister who is to reply to say whether he intends to do something for the small savers who have been so badly damaged.<br/>
I will gladly vote for this Order if the Government will give an assurance tonight that the ordinary small saver, whom they have nearly ruined, will get some compensation from this reckless and incompetent Government. Will the Government do anything from now on to gear the Savings Bonds to the cost of living index? They have asked for immense sacrifices from the country in order, as they claim, to keep and preserve the value of the &#x00A3;.</p>

<p>On a point of order.

<p>I have listened closely to what the hon. Member for Manchester, Cheetham (Mr. H. Lever) has said, and

so far I have not heard him say anything which was definitely out of order. He asked me whether I remembered what he said on a previous occasion, and what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said on a previous occasion, during an economic debate. I regret to say that I have completely forgotten what he said and what the Chancellor said, but the mere fact that he asked me to remember such a remote occasion led me to the suspicion that he was, perhaps, getting a little remote from the Order. So far, the hon. Member has not transgressed the boundaries, but I would urge him to exercise reason in the matter.</p>

You will appreciate that that is due to my anxiety to be as brief as possible.<br/>
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) really must not expect the House to vote on the manner in which Indian pension funds should be invested in this country without having some regard to the general economic and investment background. I am sure he will not take it as intentional discourtesy on my part if I say that he has, perhaps, been dozing because of the lateness of the hour. I pointed out the extreme relevance of this. Any investor knows that what is a good investment under a Labour Government is a bad investment when the Conservatives are in power.</p>

<p>I am trying to get the hon. Member for Yeovil, who obviously has a keen interest in this debate, to see the reason why he has now followed these aspects of the matter, but I know there must be many hon. Members anxious to speak on both sides of the House.<br/>
I want to ask the Minister why what is a prudent investment for deserving pensioners under this Order is forbidden by law to English trustees administering funds for orphans? Why is what is desirable and prudent for these pensioners forbidden by law to injured infants in this country, who are compelled against


their will to put their money received as damages for injury, into Government stocks which are at the mercy of Government policy? The third question is this. In asking for this permission to bring in power to invest in ordinary stocks, are the Government completely satisfied that no danger of political interference or of economic disruption or jobbery of any kind would be involved in public ownership of shares in public companies in this country?<br/>
Fourth, do the Government, accepting that this is clearly a vote of no confidence in gilt-edged as an investment for the small savers and pensioners, intend to do anything at all for the small savers who have been the victims of the Government's policy in the gilt-edged market and in the Bank Rate and for the economic situation of this country?</p>

<p>I have listened to many parties in opposition as they attempted to extend into a far-reaching debate a debate on a comparatively very small issue, and I congratulate the Opposition on taking their opportunity tonight, on what is a very limited question, to turn the debate into one much more appropriate to a very different occasion. I want to speak only on behalf of those who are to benefit under this Order when the House passes it.<br/>
This request, that the powers to invest these funds should be enlarged, dates back many years, at least to the time when the Labour Party was in power, and, I suspect, much farther back than that. These are not public funds. These are funds compulsorily and partly voluntarily subscribed by those who served in India and those who left widows and orphans behind them. Those widows and orphans have to live on the income from these funds. For years it has been known that if there were wise trustees in charge of them, and if they were given wider powers over investment, the annuities payable to the widows and children could he substantially increased.<br/>
I thank my hon. Friend and the Government as a whole for at last making this small concession to us. I have no personal interest in the matter. I did not come under the funds. No widow or orphans of mine will benefit, but I know many widows and children

who are struggling along on a small income coming from the present investment of these funds. The Government are quite right.<br/>
This is a demand for all trustees, including the ones the hon. Member for Manchester, Cheetham (Mr. H. Lever) referred to, trusts who are strictly bound to invest in trustee securities. Many of us want the Trustee Acts extended because we know well that it is not the Government who make securities go up and down but the whole economic situation of the world. Government policy has little to do with it. We are all interdependent today economically and in every other way. Everybody knows perfectly well that if one has good funds to invest it is wise to put some yin trustee securities, but one likes to invest a portion in equities, bonds, and so forth.</p>

<p>Exactly. That is just what I propose to talk about. I should like to invite the attention of hon. Members to the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 12 of this Order. Here we are concerned with investment in money and, as it states,
<q>&#x2026; the advance of money upon the security of any real or leasehold property in the United Kingdom".</q>
But the Minister of Housing and Local Government is not here, nor is his Parliamentary Secretary. Who is to speak about housing? Certainly not the Minister, if he were here, because so far as his own constituents are concerned, he sends back letters from those who complain about housing.<br/>
We are asked tonight to approve an Order which requests the Commissioners to advance money upon any real or leasehold property in the United Kingdom. That is the sort of policy which everybody would advocate if there were funds for the purpose, because it might take away some of the worst effects of the Rent Act which this Government have imposed, and I suggest that on any future occasion when an Order of this description is introduced to the House, we have present a Minister responsible for what-ever issues may be raised. We have had complaints before about the absence of Ministers from their places, and it is about time that Ministers tried to recognise that hon. Members may need an explanation about the many issues which may be raised.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Member for Kensington, South said that we wanted to get this Order through quickly; but this is not the Reichstag, it is the House of Commons, and every hon. Member is entitled to debate, every one of the issues presented by this Order. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Common-

wealth Relations, who is to reply to the debate, will give an answer to this specific point. Who are these Commissioners? Who are these people who have these great and extraordinary powers given to them? Are they to be people who will have a dual responsibility? Are they to be questioned as a matter of conscience as to whether they are acting in the interests of the nation or of an individual?</p>

<p>I can answer the hon. Gentleman straight away on that point.

<p>This brings the matter right on to the Floor of the House. This is where it becomes very difficult, unless we have many more questions answered, to decide whether we can rubber-stamp this Order as the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington.

<p>I will, of course, defer to your Ruling, Mr. Speaker, and I agree that perhaps I was getting a little beyond the bounds of order.<br/>
Perhaps I might ask who is the individual concerned. Who is to be named as a responsible person from the City representing insurance companies, to be a Commissioner to decide how money shall be invested? Surely there will be a conflict of interests at all times. I think the House is entitled to know. Until the hon. Gentleman replies to a question of that sort, I do not think any Member would be prepared to vote for the Order. We should be prepared to vote for the Order on the basis of representatives from the Public Trustees Office. But a


Commissioner may be a director of B.P., and the advice then given would be outrageous if it were advice similar to that which was criticised by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Cheetham, (Mr. H. Lever). I think the House is entitled to know who is the individual who will be a Commissioner representing what the Under-Secretary referred to as the City.<br/>
Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that I was really out of order. The hon. Gentleman referred to a gentleman from the City, and that is a geographical place. It may, of course, be an insignificant one. It may be one which irritates us from time to time.</p>

<p>I will conclude by saying that I hope we shall be told before the debate proceeds much longer who the Commissioners are. Otherwise the debate may go on until the early hours of the morning and we may not get any other business done. The House has been kept too long in ignorance, and as a result of this sort of thing a great deal of disturbance is sometimes created throughout the country. I beg the Minister to name the individuals concerned and to say whether the policy relating to the purchase of leasehold and freehold properties is to be adopted generally throughout the whole of the investment policy of Her Majesty's Government.</p>

<p>I should like to raise a small point concerning paragraph 12A (1) which states:
<q>The Commissioners may, as and when they think fit, realise, convert or otherwise deal with any investments held by them.</q>
I am sure that that does not mean what any reasonable layman would think it meant. The powers given to the Commissioners grow steadily wider as the Orders go on, but this would appear to extend the powers completely, without limit, to do anything they think fit with the shares. I am sure it does not mean that. There are certain legal rules and interpretations of words to make them mean something else. I think we ought to know what this paragraph does mean

and what are the limits of the powers imposed in those words.<br/>
In general, the reason we are interested in this Order is that it embodies in practice an important new principle which has been taking shape in men's minds for some time. The principle is that in the kind of society in which we are now living it is neither sensible nor desirable that trust funds should be invested exclusively in fixed interest bearing securities they should be invested in ordinary or equity shares. I take it that the reason for that development of thought and practice is that, with the establishment of full employment, ordinary shares no longer carry the very considerable element of risk that some of them used to carry in the past. They have become a title deed upon the increase in the total national wealth.<br/>
As I see it, the way the distribution of wealth works out at present is this. If the total wealth of the country increases&#x2014;as it does even under the present Government, though at a diminished rate&#x2014;the first people who get a share of the increase are those whose incomes are in the form of profits and dividends on ordinary shares. Next come those who get wages or salaries, the place they occupy in the queue being determined by the bargaining power of their union or professional assocation. Last of all come pensioners and others on fixed incomes.<br/>
That is not a satisfactory way of arranging things. What we want is some kind of built-in arrangement, if I may borrow a phrase from the Labour Party's pamphlet, "National superannuation," so that as the nation's wealth increases, some part of the increase shall go to pensioners and persons on fixed incomes without their having to wait at the end of the queue.<br/>
An obvious device for securing that result is that the funds which care for their needs should, at any rate in part, be allowed to be invested in equity shares. It is true that this provision must have certain safeguards attached to it, and safeguards are, indeed, to be found in the Order. For example:
<q>The said stock or shares &#x2026;</q>
must be
<q>&#x2026; quoted on the London Stock Exchange or other recognised Stock Exchange.</q>


Most of us will have noted with interest something that I did not know previously, that if one wants a definition of a "Stock Exchange" the document to which one turns is the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act, 1939.<br/>
In introducing the Order, the Minister claimed credit for the fact that it was a Conservative Government who were now beginning to put this idea into practice. We give him that freely. Most of us regard the principle in general as admirable, and it is true that wisdom sometimes speaks from strange mouths, even as Balaam's ass spoke when the prophets were silent.<br/>
There is a remarkable aspect of the Order which has not perhaps received sufficient attention so far. It will mean that the Commissioners become increasingly owners of property. In so far as that principle extends, we shall have what the Prime Minister called, in referring to the Labour Party's proposals, "nationalisation by the back door." To borrow words used by the Leader of the House earlier today, we do not know what state of mind the Prime Minister was in when he made that remark, still less what state of mind he will be in when he gets back and finds out what his colleagues have been doing in his absence. Clearly, it becomes nonsense to suggest that there is anything improvident in trust funds being used for the acquisition of actual property, real or leasehold property, or the actual physical property which ordinary shares represent.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens) said that these were not public funds but were funds voluntarily and compulsorily subscribed for the purpose of pensions. Fundamentally, that is what the National Insurance Fund is, too. It consists of funds mainly compulsorily, though to a limited extent voluntarily, subscribed for the purpose of nourishing persons when they are of pensionable age. There is no valid ground for saying that a fund of that kind should not follow the general principle which this admirable Order contains.<br/>
There is only one ground upon which we could vote for the Order and oppose the Labour Party's national superannuation policy, and that is to say, "We are

concerned about the people to whom the Order relates, but not about any other kind of pensioner." It will be recognised that most of the persons who will benefit by the operation of the Order are somewhat better off than the average old-age pensioner. I do not object to that; many are people who have rendered very distinguished public service. But it is quite wrong, when we have an admirable principle applied to their protection, to say that because they happen to be a little better off than the general run of pensioner this advantage should be confined to them.<br/>
I cannot feel that the Government will be able to put forward that proposition. It seems to me, therefore, that although my hon. Friends have expressed slightly different emphasis in this matter, the general consensus of opinion among Members on this side of the House&#x2014;if I have followed correctly the arguments that have been adduced so far&#x2014;is that we heartily welcome the principle embodied in the Order, but we shall point out the general importance of that principle and the importance of its extension.</p>

<p>Although it is not my purpose to deal with City questions, I should perhaps say a word about your Ruling, Mr. Speaker, that the City is significant only as a geographical area. The City is of special significance to this House, in that the hon. Member who represents it is, by tradition, allowed to sit on the Front Bench, and the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs of the City are the only remaining people who are allowed to petition the House. I hope that it will not pass unnoticed that the City is regarded by the Speaker of the House of Commons as being only a geographical area.<br/>
At any rate, this order is a very interesting one, because it is one of the very few Orders remaining under the Government of India Act, 1935. That Act, which is quoted at the beginning of the Order, is no longer printed in the Statutes Revised, but I want to refer the Minister to a complaint made by the present Attorney-General in 1950 to my right hon. Friend, who was then Secretary for Overseas Trade, that all the references were not properly given in the Order at that time, and that it was a small but


important point. It is because the Government of India Act of 1935 has been repealed, and is in continuation by virtue of Section 8 (3) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 that, if I may repeat the words of the present Attorney-General, it would be more helpful to the House if we had the full references in the Order.<br/>
What we are concerned with is the substance of the Order, and to get to that one has to refer back to the debate of 1936, which was introduced by the present Leader of the House, who was then Under-Secretary of State for India. He moved the original India (Family Pension Funds) Order and explained, in greater detail than we have had tinight, the reason why the Order had to be brought into effect and also exactly what was involved. As the present Leader of the House said, twenty-one years ago, this was a way of consolidating the various funds that are in existence-in India so that those who would benefit by them were able to transfer the money back to the United Kingdom and have them invested in their interest here. Later, Sir Reginald Craddock made a rather significant statement of his views which, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to quote. He was himself in some way connected with the Family Pension Funds and he said:
<q>As the House has been informed there are several Funds concerned, and in some cases the funds do not exist except in the form of an obligation on the part of the Government of India the administration of the Funds having always been maintained at the India Office."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 12th November, 1946; Vol. 317, c. 1183.]</q>
We are, therefore, dealing not just with existing funds&#x2014;as hon. Members who have already spoken have said&#x2014;but with money which derives from an obligation maintained by the India Office to certain people who worked for the India Office; and the significance of that I hope to point out in a moment. At any rate, at that time we know that there were 10,000 people concerned. We do not know whether the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens), who is knowledgeable on these matters, is able to tell us how many are involved at the moment. Presumably, the number has been reduced by death.<br/>
The only point I wish to make is the point about the extending of the powers

of the Commissioners to invest in ordinary equities. If one looks at the phrase in the Explanatory Note to this Order one sees that the Commissioner's powers of investment are
<q>&#x2026; subject to conditions laid down in the Order, to invest in industrial concerns.</q>
That is almost word for word the same phrase as is used by the Labour Party in a pamphlet published this summer, in which it says:
<q>We therefore believe that the investment policy of the National Pensions Fund should be controlled by trustees appointed by the Government who should have the same opportunities to carry out profitable investment of their funds as private insurance companies.</q>
And there is an almost identical word for word repetition in the Labour Party's scheme with the one we have in the Order tonight.<br/>
I think it worth while to do so, and so I propose briefly to take the House through the comments made about this. I make no reference to the Labour Party's particular scheme, but to the proposal to permit investment in industrial concerns which created a certain amount of comment last summer. Mr. Oliver Poole made a statement on the very day that this pamphlet was published. He is very quick off the mark, as we know. He said:
<q>As I suspected when I commented on their plans for superannuation, they intend to use pension contributions as one means of getting their hands on industry. Instead of thinking how to reduce taxation they propose that the State should use public money &#x2026; to buy shares in private companies.</q>
This is the view of the then Chairman of the Conservative Party. He has since been made Vice-Chairman. He has been promoted below Lord Hailsham, if I may put it in that way.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for contributing something to the debate. He sits for Colchester and up to now he has maintained his reputation as an oyster.<br/>
If Sir Reginald Craddock was correct and he spoke with authority in 1936 on this matter, funds do not exist except in the form of an obligation through the India Office. Therefore, what we are


dealing with is a public obligation. I wish to make perfectly clear that I am not in any way denigrating the service of the people who served in India, or their pensions. Indeed, I am trying to see that the procedure adopted tonight is one which ought to be generally applicable.</p>

<p>I could quote it again, but it means going over the point again. It does not matter whether it is the Government of India or the India Office. The point is that it is a public obligation. No one is trying to repudiate this obligation. We are discussing how to implement it to the full and I am in favour of the Order.<br/>
The fact is that the comparison between the superannuation we proposed to set up and this is exact. In both cases it relates to persons whom we believe are owed an obligation by the State. In one case it is for service to the State and in the other case people who have worked for the community. In both cases commissioners are to be appointed by the Government. Under this Order the Public Trustee is one commissioner and the others are to be appointed by the Secretary' of State. In our case, although no actual details were made public, it is obvious that they will be Government appointed commissioners who will be responsible. I am dealing with what the Conservative Party thinks about giving permission to commissioners and public trustees to invest in industrial&#x2014;</p>

to apply a general principle to this matter. Of course, like many hon. Members, I utterly reject the views of Mr. Oliver Poole on this subject.</p>

<p>On a point of order. For the future conduct of this debate we should know what is in order and what is not in order, Sir.

<p>The hon. Member is entitled to refer to that matter by way of illustrating his argument. The matter he is talking about, namely, the appointment by his party, or the State, of commissioners is not in issue at the moment.

<p>I am not dealing, nor have I sought to deal at any stage, with the right of the State to appoint commissioners. I am dealing entirely with the


powers of commissioners who have already been appointed by the State and I am arguing that this Order introduces a new principle, which I wholly support, but which is contrary to all the views expressed by hon. Members opposite when exactly the same principle was recently described. I am not in any way seeking to extend this argument by considering the merits of the Labour Party scheme published last summer. I am dealing only with the exact powers of public commissioners.<br/>
I am bound to refer to Sir Oscar Hobson's view, published by the Conservative Central Office, in which he says, in reference to public commissioners investing, that
<q>The State will inevitably be drawn into controlling what is now private industry &#x2026;</q>
It is certainly true that if this Order goes through the commissioners will be drawn into controlling investment, and Sir Oscar Hobson, whose views have been given publicity by the Conservative Central Office, to whom I am indebted for giving me this pamphlet, says this is
<q>towards the establishment of Communism.</q>
Now we come to another aspect of the matter. I agree that it is a ludicrous assertion of Sir Oscar Hobson, but it is one given the blessing of the Conservative Central Office. We come back again to this question of whether, in fact, an insurance fund operates or not, and I will not, even for the benefit of the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger), read this quotation again. I would, however, ask the House to remember that a fund does not actually exist. Last year, a statement issued by the Life Offices' Association, and by the Associated Scottish Life Offices, laid down certain principles about pensions which would cover this particular Order and meet this point. They were, of course, referring to the Labour scheme, but the point of principle they wanted to underline is the same.<br/>
They said:
<q>The new scheme would, therefore, differ from ordinary pension schemes in that it would not build up a fund commensurate with its vast commitments.</q>
That is exactly the parallel of what we have here. The fund, in modern circumstances, has not been built big enough. They then go on to say:

<q>If the money were used for the piecemeal acquisition of controlling interests in industry&#x2014;</q>
which is exactly the principle of this Order&#x2014;
<q>it would introduce a new and politically controversial factor into the field of pensions.</q>
We entirely agree with that and with the Order&#x2014;and I am speaking in support of the Order.<br/>
Now we come to what the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself said about this principle. He was referring to the Socialist scheme and to the principle involved in it. He said:
<q>&#x2026; It is expensive enough to have a pension scheme at all for social purposes. But if you add to those purposes the purpose envisaged by the Socialist Party of collecting contributions to buy off bits of British industry it is going to be much more expensive, and contributions will be correspondingly higher.</q>
So we have the view of the Chancellor that such a scheme as is advocated by this Order will be anything but beneficial to the people concerned.<br/>
Finally, we come, of course, to the statement issued by the Conservative Central Office, that the threat of nationalisation is implicit in this scheme. It is not only the Conservative Party that has attacked this scheme. We have also the Liberal Party. I do not know where the Liberal representatives are tonight. I did contact the Leader of the Liberal Party, and asked whether he could make it possible for his "shadow" Minister of Pensions to come here tonight.<br/>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), in a statement issued about a month after the issue of the Socialist scheme, said:
<q>The present Socialist tendencies of both Labour and Tories, having destroyed the gilt-edged markets, they are now determined to seize the equity market as well.</q>
Although late in the field, therefore, the Liberals issued that warning. I do not know where they have been since 1951, but there it is.<br/>
Here we have a scheme, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;and I sum up what I have said&#x2014;which, to meet the obligations to the Indian pensioners&#x2014;which I fully support&#x2014;comes out with a special treatment of them which allows the trustees to invest that money in equities, against the advice of the Conservative Central Office, of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, of Sir Oscar Hobson, and of all the City wise men&#x2014;against the advice of the Liberal


Party, and, probably, if we only knew it, against the advice of the National Liberals and everyone else. Against all that advice, the Minister advocates the scheme without giving us any real details at all.<br/>
As I say, I am fully in support of the scheme, but I would really have liked the hon. Gentleman, in introducing the Order, to have told us how much money is involved and how many pensioners are left. Is it a large or a small sum of money? Has it accrued, or has it diminished? I rather guess that only a very small number of people and a very small amount of money are involved, but the principle is important, and we have seen the passionate advocacy of the scheme by the hon. Gentleman in opening this debate.<br/>
It proves that all these other statements that I have read&#x2014;which distressed you so much, Mr. Speaker, that you found them out of order&#x2014;are, in fact, eyewash. No one at all believes them. We all know that the State has an obligation to the pensioner which we must meet as best we can. And if we appoint Commissioners to look after those interests, we expect them to do what the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Kensington, South or the Minister says they should do&#x2014;to make the best of the market.<br/>
I shall certainly, in my constituency, give wide publicity at the next Election to the speech of the Minister, and I hope that, through the Order now before us, the light may shine gradually into the minds of hon. Members opposite, first, into the minds of those few who are here to see that there is not a count, and then into the minds of those in the Library and other parts of the Palace, until, finally, Mr. Oliver Poole becomes demoted to Deputy Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>The Minister has given us a clear statement of the facts, and, of course, those of us who had had opportunity of reading the Order and the Explanatory Note were already acquainted with those.<br/>
I thought that the right hon. Gentleman did less than justice when he intro-

duced political acrimony into a discussion of an Order which all of us&#x2014;at least, all those who knew anything about it&#x2014;were agreed upon. If he had taken the trouble to see that during the period of the Labour Government, on 28th June, 1950, a scheme of this kind was introduced for exactly the purpose contained herein, he would have noted that many of the facts adduced by him tonight were just those which were advanced by myself, deputising for the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations on a later occasion, my right hon. Friend being then out of the country.<br/>
As one of my hon. Friends has said, I was then Secretary for Overseas Trade. In the OFFICIAL REPORT for 6th July, 1950, column 789, the Minister will be able to see for himself that I advanced the arguments which he has put forward in order to secure the acceptance of the Order.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Attorney-General who then sought to cross swords with me was not in any way as competent as my hon. Friends who put most searching questions tonight. All that the Attorney-General could then do was to criticise one failing in the presentation of the scheme, and even this Government do not learn by experience, because they have made the same mistake on this occasion. I will pursue that no further, but I am bound to say that I hope the Minister will be in a position to give satisfactory answers to the very searching questions already put to him. I should like to add some for myself.<br/>
I well know the knowledge on this subject of the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens), having seen him during his period of excellent service in India and discussed with him many of these matters. He will know that there were four funds originally, intended to provide for the widows and children of certain military and civil officers of the Indian Service. Those funds were, in due course, transferred to the Commissioners in the United Kingdom. We do not often pay tribute to the excellent work which was done by those members of the Indian Service; they did a first-class job, which is now being recognised by Indians themselves. Indeed, as we know, a good many of them were encouraged to remain behind and carry on in the Government of India as


a separate independent Republic, and some are still serving. We have an obligation to these loyal ex-civil servants and their dependants which we must meet. We do what we can, and by this Order we are doing something, to see that they get a just reward.<br/>
Some of my hon. Friends, however, have asked how it can be that the Government can do what is here proposed, on the one hand, and, on the other, see the old-age pensioners suffer in this country. There is a responsibility towards both the Indian civil servants and their dependants and towards old-age pensioners here. Indeed, I would say to the Lord Privy Seal, who interrupted to say it is ridiculous, that if the Government had seen to it that recent investments in B.P. had been made by the Government to help old-age pensioners, that would have been something worth while. However, they did not show the same keen interest in the old-age pensioner in this country as they are rightly showing in pensions for the ex-Indian civil servant and Army officer.<br/>
Is there one set of Commissioners or are there two? As I understand, there is a separate system for the Civil Service and for the military officers. Is one set of Commissioners controlling both, or are there two? If there are two, can we be told more about them?<br/>
The Minister has told us that the Public Trustee is one member; there is a Commonwealth Relations officer who also is a representative. In the case of these representatives, I am sure that they are the most desirable candidates for posts as commissioners. We can offer no other than support for the elected representatives of the pensioners, those whom the pensioners sought to put in a position of responsibility. They must have faith in them. The other one is the City representative. I am sure that, whoever this representative may be, he knows all about selling gilt-edged stock. Perhaps we could know who he is and the association with whom he works. We have a right to know that.<br/>
I would also ask the Minister why it has been necessary to make an alteration in the four-year period. There is something to be said for continuity and having a man in a position where he knows that he will serve for a given period. Now the period is to be reduced.

There may be some good reason, but we should be told.<br/>
The other reason for the Order is that it is for the extension and consolidation of the commissioners' power of investment. They are now having the power to invest in industrial concerns&#x2014;something which the Labour Government, when elected, is to do in a bigger way for the benefit of the people generally.<br/>
Some of my hon. Friends have been threatening to vote. They are doing so not because they are out of sympathy with the Bill, but because their threat is one of hostility to the policy of the Chancellor. This is not the occasion to exercise a vote of that kind.<br/>
I think we are in a false position. We find that hon. Members on the benches opposite are supporting Labour Party policy. I do not know what the reactionery members of the Conservative Party will say when they hear about this, or what the "Suez Group" will say. Significantly, they are absent tonight. We will leave it for difficulties to develop in the party opposite. There will be another split, and then an opportunity for a Labour Government to introduce this kind of Bill not only for Indian Civil Servants, but for pensioners generally in this country.</p>

<p>We have given to what is a fairly narrow measure a good deal of attention and, as the right hon.

<p>First, let me refer to the commissioners. There are four groups of commissioners, each of which deals with a separate fund, there being four funds comprised in the scope of this particular scheme. The representative who brings to it expert knowledge of insurance problems, and who is nominated by the Secretary of State, is somebody who does not represent any particular firm


or group of firms, but who was selected because of his experience and because of the value of the advice he can give to his fellow commissioners.<br/>
I am certain that the right hon. Gentleman, when he was in office, was aware of this arrangement, which is similar today to what it has been for many years past, and will realise the value of the work which Mr. Shrewsbury, the representative concerned, has done in, the interests of what all hon. Members will regard as a very deserving fund and a deserving set of people.</p>

<p>I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, for your help and guidance. There are some of us in the House who have a feeling that the Chief Whip is about to ask you to accept the Motion for the Closure. May I ask you what the position is? Would you bear in mind that the rule was suspended at 3.30 p.m. today to enable these matters to be properly and fully debated? Could we have an assurance that such a Motion would not be accepted?</p>

<p>I think the hon. Member for Manchester, Cheetham (Mr. H. Lever) was under a misapprehension when he accused the Secretary of State of failing in his duties and of not taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the recent B.P. issue. The hon. Member was not aware that in this matter of investment the commissioners, once appointed, act completely independently. The Secretary of State has no duties or functions in investment. The commissioners themselves act as independent trustees and use their prudent judgment as to what may be most in the interests of the funds over which they have control.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it was the commissioners' view that, unlike every other professional investor, they should not exercise their right in priority over something like half the B.P. debenture stock?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.375.4" hansard_membership_id="518" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11754" speakername="Mr. Alport" colnum="375" time="">
<p>I am not saying anything of the sort. The hon. Member showed a very great knowledge of all the various aspects of the work of investment. It was very interesting, coming from those

benches, considering what has been said in the past upon this subject. I thought he knew this matter very well, and would, therefore, have realised that this is quite irrelevant to the point I am making, which is that, contrary to what the hon. Member said, the Secretary of State has no responsibilities for any selection of investment on behalf of these funds.<br/>
What we are trying to do by this Order is simply to obtain for the commissioners of these four funds the same sort of facilities as are available to any trustee on application to the courts. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens) was quite correct when he said that these are private funds. These are moneys subscribed exclusively by the subscribers to these funds over the period of their service. They are not added to by the Government in any way. We have always treated it, and rightly, as being a fund over which the subscribers have a very considerable say.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member will allow me to reply to the questions which have been raised. There have been many, and I am doing my best to reply to them.<br/>
It is perfectly true that the salaries were originally paid by the Government but no contribution has been made from Government funds, comparable to what, I think I am right in saying, is the principle behind the Socialist Party's superannuation scheme.<br/>
I turn to another question raised by the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart). He asked me for an explanation of paragraph 12A (1). I should explain to him that this is merely a carry-over paragraph from an earlier Order, and the same as one which was included in the Order of 1950, I think, passed by the Labour Government. There is nothing sinister in this, as he suspected. It is included to ensure that the Commissioners have the full facilities which they require for the normal conduct of their business with these funds.<br/>
I was asked by the hon. Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn) what was the number of pensioners. It is 3,400. He also asked me the amount of the


funds. The amount of the funds is at present at cost about &#x00A3;10&#x00BD; million. It will, therefore, be seen that only &#x00A3;3 million, or thereabouts, is at issue in the question of the investment in equity shares or preference shares. Therefore, the amount involved is very small indeed.<br/>
A number of hon. Gentleman on the other side tried to draw a parallel between this small amendment relating to what, to all intents and purposes, are private funds and the major scheme which they are in the process of launching politically, but there is no parallel at all. My hon. Friends do not in any way begrudge hon. Gentlemen opposite that they should have taken this opportunity of bringing out their pet scheme from the oblivion which has fallen on it in recent weeks; but I can</p>

<p>After our recent exercise in rather old style Parliamentary adventures, I hope that the House will forgive me if, without preamble, I plunge straightaway into the subject of the Adjournment debate. We have not much time, and the subject is a very important one to my constituents.<br/>
A month ago, on 16th November, the manager of the British Transport Commission's East Coast Scottish ports wrote to the Transport Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland. The gist of his letter was that consideration was being given to the closing down of Bo'ness Dock and Harbour on the Firth of Forth. The reason given for such a drastic proposal was that the dock had never paid its way during the ten years that it had been under the ownership of the Commission. It was stated in the letter that the total loss to the Commission during the ten years was almost &#x00A3;292,000. That is a calculation which I shall examine critically in a moment.<br/>
The manager's letter does not constitute an official approach such as is required by the appropriate section of the Transport Act, 1947. I am informed that the Transport Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland does not so regard it. It takes it as a courteous notification by the manager of a possible approach to one method of solving the financial problems of Bo'ness dock and a means whereby the problem can be brought sharply to the attention of everyone concerned, and it feels that it should be given an opportunity to state its views.<br/>
My speech tonight is the earliest indication of those views, and there will be many other indications before the matter is officially discussed by the Consultative Committee. It is an indication that the proposal to close Bo'ness dock, although it is at the moment tentative and exploratory, has caused astonishment, dismay and alarm among the townspeople, tradesmen and shipping interests of Bo'ness.<br/>
Within the brief time limit of this debate I shall endeavour not only to state the case for the retention of the dock but to submit suggestions as to how losses could have been avoided in the past and can be eliminated in the future. I shall also state why there is a very strong local belief that there has been undue discrimination by the Commission against the dock and harbour, and I shall also endeavour to submit that it would be more costly in the long term to close the dock than to retain it and put it into proper order.<br/>
First let me examine the bald statement that the total loss to the Commission from operating the dock during the past ten years was &#x00A3;292,000. No details at all were given. No information was supplied as to what proportions of this global figure were incurred by dredging costs, maintenance and repairs, wages, administration costs, or any other costs of operating the dock during the period.<br/>
There are no details of the annual costs in each of the ten years. There is no breakdown of the figures at all; there is just the bald statement of that global sum, spent over the decade. So far as I can ascertain, no allowance is made for the fact that the dredging and other costs of bringing the dock into usable condition after the war, when it was used by the Royal Navy as a training depot, were charged to Bo'ness Dock, or that any contribution to those costs was made by the Admiralty or by the L.N.E.R., who previously controlled the dock.<br/>
It will be seen that without these details it is very difficult to make a proper analysis of the total alleged losses. I am informed that two-thirds of these losses were incurred during the first five of these ten years, and that the remaining five years have accounted for only one-third of the total. In other words, the losses during the immediate post-war years were heavy, in all probability due to the high costs of rehabilitation after enforced war-time neglect, and in more recent years the losses have been a diminishing factor. It is my belief that with adequate dredging, reasonable encouragement and more general trade, this dock could be brought out of the red and could become a valuable asset to the Commission.<br/>
It is clear that more dock facilities will be required in the Bo'ness-Grangemouth area. Developments in this area are confidently expected. The House has fairly recently been considering&#x2014;and it will again be doing so in the future&#x2014;some very important potential developments in this area. The tendency towards European free trade will demand increased portage in the Firth of Forth, particularly for the smaller type of vessel for which Bo'ness is so well suited. It may well be that after all the various inquiries into the siting of the proposed new strip mill Grangemouth will be decided upon as the venue. I hope that it will, and if it is there will be a very great increase in the portage, wharfage and berthage required in the Bo'ness-Grangemouth area.<br/>
At present, in addition to its own trade Bo'ness takes the surplus trade from Grangemouth during the not infrequent times of congestion there. We do not grudge Grangemouth her increased trade in the docks. I am very glad to see that my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) here at this small hour of the morning in support of this case. I appreciate his attendance, and I assure him and his constituents that there is no grudge on the part of the constituents of the Burgh of Bo'ness about the prosperity of his burgh, which we hope will increase. In fact, the more it increases the more certain it is to require to use the present berthage of Bo'ness Dock.<br/>
If Bo'ness closed down additional berths would be required at Grangemouth, and the construction of even equivalent berths would involve a very heavy&#x2014;I was about to say gigantic&#x2014;expenditure, because it is a very expensive business to provide new docks, wharves and berths. Obviously, it would be very bad economics to incur this expenditure when the same result could be obtained at a low cost by the adaption of existing facilities as close at hand as Bo'ness, which is 2&#x00BD; miles away from the dock gates.<br/>
Since the development of Grangemouth Docks, and until the beginning of the war, Bo'ness Docks were mainly operated to supply the needs of the coal industry. While, at present, it has a general trade in goods like fertilisers, cement, scrap

iron and timber, and while that trade could be developed, it is still possible for some practical encouragement to be given to the National Coal Board to use the dock more than it does.<br/>
The Commission has not claimed that its losses have been caused by overspending at Bo'ness, and no one could possibly make such a claim. It would be difficult to spend less than has been spent in maintenance. On dredging costs, the only expenditure of any importance in recent years has been &#x00A3;25,000 on the electrification of a power station, an economic measure, just completed, which is expected to pay for itself within three years. The other was the replacement of a weighing machine, which was absolutely necessary.<br/>
I am sorry to say that the Commission does not appear to realise the extent to which it has discouraged the use of the docks by shipowners and traders by neglect and the curtailment of facilities. The dredging arrangements have been consistently inadequate, inefficient and woefully out of date. The harbour has been allowed to silt up and sometimes vessels roll away from the berth because of the condition of the ground under the water and the fact that a vessel cannot settle flat on the ground. The equipment used for dredging is ludicrously obsolete. It consists of a bucket dredger, two barges and a tug. The barges can be filled in less than two hours. They then have to be towed down the Firth to the seaward side of the Forth Bridge. By the time they return it is too late for another load that day. It is estimated that it is costing the Commission 4s. per ton to remove mud from Bo'ness.<br/>
At the beginning of the year something very encouraging happened. A vigorous dredging programme began to operate. Great progress was made and conditions were better than anything experienced since the end of the war. Then, suddenly, all dredging stopped. No explanation was given, but there were rumours that the harbour berth was to be left to silt up and the berth put out of action. This welcome but too temporary increase in dredging activity coincided with the appointment of Captain Cooper as dredging master. He was a popular and highly efficient officer whose activities were beginning to transform the port. We now understand that his services have been terminated. Certainly, effective


dredging has been stopped and we wonder why an explanation was not given.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman may recall that in 1948 his Ministry appointed a working party to investigate the shipping turn-round in British ports. This working party recommended that the crane facilities in Bo'ness should be modernised as cranes became available. In spite of this Bo'ness was informed that the port would not get new cranes. During my youth I worked as a docker and I regard this matter with knowledge of the technical problems involved. It was a good many years ago when I was a docker, but even in my opinion the dock is old-fashioned.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman may recollect, if he has looked up the records of his Department, that four years ago the docks manager was in favour of removing the most efficient single piece of equipment on the dock, the turntable turning the best coal hoist in Bo'ness. I had to fight hard in this House to retain that turntable. There is not the slightest doubt that this dock has been neglected to a most reprehensible extent. I am not in the habit of using exaggerated language, but I believe that that statement is not an exaggeration; if anything, it is an understatement. Three or four years ago the dock police were withdrawn and a great deal of avoidable damage has been done to buildings and equipment. There are long delays in the services of maintenance and repairs. Naturally, and understandably, a strong volume of local opinion has grown up to the effect that this dock has been deliberately written down and neglected, and, some go as far as to say, sabotaged. There is a feeling that there is a strong managerial prejudice against the dock.<br/>
These views have been expressed with vehemence which is not conducive to good relations. I do not wish to exacerbate those feelings, but I claim that it would be a great injustice to close the dock. It would be an injustice to the shipping agents who have struggled against heavy odds to maintain the trade of the port. It would be an injustice to the dockers who, although they can find alternative work on Grangemouth docks, naturally prefer to work their own dock when trade is available.

It would be an injustice to the traders of Bo'ness, who depend on the import and export of goods and do not deserve to be deprived of facilities on which their businesses were founded, and an injustice to the Commission.<br/>
I believe that it might be made a paying concern. I claim that it would be possible, at comparatively low cost, to revitalise this dock and make it a port especially attractive to smaller vessels, for which there is a considerable and developing future. The Transport Acts of 1947 and 1953 both imposed certain general duties on the Commission, including the safeguarding of the needs of the public, of agriculture, of commerce and of industry. These needs exist in Bo'ness as well as elsewhere. Apart from the general welfare of the burgh, about 850 people are more or less directly concerned in the operation of the port. They are worried and distressed by the suggestion that it should be closed.<br/>
I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has no direct ministerial responsibility in this matter and that all we can do tonight is to voice the anxieties and hope that they will be taken note of in the proper quarter. In doing so, I speak with the full support of every citizen of Bo'ness.</p>

<p>I am very glad to have this opportunity of replying to the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. J. Taylor) on the question he has raised as to the future of the Port of Bo'ness, because I know it is of considerable concern to his constituents and that he has presented his case in an admirable and effective way.<br/>
The hon. Member realises as well as I do that this is a matter for the British Transport Commission and that it will be for the Commission to decide, eventually, what the future of this port is to be. It has not made any decision yet. So far as the Transport Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland is concerned, if it makes representations to my right hon. Friend he will consider them. I will come to that point in a moment.<br/>
First, I would like to reply to the suggestion that this port has, in fact been neglected by the Commission, because


I do not think that that is really true. I cannot tonight deal with all the figures relating to the years since 1948, when it became vested in the British Transport Commission, but I would like to send the hon. Member some of the figures of the expenditure on this port, both on dredging and on other works.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has suggested that the Commission has consistently neglected the dock and has not given it essential equipment; and that the dredging has been quite inadequate. I think that when I send him the figures he will probably agree that expenditure has been maintained at a consistently high level since 1948. In 1956, it was &#x00A3;27,329, and during the last eighteen months&#x2014;as I think he himself knows&#x2014;the electrification of the pumping plant at the hydraulic power station has been completed at a cost of &#x00A3;25,000, and the timber jetties at the dock entrance have been replaced at a cost of &#x00A3;7,000.<br/>
I am informed that no equipment has been removed from the port since the Commission took it over&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not exactly dispute it, but attempts were made to remove very valuable equipment, and we had to raise the matter in the House in an attempt to prevent that being done.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-12-17a.385.3" hansard_membership_id="9733" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18802" speakername="Mr. Neave" colnum="385" time="">
<p>I am informed that, in fact, that has not happened and, if he made those attempts, the hon. Gentleman has so far succeeded.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman made a great point about dredging, but in fact, I am told that more dredging is being done now than there was before the war. From 1932 to 1939 inclusive, the annual average tonnage dredged amounted to 71,690 tons. Since 1948, the annual figure has been 78,600 tons; and for 1957 the figure will be even higher&#x2014;in the neighbourhood of 85,000 tons. It is, therefore, not fair to say that dredging is not being carried out at the highest level possible at the present time.<br/>
Perhaps I may go now into the difficulties which the Commission has experienced with regard to the port, which has fallen on difficult times. One of the

problems is that there has been a decline in the export of coal for foreign and coastal trade, and in the import of pit props&#x2014;the two main trades for which the port was primarily constructed. That has, of course, caused financial difficulties for the Commission.<br/>
The only coal for export now is the bunkering given to the few coal-burning vessels that come to the port; and pit props no longer need to be imported in the same quantity, because they are now being provided in increasing quantities by the Scottish home timber industry. That has resulted in a decline in the total volume of imports and exports at the port from 200,000 tons in 1948 to 156,000 tons in 1956. The outlook is rather depressing. It is not a very bright picture.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the financial position, and I might say that, since 1948, for every &#x00A3; of revenue that the Commission has received it has spent nearly &#x00A3;2 8s. on maintenance and operation expenses&#x2014;not counting the interest charges on capital invested. I will not go into those further, because I should like to send him all the figures that I have, so that he can study them, and he will then, I think, find the position to be as I have stated.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman will be aware, of course, that neither the Commission nor my right hon. Friend have any power to direct shipowners, exporters or importers, as to which port they should use. He mentioned that he thought the Coal Board should play a part in this matter. It is perfectly true that the coal industry was once the mainstay of the port, but the Board regrets that it cannot see its way to produce the traffic for it, nor do shipowners and merchants seem able to help.<br/>
The position, therefore, as the hon. Gentleman states, is that the Transport Commission's Docks Manager for the East Coast Scottish Ports has written, to the various interested bodies, the letter of 16th November which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and, in particular, to the Transport Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland. It is, I think, technically right to state that the Commission has, in part, referred the problem to the Committee for consideration under the Transport Act, 1947. Of course, it has also been referred to other interested bodies. It is for the Transport Users' Consulta-


tive Committee to consider what action it wishes to take, and I understand that the Committee has asked these other bodies to inform them of any objections which they may wish to make to the possible closure of the port. I understand that meetings are likely to be held with representative of the Commission on this whole matter. Obviously, my right hon. Friend, as I have said, will give serious consideration to any recommendation that the Consultative Committee may make to him on the subject.<br/>
I should like to express to the hon. Member for West Lothian my sympathy

in this problem, and I want him to understand that we realise the anxiety which is felt in his constituency. I should not like to go into the question of Grangemouth at this stage, particularly since we have here tonight the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson), who represents that part of the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for West Lothian will, I hope, realise how matters stand and will accept our assurance that we shall view the problem sympathetically.</p>
