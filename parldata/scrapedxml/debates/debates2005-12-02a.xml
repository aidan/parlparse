	<p pid="a.503.1/1">The whole House has benefited from my hon. Friend's astute clarification which, I hope, will lead to even greater support for the Bill. I asked the Home Office for the level of burglary detection in each of the past eight years. Incredibly, it has fallen dramatically. When the Conservatives left government in 1997, 23 per cent. of burglaries were detected by the police in England and Wales. As of 2001&ndash;02, that rate had reduced to 12 per cent., and the detection rates for offences of burglary recorded by the police in England and Wales was only 13 per cent. in 2004. Right hon. and hon. Members will know that many people who report burglaries, particularly of vehicles, are simply given a police number. Those burglaries are not investigated or detected, so the offenders are never brought to book. Even more worryingly, only 3.6 per cent. of defendants were convicted in burglary in the courts in 2004&ndash;05. In the same year, only 1.6 per cent. of defendants were sentenced to immediate custody or given a custodial sentence for burglary.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/2">What message are we as legislators giving victims and, indeed, potential burglars other than suggesting that burglary is completely risk-free? To receive a criminal sentence and be designated a criminal someone must be accused, and their crime must be detected, recorded and prosecuted. The figures show that that is simply not happening. In clause 2, I seek to extend the provisions of the Bill to Northern Ireland, and I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Newark, because when his Bill was in Committee he said that such measures should be relevant to Northern Ireland as well as to England and Wales. I would like the provisions of my Bill to extend to Scotland, as I am qualified as a Scottish advocate, albeit a non-practising one. I hope to pursue that proposal if I am fortunate enough to see my Bill proceed to Committee. Under proposed new subsection (1A), a property owner is not guilty of an offence unless they use &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot; force and unless the excessive nature of that force is apparent to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.504.1/1">My hon. Friend has been listening closely, as the Criminal Justice Act 2003 sets out the test for an offence to be grossly disproportionate. The Government had to revisit the issue in the light of the claim by Brendan Fearon against Tony Martin in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk. Brendan Fearon was granted legal aid, reportedly to claim compensation of &pound;15,000 for the injuries that he received. I delighted that in September 2003 the case was settled out of court when Brendan Fearon dropped his claim and Tony Martin therefore dropped his counter-claim. Such cases make a mockery of the law. I am arguing, with the support of my hon. Friends, that we need a consistent test. Burglars should not be able to sue us for damages that we may inflict on them when they intrude and trespass on our property and commit a criminal act so, under the Bill, there is a higher test of grossly proportionate force for the householder.</p>

	<p pid="a.506.0/1">Initially, I shall ask some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1896" name="Anne McIntosh">the questions that the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh)</phrase> did not allow me to put during her own presentation. The first is that the crucial distinction made by her Bill by comparison with the current state of affairs is to replace the test of reasonableness with the test of gross disproportionality. She was asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase>, who left the Chamber immediately afterwards, what would happen if his wife set the dog on an intruder. The hon. Lady responded&mdash;with respect to her&mdash;evasively, saying that that was a matter for the courts to decide. Is that not a classic example of the state of uncertainty, about which she and her hon. Friends complain, in the current situation?</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/2">At present, if the hon. Lady were to break into my house and I had to decide how far I could deter her, I would have to consider what would be deemed reasonable. Under her Bill, I would have to consider what was grossly disproportionate. It is possible to imagine situations where behaviour is unreasonable but not grossly disproportionate, or cases where it is grossly disproportionate but not unreasonable.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/3">Let us take, for example, the case of the British tourist who, in one of the southern states of America, one dark night got lost. He went up the path to a remote house and wanted to ask the way. As he approached, the nervous householder, who I believe had been burgled several times, thought he was another intruder and shot the tourist dead. We could all agree that that was grossly disproportionate&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Some of us would.&quot;] Unlike the hon. Lady, I shall be glad to give way if she wishes to intervene, but I hope she would agree that that was grossly disproportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/4">Could we also say that that was unreasonable? Looking at the case, at least through British eyes, we would say, yes, it was unreasonable. But suppose the householder had not shot the tourist dead, but merely wounded him. An American court, and, I submit, a British court might in that case have said, &quot;Well, this is grossly disproportionate&mdash;using a firearm to attack somebody who has not yet done anything worse than walk up the drive&mdash;but is it unreasonable?&quot; One could argue that with a history of burglaries, it is understandable if the householder feels nervous.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/5">Here we have a case where the householder would be prosecuted under the hon. Lady's Bill, but not under the current law. Her Bill would replace one uncertainty with another uncertainty. That is being done not in order to resolve the uncertainty&mdash;if that was her intention she would merely adopt the formulation that the householder can do anything on his own premises&mdash;but to seek partisan advantage, by pretending to bring forward a different form of words which in practice would do nothing to reassure the householder that they would be able to operate. The householder would have exactly the same dilemma: to judge what a court might think of his or her behaviour&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.509.3/1">Yes; that returns me to my dialogue with the hon. Member for North Thanet. The issue has been exploited for partisan purposes, and it has also been whipped up by elements in the press. If one reads the <i>Daily Express</i> every day, and one only reads the <i>Daily Express</i>, it is very difficult to retain the will to live. <i>[Laughter.]</i> Every day, the front page contains a new catastrophe, a new sell-out, a new betrayal and a new threat to the existence of the British human race. Among the terrible catastrophes that the <i>Daily Express</i> describes is an alleged failure of the law to give due account to the position of the householder.</p>

	<p pid="a.510.5/1">Yes, I do agree. That is one of the fundamental difficulties about the Bill. Frankly, it is an example of gesture politics. If the Conservative party were in government, we would be sitting on the Opposition Benches saying that it is an example of the Government trying to be seen to do something. However, there is no evidence that it would make any concrete difference. I do not believe that a British jury would make this very fine distinction between unreasonable behaviour and grossly disproportionate behaviour. In a case such as that of Tony Martin, the jury would convict in either event. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley described his experience with a shoplifter. In a case such as that, the jury would acquit in either event. Indeed, I do not think that the Crown Prosecution Service would not attempt to prosecute in such cases. As I understand it, it was not only the hon. Gentleman's immunity that protected him from prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="a.522.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The issue between us is whether people should be able to defend their property reasonably and within the law or to make a disproportionate response.</p>
	<p pid="a.522.0/2">Being burgled is a frightening experience, and householders who react instinctively and attack intruders will be prosecuted under the existing law only if they use very excessive force. Only in the most extreme circumstances are householders prosecuted for violence against burglars. The Director of Public Prosecutions made it clear on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-12">12 January</phrase> that prosecution would be considered only in those extreme circumstances. The law also takes account of the fact that a person under attack or being robbed may be frightened or confused. When they find an intruder at 3 o'clock in the morning, a person cannot be expected to judge to a nicety the level of force that might be required to defend themselves against the threat posed. The law quite simply asks that the person should act instinctively and honestly. We must be clear about that: the law, and every part of the criminal justice system, must, and do, support the right to self-defence.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-02a.522.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="522"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051202/debtext/51202-09.htm#51202-09_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.522.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that and may refer later to some other points in that CPS memorandum. She is absolutely right: does the hon. Member for Vale of York want householders to have the right to hang, draw and quarter intruders, for example; or a gentleman in his castle to be able to pour boiling oil on them from the battlements? It is difficult to see what else householders should be permitted to do under the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.522.2/2">We should not underestimate the emotional impact of burglary. In the British crime survey 2004&ndash;05, 86 per cent. of respondents were emotionally affected by burglary, and if there was forced entry, too, the figure was 89 per cent. The responses experienced include: anger, at 56 per cent. for all burglaries and 63 per cent. for burglary with entry; annoyance, at 46 per cent. and 51 per cent. for burglary with entry; shock, for 36 per cent. at burglary and 42 per cent. at burglary with entry; and a loss of confidence or feeling of vulnerability, for 27 per cent. and 30 per cent. That illustrates how serious the offence of burglary is, and we need to take it seriously in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.522.2/3">That said, I do not think that the Bill is an appropriate response. Much has been made by the Conservative party of the support that it claims the public have for the Bill. That raises the question of what the public actually know about the existing law. The Bill's proponents pray in aid various opinion polls, particularly that on the &quot;Today&quot; programme. Last time we debated this subject, my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North&mdash;the recipient, to put it neutrally, of the &quot;Today&quot; poll&mdash;made it clear that it was not an honest poll. He said that it was not</p>
	<p pid="a.522.2/4" class="indent">&quot;the honest listeners of Radio 4&mdash;as far as I can gather, they were all on the slopes at Chamonix at the time&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.522.2/5">The poll, he said, was in fact rigged by</p>
	<p pid="a.522.2/6" class="indent">&quot;a group of website gun fanatics, headed by an organisation called Cybershooters, who orchestrated a campaign against me.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-04">4 February 2005</phrase>; Vol. 430, c. 1109.]</p>
	<p pid="a.522.2/7">One must question whether the &quot;Today&quot; programme was the victim of practices that one can compare only with the way in which people vote in &quot;Big Brother&quot;, or similar television programmes, such as the dancing one on Saturday nights at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.522.2/8">It is interesting that the Conservative party is prepared to claim public support for how it has approached the Bill, but when it came to the recent Bill on terrorism, on which 76 per cent. of the public back the police on the 90-day minimum, 72 per cent. supported 90-day detention and 77 per cent. said the police should have the powers that they said they needed, the Conservatives, for purely opportunistic reasons, voted against the wishes of the public. How on earth have they the bottle to come here today claiming the support of the public&mdash;with no opinion polls to speak of behind them&mdash;given the very clear message from the public on that previous Bill? That smacks, at the very least, of double standards, and I shall not use the unparliamentary term hypocrisy.</p>

	<p pid="a.525.2/2">Does my hon.

For example, is it not illogical and irrational that the victim of a rape in a park will be allowed to use only reasonable force to defend herself whereas the victim of a burglary in a house would be able to use grossly disproportionate force?</p>

	<p pid="a.535.3/1">I hope to deal with that shortly, because it is important that we understand where the law stands.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.3/2">I was talking about the black letter law expounded by Lord Morris, who was explaining the common law in the case of Palmer. Basically, it is a common sense test, and who can object to that? Many other myths have developed. In paragraph 19.42 in the section on offences against the person in &quot;Archbold&quot;, the old rule that a man who is attacked must retreat as far as he can has disappeared. Whether the accused retreated is only one factor for the jury to consider when determining whether force was reasonably necessary. Moreover, the same paragraph states that there is no rule of law that a man must wait until he is struck before striking in self-defence. If another person strikes at him he is entitled to make his blow first if it is reasonably necessary to do so in self-defence. The existing law therefore goes further than most people think.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.3/3">Moreover, if the defence of self-defence is offered, the burden of disproving it is on the prosecution, not on the defendant facing trial. &quot;Archbold&quot; says that where such a defence is offered, the burden of negativing it rests on the prosecution. If, on consideration of all the evidence, the jury is convinced of the innocence of the prisoner&mdash;&quot;Archbold&quot; uses old terminology because it is citing an old case&mdash;or is left in doubt as to whether he was acting in necessary self-defence it should acquit. In the Crown <i>v.</i> Abraham the Court of Appeal said that a judge should deal with the issue by telling the jury that someone who acts reasonably in self-defence commits no unlawful act. Just as it is for the Crown to show that the plea of not guilty is not acceptable, so the Crown must convince the jury beyond reasonable doubt that self-defence has no basis in the present case. There are therefore many safeguards in the existing law.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.3/4">We must also look at the charging standard text used by the CPS, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-26">26 November 2004</phrase> and tells CPS staff how they should approach such cases. Prosecutors must consider all assaults in the context in which they were allegedly committed. Particular care must be taken in dealing with cases of assault where the allegation is made by a &quot;victim&quot; who, at the time, was engaged in criminal activity himself. An example relevant to today's debate is a burglar who claims to have been assaulted by the occupier of the premises concerned. Prosecutors are reminded that it is lawful to use reasonable force in the following circumstances&mdash;self-defence; to defend another person; to defend property; to prevent crime; and to lawfully arrest someone. Where the use of force in such circumstances is reasonable the assailant&mdash;the person about whom we are concerned&mdash;has an absolute defence, and charges relating to the assault should not be brought. Paragraph 5 of the CPS charging standard text therefore sets out the position in black and white.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.3/5">The advice to prosecutors continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.535.3/6" class="indent">&quot;In assessing the reasonableness of the force two questions should be asked: was the force used justified in all the circumstances? . . . and was the first force used excessive&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.535.3/7">The courts have shown that both questions are to be answered on the basis of the facts, as the accused&mdash;the householder&mdash;honestly believed them to be. To return to my exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting, the test is a subjective one. The issue of whether a reasonable person would regard the force used as reasonable or excessive is the subsequent question, not the primary question.</p>

	<p pid="a.539.3/1">My hon. Friend is right. Juries have common sense. Most of the few cases that did reach trial resulted in the acquittal of those involved, and I believe that those that did not reach trial would have resulted in convictions under the proposed law.</p>

I am not currently persuaded that there is a need to change the law.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="1993-12-14">14 December 1993</phrase>; Vol. 234, c. 533W.]</p>

	<p pid="a.540.7/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for clarifying his position.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/2">The position of the Association of Chief Police Officers has not changed since the hon. Member for Newark introduced his Bill. When the leaflet that I mentioned was launched, Chris Fox, the then ACPO chair, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/3" class="indent">&quot;We want everyone to clearly understand that they can use force to protect themselves or others. The force used should be reasonable force.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/4">Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, gave his support to the ACPO position after the problems that he had had on the &quot;Today&quot; programme on his first day. The Metropolitan police have since indicated that that remains their position. We already know that the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the same view.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/5">Mr. Anthony Scrivener QC, who was Tony Martin's barrister, has said on several occasions that he believes that the law is right. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-14">14 December 2004</phrase>r, he said in the <i>Eastern Daily Press</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/6" class="indent">&quot;The law is simple and weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the householder.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-15">15 December 2004</phrase>, <i>The Times</i> quoted him as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/8" class="indent">&quot;Even if the suggested test of grossly disproportionate force had been used it is likely that the jury would still have convicted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/9">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/10" class="indent">&quot;The law is quite right to favour the use of force against them&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/11">the intruders&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.540.7/12" class="indent">&quot;in such a situation, as it already does&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.568.3/1">My hon. Friend is right, but I am just trying to do the best I can by applying a little common sense to the definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.3/2">The promoters have constructed a whole superstructure to suggest that a change in the law is necessary to protect people in certain circumstances, but the examples that I have cited prove that their case is fallacious. In all those cases, people were either not charged or acquitted under existing law. In some cases, the new defence provided by the Bill would not apply because the events happened outside a building. In other cases, they would have fallen foul of the new law because the force used was excessive. I do not understand what the hon. Member for Vale of York would gain, should the House see fit to give her Bill a Second Reading today.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-13">13 January 2005</phrase>, the Crown Prosecution Service issued a press release, listing other examples of cases where people were not prosecuted. There was a robbery at a newsagent in Greater Manchester where one of two robbers died after being stabbed by the newsagent, but the CPS did not prosecute. A householder, who returned home to find a burglar there struggled against him and hit him on the head. The burglar later died, but no prosecution resulted from that case in Derbyshire. Armed robbers threatened a pub landlord and barmaid. The barmaid escaped, fetched her employer's shotgun and shot one of the intruders. She was not prosecuted in that case from Hertfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.3/4">Two burglars entered a household with a knife and threatened a woman. Her husband overcame one of the burglars and stabbed him. The burglar died, but there was no prosecution in that case from Lincolnshire. A middle-aged female took a baseball bat off a burglar and hit him over the head with it, fracturing his skull. The burglar actually made a complaint, but the CPS refused to prosecute in that case from Lancashire. All those cases&mdash;the sort of cases for which the Bill provides protection&mdash;were perfectly adequately dealt with under the existing law of defence of reasonable force.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-02a.578.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" speakername="Peter Bone" colnum="578"  time="014:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051202/debtext/51202-27.htm#51202-27_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.578.1/1">I know how hard my hon. Friend works on behalf of his constituents. I feel a little guilty that secondary school children from Wellingborough are being bussed into Kettering because provision in Wellingborough is insufficient. I shall address his second point later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/2">What was the solution proposed by the local authority and the Government? They decided to force already overcrowded schools to take even more pupils, which damaged the education not only of the pupils forced into those schools, but of all those already there. That should not have been allowed to happen, but unfortunately some children still do not have a school place. Since 2001, there has been a huge amount of growth in my constituency with many, many new families, whose children require secondary school places, moving into the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/3">Over the past four years, there has been an explosion of new development in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">my constituency, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> has referred, and it is set to get much, much worse, with thousands of new homes being built on the order of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Milton Keynes south midlands sub-regional strategy will see 13,000 new homes being built in Wellingborough by 2021, with another 10,000 homes planned for east Northamptonshire, large parts of which are in my constituency. Yet despite the knowledge that those new homes will be built, the Government have not indicated whether the infrastructure will be in place to support new and existing Wellingborough residents and their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/4">Turning to the problems that we face at the moment, there are currently four secondary schools in Wellingborough&mdash;three are foundation schools and one is a community school. I have been told that in Wellingborough between nine and 10 children a month find themselves without a secondary school place and must go through a lengthy process in order to get into a school. For example, a parent came to see me at my surgery last Friday. Mr. Hussein moved back into Wellingborough after being away for two years. He has two children, one of whom is 17 and one of whom is 12. The 17-year-old had previously been educated at a secondary school in Wellingborough, but that school could not re-admit her because it is now over-subscribed. The other child could not get into a secondary school near where they live, and both children were told that they had to go on a waiting list, so they are currently at home with no education at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/5">I have spoken to the local education authority, which will do its best to get those children into a school. However, the process that it uses to place nine or 10 children a month involves a meeting which occurs only once a month and which can only occur after the LEA has been made aware of the situation. It is quite possible that such children will be without any education for three months. Do the Government think that that would be the case if one of Wellingborough's secondary schools had not been knocked down?</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/6">The LEA claims that some secondary school places are available in Wellingborough, but those places are all at the only school in Wellingborough that is in special measures. For many families moving into Wellingborough, there is no choice whatever&mdash;no matter where they live and no matter how far away they are from the school, they must go to the school that is in special measures. That situation is unacceptable, because there must be choice&mdash;parents should have some choice in what school their children go to. I note with interest that the Government's education White Paper advocates parental choice, which is welcome, but unfortunately it is just not happening in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/7">Even those pupils coming from primary schools in Wellingborough are limited for choice. At the Wrenn school last year, there were 280 applicants for 250 year 7 places. Twenty-six people appealed, but only three of those appellants were able to get a place at the school. That means that the school is already, in year 7, three pupils over the number that it considers to be its maximum admission level. The admissions system allows parents to put down a first, second and third choice of schools in Wellingborough, but if their children do not get their first-choice place, they are extremely unlikely to get their second choice, because those will already have been filled.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/8">It is natural that every parent wants their child to go to the best possible school, and inevitable that some schools are better than others, but the most popular schools in my constituency are constantly oversubscribed and struggle with the limited capacity of their school buildings. Let me take one as an example. It is extremely popular and high-achieving. Only 208 places in each year group are available because of the restrictions of building capacity. In fact, the school now has to operate a one-way system on the stairs because the corridors are so full. It is having to use up its reserves to pay for essential maintenance. There is damp on the walls in some of the classrooms and condensation on the windows. This popular and high-achieving school needs Government funding to allow it to remain so. It is simply not big enough, and parts of it are literally falling down.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/9">When I asked the Minister whether provision was being made to build a new secondary school in Wellingborough, I received a written answer stating that as part of the building schools for the future programme, Northamptonshire schools are due to be refurbished or rebuilt over the next six to 14 years. Six to fourteen years? This work needs to be carried out now.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/10">In response to a second question that I asked about a new secondary school in Wellingborough, the Minister said that the Wellingborough area of Northamptonshire is prioritised towards the end of the building schools for the future programme. Apart from the obvious paradox that nothing is prioritised if it is at the end of a list, that means that, three times over, year 7 students could start secondary school and go through the whole of their secondary education before the existing Wellingborough schools are refurbished, yet those schools are in desperate need of repair now.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/11">There is currently no real choice for parents and children in Wellingborough. If children are not granted their first choice of school, they are rarely granted their second choice. The only pupils who seem to have a real choice of school are those with special educational needs. That is most welcome, but although it is important that statemented children should be able to go to the school that parents believe will cater best for the children's needs, it is equally important that the right funding and resources are put into these schools to help facilitate SEN pupils throughout their schooling. I do not believe that that is happening in Wellingborough.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/12">Schools in Wellingborough are oversubscribed and some have been forced to take on extra pupils over their maximum intakes. At Wollaston school, years 7 and 9 are over the 240 maximum. At the Wrenn school years 7, 8 and 10 have more pupils than the 250 maximum. Last year, Sir Christopher Hatton school was oversubscribed by more than 40 pupils who put it down as their first choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/13">It is clear from what I have said today that Wellingborough needs a new secondary school, and given the huge increase in development over the next 15 years, we need it now. I ask the Minister to be good enough to deal with the following points. First, what are the mechanisms necessary to get a new secondary school built? Secondly, when can we realistically expect a new secondary school in Wellingborough to be opened? Thirdly, in the intervening period, will he undertake to look at providing more funding so that existing schools can expand for the benefit of all the pupils in Wellingborough?</p>
	<p pid="a.578.1/14">I believe that the demolition of John Lea school may have been a genuine mistake, but it is essential that the Government, working with the local education authority, take urgent action to correct the situation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-02a.581.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills"  colnum="581"  time="014:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051202/debtext/51202-28.htm#51202-28_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.581.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> on securing this debate. I am aware of his interest in this issue from the parliamentary questions that he has tabled in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/2">Changes to school provision in an area are essentially a matter for local decision. The local authority has a statutory responsibility for planning sufficient school places and for proposing to close schools and to open new ones. These duties are further strengthened in the schools White Paper, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and I shall say more about that later if time allows.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/3">The hon. Gentleman asked about the relevant mechanisms, and I will start by talking about the present school organisation arrangements and why they came about. Before this Government took office in 1997, proposals for changes to schools often came to the Secretary of State for a decision. We considered that those matters were best decided locally, however, and a new system was put in place by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/4">If a local authority decides that there is a need for a new school, it must first consult in the local area. Among those bodies that we advise should be consulted are any schools affected by the proposals, as well as parents and teachers in the area. I am pleased to say that the guidance was revised in September, when local Members of Parliament were added to the list, as were the local district and parish councils in the area in which the schools are situated. Local authorities are responsible for planning for school places in their area. They have a statutory duty to ensure that there are sufficient places and that high quality education is provided in a cost-effective way.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/5">I understand that Northamptonshire updated its school organisation plan in September this year. The new plan shows that the authority expects the number of secondary pupils in Wellingborough to increase gradually between now and 2008. However, there are at present 425 surplus places in the town. I shall come back to that point in more detail in a moment. In the longer term, a new secondary school might be required, and if Northamptonshire decides that such a school is needed to cater for a growth in the local population, the mechanism requires it to hold a competition in accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 2002. We have introduced competitions because we want to encourage a wide range of educational providers to come forward and promote schools that have a strong ethos. This is all part of our aim to drive up standards and to ensure that every child has the opportunity to go to a good school.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/6">As the hon. Gentleman has asked, I shall explain what would happen should Northamptonshire decide to hold a competition. First, the authority would publish a notice inviting interested parties to bring forward proposals for the new secondary school. The authority would then publish a summary of all the proposals received and any that it wished to make itself, as the local authority. Anyone would be able to pass comments on any of the proposals, be they objections or expressions of support. The authority would then submit all proposals and comments to the school organisation committee for consideration. The committee would pass the proposals, with its comments, to the Secretary of State for a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/7">Of course, any promoter may publish proposals for a new foundation or voluntary school at any time, under the existing arrangements, to increase diversity. There does not need to be a general shortage of places. Such proposals are decided by the school organisation committee, or by the schools adjudicator if the committee cannot reach unanimous agreement. The committee may approve proposals only if it is satisfied that any capital necessary to implement the proposals has been secured. I hope that I have described the mechanism in a straightforward manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/8">Under the normal funding arrangements, the Department for Education and Skills is allocating Northamptonshire schools more than &pound;78 million of capital over the next three years. We expect that money to be used for its priority needs, including the provision of statutory school places. It includes an element to cover pupil number increases. However, local authorities can also apply to the targeted capital fund&mdash;the TCF&mdash;every two years, if they have exceptional growth that they cannot fund from other sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/9">Northamptonshire has been allocated &pound;12 million from the TCF for 2006&ndash;07 for a replacement school in another part of the county where it is prioritising need. Northamptonshire did not apply in the TCF round for 2007&ndash;08 funding. It will have a further opportunity in due course to apply for 2008&ndash;09 funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/10">On the revenue side, Northamptonshire has benefited from an increase in its total funding for education of &pound;1,100 per pupil in real terms since 1997. We will announce in the near future the school funding settlement for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, including each local authority's allocations of the new dedicated schools grant for each of those years.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/11">In the longer term, the building schools for the future programme&mdash;a massive investment in schooling&mdash;will support investment in all secondary schools in Northamptonshire, including new schools, where there is a need. Northamptonshire is expected to enter the building schools for the future programme in waves seven to nine&mdash;2011&ndash;14&mdash;with projects in Northampton and Corby. It has proposed five geographical groupings of schools for its building schools for the future investment. Wellingborough, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, is prioritised in the final tranche of investment in waves 13 to 15, in 2017&ndash;18.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/12">I want to set out the detail of the local position that the hon. Gentleman described. I understand that since the closure of the John Lea school more than seven years ago in July 1998, Wellingborough has been served by three secondary schools. The John Lea school was closed because the number of pupils on the roll fell below 50, with more than 90 per cent. surplus places, and funding empty places, as we know, can represent a poor use of resources. The three remaining schools&mdash;Sir Christopher Hatton, the Weavers school and Wrenn school&mdash;now have 425 spare places between them.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/13">I am aware&mdash;and the hon. Gentleman mentioned&mdash;that the Weavers school has been in special measures since November 2004. In conjunction with Ofsted, the authority is addressing that. The new head teacher is helping the process and two additional school governors have been appointed to provide additional support. The local authority is also supporting the school, and there have been discussions with Department for Education and Skills advisers about how that can most effectively be done The Department has partnered Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire for the new relationship with schools. Each school will be allocated a school improvement partner, who are mostly experienced head teachers and senior managers in schools. They will provide high-quality support, challenge and monitoring. Given the hon. Gentleman's concern about the quality of education at that school and its current position, I advise him strongly to get active and join the school and local authority in finding ways in which the school can turn the situation around.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/14">On the question of growth, which has been raised by the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members in the Chamber, the authority is confident that recent enlargements to its secondary schools will provide sufficient capacity to meet future demand for places in the medium term. In the longer term, Northamptonshire might decide that a new secondary school will be required to cater for growth in the local population, but that will be a decision for Northamptonshire at a local level. I understand that there are no current plans to open a further secondary school in Wellingborough, but the local authority will monitor that situation and the progress with growth projections, which he mentioned earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/15">I have described the situation that pertains to date, so I shall briefly mention some of the changes that we propose in the White Paper, which might have some future relevance to the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman. Building on the progress that we have made since 1997, our aim is to transform our school system, so that every child receives an excellent education, whatever their background and wherever they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/16">The White Paper sets out our plans to improve radically the system by putting parents and the needs of their children at the heart of our school system. We will ensure that every school delivers an excellent education, that every child achieves to their potential and that the system as a whole is increasingly driven by parents and by choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/17">We are going to introduce tougher rules for failing schools. Schools in special measures will be more quickly turned around and where no progress is made after a year a competition for new providers will be held. Schools that receive a notice to improve from the Ofsted will enter special measures within a year if progress is not made. Parents will be able to urge Ofsted action, or request new providers. Where there is strong demand or dissatisfaction with existing choices, local authorities will have to respond to their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/18">Time does not allow me to go into more detail unfortunately, but there is a new approach, in particular with the abolition of school organisation committees, which gives local authorities a key role in making decisions on the most appropriate schools for an area. The authority will be expected to assess proposals that it receives on their merits and approve the one that best meets the needs of the area. Under the new regime, it will be possible for a local authority's decision to be challenged, in which case the schools adjudicator will make a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/19">I hope that I have described the mechanisms, outlined some of the factors that will affect a decision in terms of timing&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/20" class="italic">The motion having been made after half-past Two o'clock, and the debate having continued for half an hour, Mr. Deputy Speaker adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/21" class="indent">Adjourned at one minute past Three o'clock.</p>
