	<p pid="a.828.5/1">I thank the Minister for that response. He may be aware of a recent report from an organisation called Sea and Water, which suggests that, until road pricing is introduced, which would impose a fair charge on hauliers, there is a case for the Government to support more businesses that wish to transport their freight by sea. That view certainly has support in Dundee, where the Michelin tyre factory, which employs more than 600 people from Dundee and the surrounding area, has real concerns about the reduction in ferry crossings on the Rosyth to Zeebrugge route from five to three sailings a week. What plans do the Government have in the short-term to ensure a level playing field in the near future between businesses that transport freight by road and those that do so by sea?</p>

	<p pid="a.828.6/1">My hon. Friend will realise that specific support for the scheme that he mentions would come under the responsibilities of the Scottish Executive, so I cannot comment too much on that, other than to say that the Department for Transport and the Scottish Executive collaborated to provide &pound;11 million to start that ferry route. He makes a very fair point, however, that we must encourage the movement of goods by sea. Short-sea shipping needs to be considered as an important option for people who need to move goods. That is why we have the freight facilities grant scheme, which is making substantial sums of money available to people who consider short-sea shipping as an alternative to road transport.</p>

	<p pid="a.837.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point, which I have already taken on board. In my view, section 103 of the Finance Act 2005 means that new clause 1 covers civil partners as well. Essentially, section 103 and the related delegated legislation give civil partners in this context the same rights as spouses. If we solve the problem for spouses, we automatically solve it for civil partners, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.2/2">The Opposition believe that it is vital to save the spouse exemption for husbands, wives and civil partners for the reasons that it was introduced in its present form by the Callaghan Government in 1975&mdash;to reflect society's concern for the welfare of bereaved spouses, and to mitigate severe hardship when matrimonial homes had to be sold to pay the tax bill. There are two new modern reasons to reinforce the need to retain the exemption. The first has already been raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase>. It is important to preserve the spouse exemption for civil partners, to whom it has only just been granted. As I said, if we are successful today in protecting spouses, section 103 of the Finance Act 2005 will protect civil partners. Secondly, rising house prices, particularly in London and the south-east mean that many more middle-income families are caught by inheritance tax, and could therefore be hit by the changes in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.2/3">The Law Society recently conducted a survey asking its members which of their clients would be affected. I shall quote just a few of the answers. They were people from</p>
	<p pid="a.837.2/4" class="indent">&quot;every walk of life&mdash;teachers/nurses/engineers/computer professionals/office workers/ bank staff/engineers/manual workers&mdash;anyone who lives in their own home in the South of England . . . police officers . . .

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.838.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" speakername="Theresa Villiers" colnum="838"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-07.htm#60502-07_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.838.1/1">We are not talking about the bands of inheritance tax&mdash;that is not the debate&mdash;but about new additional and penal inheritance tax charges that will apply to circumstances that are now altogether free of inheritance tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/2">On Second Reading, the Paymaster General said that the measures on trust proposed in the Bill were aimed at preventing &quot;wealthy individuals&quot; from</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/3" class="indent">&quot;using trusts . . . to shelter their wealth from inheritance tax.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 460.]</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/4">However, trusts seldom give rise to any tax advantages whatever; they are generally tax neutral. As the impressive coalition of professionals campaigning against these measures has pointed out, the trusts penalised by the Bill are generally motivated by unobjectionable non-tax objectives: family and social objectives, which will become prohibitively expensive as a result of the proposed measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/5">Since estate duty was introduced in 1894, trusts have received broadly the same tax treatment as outright gifts. For example, under current rules, a gift on a flexible trust to a spouse, with the remainder going to children at the age of 25, is taxed in the same way as an outright gift of the property to the spouse, which is then passed on to her children on her death. Thus, the tax exemption means that no tax is charged on the first death, but the capital is charged at the full rate when the surviving spouse dies and the property passes to the children.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/6">Far from removing some sort of privileged status, as the Paymaster General claimed on Second Reading, the Government are effectively proposing to introduce additional new and penal tax charges on trusts, treating them more harshly than an outright gift. The Chancellor is actually tearing up a 100-year consensus, repeated only recently by the Revenue in its attempt to maintain a tax system for trusts that does not provide artificial incentives to set up a trust, but equally avoids artificial obstacles to using trusts where they would bring significant non-tax benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/7">Before Budget day, section 18 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 exempted gifts on trusts to spouses in exactly the same way as the system operated for outright gifts and transfers. Unless the Bill is amended, it will become almost impossible to set up a trust for a spouse without losing the exemption, as it will incur an immediate inheritance tax charge on the death of the first spouse. The spousal exemption will survive only in cases falling under the definition of an immediate post-death interest, complying with six very narrow and restrictive conditions set out in the new section 49A of the 1984 Act, as proposed in schedule 20.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/8">No one has yet been able to say with certainty how the six opaquely drafted conditions will apply in practice. It seems clear that severe problems will be caused by conditions 1, 3 and 4. Condition 1 states that the gift must take effect by will or intestacy. That means that spouses will no longer be able to set up trusts for one another during their life time without incurring the new charges. A particular concern is that it is not clear that condition 1 will be satisfied where a trust has been established not under a will, but under a pension policy or death in service arrangements, leaving the threat of the new charges applying in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/9">Condition 3 requires that the power to terminate the surviving spouse's life interest is exercised only by the spouse or with the spouse's permission. That sounds technically innocuous, but the net result is that a significant number of trusts created on divorce would fall outside the provisions of condition 3, with the risk of the new charges applying.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/10">Condition 4 provides that the life interest for a surviving spouse will qualify for the exemption only if, following its termination, assets pass absolutely to the beneficiaries. With very limited exceptions, if the property remains in trust after the death of the live tenant, the spouse exemption will not apply. The net effect of those conditions is that, if there is any flexibility in the trust, the spousal exemption is lost and a bereaved spouse or civil partner will face an immediate inheritance tax bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.844.0/1">The hon. Gentleman can speak for his constituency, but I dare to suggest that if he considers the whole country, his statement that 50 per cent. of estates will be valued at more than &pound;325,000 in the next few years is a gross exaggeration.</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/2">When the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet gave her list of teachers, fire officers and others, she appeared to suggest that all of them&mdash;every teacher in the country&mdash;will suddenly have to put together a new will and a new trust. She clearly has not met teachers in my constituency, or in the majority of constituencies, who will not get anywhere near the &pound;325,000 figure. Consequently, her comments constitute a bit of scaremongering, which is an inappropriate approach to the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/3">Secondly, the reason for my opposition to new clause 1 and my wholehearted support for the Government's proposals is that there are two alternative directions of travel in which we can move on inheritance tax. One is to undermine inheritance tax&mdash;not necessarily by pledging to abolish it, but by suggesting that one disagrees with it and would like to abolish it even if one does not have the gumption to say so. On the other hand&mdash;I may be about to step into old-fashioned shoes&mdash;some of us believe in inheritance tax for the simple reason that the greatest source of inequality and inequity in British society is inherited wealth. If we do nothing, especially when the wealthiest in our society are doing extremely well, to undermine the progress towards greater inequality, we undermine the fabric of the society in which I want and choose to live.</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/4">The hon. Lady was wrong to table new clause 1. We need to do what the Government propose and try to ensure that there are not many different ways of exempting oneself from inheritance tax and that there are not ways that are especially available to the wealthiest in society, who can afford expensive consultants on tax and other matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.845.1/1">No, no&mdash;the right hon. Gentleman misunderstands the economy of south Wales, just as he did when he was Secretary of State for Wales. I must point out to him that there are more people in paid employment with good prospects today because of the national minimum wage, which he opposed. However, if I continue in that vein, Sir Alan, you will tell me that I am straying somewhat from new clause 1, and I did promise to draw my remarks to a close fairly swiftly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.846.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" speakername="Julia Goldsworthy" colnum="846"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-09.htm#60502-09_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.846.1/1">As I said, the system will be fairer and simpler. The hon. Members for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) do, in fact, agree on something. Fundamentally, the issue raised by new clause 1 is that of spouse exemption and whether that is changed by the Bill. There is a real lack of clarity, and all the new clauses and the amendments to them are intended to make the situation clearer. Even if the Paymaster General argues that it is already clear, members of the public and professionals have a different interpretation of what the regulations mean.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.1/2">I can see the good intentions of new clause 1, but its argument is slightly circular&mdash;that anything exempt under the new Act will continue to be exempt&mdash;and does not make sense. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> improves his Front-Bench team's phrasing and overcomes that tautology. New clause 2, tabled by Liberal Democrat Members, extends that and calls for a further period of time to be elapsed so that the implications of the legislation can be made absolutely clear, not least for individuals who have died since the Budget either intestate or with their will written into trust. At the moment, the cases of those individuals are subject to considerable uncertainty. I am glad that the hon. Member for Rhondda approves of amendment (b), which, for the avoidance of any doubt whatever, makes it clear that civil partners will also fall under the spousal exemption.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.1/3">New clause 2 seeks a delay in the implementation of the Act until its impact is fully assessed and understood. Debate in the House and outside shows continuing disagreement about the extent of that impact. Making it explicit that a full consultation will take place would be appreciated, as that did not happen before the proposals in the Bill were put forward. I understand that a partial regulatory impact assessment has been undertaken, but the new clause would ensure that there would be a full regulatory impact. Would the Paymaster General be prepared to publish that partial regulatory impact assessment before the relevant clauses are considered in Committee? Will she also provide longer-term projections of the revenue that she estimates the measures will gather? The Red Book gives only a limited time scale and shows that, according to the Government's estimates, the amount of money will be small. Clearly, the professionals think that the opposite might be the case. All the measures in new clause 2 would help to inform the public and make clear what the impact and the revenue implications for the Treasury will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.1/4">As I said, new clause 3 echoes the theme of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire and extends it. As well as making it absolutely clear that there will be no retrospection for applied transfers of value written into trust made prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March</phrase>, it makes provision for people who have died intestate with dependants since <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March</phrase>. Currently, their estates are in limbo, and it is not clear how the new regime will apply to them. Fundamentally, it preserves the existing rules of exemption for two years until the new system and its implications are fully established. It also sorts out what happens in relation to people who die in the intervening period.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.1/5">Surely the fundamental anomaly is that, under the existing regulations, someone can still make a lifetime gift free of inheritance tax if they do not die within seven years. That has not been redressed by the Bill. The changes proposed by the Bill impact on people who are not cash-rich, cannot make cash gifts in kind and thereby avoid inheritance tax, and have houses that have increased greatly in value in the many years that they have lived in them. In my constituency, for example, average house prices are increasing so rapidly, and the gap between house prices and incomes is so great, that more and more households are falling into inheritance tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.1/6">Can the Paymaster General be explicit about what mischief has been done that the Government are trying to overcome, and about their assessment of the impact of any avoidance under the existing trust regime? Will the Government respond to the Treasury Committee's request that they should provide detailed information about how they arrived at their estimate that the new rules on the tax treatment of certain trusts will affect only a &quot;minority of a minority&quot; of the 100,000 discretionary trusts? Will they do that before clause 57 and schedule 20 are considered in Committee?</p>
	<p pid="a.846.1/7">If, as the Government claim, existing spouse exemptions and other reliefs from inheritance tax will continue to apply when a trust is set up in the case of an individual with dependants dying intestate, can they explain why the professionals beg to differ? Can they specify where that is explicit in the Bill, and can they clearly demonstrate why the new clauses and the amendments to new clause 1 are not necessary? Along with the professionals and many members of the public, I would welcome more clarity, certainty and evidence-based policy-making in this regard.</p>

	<p pid="a.849.3/1">I do not think that that is true; indeed, there are many examples to the contrary. I have not inherited any wealth up to this point and I do not have great prospects in that regard, but I do not begrudge those who come from much richer families than mine doing so. If that money trickles down through the generations, it very often does far more good than if it trickles into the sticky hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which seems the only alternative on offer in today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.3/2">It would be much better if the inheritance tax system recognised that a person is not very rich just because they have a flat or house that might now be worth a lot of money. There are a number of elderly residents in Kensington and Chelsea living in two or three-bedroom flats that are perhaps worth the best part of &pound;1 million who might be on quite low incomes. Is the Labour party saying that those people must move to realise their asset and to show that they have some wealth? I want to live in a country where, if such people want to carry on living in their two-bedroom flats, they can do so. They should not be treated as rich because, even though they are low incomes and have no other assets to pay all the taxes that Labour now wants to impose on them, they happen to live in a part of the country that has rather high flat and house prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.3/3">I hope that the Paymaster General will deal with the inequality of house prices nationwide, which is not always, as Labour seems to imply, good news for those in high house price areas. Such people could be worse off than those in low house price areas because they have to pay a disproportionately higher proportion of their assets and income in order to secure and maintain their property. In other words, the principle can work in the opposite direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.3/4">The final issue is what should happen in future. If the Paymaster General can persuade us that there is no effective element of retrospection and that there is an injustice to tackle, we have then to test whether she has found a route to tackling the injustice and inequality that she sees, and whether she would do so in a way that would make Britain a more prosperous and equal society. I suspect that she will achieve the opposite of what she wishes to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.3/5">I do not want to live in a country where only the super-rich can prosper by&mdash;thanks to their access to the really good lawyers&mdash;finding a way around the more complicated regulations that the Government have come up with. I do not want to live in a society that sends out the message that it is better to go offshore or live abroad. I know that offshore trusts have been popular with some Labour donors and Ministers, but they are not a particularly good thing to encourage. It is much better to have an honest, low-tax system that is the same for everybody, and which encourages more enterprise and success.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.3/6">I hope that the Paymaster General with think twice, three times or however long it takes and understand that her proposals contain several objectionable parts. First, retrospection will disrupt family arrangements. Secondly, the suspicion that all trusts are evil tax dodges is clearly not true. Thirdly, on the Paymaster General's idea that such complexity will squeeze the rich and help the poor, I suspect that the rich will escape because they will have access to good lawyers and accountants and can always go offshore. In short, I urge the Government to drop this proposal.</p>

Not all my colleagues will agree, but I think that there is a role for inheritance tax in our system. It may not apply to many people in the Rhondda, but it does to a lot of people in South-West Hertfordshire. The rate may also be open to question, but I do not disagree with the basic idea of inheritance tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/2">In addition, the saloon bar wisdom is that wealthy people get around paying inheritance tax by using trusts. I see nothing wrong with trying to address genuine tax evasion; wealthy people should not be able to evade the tax when ordinary people in South-West Hertfordshire, Falmouth and Camborne or anywhere else are stuck with the liability.</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" name="Theresa Villiers">my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)</phrase> said, the Government have expressed the view that, essentially, trusts should be tax neutral, and I support that. As she also noted, the Revenue's policy in reforming the income and capital tax treatment of trusts has been to create</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/4" class="indent">&quot;a tax system for trusts that does not provide artificial incentives to set up a trust but, equally, avoids artificial obstacles to using trusts where they would bring significant non-tax benefits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/5">I see nothing wrong with that. Since 1894, when estate duty was introduced, certain types of trust have been equated with outright ownership, and taxed accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/6">Perhaps the Paymaster General will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that there is a consensus about the value of the spousal exemption. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet said, it was introduced in its current form in 1975, but in some form or other it dates back to 1896. The need for the exemption is easy to understand; in most cases, an inheritance leads to a windfall, but a death usually results in a fall in income and an element of hardship for the surviving spouse.</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/7">In addition, there is usually a shared family home. Given the emotional concerns that follow a loss, it would be unduly harsh for a spouse to have to sell a house to pay an inheritance tax bill. Clearly, the particular circumstances of spouses need to be considered, and the Civil Partnership Act 2004 has extended the number of people in that category. We need to ask a couple of questions about the Bill. Does it continue to apply to tax trusts in the same way as to outright gifts, and does the spousal exemption continue to apply?</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/8">The Government might argue that the spousal exemption will apply in respect of immediate post-death interests, but the professional advice that I have seen maintains that that will not work because, in practice, it is almost impossible to meet the conditions. Moreover, it is held to be</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/9" class="indent">&quot;nigh on impossible for one spouse to leave their estate in trust for the other and obtain the spouse exemption.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/10">As my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet pointed out, there are specific conditions in the draft proposals in respect of inheritance tax that make it very difficult for most trusts to work and still obtain the spousal exemption under the immediate post-death interest definition. Condition 3 requires that the surviving spouse interest can be ended only during her lifetime with her consent. Consequently, a will that states that the surviving spouse has a right to live in a house until remarriage, when the assets pass to the children&mdash;the experts say that that is fairly common&mdash;will breach that condition and will not be able to benefit from the spousal exemption.</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/11">Condition 4 states that, on termination of a surviving spouse's interest, a person will become entitled to the capital outright. However, if the trustees have the right to defer a child's absolute entitlement&mdash;again, that is fairly common&mdash;then that condition is breached and the spousal exemption is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/12">The immediate post-death interest conditions prohibit flexibility, the need for which was questioned earlier. Again, my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet dealt with that very well. Complex family arrangements are best dealt with through flexibility. We have heard about the case of a widowed second wife, where there are children from the first marriage, which even the hon. Member for Rhondda acknowledged was an issue. There also cases such as that of a young widow who is expected to remarry and have more children; a widow and children with special needs; a childless marriage where both spouses want their assets to go to their respective nephews and nieces; where a property is complex and may impose management demands best performed by trustees rather than the widow; or where a testator has less than full confidence about the distribution of the property.</p>
	<p pid="a.850.0/13">Those are all legitimate, reasonable circumstances that a trust is able to address. The trust is a great intellectual achievement of English law and it seems a great pity to dismiss it as the Government seem to be doing. They seem to have a prejudice against trusts as a method of addressing those issues, which relate not to tax evasion or tax minimisation but to personal circumstances.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.852.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="852"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-11.htm#60502-11_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.852.3/1">I am inclined to believe specialists who work extensively in the field&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the civil servants had consulted a little more widely&mdash;although that is another issue&mdash;we might not have found ourselves in these difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.3/2">I think that the Government's great concern is that a widow could receive a life interest, terminate the trust and make a lifetime gift and, if she survived for seven years, benefit from provisions relating to potentially exempt transfers. I should be interested to hear from the Paymaster General about the particular difficulties that she considers exist and where the current spousal exemption is being abused. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet rightly pointed out, the Government's proposals are an ineffective way of addressing their concern. Better ways could be found by looking at the potentially exempt transfer route, which would address the matter much better than using such an over-sized sledge hammer to hit that particular nut.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.3/3">I wait in anticipation to hear whether the Paymaster General will argue that one can always vary a trust on death, thereby resolving many of the problems or injustices. However, such a solution requires both that the trust is one that can be varied and a degree of flexibility, which is clearly not something that the Government want to encourage in trusts, although it would be useful in those circumstances. Variation could also be achieved with the consent of the beneficiaries, but that would not be possible if they were minors. In that case, it would be necessary to go to the court, with all the expense that would incur. If the Government chose to use that argument, it would not be persuasive.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.3/4">The Government say that the provision will affect only a few people and several Labour Members have suggested that it would apply only to a tiny minority of the wealthy. However, over the past few days, I have been bombarded with documents produced by professionals pointing out that they regularly advise the inclusion of a trust in fairly normal wills, and that it is a common, run-of-the-mill device used to protect a family and to address particular family circumstances. As a matter of course, trusts are involved in wills, not for taxation reasons, but because they provide flexibility. The Government appear not to know that, and the fact that they fail to do so suggests a lack of consultation, which has marked the process throughout.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.3/5">Why have the Government done this? Perhaps saloon bar wisdom and the lack of consultation means that they were not aware of the problems that they have caused, but I wonder whether another element is involved, so I want to offer one or two friendly words of warning to the Labour party. The whole approach smacks of a good old go at the toffs, and we have heard one or two comments along the lines this afternoon that just the wealthy and rich are affected, that the policy does not really matter and that it will play quite well perhaps back in the Rhondda.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.3/6">The Labour party has been extremely successful in the past three elections, and one of the reasons is that the Prime Minister has managed to distance himself from the perception that the Labour party is a bunch of class warriors. Not for the first time, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has waded in and tried to play the class card, just as he did with Laura Spence and Oxford university, when he rushed in and got the facts wrong, did not understand the matter and rather embarrassed himself. I fear that the Government and the Chancellor have done exactly the same thing with this policy. They think that they have made an attack on the very wealthy and the privileged few, when the reality is that large numbers of ordinary people, not the wealthy, will be affected by this policy. The Government have made a misjudgment, and I suggest that they back off; they could start today by accepting the new clause.</p>

	<p pid="a.857.0/1">I am getting the sense that I am in a minority in the Committee as I do not have a legal string to my bow. However, my lack of legal training gives me a distinct advantage when it comes to new clause 1, and amendment (c) to it, because I can, at the very least, appreciate the value of clarity. The new clause is a simple appeal for certainty in a Bill that contains less of that quality than might be desired. The number of people who may be affected by the proposed changes to the taxation of trusts has given all hon. Members cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/2">Perhaps my closest brush with the law on wills and trusts comes from &quot;Bleak House&quot;, which provides a useful parallel to the Government's proposals. The catalogue of potential beneficiaries at the heart of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, where inheritance is squandered, indolence encouraged and legal proceedings interminable, bears close comparison to the lists of those who stand to suffer, if the proposals that we are considering are carried into law&mdash;namely widows, minors and the vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/3">Indeed, Finance Bills as a whole have more than a passing similarity to Jarndyce as Finance Bills</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/4" class="indent">&quot;in course of time become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/5">and nobody</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/6" class="indent">&quot;can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/7">The Dickensian fog may have lifted from the Chancery courts but it still sits heavily on schedule 20 and particularly on proposed new section 49A of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. The Government should be committed to the principle of proportionate rather than punitive taxation, and that commitment is not clear in these provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/8">New clause 1 has a modest aim: to ensure, setting aside all other confusions, that no inheritance tax will be payable on transfers of value between spouses, and not as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> would have us believe, to avoid inheritance tax completely. The spousal exemption exists to prevent punitive double taxation of an estate. That is a sound proposition, founded on an inoffensive principle. It has, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" name="Theresa Villiers">my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)</phrase> said, been the subject of consensus since capital transfer tax was introduced by the Labour Government in 1975. The Chief Secretary echoed the need for just such a principle when he spoke on Second Reading about the need to ensure that people pay their fair share of tax. I know from my brief experience in consideration of the National Insurance Contributions Bill that that particular Labour mantra is very much in vogue. The Paymaster General used it four times in one speech. I am glad that she has taught it to colleagues on the Treasury Bench, but the mantra is as nebulous now as it was then.</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/9">The use of trusts as a vehicle for asset protection has made them the target of another Dawn raid because they are perceived as being unfair. The fact that trusts exist to protect assets from more than the taxman does not seem to concern the Government overmuch. It is true that the caveat for those suffering from a disability has been preserved, but only for a very limited class of beneficiaries in which no one can be thought of as vulnerable if they are not first found incapable under the Mental Health Act 1983 or are claiming disability benefits. That is a sop to fairness, but in reality it is deeply regressive and inflexible. It takes care of the mad, but not the bad or the sad. It also fails to draw the sting of schedule 20 because fairness has always been at the heart of trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/10">Most often the very reason why trusts exist is to allow for flexible and equitable distribution of assets in the face of changing and unforeseen circumstances. The Government have been keen to acknowledge that trusts have a positive role to play in assisting people to manage their tax affairs, and in particular in holding assets on behalf of vulnerable people. However, vulnerability is not linked, and never has been, exclusively to disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/11">Members of the legal profession made a number of representations to me on the many beneficial effects that trusts may have in restraining a Rake's Progress or in keeping a fool and his gold well acquainted. Many sound arguments that relate to the age at which the interests of younger beneficiaries should vest regrettably go beyond the scope of new clause 1. No doubt, the issue will be revisited in Standing Committee. However, I regard beneficiaries under a trust as vulnerable if their interests would not be adequately protected without that trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/12">That point becomes germane in the context of new clause 1 if we consider the number of trusts created at present to protect the interests of children in the event that a parent should remarry. That is a common situation, and it is merely one item on the exhaustive list given by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet. As a result of the proposal, many older testators may begin to favour outright gifts to their surviving spouse, rather than risk settling assets on trust, which may fall foul of the spousal exemption and be liable to inheritance tax. Such outright gifts do not allow any measure of flexibility. Furthermore, they do not allow testators to be sure that their children will be provided for if the surviving spouse should decide to favour the other's interests over theirs. Children in that position are undoubtedly vulnerable, so we must ensure that they are protected as before.</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/13">Sadly, that state of affairs is not unforeseeable, and it is a nightmare scenario for anyone trying to provide responsibly for a family. Modern matrimonial arrangements are complex, but there should be no doubt about whether people with multiple families will continue to benefit from the existing spousal exemption. We would not want to be responsible for encouraging an epidemic of wicked stepmothers if the provisions encourage the use of outright gifts to the detriment of the prudent protection of children. New clause 1 clarifies interference with the taxation of trusts, which is invidious in principle and may prove unworkable in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.857.0/14">Trusts and their taxation are not a subject on which I profess expertise, yet I can readily understand the implication for the average prudent family of any interference with the spousal exemption. The objective of new clause 1 is to offer simple peace of mind to the many people who may be affected by the proposals. Even the legal profession is uncertain about the runaway scope of the changes, and I am more worried about the uncertainty than I am about mere outrage, although we have seen evidence of both. The Law Society, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners and many other professional bodies have pleaded for clarity. New clause 1 would achieve it by including in the Bill an assurance that surviving spouses will not be subject to inheritance tax if their affairs are structured to maintain flexibility and protection for others.</p>

	<p pid="a.859.0/1">I am not a tax accountant or a lawyer, and, given the nature of our debate, I am grateful that I am not. I am grateful, too, for the briefing that right hon. and hon. Members have received from the Law Society of Scotland. I shall ask the Paymaster General a number of questions at the end of my speech, as Members on both sides of the House are deeply concerned about the legislation's impact, intentional or unintentional. The Chartered Institute of Taxation said that</p>
	<p pid="a.859.0/2" class="indent">&quot;all the professional bodies hope that HMRC and the government will listen to our representations and modify the proposals to ensure that spouses and civil partners remain exempt and that young and vulnerable people can continue to be protected through trusts without suffering a financial penalty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.859.0/3">Similarly, the Law Society president said:</p>
	<p pid="a.859.0/4" class="indent">&quot;This measure will affect millions of ordinary people and not just the very wealthy that the Government claims to be targeting.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.859.0/5">The briefing helpfully suggests that it is anomalous that wills involving trusts for the spouse should attract more tax than wills without trusts:</p>
	<p pid="a.859.0/6" class="indent">&quot;If no trust is made, no inheritance tax is due until the death of both spouses in a marriage (or partners in a civil partnership). But under the new proposals, if a trust is made, inheritance tax could now be due . . . after the death of the first spouse and again after the death of the second.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.865.1/1">I find it best to answer one question at a time, and I shall come to those organisations and the hon. Lady's opening remarks shortly. To suggest that the way in which the Government prevent the trusts from being misused somehow damages women's rights is breathtaking, and I shall deal with that shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.1/2">The hon. Member for Ludlow need only read <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-16">16 April</phrase> or <i>The Sunday Times</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-23">23 April</phrase>, which make it clear that those trusts were being used to avoid inheritance tax by retaining control. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" name="Theresa Villiers">The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)</phrase> mentioned transfer to the spouse. What could be more damaging to a spouse than to be told that a trust had been created that transferred the interest to her, only for her to find that she had no access to the capital and that, in three months, her interest was terminated and had passed on to somebody else, when she had been used as the shield to establish the trust, with the very purpose of avoiding inheritance tax? Even to suggest that using spouse relief in that way strikes a blow for women's independence is rather odd.</p>

	<p pid="a.865.3/1">Of course, I shall come to that. I took part in a debate with one of the hon. Lady's colleagues earlier today and I find the Liberal Democrat position inconsistent and daft. This morning, her colleague argued that the Liberal Democrats want to narrow income inequality, yet this afternoon, she argues that she is happy for it to be perpetuated for the few who hang on to their money through the sort of wills that we are considering.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.3/2">The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford rightly asked whether the Government were against trusts. He made an important point, and I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the situation. Of course the Government have not suddenly taken against trusts. He knows full well that we are talking about two particular types of trust. We believe that trusts have an important role to play in helping people to manage their affairs&mdash;of course they do&mdash;but we also believe that a person's choice whether to use a trust structure should not be tax driven. That should not come as a huge surprise to the hon. Gentleman in the light of the changes that this Government have already made to trusts in previous Finance Bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.3/3">I hope that the hon. Gentleman would agree that it is unfair that some people exploit the trust rules in order to avoid in<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" name="John Redwood">heritance tax. The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)</phrase> made a similar point earlier. The Government are not labelling respectable people as tax avoiders. We are saying that a system has emerged in which two types of trust&mdash;accumulation and maintenance trusts, and interest in possession trusts&mdash;can, in certain circumstances, be configured to provide an unfair tax advantage at the expense of other taxpayers. That is what we are seeking to put right.</p>

	<p pid="a.869.3/1">People have two years in which to ensure that there is a proper end to a trust. In that sense, such trusts are affected; otherwise, it would be a bit like our saying &quot;Just because you have already successfully planned a tax avoidance, we will leave it in place.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.869.3/2">It may help the Committee if I explain the purpose of the measure and what it does before dealing with the new clauses. As I have said, the purpose is to stop inheritance tax avoidance through the use of certain types of trust&mdash;not all trusts. Before the Budget, it became clear that some wealthy individuals were using trusts in that way. The avoidance worked in different ways, and was often highly technical, but the end result was the same: substantial assets passed from generation to generation with no inheritance tax ever being paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.3/3">I have made it clear that the Government consider it unfair that a small number of wealthy people should be able to exploit trusts in that way by combining rules. The new rules prevent such unfair avoidance, while protecting straightforward and sensible arrangements made by honourable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.3/4">This measure brings accumulation and maintenance trusts and interest in possession trusts into the mainstream tax rules for discretionary trusts. It does not, therefore, create a new regime; it merely brings such trusts into the regime that applies to all the others. The money put into a trust during a person's lifetime&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.870.3/1">No; please let me make some progress on these points.</p>
	<p pid="a.870.3/2">Transferring assets into trusts is very different from making an outright gift; some people have tried to argue that they amount to the same thing, but they do not. The recipient of an outright gift can do with it as they please, with or without the consent of the person who made the gift&mdash;they are the absolute owner. However, if a person places money in a trust, it must be used by the trustees in accordance with that person's wishes. It is the fact that control can continue long after the settlor's death that makes the difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.870.3/3">Inheritance tax rules for interest in possession trusts have conferred the same exemptions that would apply if putting assets into trusts were identical to making an outright gift. The result has been that interest in possession trusts can be&mdash;and regularly are&mdash;used as a highly flexible money box and a long-term shelter from inheritance tax liabilities. That usually requires the settlor to get rid of assets in his lifetime but, where the spouse relief is available, it is possible for the settlor to hold on to his assets until death and completely wipe out any inheritance tax liability, in both the present and the future&mdash;all without giving the surviving spouse or civil partner any influence whatsoever over the assets in their name.</p>
	<p pid="a.870.3/4">Of course, some cases are not avoidance driven, and a number of exemptions provide appropriate protection for the people involved. First, spouse relief will continue where an interest in possession trust is set up in a person's will to give a life interest to a bereaved spouse or civil partner provided that, when such interest ends, the assets are taken outright by someone else. No further flexible power is necessary in the trust, because it has delivered its objective.</p>

	<p pid="a.876.2/1">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>, employers who made computer equipment available for private use by their employees could do so tax free, providing that the annual amount of the benefit in kind was &pound;500 or less&mdash;that is the equivalent of &pound;2,500 of computer equipment, inclusive of VAT. The clause removes that tax exemption. With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>, a tax charge will arise on the benefit in kind that arises in those circumstances. However, the clause does not change the position when an employer provides the use of computer equipment solely for work purposes and private use by the employee is not significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.876.2/2">The question that everybody has been asking is: why are the Government doing this? It is perfectly true that many employees have benefited from the tax exemption, but the home computer initiative has been used extensively by groups that we would not generally expect to have difficulty accessing information technology. For example, 25 per cent. of those participating in the home computer initiative are higher rate taxpayers&mdash;more than twice the proportion among taxpayers as a whole. Furthermore, nearly one third of HCI participants are from white-collar industries&mdash;often defined as industries with a greater proportion of higher-than-average earners.</p>

	<p pid="a.877.1/1">The information comes from the industry. The hon. Gentleman interrupted me rather early on in my remarks. I was certainly not saying that nobody had benefited from the HCI scheme. The case that the Government are putting is that the benefits have slowed down to a point at which the growth is very small. In particular, it is not targeted on the remaining groups that we need to assist&mdash;those on low pay. I was just about to turn to that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.877.1/2">Last month, the Low Pay Commission published the findings of its review of benefits in kind, salary sacrifice schemes and the accommodation offset. It found that take-up rates were often quite low and many part-time low-paid workers would gain no advantage from salary sacrifice schemes for home computers and other benefits in kind. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has evidence that, unfortunately, the tax exemption was being used beyond the scope of its original intention.</p>
	<p pid="a.877.1/3">On the one hand, the initiative has reached a number of people and has increased usage. On the other hand, however, it is not targeted particularly at the low paid and its effectiveness has been slowing down, and, in addition, it is being used beyond its original intention. For example, the HCI packages included items such as game consoles and MP3 players and allowed employees to buy equipment out of their gross pay, rather than borrow it. Furthermore, the cost of computer equipment has fallen markedly since 1999 when&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.880.0/1">I want clause 61 to be deleted from the Bill for the chief purpose of saving the popular home computing initiative from abolition by the Government. As we are asking the Government to relent, even at the eleventh hour, I will begin by wishing the Paymaster General a happy birthday. I congratulate her on reaching the age of 29&mdash;on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/2">The genesis of the home computing initiative was section 45 of the Finance Act 1999, which said that employers could provide computer equipment including</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/3" class="indent">&quot;printers, scanners, modems, discs and other peripheral devices designed to be used by being connected to or inserted in a computer&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/4">for the use of employees and their families at home without the employee incurring a benefit in kind for the purposes of income tax. The measure was designed to help to spread computer literacy among the population. In March 1999, the Chancellor himself proudly told the <i>Daily Record</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Britain can no longer afford to lag behind America. Inequality in computer learning today will mean inequality in earning power tomorrow&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/6">Between 1999 and 2003, however, relatively few companies took advantage of the tax exemption, largely because it was not widely known or appreciated. In 2003, a working group was formed under the office of the e-envoy to examine how a specific scheme to loan computers to employees, including for private use, might be implemented. Partly as a result of that, the Income Tax (Earning and Pensions) Act 2003 included, in section 320, additional tax incentives specifically to encourage companies to loan computer equipment to their employees up to a maximum tax-free value of &pound;500 a year. It is that section of the ITEPA 2003 that clause 61 would delete. That would have the consequence of effectively sounding the death knell of the scheme, which is why I am asking the Committee to reject the measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/7">The home computing initiative, as we have come to understand it, was effectively launched in January 2004 by the Department of Trade and Industry, which, by that time, had taken on board departmental sponsorship of the project. The DTI published specific guidelines for employers and employees on the home computing initiative, thus effectively popularising the scheme. The DTI press release at the time, which contained supporting endorsements from Sir Digby Jones of the CBI and Brendan Barber of the TUC, promoted the scheme in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/8" class="indent">&quot;For employers HCI schemes are about maximising potential in the work place. Basic computer and technology skills are now regarded as essential for the majority of jobs. With home computer access IT confident employees have greater capacity to contribute to an organisation's overall performance and adapt more easily to new roles and opportunities. HCI schemes can also generate employer National Insurance savings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/9">In practice, the scheme has usually been financed by so-called salary sacrifice, in which employees accept a small decrease in pay in return for being loaned computer equipment by their employer. The employer in turn benefits by paying a reduced rate of national insurance contributions to the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/10">We believe that it is ultimately for financial reasons that the Treasury wishes to abandon the scheme. That was effectively confirmed by the Prime Minister last Wednesday when, in reply to a question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Trade and Industry Committee, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/11" class="indent">&quot;we have to ensure that in any such initiative we obviously balance the revenue that is coming in with the support that is being given.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 570.]</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/12">The decision is thus ultimately financial, as I shall go on to emphasise.</p>

	<p pid="a.882.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. We are looking to the Government this evening for some indication, when the Paymaster General replies, that they intend to retain the scheme, even in a modified form. We are not saying that there can be no change. However, we want an indication from the Minister that if the Government believe that there is abuse, they will modify the scheme to respond to that while maintaining its inherently positive characteristics. I shall press the Paymaster General on exactly that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.1/2">The scheme has proved popular, with about half a million people taking advantage of it effectively to hire a computer from their employer to help to improve their IT skills as part of a modern knowledge-based economy. This is especially important when we are seeking to improve IT skills to allow the UK to continue to compete with economies such as China and India in the 21st century. According to a recent analysis carried out by Hewlett-Packard, China and India between them now produce more than 120,000 IT graduates each year. How are we to compete effectively with that if we are bringing in measures to reduce the spread of IT literacy among our population, which is what the proposed change threatens to do?</p>
	<p pid="a.882.1/3">A Cabinet Office press release was timed to coincide with the launch of the new initiative in January 2004. It highlighted survey findings that employees with a PC at home had better IT skills and were more familiar with the internet. The DTI guidelines on HCI were entitled, &quot;Maximising Potential in the Workplace&quot;. Along with advice on implementing the scheme, numerous references were made to skills. For example, in the CBI's booklet, Sir Digby Jones was quoted as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.882.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Of all the workforce skills required today, there's no question that basic IT literacy is one of the most important . . . Getting IT into the DNA of the workforce must therefore be a primary objective for every organisation that wants to adapt to the high-skills economy of the future.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.884.0/1">I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the trade union movement, from the general secretary of the TUC downwards, are opposed to the abolition of the scheme, not least because at a local level many trade union officials have put a lot of work into persuading employers to adopt it. The hon. Gentleman must understand, irrespective of the learning fund, that the scheme is one that the trade union movement wants the Government to retain. I have a few quotes to drum that point home in case the hon. Gentleman did not get it the first time around.</p>
	<p pid="a.884.0/2">Scrapping a scheme that was already working for those in employment will not solve the Government's problem in respect of others. According to the HCI Alliance, 60 per cent. of the scheme's participants are in blue-collar industries and 75 per cent. of them pay the standard rate of tax, or lower. Moreover, as Intel, the computer supplier, argued in a recent letter to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.884.0/3" class="indent">&quot;As this scheme is run through the employer even the most financially excluded are able to join. The fact that blue collar workers in the future will be denied such an incentive is genuine cause for concern. This has the potential to create inequity within low paid, hard working families and workforces. 21,000 Tesco workers recently adopted this scheme, many would not have a computer today if this had not been offered to them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.884.0/4">Similarly, Brendan Barber&mdash;I hope that the hon. Gentleman is listening&mdash;general secretary of the TUC, who has also personally endorsed the scheme that we are trying to save, wrote to the Chancellor requesting a rethink and issued the following statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April</phrase>, stressing the value of the scheme, in particular, to the low paid. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.884.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The Home Computing Initiative has helped thousands of low paid workers without confident IT skills buy their first ever computer. Unions up and down the country have been promoting the scheme, often linked to training schemes. The sudden closure of the scheme would mean that many hours of voluntary union effort would go to waste.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.884.0/6">Any politician&mdash;Tory, Labour, Liberal Democrat or otherwise&mdash;will understand the clear intent that lies behind that statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.885.5/1">If the Paymaster General had done me the courtesy of listening, she would know that I explained that between 1999 and 2003 the scheme was relatively unpopular, so the Department of Trade and Industry effectively rebooted and relaunched it in 2004, with clearer and better publicised guidelines. The scheme has now begun to take off, and 0.5 million users around the country are dependent on the scheme. It is rather worrying that the Paymaster General&mdash;a Treasury Minister&mdash;will not listen to basic statistics.</p>

	<p pid="a.886.5/1">I shall come on to that, and I shall prove that it is not taking place on a scale that would justify the abolition of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.886.5/2">The initial decision to scrap the home computing initiative, once it was discovered hidden in the Budget of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March</phrase>, was greeted with incredulity, not least by the HCI Alliance, which only a few days before had discussed with the Treasury ways in which it could be updated. Moreover, it is evident that the Brownite Treasury hardly bothered to tell the Blairite DTI&mdash;the scheme's sponsoring Department. Even on Budget day, the DTI promoted the scheme on its website:</p>
	<p pid="a.886.5/3" class="indent">&quot;The real beauty of HCI schemes is that they have the potential to improve performance in almost every area of the organisation. As well as traditional drivers&mdash;reducing costs, increasing profitability&mdash; they can also contribute to more recent imperatives such as corporate responsibility, individual learning and workplace development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.886.5/4">Even more embarrassingly for the Government, the DTI was in the process of rolling out an HCI scheme for its own staff, as was the Department for Work and Pensions, which has far more staff than the DTI. In addition, the CBI, which actively advocated the scheme for two years at the Government's behest, reacted to the change with consternation. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March</phrase>, Sir Digby Jones commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.886.5/5" class="indent">&quot;This flies in the face of everything the country is trying to achieve on skills. Seventy-five per cent. of people affected by this change are lower paid taxpayers. They will want to know why the Government has deprived them, and their families, of this opportunity . . . computer literacy has to be a given in a globally competitive economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.886.5/6">In addition, as we have heard, Brendan Barber of the TUC wrote directly to the Chancellor requesting an urgent rethink, as indeed did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1868" name="George Osborne">my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.887.0/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned flexibility and competitiveness. In the Budget, the Chancellor said that</p>

	<p pid="a.887.1/1">I agree. The Chancellor said little about the initiative in his Budget speech but, equally, he said little about the national health service. However, he evidently tried to hide what was being done. Our role in the House is to try to expose that, and then try to persuade the Government to change their mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/2">There was adverse reaction from employers who have promoted the scheme to their employees, as the Government encouraged them to do. Andrew Unsworth, the head of e-Government at the City of Edinburgh council, which is Labour-run&mdash;at least until Thursday&mdash;sent the following e-mail this morning. <i>[Interruption.]</i> That would be lucky for the Labour party. Mr. Unsworth said:</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/3" class="indent">&quot;City of Edinburgh Council has run two very popular schemes for our monthly staff since March 2005. Take-up rates were over 2000 employees, nearly 16 per cent. of those eligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/4" class="indent">We were preparing to launch another scheme making computers available to our weekly and fortnightly paid staff who are predominantly on lower rates of pay. These pay groups may not otherwise be in a financial position to afford computer equipment. We viewed this as an excellent way for employees to benefit from a computer and its educational properties for both them and their families.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/5">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/6" class="indent">&quot;This scheme provided an excellent platform to improve literacy, communication skills and overall education for employees and their families. City of Edinburgh is currently introducing more computers to schools and several staff had indicated that they were participating in this scheme for the benefit of their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/7" class="indent">City of Edinburgh Council have followed the HCI guidelines very closely and only included computer packages in their scheme. I would hope that the government would consider reversing its decision in this matter even if it means tightening the guideline to prevent the alleged abuse of the scheme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/8">Similarly, Mike Clayton, finance director of Essex fire authority, wrote to me on the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Take up for the scheme was excellent with over 1 in 5 employees joining. The level of take up was particularly high for firefighters where over 1 in 4 chose one of the computer packages available.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/10">Mr Clayton amplified his point:</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/11" class="indent">&quot;15,000 nurses took up the scheme last year. Many low paid nurses, fire officers and other key workers have access to IT for the first time because of HCI. Given the importance of computers in the lives of nearly all citizens, I hope that this proposal can be withdrawn and the take up of computers extended.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.888.3/1">I have given way several times to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> and I want to make some progress. I may give way later to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1931" name="Stephen Hesford">the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford)</phrase>, particularly given that we greatly enjoyed his intervention on my Second Reading speech last week.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/2">I move on now to deal with the reaction of the IT industry, including the companies that had been created to fulfil the home computer initiative objectives by facilitating the supply of computing equipment to both public and private sector enterprises, many of which will go out of business if the provision goes through. The Government's regulatory impact assessment, which was rushed out just last week in response to the furore over this issue, admits that, exceptionally, no small firms impact test has been carried out in this instance, although that would usually be the procedure. It also notes in paragraph 62, in classic Whitehall jargon:</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/3" class="indent">&quot;HMRC does expect there to be an impact for HCI providers. Particularly those in the small business sector that have been set up specifically to provide HCI schemes . . . will be impacted more significantly in the short term than businesses with more diversified business models&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/4">The IT industry body, Intellect, put it more succinctly after the Budget:</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/5" class="indent">&quot;There are about 2,000 individuals working in this industry that Gordon Brown has just signed redundancy notices for&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/6">Before Ministers seek to accuse anyone of crying wolf in this matter, I have to inform the House that the programme of redundancies in the companies established to support the HCI initiative has, unfortunately, already begun. Last month, Red PC became the first company to fall victim to the abolition of the HCI when it was reported that it was about to call in the liquidators. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April</phrase>, another company, Encompass, announced that it was closing down. As the managing director subsequently told the press:</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/7" class="indent">&quot;As a small company solely involved in providing HCI, I was completely knocked back by the Chancellor's decision. The government's Digital Strategy sets targets for 2008 so I thought the HCI scheme would run until then, and at the very least we would have 12 months notice. To be given 15 days is appalling.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/8">At a time when unemployment is unfortunately on the rise again, it will be a great shame to see further high-tech companies going into liquidation if clause 61 remains in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/9">Most importantly, Mrs. Heal, millions of people across the country who might have been able to take advantage of the scheme to improve their and their families' IT skills are now to be denied that opportunity. The Chancellor will now disappoint them if the scheme is withdrawn. Moreover, even those on the existing scheme will be allowed to benefit from it only until whatever agreements they have reached with their employers have expired. That is confirmed by paragraph 71 of the regulatory impact assessment:</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/10" class="indent">&quot;Changes to the exemptions for computers and mobile phones were announced in the Chancellor's Budget statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March 2006</phrase> and will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>. However those people already participating in schemes based on the law as it applied prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> will not be affected until the period of their current agreement expires and they enter into a new agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/11">In other words, at that point they will be caught by the changes. Even the 500,000 people who are benefiting now will not do so for much longer, once their individual agreements with their employers expire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.893.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" speakername="Mark Francois" colnum="893"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-24.htm#60502-24_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.893.1/1">In a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/2">I come to an important point&mdash;the definition of &quot;not significant&quot;, which the Paymaster General briefly addressed in her introductory remarks. If the existing exemptions are removed by clause 61, an associated issue arises; how computers provided by employers to employees will be taxed. As the RIA states at paragraph 22:</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/3" class="indent">&quot;If significant private use is made of a computer provided for business purposes a tax charge will arise on the private use element based on the value of the computer and the extent of the business and private use. Employers will also be liable to Class 1A National Insurance contributions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/4">That could lead to a significant compliance burden for employers if they are required to police the extent of private use by their employees. As the British Chambers of Commerce state in <i>The Times</i> today,</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Businesses have already seen the cost of implementing government regulation rise to over &pound;50 billion since 1998, so to introduce in the small print of the Budget another measure such as this one will further serve to burden employers and impact on their ability to compete effectively.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/6">The Government have responded by arguing that there will be no tax or NIC liability if such use is deemed to be &quot;not significant&quot;, but have not clarified how that will be defined. If clause 61 remains part of the Bill, it is vital that that is clarified so that both employers and employees know where they stand.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/7">The RIA states at paragraph 73 that HMRC will</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/8" class="indent">&quot;invite employer representatives to work with them as they develop guidance which will articulate their approach for handling compliance and administration issues that flow from the changes announced in the Budget.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/9">I think I heard the Paymaster General reiterate, but I will ask her to repeat beyond peradventure in her winding-up speech, that the Government are planning to consult industry so that they can clearly define &quot;not significant&quot; and the matter can be clarified once and for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/10">If that is the Government's intention, can the Paymaster General estimate how long the process will take? For instance, does she anticipate that it will be concluded successfully by July, as suggested in paragraph 74 of the RIA? Even better, if clause 61 were removed from the Bill, the current exemptions would remain in place and the issue would not arise. As <i>The Times</i> argued this morning in a leader sub-titled &quot;The Treasury sends another nasty message to business&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Treasury officials have promised to take a 'practical' view of how much private use should be regarded as 'significant'. The most practical approach, when the issue is debated in the Commons today, would be to withdraw it. We are watching.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/12">That is another good reason for deleting clause 61. I shall now give way to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.895.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" speakername="Rob Marris" colnum="895"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-24.htm#60502-24_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.895.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" name="Mark Francois">the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois)</phrase> for his speech, a large part of which was thoughtful, although he will not be surprised to learn that I disagree with much of what he said. If clause 61 passes into law, computers provided for use at home solely for business purposes will continue to be allowed, and I shall return to that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.895.0/2">The hon. Gentleman accepts that times change. The Paymaster General has said that the take-up rate for the HCI scheme in the first four years after its introduction in 1999 was 29 per cent. and that it then fell to 4 per cent., which shows the operation of the law of diminishing returns. I know that the hon. Gentleman was not a Member of the House in 1999, but I strongly suspect that his party failed to support the HCI when it was introduced and when it was reviewed in 2003&mdash;he can correct me on that point, if I am wrong. He, along with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase>, now supports the HCI, and the thrust of his speech seemed to be that times change and that the scheme has reached lift-off.</p>
	<p pid="a.895.0/3">It is true that times change, but we must put the matter into context, which the hon. Gentleman addressed only at the beginning and end of his speech when he discussed India, China and globalisation. He issued a challenge to the House, which I shall answer. The hon. Gentleman, and most Conservative Members in the Chamber, want to retain the HCI, because it is an attempt to upskill our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.895.0/4">The Government have spent a huge amount of taxpayers' money on trying to upskill our society, and they continue to do so. I will not reel off the figures, because we have all heard them, but Labour Members agree that that spending was certainly correct, whereas Conservative Members are somewhat divided. For example, the educational maintenance allowance was piloted in my constituency, and, although I cannot prove it, I posit as cause and effect the fact that staying on rates at 16 greatly increased. That measure involved investing a lot of money in a long-term process of upskilling our economy, which is the context in which we need to understand the HCI.</p>
	<p pid="a.895.0/5">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the trade union learning fund. I served in the Committee that considered that legislation, where Conservative Members opposed it. The trade union learning fund has been very successful as part of a mosaic of measures to upskill our economy. The HCI was part of that mosaic, and the Government now say that they would rather that other things were part of it, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.895.0/6">As far as I am aware, the HCI did not cover students or pensioners, unless they happened to be in paid employment. As part of the mosaic of upskilling, the Government have been pouring computers into schools. All hon. Members visit schools in their constituencies&mdash; I am sure that you have done so in the west midlands, Mrs. Heal&mdash;where interactive white boards have been installed, many teachers have been provided with laptops, and increased numbers of computers have been made available to pupils. Indeed, some schools in Wolverhampton are successfully piloting the use of personal digital assistants&mdash;I do not know whether PDAs fall within the category of computers, because, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase> has said, technology moves on so quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.895.0/7">Shortly before the Budget, the hon. Member for Rayleigh asked about support for the scheme by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Trade and Industry. However, the Budget included a lot more money for education, and what is known in the vernacular as &quot;Brown money&quot; consists of money that goes directly to schools&mdash;from memory an average secondary school can receive up to &pound;198,000 in the following financial year. It is surprising that the hon. Gentleman has suggested that the abolition of the HCI is simply an act of desperation by the Chancellor, because the Budget included far more extra money for education, which affects skills both directly and indirectly, than will be saved by the abolition of the HCI. The further education White Paper was produced at the beginning of March, and adult learning grants allow people to upskill to level 2 and under-25s to upskill to level 3. The HCI was part of that mosaic of upskilling.</p>
	<p pid="a.895.0/8">Whether Conservative Members like it or not, those taking advantage of the HCI disproportionately consisted of hig<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">her-rate taxpayers. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> has pointed out, that is not the case in absolute numbers, but it is true proportionally. In round terms, higher-rate taxpayers make up about 10 per cent. of taxpayers, but they made up 25 per cent. of those who benefited from the scheme. That is not to say that we should abolish the scheme just because higher-rate taxpayers benefited disproportionately, but it is worth bearing that point in mind against the backdrop of where the Government want to go on skills provision. We must consider the HCI in that context.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.898.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" speakername="Julia Goldsworthy" colnum="898"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-25.htm#60502-25_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.898.0/1">I welcome the announcement of a dedicated digital inclusion team and hope that it will really tackle exclusion issues. Will the entirety of the &pound;370 million in savings that the abolition of the scheme will generate be transferred into that, or will some go into the Treasury pot?</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/2">If the clause remains in the Bill, it will signal the end of a very successful scheme that has helped 500,000 people, more than 75 per cent. of whom were in the lower-income tax brackets. Those people gained access to computers at home, not only for them but for their families. Siemens told us that its participation rate is more than 35 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/3">Can the Paymaster General tell us more about how the decision to end the scheme was made? I understand that it was made a matter of hours before the Budget with very little consultation with the Department of Trade and Industry. The explanatory notes give this reason for the decision:</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/4" class="indent">&quot;There is also evidence to suggest that the exemption has been applied beyond the scope of its original intention. Some HCI providers have offered packages that include games consoles and MP3 players and allow employees to buy equipment through salary sacrifice arrangements rather than borrow it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/5">Will the Paymaster General not only write to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> with that evidence but place it in the Library so that all Members can have access to it?</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/6">The Government claim that there are fundamental problems in two key areas, yet neither need be terminal for the scheme. All that is needed is clearer definition of the existing regulation. The Government would be more believable if, when they gave their reasons, they accompanied them with the hard evidence which, as yet, we have not seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/7">The first problem is that of the definition of a computer, which in the original regulation is defined as &quot;computer and peripheral equipment&quot;. There is a precedent in terms of how that has been resolved in other countries. Sweden tightened up its definitions of &quot;eligible equipment&quot; and &quot;ineligible equipment&quot;, and made it clear that only one computer per household would be eligible. It might be worth paying attention to another Scandinavian precedent&mdash;that of Denmark, which cancelled the scheme but brought it back a year later. The Government might be forced to eat their words in future. There are ways of coming up with a series of workable definitions that continue to bring benefits to employees and their families. It should not merely be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul in order to improve inclusion in other deprived groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/8">On the wider issue of salary sacrifice, I understand from the HCI Alliance that the Office of Fair Trading has to approve every single hire agreement that goes through the scheme, so that if a claim fell outside the terms of the scheme, it would not qualify for the exemption. If the Government were able to provide evidence of such abuse, that would help clarify the situation. Certainly, the HCI Alliance has no evidence that it was being abused in that way or beyond the definitions of the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/9">Withdrawal of the scheme will create a massive compliance problem for employees and employers. The regulatory impact assessment is very helpful. It explains that if the exemption is removed, all employees are technically required to log the time that they spend at home on their work computer using it for leisure purposes, such as checking e-mails or playing computer games, because it will be taxable. The removal of the scheme will create further confusion, not remove it.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/10">Paragraph 18 of the RIA states:</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Where employers and their employees enter into new agreements to loan computer equipment for private use on or after <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase>, the employee will be liable to pay tax on the cash equivalent of the benefit in kind. Employers will be liable to class 1A NICs on the same amount.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/12">The RIA goes on to say in paragraph 22:</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Some employees may be provided with computer equipment or mobile telephones solely for business use. In this situation as long as any private use that it is made of the equipment is not significant there will be no liability to tax. If significant private use is made of a computer provided for business purposes a tax charge will arise on the private use element based on the value of the computer and the extent of the business and private use. Employers will also be liable to class 1A National Insurance contributions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/14">I will be grateful if the Paymaster General can explain what &quot;significant&quot; means and how employers are planning to fill out their tax returns.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.904.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" speakername="Peter Luff" colnum="904"  time="019:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-27.htm#60502-27_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.904.3/1">I am not going to speculate on the tax policies drawn up by my Front-Bench colleagues. I do not have any knowledge whatever of them. We all believe that tax policies should change and evolve over time; that is not in dispute. If the Government had made a good case for the abolition of the HCI, I would have accepted its abolition. However, they did not, and they have abolished the scheme in the worst possible way. That is the problem. If only they had taken a bit more time and care over its abolition, we might not be having this debate tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/2">I remind the Paymaster General that, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-19">19 January 2004</phrase>, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&mdash;now the Health Secretary&mdash;said at the relaunch of the scheme:</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/3" class="indent">&quot;For individuals&mdash;as well as cost savings&mdash;HCI schemes can help realise personal and professional potential. Through improved ICT access and use, they provide the tools and resources which further individual learning, enhance workplace skills and increase employment opportunities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/4">In January this year, on the second anniversary of the scheme, the Minister for Industry and the Regions said that the</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/5" class="indent">&quot;HCI provides a great example of what can be done when the government and industry are working together to fulfil policy objectives&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">13 March</phrase>, he repeated that praise in <i>The Times</i>, in a supplement on the HCI, when he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/7" class="indent">&quot;Since 2003, our home computing scheme has promoted the Government's aim of widening the ownership and use of computers at home, while helping our aim of bridging the digital divide.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/8">As the Paymaster General knows, the DTI offered the scheme to its own staff for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase> this year. It was still encouraging its staff to take up the scheme even on the very day of the Budget. It came as a total surprise to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry that it was to be abolished. That is a matter of public record.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/9">The most extraordinary quote of all comes from the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his 1999 Budget:</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/10" class="indent">&quot;Inequality in computer learning today will mean inequality in earning power tomorrow, so to bring more computers into more British homes, we will legislate so that employees will be able to secure computers on loan from their companies as a tax-free benefit . . . In the new economy, the more individual talent we nurture, the more economic growth we will achieve.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-09">9 March 1999</phrase>; Vol. 327, c. 180.]</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/11">Yet at the precise moment at which that ambition was beginning to be fulfilled, the scheme was abolished.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/12">The reasons that the Paymaster General gave earlier for abolishing the scheme do not bear even the most cursory critical examination. The job has not been done. She made derisory comments about a 4 per cent. increase in the number of people taking up that initiative, but that is 1 million households by my reckoning. If we are to be internationally competitive, we have a long way to go to increase the penetration of computers in households.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/13">I was particularly disturbed by the Paymaster General's comments on the abuse of the scheme. Of course, everything that we do is abused. The VAT system is abused, and I expect that many hon. Members would love to see it abolished, but I doubt that that would be the response to its abuse. Instead, the response would be to close the loopholes and to police the system more effectively. That should have been the Government's response to abuse of the HCI scheme. If there was significant abuse&mdash;which I genuinely doubt&mdash;the response should have been to close the loopholes. Indeed, the industry is bursting with ideas on how to close every possible loophole.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/14">As I said earlier, I take particular exception to the Paymaster General's suggestion that Evesham Technology was abusing the scheme by marketing other products. Some of those products were specifically allowed under the scheme. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs kept the terms vague because it said that it wanted to allow room for emerging technology. Actually, the industry would have liked the terms to be tighter, to avoid any possible abuse. Also, as good entrepreneurs, representatives of the industry offered other products outside the scheme at full market cost in their brochures. They were trying to sell more kit. That is a natural reaction for enterprise. HMRC made the fatal error&mdash;a tragic misunderstanding that further undermines my confidence in it&mdash;of thinking that those products were being offered as part of the scheme. They were not; they were add-ons that were not included in the scheme's terms. I accept that there is bound to be a modest amount of abuse, but I fear that the abuse that the Paymaster General has referred to will turn out either to have been very modest indeed or to have involved a complete misunderstanding of what was actually going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/15">I completely reject the idea that the scheme was not properly focused, because 375,000 lower-paid workers have already benefited from it. All the signs were that, as the scheme extended down into the small and medium-sized businesses, more and more lower-paid workers would benefit. It is no good the Paymaster General shaking her head in disbelief: that is what the evidence showed. It is quite clear that that was beginning to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/16">The TUC expressed its strong support for the scheme. Brendan Barber stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/17" class="indent">&quot;The Home Computing Initiative has helped thousands of low paid workers without confident IT skills buy their first ever computer. Unions up and down the country have been promoting the scheme, often linked to training schemes. The sudden closure of the scheme would mean that many hours of voluntary union effort would go to waste.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/18">I am not sure whether that was the quote that my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh cited earlier. I do not think that it was.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/19">As for suggestions that higher rate taxpayers particularly benefited, I note that the foreword to the information and guidelines booklet referred to developing,</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/20" class="indent">&quot;a broader skills base for all employees&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/21">not just lower-paid ones. The Government were not focusing on those workers then, and they boasted about the greater benefit that higher rate taxpayers would get from the scheme&mdash; the combined taxation benefits meant that the price of a computer fell by 41 per cent. for those higher rate taxpayers compared with a 33 per cent. discount for basic rate taxpayers. An advantage that the Government were trumpeting then is now suddenly a reason for abolishing the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/22">We all know that the sole reason for the removal of the scheme is that the Chancellor wanted to save some money at the eleventh hour. That is the only explanation for the fact that the proposal was put in the Budget at the last minute, without any of his colleagues in Whitehall even knowing that it was being considered. That is what makes it so sad. Although I was interested to hear what the Paymaster General had to say in her opening speech, she sounded more like the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry than the Paymaster General. We need to know where responsibility for delivering the Government's digital strategy resides. I wrote to the Prime Minister, following an unsatisfactory exchange in Prime Minister's questions last week, to ask him whether that responsibility now lies with:</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/23" class="indent">&quot;The Chancellor, who did not understand the very serious consequences of his precipitate actions, or the Trade and Industry Secretary, who had only just offered this excellent scheme to his own departmental staff?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/24">Such crucial policy cannot be made on the hoof in response to bad Budget decisions, but that is what we have seen tonight, and that is why I am so concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/25">I could go on at great length, but other Members wish to speak and we wish to hear the Paymaster General's response. I know that I have sounded excitable and angry at times; that is because I am angry about the way in which the scheme has been abolished. It was delivering the Government's objectives and I resent the way in which they are rewriting history to say that it was not. The method of its abolition was handled appallingly, causing maximum possible despair and despondency in the industry and destroying the vital bond of trust that should exist between Government and the private sector in this important area of policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.3/26">I had hoped, with more time, to list ways in which the scheme could have been improved, all of which have been suggested by the industry, which was discussing them with HMRC officials a few days before the Budget&mdash;only a few days before the scheme was abolished. That is what I find utterly extraordinary. Not even HMRC had the slightest idea that the Chancellor was planning to abolish the scheme. It was a last-minute decision, and I plead with the Paymaster General for it to be reconsidered. At least the scheme should be given an extra year for an orderly phase-down while satisfactory alternatives are put in place.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.909.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" speakername="Brooks Newmark" colnum="909"  time="019:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-28.htm#60502-28_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.909.0/1">This year, the Chancellor presented a Budget for Britain's future, a Budget which will supposedly equip this country for the increasing challenges of global competitiveness. Unfortunately, clause 61 will do anything but that. The foreword to the HCI guidelines published in 2004 had no hesitation in stating that the scheme was an extremely powerful catalyst for an organisation that wants to exploit the clear and indisputable link between individual learning, workplace productivity and overall competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/2">The then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, now the Secretary of State for Health, has fallen on hard times since the heady days when she was able to add her signature to a statement, alongside those of the director general of the CBI and the general secretary of the TUC. If only the Royal College of Nursing were as co-operative. The strength of Government support was also indicated by the fact that the guidelines were issued by three Departments: the Department of Trade and Industry, the Cabinet Office and the Department for Education and Skills, with&mdash;I stress the word &quot;with&quot;&mdash;the backing of the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/3">Sadly, Members have not been surprised by the lack of consultation before the scrapping of the HCI, but the contrast between the close co-operation of 2004 and the chaos of 2006 is particularly stark. No longer is there joint authorship; the DTI itself was busy investing thousands of pounds in a scheme for its own staff, unaware that just across the road in the Treasury, Ministers were planning to axe the very same scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/4">We should also contrast the flamboyantly named Office of the e-Envoy, which existed until 2004, with the present e-Government Unit. The first had a responsibility to get the nation online, and, with the HCI, piloted a project that actually worked. Its successor focuses on</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/5" class="indent">&quot;delivering and transforming public services through information technology.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/6">We now have the paradox of a Government investing in online services&mdash;an example is the &pound;340 million spent by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs on expanding electronic tax returns&mdash;while simultaneously cutting spending on a project that has successfully delivered on its promise to increase the uptake of personal computers by low-paid workers. There is a delightful irony here, which I know many of my hon. Friends will appreciate: in the long litany of disasters that have come about because of Government investment in IT projects there is one notable success, and it is being cancelled. Perhaps the Government will consider applying some of the &pound;71 million compensation which has been paid as a result of the tax credits IT fiasco to the continuation of the HCI scheme. The subsidising of a success by a disaster would be a rather neat compromise.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/7">On Second Reading, the Chief Secretary reminded the House that</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/8" class="indent">&quot;times have changed and are changing rapidly&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 368.]</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/9">Indeed they are, but they are not changing so rapidly that they excuse the total absence of consultation on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">the end of the HCI. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> was also helpful when he said that this issue</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/10" class="indent">&quot;seems to have become a big deal&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 410.]</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/11">I am sure that my constituent Mr. Jon Emin is grateful for that sage pronouncement. I should add, however, that the hon. Gentleman made some thoughtful suggestions in his speech today.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/12">Mr. Emin is the director of a company which, over the past few years, has been working to deliver the NCI scheme to the NHS. To date, he has helped to provide some of the 15,000 personal computers for nurses. He wrote to me that the HCI was</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/13" class="indent">&quot;one of the few good things that this current Government&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/14">have achieved. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/15" class="indent">&quot;There are still millions of low paid workers&mdash;in smaller organisations which are now finally being reached by the HCI administrators&mdash;yet to take advantage of this scheme, not to mention all the nurses, council workers and teachers who have not yet been given the opportunity to take part.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/16" class="indent">Is this fair? We think not.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/17" class="indent">The Government claim that it's trying to help UK Plc become more IT literate, but this clearly goes against that claim.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/18">My constituent enclosed a copy of a letter that he had received from the director of finance at the Public and Commercial Services Union. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/19" class="indent">&quot;We were about to introduce the scheme to our staff and have over the last few months undertaken a considerable amount of work to get the scheme off the ground. Both PCS and its employees are therefore extremely disappointed&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/20">that the Government intend to end the scheme. As I am sure the Paymaster General will tell us, taxpayers are often &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; by Budget measures that leave them worse off, but the Government have given no explanation for their decision, and there is a sense that the Chancellor may have believed that no one would notice clause 61.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/21">Let me now deal with the question of definitions in amendments Nos. 2 and 17. On Second Reading, the Paymaster General gleefully challenged <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" name="Theresa Villiers">my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)</phrase> on what definition of computer equipment should be applied for the purposes of the scheme. She should have been a little less triumphant. In the Standing Committee that considered <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" name="Mark Prisk">the 2004 Finance Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase> asked her</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/22" class="indent">&quot;to clarify what is included as eligible equipment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/23">That was two years ago. If the Paymaster General had given an answer in 2004, she might have been able to prevent the two years of abuse&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Alleged abuse!&quot;]&mdash;alleged abuse&mdash;that the Government are using as a justification for axing the HCI. Instead, she said that the Office of the e-Envoy</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/24" class="indent">&quot;will be monitoring take-up in the coming months. That information will demonstrate to us whether the &pound;500 is reasonable, what type of equipment is being purchased and how wide take-up is.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-18">18 May 2004</phrase>; c. 216&ndash;8.]</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/25">It is sad, therefore, that the Office of the e-Envoy was itself axed along with whatever evidence of abuse it may have found. The Government should have provided a definition of computer equipment back in 1999, and certainly when Ministers were pressed for one in 2004. A definition must be open to regular review.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/26">iPods have been mentioned with some derision in debates, but the average iPod now has more memory than the average home computer did when the scheme was initiated in 1999. Furthermore, podcasting is increasingly being used as a business tool. That is why amendment No. 2 emphasises the need for industry and user consultation, with the aim of arriving at a workable, flexible definition that is not open to abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/27">The notion that people have been buying games consoles and iPods is as yet unproved, but I was interested to learn that &quot;entertainment&quot; was among the list of benefits that the DTI believed to stem from home computer ownership. It was mentioned in its 2004 guidelines, along with education, e-mail and e-government, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> pointed out earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/28">It seems always to have been envisaged that</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/29" class="indent">&quot;most new computers support the latest video game, DVDs and other popular multimedia formats.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/30">Why the Government's new-found technological puritanism?</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/31">Before I end my speech, I want to refer to the lack of evidence and the solution proffered by amendment No. 18. In 2004, the Paymaster General said:</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/32" class="indent">&quot;Since the exemption was introduced, we have not had exact figures on the take-up for obvious deregulatory reasons.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-18">18 May 2004</phrase>; c. 217.]</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/33">Conservative Members are all in favour of deregulation, but it is unfortunate that this single example of obvious deregulation should have had the inadvertent effect of undermining a successful IT initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/34">The Minister for Industry and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" name="Alun Michael">the Regions, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael)</phrase>, admitted in a recent parliamentary answer:</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/35" class="indent">&quot;I am unable to provide a statistical breakdown of how many individuals have participated in the Home Computing Initiative Scheme in each year since 1999, broken down or by region.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/36">Instead, he said only that</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/37" class="indent">&quot;A recent estimation provided by the HCI Alliance (BT, Intel and Microsoft) indicates that over 500,000 units have been loaned under the Home Computer Initiative Scheme since 1999.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-25">25 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 989W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/38">The Government's evidence base for axing the HCI seems to have been provided by the very organisation that is lobbying for its continuation. That is an absurdity. Perhaps the Minister will tell us where is the evidence, where was the consultation, and where is the need to scrap an IT project that has helped the lowest-paid people to improve their skills and prospects.</p>

	<p pid="a.913.2/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara, for allowing me to contribute to this debate. This is a novel experience for me on two counts. This is the first time since joining this House that I have attended a debate in which the Government are insisting on scrapping a successful measure; in my experience, they usually seek to abandon failed initiatives that they have introduced during their tenure. To witness them abandoning a successful one is surprising, to say the least.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.2/2">I am pleased that the Paymaster General has an opportunity today to diffuse criticism of this penny-pinching, revenue-retaining measure by making a positive announcement on digital inclusion. In my experience, the Paymaster General is usually asked to defend the indefensible on the Chancellor's behalf, but today she is able to announce some good news. However, it is a classic new Labour move: on the one hand, we are debating a measure, the withdrawal of which will save the Treasury &pound;300 million over three years; on the other, Labour is sweetening the pill with a &pound;50 million new initiative, but it is merely a sleight of hand to try and distract attention from the bigger issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.2/3">Having said that, I welcome the digital inclusion initiative and I should like to comment briefly on it, given that the Paymaster General introduced it into this debate. I hope that the new cross-departmental unit will address the severe shortcomings of the digital TV footprint. It is claimed that digital TV will reach 98.5 per cent. of the population. Given that the Paymaster General has taken an interest in this subject, I will send to her and to whoever is responsible for running the new unit a map that the <i>Shropshire Star</i> helpfully provided. It shows the area along the Welsh marches that would be excluded from digital TV coverage. That area includes most of the western half of my constituency and all the area classified as an area of outstanding natural beauty, which amounts to about 80 per cent. of south Shropshire district. I look forward to hearing about the measures that this magnificent new unit will implement to provide coverage for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.2/4">I want to speak to amendment No. 2 to clause 61. The home computing initiative has encouraged home-working, and before I illustrate this issue with some comments about my constituents, I want briefly to highlight some of the non-financial benefits that derive from home working of which the Paymaster General may not be aware. BT, one of the largest employers in the country, has undertaken research among its work force. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.913.2/5" class="indent">&quot;People working from home are 7 per cent. happier than their office-based colleagues&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.2/6">So there is a happiness quotient to this issue. The research also noted that there is</p>
	<p pid="a.913.2/7" class="indent">&quot;20 per cent. less absenteeism than the national average&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.927.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" speakername="Mark Hoban" colnum="927"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-33.htm#60502-33_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.927.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate clause 26. The Financial Secretary briefly discussed the history of the measure, and I want to spend a little more time on that, because I think it important to understand why we are where we are. The current situation is not a surprise, because there were indications along the way that it would happen. In the Finance Bill, the Government are taking more than &pound;800 million out of small businesses over the next three years with scant compensation for the additional costs that those businesses must bear at a time when small businesses are facing higher burdens through not only tax but regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/2">The Chancellor introduced the measure to stimulate business but later restricted it with complex legislation around the non-corporate distribution rate, which added to the complexity of the system. He then announced the measure's abolition, saying that it was a bold move to simplify the system, but he was simplifying his own handiwork and the damage that he had created.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/3">As the Financial Secretary has said, the corporation tax starting rate was introduced by the Chancellor at 10 per cent. on profits up to &pound;10,000. In his 1999 Budget speech, the Chancellor said:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/4" class="indent">&quot;I want to create an even lower rate, which will give new incentives for men and women to start their own businesses and work their way up . . . The legislation will ensure that the beneficiaries are genuinely those who take risks. And 85 per cent. of the firms gaining from the 10p tax rate will have fewer than 10 employees&mdash;the very firms that we most want to see grow; the very firms whose growth will create the greatest number of new jobs.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-09">9 March 1999</phrase>; Vol. 327, c. 177.]</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/5">The measure was clearly targeted to stimulate business. To reinforce its impact, the Chancellor reduced the starting rate from 10 per cent. to 1 per cent. in his 2002 Budget. Hon. Members may remember that that was also the Budget in which he increased national insurance contributions, so perhaps the reduction was seen as compensation for small businesses for the increase in national insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/6">When we debated those changes in Committee and on the Floor of the House, hon. Members identified some of the risks. In 2002, we supported the introduction of the zero rate, and we oppose its being scrapped in the Finance Bill. We welcomed the relief that it provided for small businesses and object to the burdens that it places on them today. We want to support our small businesses, not attack them when they feel vulnerable because of increased regulation and red tape.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/7">I want to highlight three issues: the bias towards incorporation created by the measure; the cost of the zero rate against the money that the measure will save; and the economic benefit accruing from the zero rate. It was clear in 2002 that there would be an incentive for unincorporated businesses to become limited companies. Indeed, I made that point in Standing Committee in 2002, where I pointed out the concern among unincorporated businesses about the fiscal advantage of incorporation:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Many unincorporated businesses feel that the Government are trying to drive them towards incorporation. They do not wish to incur the additional costs of incorporation, but the tax regime is such that they feel almost obliged to do so because if they did not, they would be significantly worse off.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-16">16 May 2002</phrase>; c. 104.]</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/9">Both <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>, who served on that Committee and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have commented on that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/10">In Committee, the Paymaster General chose to dismiss the views of not only a new Back Bencher but the Institute for Fiscal Studies. She highlighted incentives for unincorporated businesses and attempted to explain why they should not automatically seek to take up incorporation:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/11" class="indent">&quot;It is not a question of the Government making companies choose between incorporation or unincorporation . . . but of demonstrating clearly the steps to help businesses&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-30">30 April 2002</phrase>; Vol. 404, c. 912.]</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/12">Given the strength of those incentives, it is remarkable that any business embarked on the route that this year's Red Book described as &quot;tackling tax motivated incorporation&quot;, since the attractions, according to the Paymaster General, of the other support for business were such that they should not feel the need to be incorporated. The Government highlighted the cost of the zero rate of corporation tax. That was the subject of the report that the IFS produced during the consideration of the Finance Bill 2002. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said of that report:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Through its analysis of the survey on personal incomes 1998&ndash;9, it says that 1.2 million self-employed people each stand to gain in excess of &pound;500.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/14">He said that the IFS calculated that</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/15" class="indent">&quot;the cost would be &pound;1.2 billion, compared with the highest possible figure from the Government so far of &pound;450 million.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-16">16 May 2002</phrase>; c. 108.]</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/16">Typically, the Paymaster General was trenchant in her remarks, batting away the IFS, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Sometimes its figures are nearly right and sometimes they are spectacularly wrong.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/18">She went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/19" class="indent">&quot;The Government stand by their estimates in the Red Book of costs rising to &pound;450 million.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-16">16 May 2002</phrase>; c. 114&ndash;115.]</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/20">On that occasion, the Paymaster General was right, as it was spectacularly wrong. The Red Book shows that the saving to Government in 2008&ndash;09 through scrapping the zero rate of corporation tax&mdash;&pound;530 million&mdash;is not that dissimilar from the highest cost that she predicted in those debates back in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/21">The other issue that we debated then concerned the economic benefits and what would happen as a consequence of the zero rate being introduced. Again, the Paymaster General mounted a robust defence:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/22" class="indent">&quot;We believe that cutting corporation tax is an effective way of targeting support at small and growing businesses. It also encourages would-be entrepreneurs to set up new companies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/23">She heralded the measure as</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/24" class="indent">&quot;a targeted reduction in tax to help small and new companies thrive and grow.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-16">16 May 2002</phrase>; c. 114.]</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/25">It is rather difficult, four years later, to see why the Paymaster General and the Treasury have deviated from their robust line of defence of the zero rate of corporation tax. The measure went through after detailed and robust scrutiny on both sides of the House. The then Member for Arundel and South Downs tried to make amendments to extend some of the benefits for incorporated companies to unincorporated companies, but the Paymaster General's remarks show that she vigorously defended of the attractiveness of remaining an unincorporated business.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/26">The Treasury then started to get cold feet. Having looked again, it introduced the non-corporate distribution rate. By the time of the 2003 pre-Budget report, it was clear that many businesses had incorporated, which was described as &quot;avoidance&quot; by the Revenue. In the PBR speech, the Chancellor talked about the need to ensure that small companies paid the right amount of tax. Following those remarks, in the Finance Bill 2004, we saw the introduction of the non-corporate distribution rate, which was to ensure that where dividends were paid to shareholders, they were taxed at 19 per cent. rather than 0 per cent. But the mechanics of the NCDR impose differential rates of corporation tax between distributed and non-distributed profits. That is complicated to manage and added to the complexity of the tax system.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/27">Despite all that, the Government threatened further complexity to try to tighten the system. It is no surprise that most respondents to the PBR consultation said that they favoured simplification over options that risked additional complexity. But who created the additional complexity? It was the Chancellor, who is trying to unpick the problems that he himself has created.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/28">The tax relief granted to stimulate enterprise was restricted by increasing the complexity of the tax code, and then scrapped to reduce the complexity of the tax system, with little by way of compensation to stimulate small businesses. It is therefore not surprising that many business groups have been hostile to the change. The Financial Secretary prayed in aid the Federation of Small Businesses. At the time of the pre-Budget report, the Confederation of British Industry stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/29" class="indent">&quot;While the CBI support simplification of the corporation tax structure, this measure will mean that companies with profits of less than &pound;50,000 per year could face a tax increase&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/30">Bill Midgley, president of the British Chambers of Commerce, commented that</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/31" class="indent">&quot;we have concerns that the removal of the 0 per cent. starting rate of corporation tax will harm the growth of some of the smallest firms.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/32">Let us remember what the Paymaster General said in 2002:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/33" class="indent">&quot;The measure is a targeted reduction in tax to help small and new companies thrive and grow.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>Standing Committee F,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-16">16 May 2002</phrase>; c. 114.]</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/34">Four years later, the Government are introducing measures that the president of the British Chambers of Commerce believed would harm the growth of some of the smallest firms.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/35">After the Budget, Nick Goulding, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/36" class="indent">&quot;Small businesses operating on tight profit margins will have found this tax break extremely useful. Business that incorporated to take advantage of this tax break now find they have all the bureaucracy and costs of incorporation and no financial advantage. How can businesses plan effectively when the Chancellor keeps changing his mind?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/37">Why did the Chancellor start to unpick that valuable tax relief, on which small businesses relied? The Red Book tells the whole story. The measure is planned to raise &pound;870 million for the Exchequer in only three years. The small businesses that depend on such tax breaks are confronted with an increasing burden of regulation and will stump up an extra &pound;870 million for the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/38">It is worth remembering, in the context of the measures announced in either the 2005 pre-Budget report or this year's Budget that, in the first full year in which the provision takes effect, in 2008&ndash;09, the tax increase is the second highest in raking in revenue for the Treasury. It is second only to the huge hike in tax revenues from the oil industry. So much for the rhetoric of helping small businesses. They are bailing out the Government and trying to plug the Government's black hole.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/39">Small companies will end up paying an extra &pound;1,900 tax, discouraging them from further growth and from expanding. In 1999, the Chancellor said:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/40" class="indent">&quot;I want to do more. I want to create an even lower rate, which will give incentives for men and women to start their own businesses and work their way up.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-09">9 March 1999</phrase>; Vol. 327, c. 177.]</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/41">In 2002, the Paymaster General said:</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/42" class="indent">&quot;We believe that cutting corporation tax is an effective way of targeting support at small and growing businesses. It also encourages would-be entrepreneurs to set up new companies.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-16">16 May 2002</phrase>; c. 114.]</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/43">The decision to scrap that lower rate, which was designed to promote enterprise and small business, tells the business community everything that it needs to know about the Chancellor. When the chips are down, he raises taxes from them. They are no more immune from the Chancellor's grab to increase tax revenues than any other sector of the economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.931.0/1">I agree with most of what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase> said. We all agree that small business are our genuine potential for the future. The Government and perhaps previous Governments have gone wrong in not genuinely enabling small business to grow in the way we all want them to. Plenty of new businesses have started up but plenty have regrettably failed relatively early. Tax plays a significant part in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.931.0/2">Governments in recent times have attempted to change tax rates and the way in which they support small business. We have all largely tried to support the Government's intentions. However, although we are creating small businesses, we do not sustain them for a reasonable period so that they can grow into medium-sized businesses. Far too many fail and far too many are swallowed up by larger competitors. The nurture and support that small business needs to provide the strong economy that we want has not happened. Perhaps it is indicative that tax regimes have changed and we have not got the stability for people to plan properly. Anyone who has started a small business will recognise that the first three to five years are the toughest time. The stability of the taxes that they have to pay is extremely important if they are to plan for the growth that they need. While we applaud the simplicity, we must implore the Treasury to provide stability as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.932.1/1">Saying that the Chancellor has executed a U-turn on the nil rate band of corporation tax is not entirely accurate; it is more like a three-point turn. I am heartened that the Chief Secretary has had a damascene conversion and has come to believe in the value of simplicity, but that progress is bought at a price.</p>
	<p pid="a.932.1/2">Despite being told at every stage that the nil rate band was open to exploitation, the Government pressed ahead with it in 2002. In 2004, there was wide recognition that the fear of exploitation had been realised. The Government had the opportunity at that point to choose the path of simplicity or the path of greater complexity. There are no prizes for guessing which choice prevailed. However, with the choice having been made to introduce the non-corporate distribution rate, small businesses should not be subjected to yet another change in the corporation tax rules. Stability and predictability sit alongside simplicity as the cardinal virtues of the tax code.</p>
	<p pid="a.932.1/3">Our suggested amendment had a very modest objective&mdash;to guarantee that the interests of those businesses that were lured into incorporation in 2002 were not further prejudiced by yet another change in the rules. It would have prevented the &quot;gift horse&quot; of 2002 from being remembered instead as the Trojan horse of 2002. In 2002, the then shadow Chief Secretary said:</p>

	<p pid="a.933.4/1">You are absolutely correct, Sir Alan. It is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase> who has an idiotic proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/2">In 2004, the Paymaster General was a little more certain when she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/3" class="indent">&quot;The deliberate and cumulative aim is to underpin all the measures that the Government have taken to encourage businesses to grow and to be more enterprising and productive in the medium and long term and not to operate year by year by playing around with the tax system.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-27">27 April 2004</phrase>; Vol. 420, c. 846.]</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/4">What is deliberate and cumulative about clause 26? The Paymaster General had an opportunity in 2004 to admit that the zero rate of corporation tax was not viable. Instead, the regulatory impact assessment to which she put her name insisted that the abolition of the nil rate band</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/5" class="indent">&quot;would be the most straightforward option. However, it would run counter to the Government's aim of maintaining low rates of corporation tax to encourage growth and enterprise.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/6">On Report, she reiterated that sentiment for those few Members of the House who neglect to read regulatory impact assessments by affirming:</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/7" class="indent">&quot;I fail to understand how removing the zero rate, yet keeping the 19 per cent. rate, would assist such small companies.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-07">7 July 2004</phrase>; Vol. 423, c. 863.]</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/8">I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/9">It seems that enlightenment is contagious among Treasury Ministers this year, as the Paymaster General now seems to have reached a better understanding of how the removal of the nil-rate band will help small businesses after all. That is what this proposal is about&mdash;helping small businesses, not hindering them.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/10">In his submission to the Treasury Committee in December, Mr. John Whiting, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said of the current proposals</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/11" class="indent">&quot;Now we are to go back to the beginning with small business probably feeling they would rather have been left alone from the start.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/12">In other words, small businesses like needless interference from Government even less&mdash;again, I hope that this answers the hon. Gentleman's question&mdash;than they like corporation tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.4/13">Once again, the Government's unhealthy fascination with anti-avoidance legislation precluded sensible consultation. Once again, papering over the cracks has not kept the water out. Once again, the lofty intention of aiding small businesses has ended in a farce. The guiding principle should now be to let well enough alone. If the non-corporate distribution rate was an appropriate solution to a self-inflicted problem in 2004, what has changed since then to justify its removal? I hope that the Minister will answer that question.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-02a.942.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="942"  time="022:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/debtext/60502-37.htm#60502-37_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.942.2/1">As the gas price spiralled ever upwards last winter and spring, the disadvantages of our future dependence on that fuel became increasingly obvious. They were clear to the ordinary domestic consumer paying a highly inflated bill, obvious to the point of depression in the Government-supported anti-fuel-poverty sector, and painfully transparent to energy-intensive users, such as the petrochemical businesses in my Redcar constituency. Several of the petrochemical firms, which, together, provide a big slice of the north-east's gross domestic product, had to idle plant and limit output in favour of non-UK locations, and, in one case, temporarily close. The huge hike in those energy costs is likely to have longer-term effects, such as the delay, or even abandonment, of industrial investment in the chemical sector, all of which will be made much worse in the absence of speedy action to guard against a recurrence of the price hike next winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/2">The cause of the problem is at least partly the impact of the early liberalisation of the UK energy market ahead of that of the rest of Europe. However, additionally, we are moving more quickly than anyone could have predicted from supplying our own energy, which we have done for the past 100 years, first from coal and then from North sea oil and gas, to potentially becoming dependent on Russia, Algeria and the middle east for gas.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/3">The problem of relying on Russia, which was previously regarded by the west as a reliable energy source, became especially clear to Ukrainians on new year's day when the Russians cut their supplies. However, the ripple effects were felt thousands of miles away. Not only did France lose a third of its gas, but the whole of Europe, which relies on Russia for a quarter of its supply, was forced to realise that there are serious limits to the length of the spoon that can be used when supping with President Putin. Clearly he will readily use his abundance of hydrocarbons for political purposes, in this instance to punish the western-leaning Ukraines for considering joining NATO and the EU and to force them back into Russian hegemony</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/4">Our dependence on Russian gas looks set to grow. Russia has 28 per cent.&mdash;the largest share&mdash;of the world's natural gas resources. Given that, should we ask what sort of a country is President Putin's Russia? According to Amnesty International, Russia has an abysmal human rights record. According to Freedom house, another human rights non-governmental organisation that assesses countries across a range of rights and issues as free, partly free or not free, Russia has declined from partly free to not free in the past two years. It says that Russians cannot change the Government democratically because the state's far-reaching control of the broadcast media and the growing harassment of Opposition parties make that impossible. There was strong evidence of an undercount in the vote for Opposition parties in the last election that kept them from attaining the 5 per cent. threshold required for parliamentary representation. Corruption is pervasive and libel laws are used to intimidate the independent media. Putin has just taken power to appoint the judges.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/5">According to the annual human rights report from the US State Department, Parliament in Russia</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/6" class="indent">&quot;has been virtually stripped of power.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/7">There is</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/8" class="indent">&quot;selectivity in the enforcement of the law and . . . there is harassment of some non-government organisations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/9">It is a statement of the obvious that the history of Saudi Arabia and the rest of the middle east shows how difficult Governments find it to be other than indulgent to countries that are rich in energy. Middle eastern countries are, of course, significant gas suppliers. Levels of dependency on a country for energy supplies tend to make purchaser Governments significantly less prepared to challenge the supplier Government's democracy and human rights record, even though we and other western European countries assert that these values are key ones to be supported in foreign policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/10">Europe's only really viable alternative source of gas is Algeria, which is fourth in the world as a gas exporter. However, Algeria, too, has serious human rights problems with Freedom house reporting that the right</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/11" class="indent">&quot;of Algerians to choose their government freely is restricted&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/12">Although the recent presidential elections were an improvement it is still reported that</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/13" class="indent">&quot;the president wields minimum leverage with the small group of generals who retain ultimate power.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/14">Demonstrations are banned in Algiers while in other areas, peaceful demonstrations have been broken up, sometimes violently. The Algerian alternative source of gas does not seem to hold a better promise of contracting with a clear human rights conscience.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/15">President Putin has recently engaged in a fruitful piece of diplomacy in this direction. He signed a contract for Russia to supply missiles and fighter aircraft to Algeria. Payment for these is so arranged that Russian influence is now woven deeply into the Algerian energy sector. At the same time, President Putin has tightened his monopoly of the gas transit route from the Caspian and central Asian regions, building up, therefore, a double or a triple potential stranglehold on European gas supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/16">It is noteworthy that it was Russia that was free to supply enriched uranium to Iran to limit concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation in that country. Iran has the second highest natural gas reserves in the world, behind only Russia, and there are emerging concords in the energy sector between these two countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/17">Recently, the Kremlin controlled Gazprom indicated a wish to bid for Centrica, the UK's largest domestic supplier, which sells gas to 40 per cent. of British homes. Success would secure UK demand as well as supply for the Russians, who are not yet big players in the UK. It would be a surprising outcome if, as the UK energy market is liberalised primarily to create competition, it became dominated by a state-owned corporation, and not even a British one.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/18">Is it any coincidence that as Russian democracy and human rights are forced downwards and Putin simultaneously extends both his own tentacles of energy supply and his influence over other countries with large gas reserves, that the largest investment currently being made in nuclear power is at Olkiluoto in Finland, which as a country famously shares a common border with Russia and whose domination by the Soviets during the cold war gave rise to the description of oppressive hegemony as Finlandisation?</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/19">The fact that we are timid about energy suppliers' human rights obligations should not be a surprise when one considers the temptations. Energy is vital to modern economies, and problems with supply have been the basis of some of the most important events in recent history, including the global recession in the early 1970s after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut supplies and, in the UK, the miners' strike of 1974 that brought down a Tory Government and the strike in the 1980s that did not do so. Ultimately, the 10-year war between Iran and Iraq, and the two more recent wars in Iraq were strongly linked to, if not determined by, reliable energy supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/20">In addition, energy-rich countries have a great deal of buying power, and can offer lucrative contracts for western know-how effectively to extract resources from the ground or the seabed. Gazprom is keen to secure western technical help further to develop Russian resources. Those countries are often ready to purchase sophisticated arms from the west, which are necessary to shore up their security and protect the status quo. As chair of the all-party group on Burma, I know the power that hydrocarbons can give despotic Governments. European efforts to isolate the despicable Rangoon junta are constantly foiled by the French, whose oil company, Total, is the regime's largest corporate funder. Incidentally, that has led to the unacceptable belief that the Bush White House operates a more effective sanctions programme against Burma than the EU. The Burmese Yadana gas project, in which Total and the junta are partners, earns the regime up to $450 million a year, which it spends on boosting the military suppression of its citizens and which it uses as an aid to laundering drugs money for the purchase of foreign arms.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/21">Although we do not buy hydrocarbons from Burma, that country's history teaches us another truth. Countries with immense natural resources may have lopsided economies. A sudden inflow of dollars as prices rise can lead to an appreciation in domestic currencies, making non-energy sectors uncompetitive in the world and removing incentives to develop other industries, thus confirming the domination of oil and gas. The resource is concentrated so that cash passes through few hands and can easily be misdirected. The inherent instability of commodity prices impacts mostly on the poor, who do not have any way of hedging the risk. Such countries rarely have stabilisation policies to set aside surpluses to cushion the blow when prices fall. Indeed, there are few internal pressures in such countries to govern well at all, because those money flows mean that there is little need to raise revenue through taxes, so there is little need to secure the consent or support of their people, who have little leverage to call their rulers to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/22">Oil and gas extraction do not require large teams of highly skilled indigenous workers, so the individuals in charge see little point in investing strongly in education, welfare or health. Indeed, they do not require huge numbers of unskilled workers. Many such countries grow slowly and do badly on the UN's human development index. Countries with strong institutions can benefit from the wealth that great natural resources bring, including Norway, which has about 1 per cent. of world gas reserves, and, historically, Britain. Both countries had a strongly entrenched representative democracy, freedom of speech and association, as well as the rule of law, long before they realised that they had hydrocarbons. None of the countries in the top five for gas reserves are classified by Freedom house as free.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/23">Clearly, relying on such countries for our gas supplies can bolster unacceptable regimes and ensure that their citizens pay a high human rights and democracy price even as we pay a high financial one. Ultimately, the dangers and instability to the world from human rights abuses mean that the price that everyone pays is extremely high. Happily, that understanding appears to be compatible with the direction of Government policy. The energy review was partly initiated as a result of the UK becoming a net gas importer sooner than expected and the newly appreciated risks of an unreliable supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/24">There are genuine gains to be made from renewable technologies using wind, wave and solar power. Clean-coal technology and carbon sequestration for coal and North sea oil have a future, while efficiency measures to reduce demand for energy are vital too. Campaigners protest that a fully committed Government should push through much stronger action on renewables and energy efficiency, but such measures often involve major changes to people's lifestyles and are hard to deliver. For example, wind farms are widely opposed because of their impact on the local environment. A proposed offshore wind farm in Redcar is deeply unpopular, because it is less than a mile from the shoreline of our main tourist bay. The proposed onshore wind farm at the steelworks is acceptable to everyone, however, because it is part of the industrial landscape. In a similar way many people resist microgeneration windmills on houses, recently exposed as dangerous and difficult. Wave power may have environmental problems, and the technology for carbon sequestration is only in its early stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/25">The technology that should not be overlooked in establishing what is likely to be a mix of energy supply is nuclear power. At present it contributes about 19 per cent. of our electricity needs, but that could fall to 7 per cent. by 2020. Meanwhile, the Government's target for renewables, which many consider to be optimistic, is for an increase in renewable power from 3.4 per cent. to 20 per cent. by the same date, 2020. These figures show how the majority of the effort that we put into reducing CO <sub>2</sub> emissions through renewable energy is in danger of being wasted if old nuclear power stations are not replaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/26">Importantly for human rights concerns, nuclear fuel can be bought in ways that do not endanger human rights in the same way as gas. It mostly comes from Canada and Australia. Clearly, nuclear power has problems, particularly its waste, though a recent draft statement from CoRWM, the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, envisages a deep underground repository which it describes as safe and</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/27" class="indent">&quot;a fair burden to pass to future generations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/28">Its chair added:</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/29" class="indent">&quot;We have looked at whether the options on our shortlist could accommodate new-build wastes and concluded that they could&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/30">Early indications are that the petrochemical industry, as represented by businesses in Redcar, might be willing to support capital investment in nuclear power generation in return for very important stability of supply in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/31">We should hope that the energy review can find workable solutions so that we can continue to benefit from a relatively affordable carbon-free energy source and so that, by expanding our gas purchasing from unacceptable Governments, we do not simultaneously make the world a worse place both for climate change and for human rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.946.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> for the opportunity to discuss the important issues of human rights and the current energy review. It seems that only recently she and I were discussing equally important questions about women and pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/2">The Government take human rights very seriously and I am proud of the work that we undertake. As a developed country, with a well-established representative democracy, we have a duty to promote good human rights in all interactions that the UK has with other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/3">Energy policy is a truly international issue, as events every week demonstrate. Even though the UK has a large natural resource in oil and gas reserves in the North sea, imports remain an important element of our energy mix. In the future, our imported energy will come from a wide range of sources&mdash;oil from Denmark and Venezuela, and gas from Norway, Qatar and Algeria, for example. Furthermore, some of the world's leading extraction companies, such as BP, BG Group and Shell, are based in the UK. As such, they share the responsibility for protecting human rights wherever they are operating.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/4">As my hon. and learned Friend made clear, the way in which countries use their energy resource is an important issue for the whole international community. It was for this reason that in 2000 the UK and US Governments established a set of international voluntary principles on security and human rights. These are designed to help companies to meet the requirements of their international operations, while respecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those in the host country.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/5">We have continued to work with British companies to promote and expand the work of the voluntary principles initiative. I am pleased to see that those principles have formed the cornerstone of those companies' approach to security and human rights in the countries in which they operate. The initiative is also backed by a number of non-governmental organisations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/6">We are also committed to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines for multinational enterprises. These set out guidelines on responsible business conduct for all companies based in the UK. The guidelines cover areas such as combating bribery, environmental protection and public health and safety. Stable and successful producer countries are crucial for the international community's long-term energy security. The best way to ensure such long-term security is to ensure that the revenues raised from oil are transparently accounted for and used to benefit the people of those countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/7">Through the extractive industries transparency initiative, we are working with Governments in resource-rich countries to improve such governance through the publication and verification of company payments and Government revenues from oil, gas and mining. Some 20 countries&mdash;for example, Azerbaijan and Nigeria, which are significant players in the global liquefied natural gas market&mdash;have either endorsed or are now actively implementing that initiative, and other countries that are global suppliers of uranium, such as Niger, have also endorsed the initiative. We are encouraging emerging markets&mdash;for example, China, India and Brazil&mdash;to support the initiative's implementation in resource-rich countries and by their companies, whether state owned or otherwise. Russia could play a leadership role with those economies.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/8">Our indigenous supplies of energy have declined sooner than expected. We are already a net importer of gas and expect to be a net importer of oil by 2010. There is no doubt that whatever is decided by the energy review, to which my hon. and learned Friend has referred, the UK will be importing significantly more oil and gas in coming years from a range of countries around the world, but heightened concern about global energy issues are affecting perceptions of the security of supply from major exporter countries. Reliance on imports is not per se a threat to security of supplies. Indeed, all other G7 countries, with the single exception of Canada, have been in this position for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/9">Securing our energy supplies from a diversity of countries by a number of different routes is an important factor in our energy policy. We are not putting our eggs all in one basket, because diversity helps us to maintain reliable supplies and mitigates the risks of any interruptions. Oil and gas come to the UK from a variety of countries, but a significant proportion of our current oil and gas imports come from Norway&mdash;for example, 72 per cent. of oil imports and 80 per cent. of gas imports. Countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are also suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/10">The market for liquefied natural gas, which can be shipped like oil, is expanding significantly. The UK expects to receive the first supplies of LNG from Qatar by the end of 2007. As the LNG market becomes more global, it is possible that the UK will receive shipments from other producers such as Nigeria and Egypt. That diversity will help to continue our strong record for the continued physical supply of gas and electricity to end users. We have had fewer unplanned interruptions to electricity than any European country except the Netherlands. The expansion of renewables, to which we still remain committed, is further adding to our diverse generating mix.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/11">We have also been working with the energy intensive users group, which includes the Chemical Industries Association, during the past winter. Our efforts have been focused on maximising gas and electricity supplies, encouraging demand-side response and pursuing fair access to markets across Europe. We are also working with Ofgem, national grid and industry over the summer to ensure that we are in the best possible position ahead of next winter. However, we need to ask ourselves whether we are doing enough to manage the risks of this new situation into the future. That is one of the reasons why the Prime Minister asked me to lead a review of UK energy policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/12">We must ensure that the right framework is in place to help the market to deliver our medium and long-term energy policy goals. The review is therefore looking at the overall framework and within that ensuring reduced carbon emissions, attaining reliable energy supplies, examining the role of nuclear and assessing the potential of carbon abatement and low carbon technologies. In addition, the scope for improving energy efficiency is subject to the review, including achieving affordable and adequately heated homes for the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/13">There are no foregone conclusions in the review, but there is one thing that I am sure of&mdash;there is no single solution and no do-nothing option. We have just finished the formal consultation as part of the review, and the scale of the debate has been impressive. We have received many more than 2,000 responses to our consultation and I have met more than 500 different stakeholders through our extensive programme of seminars, round tables and other activities, from which three key messages have emerged. First, the objectives of the 2003 White Paper are the right ones, and a review for the long term is the right decision. Secondly, there is a need for greater long-term clarity about the direction of UK energy policy. Thirdly, there is a need for action on both energy demand and energy supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.0/14">Everyone, whether in Government, in industry or as an individual, has an important role to play in taking action to meet our energy policy goals. We are analysing the evidence that we see from the consultation and further considering the policy options that the review might recommend. We must continue to provide a framework in which the UK market can supply UK energy requirements while at the same time, of course, having regard to human rights considerations, including through our support of the voluntary principles.</p>
