	<p pid="a.1729.6/1">Generating capacity has an effect on prices. As my hon. Friend is aware, Ofgem has launched a welcome investigation into the electricity and gas markets. In view of the similarities between the price increases imposed on consumers by energy companies, will the Minister ask Ofgem specifically to look into the possibility that the companies are operating a nice, cosy cartel against the public interest and are a major cause of fuel poverty?</p>

	<p pid="a.1729.7/1">My hon. Friend has reflected the concerns of many by talking about fuel poverty. As he is aware, given that in today's climate the cost of a barrel of oil is now in excess of $100, the issue affects not only the UK but countries right around the world. My hon. Friend is right to point out that Ofgem's role is to ensure that no cosy cartel exists, and I am sure that that will be part of the review that it is undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="a.1729.7/2">As a Government, we can ensure that those discussions can take place. My hon. Friends in the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions have been talking with Ofgem representatives about those matters, too. In the meantime, we will continue our attack on fuel poverty through measures such as the winter fuel payment&mdash;now worth up to &pound;300 in households where somebody is aged 80 or more&mdash;and by ensuring that the great inroads that we have made to reduce fuel poverty are not undone by rising fuel prices.</p>

	<p pid="a.1729.8/1">Does the Minister agree that it is important to ensure Scotland's future generating capacity? In that regard, is he aware that the Pentland firth is estimated to have 31 GW of potential? People on both sides of the firth are working to exploit that potential. The last Scottish Executive helped, and the current one is helping; on the other hand, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is being somewhat slow. What can the Minister do to help that UK Department ensure that there is a UK supply of electricity from the far north?</p>

	<p pid="a.1730.0/1">I commend the hon. Gentleman on his question. He is, of course, a distinguished former Liberal Democrat Scottish spokesperson, and if press reports are to be believed, he may be back in that job tomorrow. I look forward to welcoming him back to the post, following the outcome of this evening's vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730.0/2">As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am well aware of the potential of Solway firth; I have been to look at it twice in the past couple of months, and the Minister for Energy has been to the hon. Gentleman's constituency as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730.0/3">I do not accept that DBERR is dragging its heels. We have ensured the correct levels of subsidy at the correct time in the development of technology. Because we have international targets to meet and the threat of climate change is real, those have been designed predominantly to meet the needs of onshore wind technology. However, the next generation of tidal and wave power will have a part to play and the Government stand ready to assist it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1730.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that nuclear power generates more electricity than any other form of power in Scotland, and that the Scottish Executive are irresponsible and short-sighted to rule out building any new nuclear power stations?</p>

	<p pid="a.1730.2/1">Factually, my hon. Friend is entirely correct. Nuclear power is responsible for producing about 40 per cent. of Scotland's electricity. It should be part of a balanced portfolio of energy that includes renewables, which have a very important part to play, as well as clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage. I also agree with my hon. Friend's criticism of the Scottish Executive.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-03-05a.1730.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="1730"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/debtext/80305-0001.htm#08030572001042">
	<p pid="a.1730.3/1">The Minister is, of course, quite wrong. The last figures from DBERR itself show that nuclear power made up only 26 per cent. of generation and was falling as renewables rise. Is the future not with renewable energy, such as that to be produced by the Glendoe hydro-station, which, when it comes on line, will produce enough energy to cover the whole of Glasgow?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-03-05a.1730.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1994" speakername="David Cairns" colnum="1730"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/debtext/80305-0001.htm#08030572001043">
	<p pid="a.1730.4/1">I support the Glendoe hydro-scheme, which the previous Labour-led Scottish Executive consented to. The fact is that, even if we accept the hon. Gentleman's figures&mdash;which are only the case because of temporary outages at Hunterston&mdash;historically speaking, nuclear power has been responsible for 40 per cent. of Scotland's electricity. How would the hon. Gentleman replace that? He could not replace it with intermittent renewables, and he is attempting to con the Scottish people if he says that he can.</p>

	<p pid="a.1731.2/1">As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made clear, the time has come to assess how we can strengthen devolution. The cross-border, cross-party Scottish parliamentary review is the right place for that assessment to be made and I am not in a position to prejudge its outcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.1731.3/1">We have another review, but I remind my friend that Joel Barnett called for a review of the Barnett settlement, which gives to Scotland &pound;1,500 more in public spending per head than it does to England. My question is this: should Holyrood have additional tax or revenue-raising powers, and if so, what are the implications for the Barnett formula?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-03-05a.1731.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1996" speakername="Des Browne" colnum="1731"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/debtext/80305-0001.htm#08030572001047">
	<p pid="a.1731.4/1">I say to my hon. Friend that, as he is well aware, the Scottish Parliament has tax-raising powers under the Scotland Act 1998, but it has chosen not to exercise them. Members of the Scottish Parliament, in a motion that they overwhelmingly passed, accepted that proper financial accountability must be looked at in the context of the review, and we shall have to wait and see what comes out of that process. The Barnett formula has delivered stable and transparent settlements for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales for about 30 years. Despite the lurid headlines in some of the newspapers this morning, there are no plans for any review of the Barnett formula.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.1731.5/1">Last August, the First Minister called for the reconvening of the Joint Ministerial Committees, and we have heard today that that will happen, which my colleagues and I welcome. We also learned today that when Scottish voters last year were deciding in favour of change, there was an embarrassing secret meeting between the Prime Minister and the leader of the Liberal Democrats to stop that change. Still going against public opinion, the Prime Minister says that he wants to take away democratic powers that the Scottish Parliament holds as part of the devolution settlement. Which powers would those be?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-03-05a.1731.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1996" speakername="Des Browne" colnum="1731"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/debtext/80305-0001.htm#08030572001049">
	<p pid="a.1731.6/1">The hon. Gentleman sometimes gets slightly over-excited in these circumstances. We saw there a fine example of the Scottish National party's attitude to Scotland. His question was not, &quot;another day, another grievance&quot;, but &quot;another day, another three grievances&quot;. As I recollect&mdash;I was not party to any of the discussions&mdash;in the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament elections, discussions took place between all sorts of people about the formation of a Government in Scotland. I am absolutely certain that the man who is currently the First Minister in Scotland took part in such discussions. If the hon. Gentleman wants to reveal which discussions took place with various other parties, I would be delighted to hear about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.6/2">As far as the powers of the Scottish Parliament are concerned, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, the settlement for that Parliament includes a degree of flexibility that has, over the years, allowed powers to be transferred to the Scottish Parliament and, on occasions, from it. The test that we will apply as to which powers go and which powers come will be what is in the best interest of the people of Scotland and the Union. If he wants to join me in those discussions, he is welcome to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1732.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that if we are going to discuss the powers of Westminster and the Scottish Parliament, one of the best places to do so is not in the media or commissions, but on the Floor of this House or within parliamentary structures? Would it not be a good idea, as I have suggested to my right hon. Friend in the past, for the Grand Committee to discuss all matters concerning Scotland&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> My right hon. Friend will note that the Liberals and the SNP do not want to discuss Westminster issues in Scotland in this Parliament. I hope that my right hon. Friend agrees with me.</p>

	<p pid="a.1732.1/1">My hon. Friend has raised a point that he has been raising consistently for some time. He is to be commended for his consistent championing of that agenda, but it is a matter for the House rather than the Executive. However, he has made a good point. Those issues are alive, and they ought to be discussed in this Parliament and in the Scottish Parliament. The democratic deficit in Scotland is that, allegedly, a conversation is going on, although it is a pretty muted one, instigated by the Scottish Executive and paid for with public money, but without the authority of the Scottish Parliament. The democratic deficit in Scotland is that the SNP has been unwilling&mdash;dare I say it, afraid&mdash;to bring the national conversation to the Scottish Parliament to get it endorsed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1732.2/1">I thank the Secretary of State for his input so far into discussions leading to the setting up of the Scottish Constitutional Commission. He has always been very positive and engaged. However, he will need to explain to the Prime Minister that there is no appetite in Scotland for the transfer of powers between here and Edinburgh to be a two-way street. Unless that can be explained to the Prime Minister, the prospects for the commission's success will be diminished.</p>

	<p pid="a.1732.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his recognition of my contribution. For my part, I reciprocate that and look forward to building the same sort of relationship with his successor. Our discussions have been constructive, because all the people at the heart of those discussions have the best interests of the Scottish people at heart and reflect the overwhelming view of the Scottish people that devolution must be made to work. Currently, we see a significant reduction in support for independence in Scotland, but that is no wonder, given that we have an Executive running Scotland who are more interested in powers that they do not have than in using those that they do for the people of Scotland. As for the point that the hon. Gentleman has made, I well understand his party's position, but the reality is that the transfer of powers under the 1998 Act has been a two-way street, and we should not deny it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1733.0/1">I understand that the Secretary of State does not want to pre-empt the outcome of the commission, but does he agree that it is a matter of principle that where a Government have responsibility for spending money, they should also have responsibility for raising it and not just have tax-raising powers as an option?</p>

	<p pid="a.1733.1/1">It is interesting that the current Scottish Executive aspire to that position but are taking such powers away from local government in Scotland. There is no question but that financial accountability is an important part of democracy, and I am sure that the review consideration will come up with an answer to that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1733.2/1">I have heard what the Secretary of State has said about reviewing the Barnett formula, but is he really telling the House that no one on the Government Benches believes that such a review should take place?

	<p pid="a.1733.3/1">The hon. Gentleman knows what I have said at the Dispatch Box, but I cannot speak for everybody who sits on the Government Benches, any more than he can speak for everybody who sits on the Conservative Benches behind him. If he wants to know what each person believes, he should ask them. To describe the Secretary of State for Justice, who has responsibility for devolution in departmental terms, as a shadowy figure is a distortion of the truth. The fact of the matter is that no review of the Barnett formula is planned, and I understand from the Leader of the Opposition's comments yesterday that he does not plan one, either.</p>

	<p pid="a.1734.1/1">I am grateful for the hon. Lady's recognition of the world-class clinical care that our troops receive at Selly Oak hospital. That has not always been recognised, but the Defence Committee has done the House, Selly Oak hospital and our troops a significant service by clearly confirming that a world-class service is provided there. The reason the service is world class is that there is a concentration of expertise at Selly Oak hospital that would be almost impossible to replicate anywhere else. I am aware of one occasion, for example, on which a soldier returning from Afghanistan required the attention of 16 trauma consultants. Only Selly Oak hospital can provide that. Any attempt to replicate that anywhere else in the United Kingdom would run the risk of diluting the care that we can give. Selly Oak should be built up.</p>

It has done a service to our armed forces by identifying that one criticism among a small number of criticisms in a report that was otherwise substantially complimentary about medical care. The Scottish Executive&mdash;in particular, the Health Minister in Scotland&mdash;have responded immediately to that matter. They have suggested that their dealings with the Ministry of Defence are very good on that issue, and I can confirm that they are. We will work together to deal with that and sort it out.</p>

It is disagreeable and disappointing that the Scottish National party should choose to make party advantage in that matter.

In the absence of a coherent defence policy, it is not surprising that it chooses to exploit circumstances as it does.

It is now important that economic opportunity is expanded out from the centre to all Glasgow's inhabitants. We will be able to do that only if we ensure that people have the right skills and training to be part of Glasgow's economic success. That will not happen by capping the number of available apprenticeships, which is what the SNP has done, in sharp contrast to the big expansion in apprenticeships that my right hon.

	<p pid="a.1738.0/1">Unemployment in my constituency stands at 2.4 per cent., but that figure will increase because of the cuts being implemented by the Scottish National party.

	<p pid="a.1738.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. Since 1997 there have been more than 250,000 additional jobs in the Scottish economy thanks to Labour's management of the economy, and it is a great shame to see that good work being undone by the SNP, both in the Administration in Edinburgh and locally. I am sure that the voters of Livingston will bear that in mind the next time that they go to the polls.</p>

Some people said that the minimum wage would cost us 2 million jobs. We have a rising minimum wage, and we have created 3 million jobs. I am also delighted to say that in contrast to what others are suggesting&mdash;&pound;10 billion of tax cuts will be paid for by huge cuts in public spending&mdash;we will maintain public services in health, education and transport infrastructure, and those for children and pensioners.

	<p pid="a.1739.3/1">If this were a constitutional treaty, we would hold a referendum. If there were a vote on the euro, we would hold a referendum.

	<p pid="a.1739.6/2">The Prime Minister says that the constitutional concept has been abandoned, yet this treaty includes provision for an EU Foreign Minister, an EU president and an EU diplomatic service. I do not think that Tony Blair is running for president of some feeble organisation. He is running for president of the United States of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1739.6/3">This treaty gets rid of dozens of vetoes, and gives the European Union, for the first time, the ability to get rid of further treaties without another treaty. If it looks like the constitution and sounds like the constitution, that is because it is the constitution. Tony Blair found the courage to back a referendum; why will not the Prime Minister?</p>

He has also forgotten that more young people are in work now than there were in 1997, and that youth unemployment has fallen by 80 per cent. Yes, there is an issue to address about young people who fall through the net and young people who leave school without qualifications, but the only way to deal with it is through the measures that we are taking to raise to the age of 18 the opportunities for young people and not to cut them, as the Conservative party would do.</p>

It is right that he pursues an investigation to see whether competition is working effectively in the industry. It is also true that as a result of the European emissions trading scheme windfall profits have been made by the energy companies. That is a matter on which the head of Ofgem has also commented. The energy companies have made additional money available this year to help people on low incomes pay their fuel bills, but that is a small amount in relation to what the Government are doing through the winter allowance. Our winter allowance is &pound;200 for the over-60s and &pound;300 for the over-80s. This winter, when people are experiencing high utility bills, the winter allowance that we are giving is crucial.</p>

I would have thought that both sides of the House would think it a tragedy that 500,000 mothers die unnecessarily each year in childbirth and that in a country such as Sierra Leone one in every seven mothers dies in childbirth, bringing into life a baby while dying herself. That is why it is very important that the international health partnership that we have formed takes action to deal with maternal mortality. It needs more nurses, more midwives and more help with treatment in those countries. I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because she has put this issue on the agenda in this country. If the Opposition would get serious about issues relating to maternal mortality, perhaps together, as a House, we would take action on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.1746.4/1">The key priority is that we have more doctors who are serving their communities, not just during working hours but during evenings and weekends. That is why it is right that in every area of the country we are investing more in the GP service. I hope that our GPs will vote for the three extra hours that will allow half the practices in this country to offer weekend opening or evening opening so that doctors are available for people when they need them.</p>

We will continue to look at what we can do and to value the service that is given by volunteers, as well as professionals, in this area.

We are proposing major changes in the EU so that it is more outward looking, more global in its orientation, more flexible and less bureaucratic. On her first point, let us be absolutely clear that on every other amending treaty for the EU, the decision has been made by this House and not through a referendum. The Single European Act, Nice, Amsterdam and Maastricht were all decided on in this House. It is the Conservative party that has changed its mind, not the Labour party.</p>

For Members of this House with open prisons in their constituencies, there is a concern that security vetting is being relaxed because there are spare places in open prisons.

	<p pid="a.1747.2/1">I understand that security vetting does take place. The important thing for the hon. Gentleman to recognise is that we have created 20,000 more prison places over the past 10 years. Even this year there will be a rise in prison places from 82,000 to 85,000 and we will create 15,000 more prison places in the years to come. The reason that we are doing that is that we have brought more offences to justice. Five years ago, 1 million offences were brought to justice; now the figure is 1.4 million. That is a tribute to good policing in this country, and it is because we have been prepared to invest in the police services through our public expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1749.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision about the noise emitted by fireworks supplied in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/3">Fireworks used in the United Kingdom are too often too noisy. We need a lower limit on their noise, and improved labelling of fireworks to go along with it. I thank the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of which I am a long-time member, for its assistance with background information to the Bill. I pay tribute to my former colleague Bill Tynan for the work that he did to bring in the Fireworks Act 2003, which has benefited millions of people and millions of pets in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/4">Under the 2003 Act, there is a ban on those aged under 18 buying fireworks. It introduced a curfew on the use of fireworks between 11 pm and 7 am, except on four major festivals: Diwali, Guy Fawkes night on <phrase class="date" code="">5 November</phrase>, new year's eve and Chinese new year. Regulations made under the Act in 2004 introduced a limit of 120 dB for fireworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/5">Fireworks fall into four categories. Category 1 fireworks are suitable for use inside domestic buildings; category 2 fireworks are suitable for outdoor use in relatively confined areas; category 3 fireworks are suitable for outdoor use in large open spaces, and category 4 fireworks are incomplete or not intended for sale to the general public. Most fireworks with which the Bill is concerned, and which concern our constituents, fit into category 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/6">The 2003 Act also introduced criminal sanctions for contravention of fireworks regulations&mdash;an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to six months' imprisonment or a fine up to level 5, which is currently &pound;5,000. Unfortunately, a recent poll suggested that 60 per cent. of people in this country think that the Act and the regulations made under it are not effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/7">Like many Members, I love fireworks&mdash;I love the visuals of fireworks. I am not against fireworks or against their use in domestic situations, but I am against the antisocial use of fireworks, which is generally connected to their noise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/8">Over the years, I have received lots of letters about fireworks, but I have never received a letter about the visual pollution of fireworks, although I appreciate the fact that certain nights of the year may be difficult for astronomers. However, what my constituents write to me about is the noise of fireworks, and I suspect other Members receive similar letters from their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/9">As I said, the current limit is 120 dB. To give the House some idea of what that sounds like, it would be like being 120 m from a passenger jet. A road drill is 100 dB, and 95 dB is roughly equivalent to a book being dropped 1 m on to a table. At a lower level, 70 dB is the normal sound one would hear on a television and, depending on traffic volume, between 70 and 80 dB is the background traffic noise that many of us experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/10">We continue to receive letters from constituents understandably complaining about the noise of fireworks, even though most fireworks sold and used in the United Kingdom are below the current 120 dB limit. However, they still disturb humans and pets, so the Bill would lower the threshold from 120 to 95 dB in the interests of improving the lives of all of us&mdash;human beings and pets. There would also be safety implications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/11">Secondly, the Bill would improve the labelling of fireworks. Three and a half years ago, I tabled early-day motion 1549:</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/12" class="indent">&quot;That this House believes that, in the interests of helping to promote good neighbourliness and animal welfare, regulations should soon be made under the Fireworks Act 2003 requiring all those selling fireworks to label them clearly specifying the decibel level produced by each firework when used.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/13">I want informed choice for consumers. I am sure that many people who buy fireworks have no intention of disturbing their neighbours. However, unless we have clear labelling on the noise level to be emitted by fireworks it is difficult for people to know until they use them whether they will in fact disturb their neighbours or animals in the neighbourhood. We should lower the level allowed for fireworks used in the United Kingdom from 120 dB&mdash;the current limit&mdash;to 95 dB, and we should make sure that fireworks supplied for use in the UK have a clear label specifying the decibel level to be emitted by the firework.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/14" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749.1/15">Bill ordered to be brought in by Rob Marris.</p>

	<p pid="a.1762.0/1">Amendment No. 293 is linked with new clause 1, and its effect is very simple: it would mean that the Act would come into force, and the Lisbon treaty would be ratified by the United Kingdom, only once there had been a referendum of the British people, in line with the manifesto commitments of every party in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.0/2">The Committee will understand that the arguments in favour of a referendum are many and varied. They include the arguments that the issues being decided are of great importance to the governance of Britain, that the constitutional nature of what is being proposed is transparently obvious, and that referendums have become a regular part of our constitutional practice in Britain in recent years, on matters ranging from directly elected mayors to the establishment of a Scottish Parliament. However, there is one argument that all of us in the House would do well to reflect on in the coming hours as we debate the issue of a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. It is an argument that goes to the heart of trust in politics and faith in political institutions. Put simply, it is this: a referendum should be held on the issue because a referendum was promised&mdash;by the Government, by the Opposition and, yes, by the Liberal Democrat party.</p>

	<p pid="a.1763.0/1">While we are talking about trust, on the basis of the right hon. Gentleman's considerable historical knowledge of the Conservative party, can he tell me of any occasion when the Conservative party has held a referendum on any treaty that it has negotiated&mdash;or indeed on anything else at all? Ought we not to measure the Conservative party's attitude by how it behaves in power, rather than how it behaves in opposition?</p>

	<p pid="a.1763.1/1">Parties should be judged on whether they keep the promises that they make. The only occasion on which the Conservative party has promised a referendum, other than on the possible introduction of the euro under the Maastricht treaty, was in the 2005 general election, and we are keeping that promise by voting for the amendment today. It is a pity that the right hon. Gentleman's party will not keep its promise by voting for the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1763.2/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that there have been substantial changes, particularly as regards justice and home affairs, for which the opt-in and opt-out arrangements are far more extensive than they were under the proposed constitution? That was a matter of particular sensitivity for him and his colleagues. Circumstances have changed, and as that great Liberal, Lord Keynes, said,</p>

	<p pid="a.1763.3/1">The hon. Gentleman says that there are substantial differences between the constitution and the treaty before us, but last night on the BBC's &quot;Newsnight&quot;, a commentator said, &quot;There are differences but they are differences of nuance.&quot; He also said: &quot;I think you have to go through some pretty perverse constitutional contortions to be able to go back and explain to the electorate why that promise for a referendum doesn't hold.&quot; That commentator was one Mark Littlewood, head of media for the Liberal Democrats until last year. That is the accurate position. Clearly, it is not only the leader of the hon. Gentleman's party who can run into calamities from time to time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1763.3/2">The promise was made specifically about the European constitution, and given the overwhelming similarity between the constitution and the reform treaty, all attempts to wriggle out of that commitment will only be seen, and will only be, the weasel words with which a solemn promise is deliberately and calculatingly broken.</p>

	<p pid="a.1763.4/1">The right hon. Gentleman speaks of opting out of measures as a nuance, but it is much more than a nuance.

	<p pid="a.1764.4/9" class="indent">&quot;Those points are central to the European constitutional treaty, and of course I see no prospect of their being brought into force, save through the vehicle of a constitutional treaty.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-06">6 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 434, c. 1001.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1764.4/10">Even the most casual voter, looking to see whether the promises made at election time are fulfilled, would recognise that that combination of statements does not allow for the abandonment of the referendum when a redrafted treaty still contains the essence of its constitutional nature, as defined by the current Lord Chancellor himself.</p>

	<p pid="a.1765.2/1">I hope that hon. Gentlemen will wait a moment. I am coming to the Liberal Democrats' manifesto of 2005, then I will gladly give way. That stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1765.2/2" class="indent">&quot;We are therefore clear in our support for the constitution, which we believe is in Britain's interest&mdash;but ratification must be subject to a referendum of the British people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1765.2/3">A few months later, at their party conference in Blackpool, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" name="Nicholas Clegg">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)</phrase> proposed a conference motion that stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1765.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Any proposals which involve significant change in the relationship between the Union, the Member States and its citizens should be approved in Britain through a referendum&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1765.2/5">That is of interest to the Committee, because it went further even than the manifesto commitment. Not only, in the view of the then future leader of the Liberal Democrats, should the constitution be submitted to a referendum, but any proposals involving significant change in the relationship between the EU and its member states, he said, should be submitted to a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1765.2/6">That is an interesting view. Difficult as it is to argue that the Lisbon treaty is fundamentally different from the EU constitution, relying, as the argument does, on the exaggeration of the significance of a small number of changes, when one considers the sheer sweep of the treaty's provisions&mdash;the creation of a president and Foreign Minister, or high representative, the abolition of so many vetoes, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the provision, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase> pointed out, for the abolition of even more to come, the total collapsing of the third pillar of the EU, the widened scope of the European Court of Justice and the increased powers of the European Parliament&mdash;an argument that the treaty is not even a significant change in the relationship of the EU to the member states can only be an exercise in intellectual nonsense and political deception. And that is what it is.</p>

	<p pid="a.1765.3/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way, because he avoided answering my previous intervention on justice and home affairs, which he and his colleagues always regarded as the most sensitive of the subjects that we are considering. Does he now accept, and will he put it on record, that the reform treaty is substantially different from the constitution in that every single aspect of justice and home affairs is subject to an opt-out or an opt-in?

	<p pid="a.1765.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that there are some differences on justice and home affairs, which I will tackle shortly, between the constitution and the Lisbon treaty.

	<p pid="a.1766.1/1">Let me finish my point about the Liberal Democrats before I take a further intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1766.1/2">The leader of the Liberal Democrats should be true to his original conviction. When he wrote in <i> The Guardian </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-15">15 October 2003</phrase>, as a Member of the European Parliament, he attacked the Government for</p>
	<p pid="a.1766.1/3" class="indent">&quot;dismissing all calls for a referendum&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1766.1/4">and</p>
	<p pid="a.1766.1/5" class="indent">&quot;playing straight into the hands of the Eurosceptics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1766.1/6">He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1766.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Nothing will do more damage to the pro-European movement than giving room to the suspicion that we have something to hide, that we do not have the 'cojones' to carry our argument to the people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1766.1/8">An explanation of why the Liberal Democrat leadership's protests in the debates have become ever more shrill is that, at some point in recent months, they have become separated from their cojones. Those unfortunate objects are now to be found impaled on a distant fence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1766.1/9">The argument that the Lisbon treaty is not only different from the European constitution, but so different that entire political parties are relieved of their commitment to hold a referendum does not stand up to much analytical scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="a.1766.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is right to point out that every party in the House committed itself to a referendum, not least the Scottish National party, which committed itself first, and will vote for a referendum this evening. However, is not it right and proper to remember the public in the debate? Opinion poll after opinion poll shows that the overwhelming majority of supporters of the Labour party, the Conservative party, the SNP and even the Liberal Democrats want a referendum on the issue. It is no surprise that cynicism arises in the country about democratic decisions when we ride roughshod over our promises and public opinion on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.1766.3/1">Absolutely. That is well said. People in 10 parliamentary constituencies have had the opportunity, organised by the Electoral Reform Society, to cast a vote. It is noticeable that one of the highest turnouts and one of the largest majorities in favour of a referendum on the treaty was in the constituency of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. The margin for a referendum was vastly greater than his majority at the general election. He should reflect on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1766.6/1">No; my right hon. Friend said &quot;greater than his majority&quot;. The number of votes for the referendum was actually greater than the number that elected the hon.

	<p pid="a.1768.3/1">The Minister says that that is the French, but here come the Belgians. The then Belgian Foreign Minister put it honestly when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.3/2" class="indent">&quot;The aim of the Constitutional Treaty was to be more readable: the aim of this Treaty is to be unreadable... The Constitution aimed to be clear, whereas this Treaty had to be unclear. It is a success.&quot;</p>

If it is unreadable, it is not constitutional, that was the sort of perception...Because if this is the kind of document that the IGC will produce, any Prime Minister&mdash;imagine the UK Prime Minister&mdash;can go to the Commons and say, 'look...it's absolutely unreadable, it's the typical Brussels treaty, nothing new, no need for a referendum.'

	<p pid="a.1768.5/2">A comparative analysis is, however, beyond the capabilities of the Foreign Office, it seems. Throughout last autumn, the initial answers to the written questions that I had tabled to the Foreign Secretary asking for a comparative, clause-by-clause analysis were simply delaying replies, as Ministers worked out how to avoid publishing something so deeply inconvenient to their argument. In the end, the Foreign Secretary just refused to do so, relying on the discredited mantra that the constitutional concept had been abandoned, which was not conducive to open debate. From a Government who are supposedly committed to freedom of information and transparency, that should not be acceptable to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.5/3">As a result, it has been left to others to perform the comparative analysis with intellectual rigour and honesty. The European Scrutiny Committee has published a table showing that the overwhelming majority of the constitution's provisions are replicated in the Lisbon treaty. We always say that we will try not to get the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, who is reading at the moment, into too much trouble, but the Minister for Europe has told us that the hon. Gentleman is in so much trouble as it is that that does not matter any more. The hon. Gentleman said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.5/4" class="indent">&quot;every provision of the constitutional treaty, apart from the flags, mottos and anthems, is to be found in the reform treaty. We think that they are fundamentally the same, and the Government have not produced a table to contradict our position.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-11">11 December 2007</phrase>; Vol. 469, c. 211.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.5/5">Another analysis showed that of the 250 main provisions in the constitution, 240 are replicated in the Lisbon treaty. Every cross-party analysis of the treaty has reached the same conclusion. The Foreign Affairs Committee concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.5/6" class="indent">&quot;there is no material difference between the provisions on foreign affairs in the Constitutional Treaty which the Government made subject to approval in a referendum and those in the Lisbon Treaty on which a referendum is being denied.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.1770.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman thinks that there is a fundamental difference between the documents, but my argument is that there is no fundamental difference between them. Let me complete the answer to that, and I shall come to his second point in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1770.0/2">Faced with that onslaught of evidence and analysis from independent commentators and Committees of this House, the promise breakers have made their last stand on one forlorn but intriguing argument&mdash;the &quot;mouse&quot; argument, originally introduced, I think, by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman will explain later who originally came up with it. That argument concedes that the Lisbon treaty is indeed 90 per cent., or thereabouts, the same as the constitution, &quot;But,&quot; it goes on, with an air of triumph inappropriate to the facts available, &quot;a mouse is 90 per cent. genetically the same as a human being, and it is the 10 per cent. difference that really counts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1770.0/3">The difference between a man and a mouse is indeed a fascinating question, and if Liberal Democrat Front Benchers vote for a referendum tonight, the performance of their leader might be part of the analysis of that difference. Even if we bend over backwards to accommodate that view, however, by no stretch of the imagination do the changes made between the two documents turn the man-like constitution into the mouse-like treaty of Lisbon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1770.0/4">Compared with the constitution, the Lisbon treaty contains some improvements, such as the explicit ruling out of European Court of Justice competence in foreign policy and the six words on climate change, which we debated last week. They are nice to have, but they make no material difference to the policies, powers or procedures of the EU. The changes between the constitution and the Lisbon treaty also take one important step backwards&mdash;the removal of the commitment to undistorted competition within the EU from the overriding objectives of the European treaties&mdash;but the vast majority of the rest is the same.</p>

We would not be arguing about the same things if the two documents were fundamentally different. The Government are fond of alleging that the Conservative party is alone in its view of European affairs&mdash;they always omit to mention that they opposed vast tracts of the treaty to which they have now signed up&mdash;but on the issue of whether the constitution and the treaty are the same, it is the Government who are alone in Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.1771.6/1">I must proceed for another few minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/2">The Government cannot argue that the treaty is different and that the referendum is unnecessary because they have met their four red lines, which relates to the point that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has just made. One of the red lines was that the treaty should have no impact on tax policy. The fact that the impact on tax is the same in the treaty as it was in the constitution is clear&mdash;there is no impact at all. It was only ever a red herring that Tony Blair invented when he was before the Liaison Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/3">The second red line is that there should be no loss of independence in foreign policy&mdash;that can be debated in respect of either document&mdash;but other than the renaming of the foreign minister as the high representative, almost nothing has changed between the two documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/4">A third red line&mdash;claimed by Tony Blair at the Dispatch Box in front of me at the end of June in his last days in office&mdash;was a clear opt-out from the charter of fundamental rights, but the Minister for Europe has since told us:</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/5" class="indent">&quot;The fact is that the United Kingdom has neither sought nor achieved an opt-out on the charter of fundamental rights, which will apply in every member state of the European Union.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-28">28 January 2008</phrase>; Vol. 471, c. 34.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/6">That is a total reversal of what the former Prime Minister said, and he is no longer here to explain that to the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/7">The final red line was the opt-in on justice and home affairs. The value of that has been debated, and the European Scrutiny Committee has cast doubts on parts of it. The Government claim to have met their red lines, although few objective analysts agree with them, but when they promised a referendum they made exactly the same claim about their red lines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/8">So, what has really changed between Tony Blair standing at the Dispatch Box and saying</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/9" class="indent">&quot;let the battle be joined.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-20">20 April 2004</phrase>; Vol. 420, c. 157.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/10">about a referendum in April 2004, and the current Prime Minister saying, &quot;Let battle be avoided at any cost, and please don't let me be photographed at the signing ceremony&quot;? Only two things have changed: the general election of 2005 was got out of the way, and the Government decided that a referendum could not be held because they did not think that they would win it. The Prime Minister who did not have the bottle to call a general election he had prepared for is the same Prime Minister who does not have the courage or honour to hold a referendum that he has promised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/11">As a result, this treaty is devoid of any democratic mandate or legitimacy, which is a rarity in the history of European treaties. The authority of the Wilson Government in the '60s to pursue entry negotiations into the then European Economic Community derived from a clear commitment in their election manifesto. The mandate of the Conservative Government elected in 1970 to complete those entry negotiations was based on an explicit manifesto commitment. The Labour Government elected in 1974 said that they would hold a referendum, and they did. The Conservative manifesto in 1992 included the intention to ratify the treaty of Maastricht. However, nowhere did the Labour manifesto of 2005 say that if the constitution were defeated elsewhere in Europe, it would be brought back with a few tweaks or that a commitment to a British referendum would be abandoned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/12">The opportunity to call a general election last autumn, with the ratification of the treaty proposed in the Government's manifesto, was not taken up. Given that the treaty brings about major changes in the way in which Britain is governed, the Government have nowhere&mdash;neither in a general election nor in a referendum&mdash;requested or received the authority and consent of the people. The absence of such authority damages the democratic legitimacy of the European Union in the eyes of the electorate. The unwillingness of those who favour a treaty of this kind to submit their views to the electorate contributes neither to democracy nor to the quality of argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/13">In a speech last month to the Centre for European Reform, the Foreign Secretary was reported to have said that once the new EU treaty had been ratified, pro-Europeans in Britain, as he termed them, would have no more excuses in trying to combat public hostility to the EU. The implication is that, once the treaty is ratified without the voters' consent, Ministers must start working on the voters in order to encourage them to favour such things. What is wrong with trying to persuade the voters of the merits of the case before ratification, rather than afterwards? What does it say about the convictions of politicians when they reserve their arguments for following quietly in the wake of decisions, rather than arguing boldly for them in advance? It tells us that their calculations are more important than their convictions. As one commentator wrote yesterday in <i> The Independent</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1771.6/14" class="indent">&quot;This treaty strategy is Gordon Brown's personal creation, this is his specified treatment of Parliament, and visible to all is his definition of politics as cynicism in action.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.1773.0/1">I think that the United Kingdom negotiated a good deal. Indeed, many in France would say that the rejection of the constitutional treaty in a referendum has led to a worse deal for France on the Lisbon treaty. If the right hon. Gentleman had his way, and there were a referendum and it were lost, what evidence does he have that the UK could renegotiate a better treaty for itself?

	<p pid="a.1773.1/1">Of course, there are many arguments, which are probably beyond the scope of the amendment&mdash;they are certainly beyond the time available for my speech&mdash;about what could be achieved in different situations and through different negotiations. We could go into all the arguments about what would have happened if the Government had actually taken a lead in the past two years, rather than sitting immobile and allowing this to be done to them&mdash;declaring the constitution dead two years ago. They could have negotiated many things more successfully. The argument that we cannot possibly ever say no for fear of what would happen afterwards is a strange argument in a democracy. This House must be able to come to a judgment, and the country should be able to come to a judgment, when it has been promised the opportunity to do so. The Government's refusal to call a referendum&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1774.0/1">If the Liberal Democrat party is so concerned about the implications of a &quot;no&quot; result in a referendum on the treaty, it should not have included a commitment to such a referendum in its election manifesto. The hon. Gentleman makes the point that an in-out referendum would give a clear view. On the question of in or out, it would give a clear view, but it would tell us nothing about what people think about the Lisbon treaty.

	<p pid="a.1775.4/1">No, I am explaining my argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.4/2">It is central to people's faith in participation, which we so strongly encourage, that Members of Parliament, once elected, do their best to be true to the broad direction and principal promises that they have made to voters. On occasion, when Members of Parliament cannot do so, there should be a compelling reason that the country as a whole can understand and, at least in part, accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.4/3">No such argument prevails in this case. If the Committee votes down the amendments calling for a referendum, we will have to go to our schools and colleges and say that there are times when almost the entire House of Commons can be elected on a specific pledge, and yet a majority in the House can then decide to renege on it, not because it is unaffordable, not because there is an emergency and not because the voters no longer want that pledge, but simply because those in the majority calculate that it suits them in the short term and that they can probably get away with it. The unavoidable implication is that politicians are not trustworthy, that Parliament does not see itself as accountable and that votes do not necessarily matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.4/4">So, I believe not only that a referendum is right and appropriate on a treaty of such importance, but that if the Committee were to tell the Government today that a clear promise that could so easily be kept ought to be kept, it would, in a climate of loss of faith in political institutions, do more to restore public confidence in the basic honesty and accountability of our politics than any other action that we could take. The Prime Minister said that trust in the Government was central to his purpose. The leader of the Liberal Democrats called for</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.4/5" class="indent">&quot;a new politics, of politicians who listen to people, not themselves.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.4/6">If those leaders remain heedless of the arguments for a referendum on the treaty, they will win short-term relief from the views of the electorate tonight, but the damage to their standing and to the politics and reputation of our country and Parliament is something on which they will have to reflect and repent for many years.</p>

The question is whether the new treaty produces the same substantial effect as the constitutional treaty. We said that that is the case only</p>

Because, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> said, we have secured an extension of the UK's current opt-in arrangements. The UK has a right to choose when it wants to share power by joining EU arrangements in those areas. Let me quote what the European Scrutiny Committee said on the subject. It concluded that it was</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.5/3" class="indent">&quot;clear from the 'opt-in' arrangements that the UK is free to decide whether or not to take part, and to that extent is able to protect the distinctive features of the legal systems of the UK&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.5/4">Similarly, nothing in the charter of fundamental rights extends the ability of any court&mdash;European or national&mdash;to strike down UK law. Professor Alan Dashwood of Cambridge university, a leading expert in this area, concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.5/5" class="indent">&quot;the Charter is not, in itself, a source of rights but simply provides a record of rights that receive protection within the Union, from one source or another&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.1783.6/1">Is it not the case that one of the core changes is that the treaty not only extends competences, but means that many new policy areas will now become shared competences? Over time, disputes in those policy areas will be determined by the European Court of Justice. As declaration 17 annexed to the treaty shows, that takes primacy over this House, which is a huge shift of power.</p>

	<p pid="a.1784.1/1">I would never describe the Foreign Affairs Committee's conclusions as absurd. However, to give just one example, under the constitutional treaty all foreign policy activity was merged into a single treaty pillar.

	<p pid="a.1784.2/3">That, I think, is the essence of what my right hon. Friend has been saying. Fortunately, it comes from our manifesto of 2005, which defines the constitutional treaty. Can he tell us the difference between that definition and his definition of the Lisbon treaty?</p>

	<p pid="a.1784.3/1">There are big differences. First, the structure of the constitution abandoned all previous treaties that governed the EU. This treaty does not do that. Secondly, in respect of a range of policies&mdash;notably on justice and home affairs, but also on other areas&mdash;the content is different. Thirdly, in respect of the consequences, the constitutional treaty was alleged by many Conservative Members to be a slipway to a superstate. Under the Lisbon treaty and the conclusions of last month's European Council, there is an agreement that there shall be no further institutional reform for the foreseeable future. So in structure, in content and in consequence, this is different.</p>

Far from being novel or an innovation, they are an established part of the EU machinery. Contrary to what the right hon.

	<p pid="a.1787.8/1">I certainly believe that it would send us to the margins of Europe, which would be very damaging to the national interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1787.8/2">At every stage the Lisbon treaty amends existing treaties instead of replacing them, contrary to what was done by the constitutional treaty. The constitutional treaty restarted the EU from scratch. It abolished previous treaties, and created a new one. The constitutional treaty did not make special provision for Britain in respect of justice and home affairs. The reform treaty does, in inordinate detail and in respect of all JHA measures. The constitutional treaty left open the opportunity for the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks to advance specious arguments about a European superstate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1787.8/3">Those are the reasons why the Law Society of England and Wales says that this treaty</p>
	<p pid="a.1787.8/4" class="indent">&quot;does not have the same ambitions as the previous Constitutional Treaty&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1787.8/5">It is why eight European Governments who promised a referendum on the constitution no longer consider it necessary. It is why the Conservative Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Balkenende, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1787.8/6" class="indent">&quot;We are not talking about a Constitution. The Constitution has gone.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1787.8/7">It is why Giuliano Amato, who was prayed in aid by the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, says that what was agreed was &quot;a cluster of amendments&quot;, not &quot;a new constitution&quot;. It is why Professor Damian Chalmers, a leading authority at the London School of Economics, says that this is</p>
	<p pid="a.1787.8/8" class="indent">&quot;probably the most limited reform, with the exception of the Treaty of Nice, that we have seen in the last twenty years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1787.8/9">So the content of the treaty does not justify a referendum, and the comparison to other treaties does not either.</p>
	<p pid="a.1787.8/10">The Single European Act&mdash;which was piloted through the House by the Conservative party&mdash;set out the terms for the creation of a single market, created the concept of the convergence of economic and monetary policies, and provided for co-operation on foreign policy. No referendum was required; I wonder why. [Hon. Members: &quot;Why?&quot;] The reason why is that it did not shift the balance of power in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.1789.3/1">I want to bring my speech to a close.</p>
	<p pid="a.1789.3/2">On day five of the debate, on foreign affairs, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, who speaks for the Opposition&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot; Brilliantly.&quot;] He is a very good after-dinner speaker, although I am not sure about the content. The right hon. Gentleman let the cat out of the bag. He could not think of one change in the treaty that he supported&mdash;not a single one. He wants to rely on the previous arrangements agreed at Nice, but what did he say about the Nice treaty? He opposed that, too. He claimed that the European security and defence policy provisions were a step towards &quot;a superstate&quot; and that they would progressively &quot;move away from NATO.&quot; So he does not support the Nice treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1789.3/3">What about arrangements before that, such as the treaty agreed at Amsterdam? The right hon. Gentleman opposed that, too. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1789.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Amsterdam was a bad Treaty. Bad for Europe and bad for Britain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1789.3/5">There is a pattern here. The right hon. Gentleman opposes every single treaty that comes before us: no to the Lisbon treaty, no to the Nice treaty, and no to the Amsterdam Treaty. No, no, no: we have heard that before from the Dispatch Box.</p>
	<p pid="a.1789.3/6">That makes the key point that the Conservative party has a fundamental problem: 18 years after Mrs. Thatcher's departure from office, it is still haunted by the Thatcherite policy on Europe, and 16 years after Maastricht, the rebels on the fringes of the party are now calling the shots. It is no wonder one of the Conservative party's MEPs has described its Europe policy as a poisonous fungus eating away at the heart of the party.</p>
	<p pid="a.1789.3/7">The question before us is simple: do the contents of the treaty constitute a fundamental shift in the balance of power? The answer is no. The responsibility is ours, as Members of Parliament; I say, vote down the amendments and let us do what we are paid for.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-03-05a.1789.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" speakername="Edward Davey" colnum="1789"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/debtext/80305-0010.htm#08030572001334">
	<p pid="a.1789.4/1">It is already clear from the debate that the key question is whether the Lisbon treaty is the same as the constitutional treaty. There is a strong case that Members who promised a treaty referendum at the general election and who agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase> that the treaties are the same should back the Conservative amendment, and that those who do not agree with him should not support it. However, Members who are in favour of a referendum on the principle, as the Liberal Democrats are, but not on one on Lisbon on the grounds that it is different from the old constitutional treaty, should abstain tonight, as we will.</p>
	<p pid="a.1789.4/2">The Conservatives have said throughout our proceedings that the old and new treaties are more or less the same. They are wrong. The truth is that the treaties are different in nature&mdash;different in the very essence of what they mean&mdash;and that for the UK especially there are key differences in substantive detail. The fact that the Conservatives try to ignore that does them absolutely no credit&mdash;and neither does their shabby complicity with the Government yesterday, when they conspired to restrict choice and curb free speech in this House. They have gagged open debate on Europe in this House, and we will make sure the voters know that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1791.3/2">Let me return to the differences between the treaties, and in particular the different natures of the treaties. One treaty was of supreme constitutional significance; the other treaty simply makes modest reforms. One treaty replaced all the past EU treaties with one document; the other is merely an amending treaty. One treaty would, effectively, have given the people a chance to vote on the principle of Britain's membership of the EU, and the other would give the people a chance to vote on whether they wanted to cut the number of EU Commissioners by a third.</p>

The treaties that saw the most significant transfer of power, the Single European Act and Maastricht, were pushed through this House by Tory Governments, with not a word from the Tory Front Bench about a referendum. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase> said, those on the Conservative Front Bench have only ever promised referendums when in opposition, and only on the minor treaties such as Amsterdam, Nice and now Lisbon.

	<p pid="a.1792.5/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The difference between the Lisbon treaty and the constitutional treaty is to do with that very point. The constitutional treaty would have allowed people a vote on the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty, and Nice and Amsterdam. We should have had a referendum on that, because it was a genuinely constitutional treaty wrapping all up the other treaties in one document. The Lisbon treaty does not do that. A vote on Lisbon offers no vote on Rome, no vote on Maastricht and no vote on the Single European Act. It really is that simple.</p>

That is the difference: one of the documents had all the treaties in it, and the other does not. Only the Conservatives could deny that significant difference.</p>

	<p pid="a.1793.3/2">I have been focusing on the difference in the nature of the treaties for a very good reason. We Liberal Democrats believe that referendums should be used not willy-nilly, but with care and sparingly, for issues of constitutional significance. Even for issues of constitutional significance, it is not always clear to me that we need a referendum. I do not think that anyone in any party argued for a referendum when this House passed the Human Rights Act&mdash;or, indeed, back in 1950, when the European convention on human rights was signed. We rarely, if at all, hear arguments that there should be a referendum on reform of the House of Lords or the Freedom of Information Act, so there are many constitutional issues on which people do not think there should be a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1793.3/3">We believe that such analysis is directly relevant when one comes to make the judgment about whether a European treaty deserves a referendum. Treaties that make modest institutional reforms to make the European Union more efficient for enlargement, such as Lisbon, simply do not have the constitutional impact that some Members wish to ascribe to them.</p>

Back in 2006, he made a very interesting comment on the nature of European treaties. He said of the defunct constitutional treaty that</p>
	<p pid="a.1795.6/3" class="indent">&quot;the fact that it was a Constitution, not simply a treaty, would have revolutionised the EU.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1795.6/4">There we have it&mdash;a revolutionary document, or a simple treaty? Referendums are the democratic way&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Revolutions are important in our government, and I would suggest that referendums are the democratic way to judge constitutional revolutions, but they are absolutely not the way to referee institutional reforms. That is why we Liberal Democrats believe that the only way to honour the pledge on Europe that most Members of this House gave at the last election is an in-out referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1795.6/5">We heard yesterday, and we have heard today, accusations that people think that this is some sort of ruse&mdash;that somehow, we have made it up, that we imagined it all of a sudden. Let me take the House back to the history of the pledge that we made. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2011" name="Charles Kennedy">My right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy)</phrase>, the then leader of the Liberal Democrats, explained before the general election what we considered our pledge to mean. When arguing the case for a referendum on the constitutional treaty, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1795.6/6" class="indent">&quot;It's time for this debate&mdash;time for us to decide what we actually want from Europe. I believe, once the argument has been joined, the consensus will be that it's better to be in than out.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1795.6/7">He was right; that was the significance of our referendum pledge on the constitutional treaty.</p>

The explanation was spelt out by the leader of his party, who said that it would all depend on the electoral arithmetic in the House.

	<p pid="a.1796.5/1">I shall make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.5/2">I have dealt at length with the difference in nature between the treaties, so let me deal with the differences of substantive detail. When one looks at the really big changes proposed in the old treaty, one finds that, as has emerged from the debate, by far the biggest one was on justice and home affairs. To be specific&mdash;as this debate so far has not been&mdash;the proposal that the EU would have competence over cross-border police co-operation and cross-border aspects of criminal justice represents, to any fair-minded person, a big shift. It is arguable whether it is of major constitutional significance, but it was the biggest proposed transfer of power in the original treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.5/3">What happened to that transfer provision in the time between the old and new treaties? It remained for other member states, but the United Kingdom negotiated new opt-ins. That is a massive change. When pressed, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks had to acknowledge that, in a way that Conservatives had not done during the rest of our proceedings. What is even more interesting about the UK opt-ins negotiated at Lisbon, which were not in the old treaty, is that they went much further; indeed, they took power back from the EU. Britain gained new opt-ins on aspects of JHA in areas that the Conservatives had signed away at Maastricht. That is one of the greatest ironies of this debate. The Conservatives not only want a referendum on a document that is significantly different, but in opposing the Lisbon treaty, they oppose powers being brought back to this country.</p>

Both treaties sought to change &quot;ecu&quot; to &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;economic community&quot; to &quot;European Union&quot; in all the past treaties. Both treaties contain a hatful of useful reforms, from energy liberalisation to information sharing about sex offenders, from cutting the bureaucracy to strengthening accountability. Are those the reasons why any of us promised a referendum? Absolutely not. Is it contentious to co-operate on tackling terrorism more effectively? Do we need a referendum on that? Why are the Conservatives so worried about Britain being more able to influence countries in eastern Europe? Is it to clamp down on the trafficking of guns, of drugs or of people? As has been said, when the facts change and the treaties change, people should have the courage to admit that.</p>

I think it is good that the size of the Commission will be reduced, because I want an effective Commission, but we must consider the institutional structures. There is a basic principle that at any one time every country should be represented in the Commission. Once the Commission's size is reduced that will no longer happen. That is significant, so the treaty contains big changes. Some may be good, others not so good, but the word &quot;modest&quot; does not apply.</p>

	<p pid="a.1798.5/1">No, I will not give way, because I want to make some progress. As the House knows, the Liberal Democrats believe that there should be a referendum on Britain's membership, because as pro-Europeans, we want to argue that case. We believe that such a referendum would enable us to get on to the front foot for the first time in a generation to argue the case for Europe. More importantly, it would enable us to set to rest people's concerns about Europe and rebuild the deep coalition for Europe. Whether on climate change or on globalisation, on beating terrorism or on tackling international crime, the arguments for the future role of Europe are as strong as the past arguments for a Europe that has helped to bring peace and prosperity, democracy and human rights to our once battered and divided continent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1798.5/2">With so much at stake, there is a price to be paid for a strategy of Eurosceptic appeasement, which some pro-Europeans have adopted. That appeasement process means that deliberate misrepresentations of Europe go unchallenged, policies that are in the interest of Britain are not adopted, and the power of Britain's voice and influence at the European table is diminished and reduced. How long can we go on appeasing the people who hold such views? They are damaging Britain's national interest. The Foreign Secretary and his colleagues must address that point, because they are in danger of becoming the arch-appeasers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1798.5/3">The Prime Minister will jump when Mr. Murdoch calls, but arrived deliberately late for a European summit with 26 other countries.

Member for Richmond, Yorks are writing their manifestos tonight either.</p>
	<p pid="a.1799.1/2">It is time that we took the Europhobes on and called their bluff. I am sceptical about Eurosceptics. On the whole, they are really anti-Europeans and Europhobes, seeking to adopt a veneer of respectability and unwilling to see that to reform Europe is to be in Europe, at the table, arguing for your views. With a referendum on membership, the weakness of that position would be exposed, and with the yes vote winning through, as I believe it would, Britain could be unshackled from the chains of appeasement and ensure that European policy was based once again on a clear calculation of the national interest, and not on the interests of a weak Government avoiding screaming anti-European headlines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1799.1/3">We know from the polls that it is the referendum on membership that the British people really want. The MORI poll last weekend was the only poll of the British people that has asked the relevant question&mdash;whether</p>

	<p pid="a.1800.2/1">No, and I shall explain why. The hon. Gentleman has a principled position on the European Union, which a fair number of his colleagues share&mdash;they want to get out. The past 11 days of debate have made it clear that the new leadership in the Conservative party has not been able to move the party to the centre of British politics, where the majority of people believe that we are better off as part of the European Union. There is still a group in the Conservative party that has a stranglehold on policy on Europe, and it wants to take Britain out of the European Union. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for confirming that he is part of that group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1800.2/2">My first point concerns the history of the manifesto commitment in 2005. In 2004, the then Prime Minister took the view that the constitutional treaty that was being developed in the European Union, with the help of some of my hon. Friends, who played a key role, was in essence a refounding of the institution. The constitutional treaty aimed to repeal all the existing treaties and replace them. The former Prime Minister believed that that was of such significance that it formed a new constitutional structure for the European Union. He came to this House and said as much on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-20">20 April 2004</phrase>, when he made his position clear about the need for the British people to vote on the constitutional treaty.</p>

However, the European Scrutiny Committee has said that this treaty is substantially equivalent to the constitutional treaty. Does that not mean that this treaty should be subject to a referendum?</p>

	<p pid="a.1801.6/1">I am trying to explain why the manifesto referred to just the new constitutional treaty, and why we are not therefore breaking a promise.

	<p pid="a.1801.6/3">The point that many hon. Members fail to recognise is that the manifesto was absolutely clear and referred specifically to the new constitutional treaty. We made a commitment to have a vote on the new constitutional treaty, and we definitely meant that constitutional treaty. When we put those words in the manifesto, there was no doubt that we were referring to the new constitutional treaty, which was what we had in mind when we included those words in our manifesto.

Some talked about returning to the French or the Dutch to try to get a positive vote in favour of the European constitutional treaty, as it then was.

	<p pid="a.1803.5/1">I do not mean to detain the right hon. Gentleman for any length of time. May I take him back to the point about the manifesto, because the debate runs around it? The truth is that the manifesto is wonderfully general, and the words used are intriguing&mdash;they prompt some questions. The manifesto states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1803.5/2" class="indent">&quot;The new Constitutional Treaty ensures the new Europe can work effectively, and that Britain keeps control of key national interests like foreign policy, taxation, social security and defence. The Treaty sets out what the EU can do and what it cannot.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1803.5/3">That is exactly what the Government say about the treaty of Lisbon, and it is no different from the way in which they sold the constitutional treaty in 2005. There is therefore no reason why they should not vote for a referendum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1804.0/1">Yet again, I must disagree with the right hon. Gentleman. The promise for a referendum referred to the new constitutional treaty, and we can then discuss what people believed that it stood for and so on. However, the promise concerned the new constitutional treaty, which, as we have heard, was voted down by voters in France and Holland and an attempt to resurrect it was effectively killed off. When we took over the EU presidency in July 2005, we had a period of reflection and, to everybody's benefit, we managed to shift from the concept of a constitutional treaty to considering a measure that is far more modest in its effect&mdash;the Lisbon treaty. There was a period of reflection, and the view was taken that perhaps too much power was being given to the EU and that it was far better to get consensus from nation states, which the Lisbon treaty now reflects. That was the background to the manifesto pledge, and the commitment was to a vote on the new constitutional treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1804.0/2">There are many differences between what was discussed in 2004-05 and what we have as a result of the Lisbon treaty. The Foreign Secretary has taken us through some of the major differences in content. I was interested to hear the shadow Foreign Secretary on the radio this morning. It is unfortunate that he is not in his place, because he came up with the totally illogical argument that a referendum was needed not because of content but because of some great principle that there should be a vote. He failed to address the substantive differences between the constitutional treaty and the treaty of Lisbon, but he knows that they are major and significant. He is looking for an argument to escape from the difficult position he would be in if he had to compare the content of the two treaties.</p>

	<p pid="a.1804.1/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman not accept that after the rejection of the constitutional treaty by voters in France and Holland Governments produced a document that would achieve pretty much the same things? They made what they felt were sufficient changes to deny that it is fundamentally the same. Will he not accept that this treaty is intended fundamentally to do the same job as the constitutional treaty, and that changes have been made cynically to avoid giving the people a say, not only in this country but in others across Europe?</p>

	<p pid="a.1804.2/1">No, I do not agree with that. Interestingly, there are different constitutional situations in different countries. My understanding is that nine countries planned to hold referendums on the old constitutional treaty, of which one was the United Kingdom. Because it was regarded as a constitutional matter, not just a political decision, many countries were legally obliged to do so. Because the Lisbon treaty is so different, there is no need to have referendums in most of those countries&mdash;I think that Ireland is the exception.</p>
	<p pid="a.1804.2/2">The view taken by the Dutch Council of State&mdash;an independent body that advises the Dutch Government on the steps that they must take to ratify treaties&mdash;is particularly instructive and helpful. It is a constitutional requirement that there must be a referendum on a constitutional matter, and that body advises the Dutch Government on particular measures. Its conclusion on the constitutional treaty in 2004 was that it had to be put to a referendum, because it would change the Dutch constitution. Its conclusion on the Lisbon treaty was quite different, stating that it</p>
	<p pid="a.1804.2/3" class="indent">&quot;provides no arguments for the gradual expansion of the EU towards a more explicit state or federation. The treaty is substantially different from the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1804.2/4">So there was a significant difference in the view and recommendations of the independent Dutch Council of State. There is clearly a difference between the two treaties, which is why eight of the nine countries that originally planned a referendum no longer do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1804.2/5">The treaty of Lisbon contains a modest set of proposals that will provide a stable framework to allow EU expansion to be more effective. The differences between it and the constitutional treaty are major and significant. The Foreign Secretary took us through a few of them, and, although I do not wish to detain the Committee by going through a long list, we should be prepared to recognise them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1805.4/1">I am grateful. Is not the situation worse than the right hon. Gentleman says? The Conservative party is suggesting that, if the treaty were ratified, functioning and operational, and there were a change of Government in this country in two years' time&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] They say &quot;Hear, hear&quot;, but they would disrupt the workings of 27 member states and effectively terminate Britain's constructive engagement in Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.1805.5/1">That is a helpful intervention, and the response of Conservative Members says it all. The Conservative party has no time for the whole concept of the EU, and it is turning its back on the EU just at the time when we probably need it more than ever, because of what is happening in the world in general. As I have said, I shall not go through the detail of the changes in the treaty, as my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary did that very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1805.5/2">My final point concerns the responsibility of Members of this House. I have no doubt that, because of my speech today and the way in which I will cast my vote this evening in the Division, I will lose votes in my constituency. Some people will not vote for me at the next general election because of the position that I am taking. That is part of the democratic process and a representative democracy, and I am prepared to accept it. I will make the case as best I can, but I recognise that in a democracy, we take decisions in the House and take responsibility for them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1806.1/1">Clearly the hon. Gentleman was not listening to the points that I made earlier. I hope that my constituents will pay me a bit more attention than he has. We made the promise in relation to the new constitutional treaty, which is no longer in place, and we shall see whether people are prepared to accept that. The hon. Gentleman confirms my point about the nature of our democratic accountability as Members of Parliament. I do not think that every single issue must be subject to a referendum, because referendums can be an excuse to hide divisions in political parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1806.1/2">I agree very much with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the point that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> made last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.1806.1/3" class="indent">&quot;It always was crackpot to argue that it was transferring great powers to Brussels and there's an important constitutional change. It doesn't justify a referendum and it never did.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1806.1/4">I agree absolutely with that statement of the position. We need to take a decision here in Committee and be accountable for so doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1806.1/5">The debate has shown the divisions in the Conservative party and, more importantly, the failure of its leader to bring it into the centre ground of British politics. He is a hostage to his Eurosceptics, and it is interesting to see that the hostility towards Europe in the Conservative party is still so powerful that a new leader, who is trying to remodel and reposition the party, has totally failed to do so on Europe. As time goes by, the other policy areas on which he has failed to move the party will be revealed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1806.1/6">We need Europe more than ever at this time of globalisation and rising protectionism, which we are seeing in the American presidential debates. We need measures to tackle climate change and deal with mass migration, and we need a functioning and effective EU to meet those challenges. Now is not the time to walk off the stage; it is the time to be at the heart of Europe arguing for our national interests. That is what Labour Members intend to do, and that is why the treaty should be ratified by this House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1806.2/1">I am grateful for the chance to take part in the debate. I had hoped to speak about the referendum on Second Reading, but unfortunately I was suffering from flu and had no voice that day, so I had to leave my comments until today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1806.2/2">The debate on the amendment will be remembered most for the impressive sight of the Liberal Democrat party marching with sound and fury courageously towards the fence on which it has been ordered to perch tonight. The other thing that has struck me during the debates on the Bill is the backcloth of the Labour strategy towards Europe; it is based on the extraordinary belief that if they do not allow the British people the chance to express through a referendum their growing doubts about the European Union they will somehow come to love the European Union. That is gravely to underestimate the British people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1806.2/3">We are told that a referendum is not needed because the treaty does not, in effect, do very much. That has been the main argument. It was even the argument when we were talking about the constitutional treaty: we were told that it, too, did not do very much. However, even if that were true, which it is not, as my right hon. Friend the shadow Foreign Secretary impressively indicated earlier, it takes only a small step to walk through a doorway into another room; it takes only a small step to cross a dividing line. I believe that the treaty is the latest and the most significant step down the road of ever-closer union to the project of a united Europe which is at the heart of the policies of so many other Governments in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1806.2/4">We fool ourselves if we believe that somehow the treaty is not actually taking us one step further down that road, yet the British people have never been allowed to say whether they want to go down that road. Each step&mdash;each of the recent treaties&mdash;has been described in the House as insignificant, as not doing very much, but each, like grandmother's footsteps, edges us closer and closer towards the goal of a united Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1806.2/5">My growing disillusion with the way in which Europe is developing is shared by many others in the UK who, like me, did not start out as Eurosceptics. I supported the Common Market in the first and only referendum but, over recent years, my Euro-friendliness has been increasingly tested by a series of treaties, each incrementally diminishing the sovereignty of this Parliament and, therefore, of the British people without the British people ever being asked whether they wanted that to happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.1807.0/1">I am intrigued by the argument that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is developing, but what is his response to the facts? He is talking about a federal superstate, but the entire professional staff of all the European Union institutions is smaller than the staff of Hampshire county council. Will he also respond to the point that on average 40 per cent. of gross domestic product goes on public spending, yet the European institutions spend only 1 per cent. of GDP? Where does the paranoid delusion that he is attempting to articulate come from?</p>

	<p pid="a.1807.1/1">I am not talking about the bureaucracy of the European Union, but about the wishes of the British people. That is, in essence, what the debate is about. The Europe achieved by the treaty of Lisbon is unacceptable to the British people; it crosses the dividing line. However big or small a step it is, we are moving into a new Europe where, as we have already heard, we will have a president, a foreign secretary, diplomats and all the trappings of what so many of the Europhiles in Europe want&mdash;the beginnings of a European state.</p>
	<p pid="a.1807.1/2">If I am wrong about the treaty being unacceptable, why do the Government not ask the British people whether they believe it is unacceptable? If I am right&mdash;as I have every reason to believe that I am&mdash;the Government have no mandate to force through the treaty without any form of consultation with the British people, either in a general election or a referendum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1808.0/1">I, too, am intrigued by the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. If he is saying that all the other countries in Europe are moving along a federalist path and he wants to stop moving in that direction, does that not imply not just voting no to the treaty but withdrawal from the EU?</p>

	<p pid="a.1808.1/1">I shall deal with that point later. I believe that the European Union as currently constituted is unacceptable. That is not a new view of mine; I expressed it many times from the Dispatch Box when I was shadow Foreign Secretary. At the last election, I stood on a manifesto that called for renegotiation to create a more flexible Europe, and I still believe that that is what we should do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1808.1/2">Refusing the British people a referendum will not diminish their doubts about the Europe that is being imposed on them, it will strengthen them and, paradoxically, it will increase Euroscepticism in the UK.</p>

There would be an end to democracy. Secondly, in Holland and France a majority of people rejected the constitutional treaty. How alone is that?</p>

	<p pid="a.1809.4/2">What would be the consequences of not holding a referendum? The question what would happen if there were a referendum and the vote was no has been asked a lot. The answer to that is that the provisions of the treaty would not apply across Europe as a whole. The status quo would be maintained. I would regard that as unacceptable, but a no vote would not change the situation; it would leave the European Union where it is at present. However, if we do not have a referendum and the treaty is implemented, creating a Europe that is unacceptable, the only option for changing that situation would be renegotiation. The failure to hold a referendum now would strengthen the moral right of the British to ask for renegotiation to create and secure a more acceptable Europe. We do not have to do that aggressively&mdash;I have always been someone who believes that reform rather than confrontation is the right way in Europe&mdash;but the treaty will create a running sore, not just in the UK but in other parts of Europe, which can be dealt with only by renegotiation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1809.6/1">The hon. Gentleman is arguing that even if we in Britain feel that the Europe we are in is wrong, or getting worse, unless other people in Europe are with us we have no choice but to continue down the road to a European state. I do not accept that argument and I do not think the British people will either. If we cannot find partners and secure renegotiation, we have to look seriously at asking to renegotiate our status within the European Union because the European Union will have left us with no option. If Europe still rejects that, we may have to ask ourselves seriously what we are doing in a Europe that is grinding inexorably towards something that we know our country would not live with. I hope that we never reach that point, but the inexorable advance of an ever-closer Union&mdash;without the British people's consent, as given in a referendum&mdash;has driven me and many others to recognise the possibility. The Government should make no mistake: it is their arrogant refusal to give the British people their promised referendum on the treaty that opens up that scenario.</p>

	<p pid="a.1810.0/1">Many of the questions associated with the treaty are immensely complicated, but at their core is the simple issue of whether we keep the promise that we made at the general election to hold a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1810.0/2">I remember the timing of the decision to have a referendum well, because I regarded it as a great success at the time. It is worth while reminding the House that the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, announced a referendum in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-20">20 April</phrase>, before a decision had been reached on what the constitutional treaty was to be. It is not the case that once the constitutional treaty had been produced and examined, the Prime Minister said, &quot;This is so important that we need to have a referendum.&quot; The referendum was announced before the constitutional treaty had been produced in its final form. As was suggested earlier, that clearly indicates that the decision was taken in order to clear the air. The decision to have a referendum did not depend on the detail of the wording, but on the general principles that were being advanced.</p>

	<p pid="a.1811.1/1">Let me take a step back to what I was saying. Tony Blair, the then &quot;dear leader&quot;, made the announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-20">20 April</phrase>. Why did we make the announcement then? The answer is simple and straightforward: because we wanted to park the issue out of the way in the run-up to the general election. We wanted to have the referendum after the general election, so that the forces of darkness on the other side of the Chamber would not have that weapon to beat us with during the general election. I welcomed that; I saw it as a great advantage to us, as it prevented us from giving the forces of darkness a weapon that they would have used against us. I was also strongly in favour of a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1811.1/2">Let us be absolutely clear that it was not the case that the Prime Minister agreed to have a referendum on the basis of detailed knowledge of the exact wording of the constitution. It was an evasive tactic, which I am glad to say was successful, and we went on to win the general election. From that arose the commitment in our manifesto. I am glad to say that I have my copy of that little red book with me today. Unlike some hon. Friends on the Labour Benches, I was never a Maoist or a Trotskyist, so it is the only little red book that I have. People can usually spot the former Maoists and Trotskyists, because they become the most extreme exponents of new Labour.</p>

Friend will refer to the clear commitment given in May 2005, before the general election, about the new constitutional treaty. At that stage, we knew exactly what the new constitutional treaty was. He is right to say that in April 2004 that was not so, but by the time of the manifesto, we knew precisely what the new constitutional treaty was, and that is what we referred to in the 2005 manifesto.</p>

	<p pid="a.1811.3/1">I am grateful to Comrade Zhou for raising that point, but it is important to accept the context in which the exact wording was written. Let us remember why we did what we did. The Prime Minister made a statement indicating that there would be a referendum on whatever appeared in the document, in order to park the issue before the general election. When the document appeared, of course the party said, &quot;This is the document on which we will have a referendum.&quot; The Prime Minister could hardly say &quot;We'll have a referendum&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-20">20 April</phrase>, and then say, once he saw the document, &quot;No, we will not have a referendum.&quot; Of course the one followed on from the other. He would have said that there would be a referendum, and the manifesto would have reflected that we were going to have a referendum on the document, whatever was in the document. It is not fair or true to say that a referendum would have been ruled out, had the current document been produced at the time.</p>

	<p pid="a.1812.1/1">I cannot remember whether I have been in favour of a referendum on every European treaty, but I was certainly in favour of one on the Maastricht treaty. On that occasion, I was in a minority in my party, as I am now, but the difference then was that the Government, not having made a commitment to a referendum, were not obliged and honour-bound to have one, unlike us; we are so obliged. I voted for a referendum on Maastricht, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to bring that up, but the situation then was different, because that Government did not make a commitment to having a referendum. We did.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.1/2">I have heard many arguments against referendums, and many people regret the commitment that we made at that time, but regretting the commitment is not the same thing as saying that we did not make it. I understand the point about repenting at leisure, and I believe many people are doing so, but let us remember why we entered into the commitment in the first place. It was for base electoral reasons, and I am glad we did so. None the less, we must honour the commitment that we made.</p>

	<p pid="a.1812.3/1">I confess that although I had a substantial personal vote, it did not single-handedly elect me to the House. There is a commitment in a manifesto from a Government on how they will take matters forward. Clearly, as the document is always a compromise between competing interests, some will be less than totally enthusiastic about elements of it. I forget which ones I was less than totally enthusiastic about. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The referendum may well have been one of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.3/2">I return to the question whether the treaty is the same document as the constitution. Much of the discussion about that is a little like the question of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. I take the view that we gave a commitment to hold a referendum only on that constitutional form. As I indicated, I believe that we made a clear commitment to have a referendum on what was produced at the end of the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.3/3">We should ask ourselves whether promises matter. In my constituency I suffer, as I am sure many other hon. Members do, from a pervasive cynicism about politicians in general&mdash;not about me, because most constituents think their own MP is okay; it is the other lot that they do not like. There is an assumption that politicians and parties cannot be trusted and that we will say anything to get elected. That is not constructive or helpful, particularly to those of us on the left, because we depend on popular support to put forward a programme that seizes some of the instruments of power and changes society in the way that we want. It is necessary for us to command popular support in a way that is not quite so necessary for others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.3/4">Abandoning our proposal for a referendum because of nuanced differences and because somebody is prepared to argue that this does not mean exactly the same as that, gives out entirely the wrong message and confirms the view that we collectively, as a political class, cannot be trusted. Let us be truthful. One of the real reasons why we are not having a referendum in Britain and why the elites of Europe are not having referendums in their own countries is that they do not have confidence in the people producing the right result.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.3/5">If there was, for a moment, a feeling among those on the Government Benches that if they went for a referendum, they would win it, they would be off to a referendum like a shot. Let us not forget, for example, that Portugal wanted to hold a referendum on the treaty to demonstrate how committed it was to the European ideal, but Portugal was persuaded out of that view by the French and the British, in particular, leaning on them, saying, &quot;If you do that, it would set a precedent that would cause us enormous difficulties because we can't carry our people with us in a referendum. Therefore you should not allow your people to have a vote on the question.&quot; That changes somewhat the implication that the treaty is so trivial that nobody in their right mind in Europe would want a referendum. The situation has been rigged to some extent by the pressure put on smaller countries not to have referendums that would be inconvenient to their colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.3/6">Let me deal with what happened when the constitution was discussed and debated in France and Holland. I am happy to say that I played my part in those defeats. I was across in France speaking at French Socialist party rallies and meetings on the constitution. I spoke partly in French, but I was applauded entirely in English in order that I could understand what was being said. It was an international gathering where speaker after speaker from other countries stood up and said to the French, &quot;Do not believe that you who are against the constitution in France are alone in Europe.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.3/7">Throughout Europe, in every country where doubts were expressed&mdash;this tended to happen more in the smaller countries, such as Holland, Denmark and Ireland&mdash;the people expressing those doubts were told, &quot;You're the only ones who object to the constitution. If you go against it, you will be isolated. You might very well be expelled. It will be the end of civilisation as we know it. The money will cease to come from the European Union.&quot; All of that was untrue. Members will remember what happened when France and Holland rejected the proposals. They did not get expelled, and nor would we. There was not an enormous crisis in the European Union which brought the payments, the fraud and so on to an end. It carried on pretty much as before, with a period of discussion, then a period of reflection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.3/8">A period of reflection would be expected to allow the elites to think about where they had gone wrong, whether they ought to choose a different path and what that path should be. Indeed, some of that happened. They thought about where they had gone wrong, but they identified that as a problem of presentation. They came back with exactly the same thing in a slightly different form, but the valuable lesson that they had learned was not to make the mistake of asking their peoples what they thought of it this time round. That is where we are. Whenever there has been the opportunity to do so, the elites of Europe have managed to avoid giving the peoples of Europe any opportunity to discuss whether they should accept the treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.3/9">Let me turn to the Liberals, more in sorrow, if I may say so, than anything else. How does it happen that such a once proud party is reduced to this? One thinks back to the great principles that they stood for on occasion, and how they contributed to debates, even though sometimes they were a pain in the neck and other parts of the anatomy. Nevertheless, they are now in a position whereby, on the great issue of the day, they walk out or abstain. I can understand how they were bullied into it by the threat of Shirley Williams and others leaving them if they were prepared to countenance a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812.3/10">Let us be clear: some Liberal lords are prepared to fight to the last drop of Liberal blood to maintain their position. Greater love hath no MP than this, that he lay down his seat for their lordships. The Liberals in the House of Commons are prepared to lose parliamentary seats simply to keep Shirley Williams happy. I have not come across a single Liberal who believes that the policy is popular or that much of it is understood by the electorate.</p>

It is clear that they want an in-out question. My new clause is the only way to achieve that; it is the only option on offer that gives any possibility of that question being asked&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]</i> Let me complete the point. I am strongly in favour of a yes-no question being asked. I am prepared to concede that, if there is sufficient public pressure, we should have an in-out question as well.

I have left open the possibility of introducing an in-out question if the Liberal Democrats managed to persuade the Government of that&mdash;as I and others managed to persuade our dear leader on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-20">20 April 2004</phrase> to accept a referendum on Europe. The policy had been entirely against a referendum, and huge numbers of my colleagues were against it&mdash;until the policy changed, when huge numbers of them were in favour. Indeed, I could not find any who had ever been against it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1819.9/1">There has only ever been one United Kingdom-wide referendum in this country. I had the pleasure of campaigning hard in that election and of finding myself on the winning side. I very much hope that we never have a second referendum, and I am rather appalled that I should be taking part in a debate so many years later in which people are pressing to have another UK-wide referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1819.9/2">The precedent was a bad one. In my opinion, Harold Wilson called that referendum for totally cynical reasons, as is widely acknowledged on all sides. He was concerned about party management, almost regardless of which way the result would go. In the event, the pro-European side won quite easily&mdash;by a two-to-one majority, I recall&mdash;and the people who had demanded the referendum immediately reneged on their undertaking to abide by the result.</p>
	<p pid="a.1819.9/3">A referendum was demanded in those days by the people who were the most numerous Eurosceptics&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1991" name="Ian Davidson">the ancestors of the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson)</phrase>. Benn and the left regarded the European Union as a capitalist plot, and the moment they took control of the Labour party in the early 1980s, they started campaigning for immediate withdrawal from the European Union, with no more referendums. The whole thing was a sad and cynical exercise, which fortunately did not do too much lasting damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1819.9/4">Over the years, the only advocates of referendums as an addition to our constitution whom I can think of&mdash;the landmark people&mdash;have been Tony Benn and Jimmy Goldsmith. Both of them represented Eurosceptic opinion, but until recently they were, comparatively speaking, voices in the wilderness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1819.9/5">We do not have to go back too long to find a time when people in this House who really believed in the value of referendums were hard to find. Indeed, it was quite easy for them to be swept away. I served under three Prime Ministers: Ted Heath, Margaret Thatcher and John Major. I am glad to say that under each of them, we overruled demands for referendums&mdash;almost always on Europe&mdash;with the support of the mainstream of the Labour party. It was the accepted wisdom of parliamentarians that we were against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1819.9/6">I am astonished to find the atmosphere so completely changed now. In fact, it worries me that members of the political ruling class of this country have now lost their self-confidence and their ability to rely on their legitimacy as parliamentarians to such an extent that no one among them dares defy the media, the hard-line Eurosceptics or any other people who demand a referendum, because they find themselves faced with a parliamentary majority that they seek to overturn.</p>

	<p pid="a.1820.3/1">I do not want to get into the history of referendums with my hon. Friend. The history of our debates goes back long and far, and remains perfectly amicable, but neither of us is going to persuade the other. I should like to make some progress. I have made my general point, and there are few original arguments to be made on ei<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">ther side of it. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> and I have made most of them in our time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1820.3/2">Unusually, I find the official position of all three political parties quite bewildering. I do not envy their Front-Bench spokesmen. They have had considerable difficulty in putting forward their near-incomprehensible positions. The Conservatives are quite unable to explain how the treaty differs from Maastricht and the Single European Act, upon which we consistently refused a referendum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1821.1/1">Let me deal with the other two parties as well. The Labour party is quite unable to explain sensibly why the treaty is so different from the constitution that it should now be released from the obligation that it entered into&mdash;for pre-electoral reasons, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West rightly said&mdash;to hold a referendum. I believe that those reasons were mixed up with Mr. Murdoch as much as with the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1821.1/2">On the Liberals' position, with great respect, I am sorry that I upset <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">their spokesman, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>, with whom I have usually agreed throughout these debates on the treaty. The fact is that he has drawn the short straw. He had to get up and explain why, having promised a referendum on the constitution, he thought that the treaty was so different that he was not going to vote on it at all. The position of all three parties is almost impossible to explain.</p>

	<p pid="a.1821.2/1">I am listening with great interest to my right hon. and learned Friend's compelling analysis.

	<p pid="a.1821.3/1">I have supported it; I believe that it has been in the British national interest. We have pooled our sovereignty with the European Union and I think that that has been overwhelmingly to our benefit. The treaty will develop the institutions of the European Union, which will make it easier to make decisions. We shall then be able to make better progress in areas that are particularly important to the United Kingdom, and get away from the tedious obsession with institutional reform, referendums&mdash;and all the rest of it&mdash;that has poisoned our politics for so long.</p>

	<p pid="a.1821.4/1">I accept that my right hon. and learned Friend has shown great principle in his stand on these matters, but does he accept that as Members of Parliament we are trustees for the time being of the powers inherent in the British people? We hold those powers in trust. In the exceptional case in which we collectively decide that we wish to hand those powers that we hold in trust to another body outside our control, should we not seek the express consent of the British people? That express consent has not been given. What the British people have seen over the last 30 years is a transfer of power from this Parliament elsewhere. They have never been given a proper opportunity to have their say, yet at the general election they were promised a referendum, precisely on this transfer of power.</p>

	<p pid="a.1822.0/1">I disagree with my hon. Friend; he and I have never really seen entirely eye to eye on this issue. I do not believe that this treaty represents a massive further transfer of powers, and I can only refer my hon. Friend to earlier debates in which I have taken part and got involved in those arguments. I was actively involved at the British end of the Single European Act. I discussed the British position with the then Prime Minister as we tried to move towards the single market. That was a massive transfer of power&mdash;the biggest since the original European Communities Act 1972, when we openly talked about pooling our sovereignty, and stood at the election to defend that decision. The Single European Act was the context in which we went in for qualified majority voting on a grand scale, because it was in British interests to do so. That is where the passerelle provisions came in; they are a sensible way of dealing with routine matters without having to go through the whole rigmarole of having an intergovernmental conference and all the rest of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1822.0/2">There have been no new arguments in this debate. All the way through the debates on this treaty, I have been reminded either of Maastricht or of the Single European Act, the only difference being that even bigger issues were involved in the previous treaties than in this one&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]</i> I said that I would not go on about the merits much further&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1822.2/1">If my right hon. Friend will forgive me, other hon. Members are waiting to contribute. I cannot give way all the time, and I am not going to give way even to my hon. Friends who agree with me, some of whom may also be trying to catch your eye, Sir Alan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1822.2/2">Finally, let me deal with a question that really must be addressed: if we find that a referendum is carried, what happens then? That is relevant; the question cannot be avoided. It will change the course of history only if we get a no vote. That illustrates my objection to referendums. The trouble with introducing a referendum into a constitution, as Mussolini well understood, is that it renders Parliament powerless. In this case, it would also render the Government powerless.</p>
	<p pid="a.1822.2/3">I happen to believe that good democratic Governments often have to take tough and unpopular decisions. They do not do that if they live by newspaper headlines and focus groups; indeed, that gets them into the mess that the present Government have got themselves into. Governments have to take unpopular decisions that the focus groups do not like&mdash;that is what Margaret Thatcher did&mdash;and then offer themselves for re-election to see if they can survive democratically when, some years later, people see the consequences of what has been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1822.2/4">Let us say that on this occasion we finish the parliamentary process, in which the majorities have been about two to one in favour of the treaty of Lisbon, and we then hold a referendum. Given that everyone I have so far met who is demanding a referendum actually intends to vote no, what do we do then? <i> [Interruption.] </i>Someone says that we should carry on with the present treaty. The hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West addressed this question, but effectively tried to sweep it away. The fact is that everyone across western Europe is absolutely fed up with the tedious process of carrying through reform of institutions, which it was previously thought would be pretty routine and agreed by most people, after the enlargement of the Union. If 26 other countries succeed in ratifying the treaty&mdash;that means the Irish succeeding with their referendum&mdash;and then the British come along and say, &quot;Sadly, although we, the Government, agree with ratification, and Parliament agrees with it by two to one, we've just got a no vote at the demand of <i> The Sun </i>newspaper. What do we do now?&quot; It cannot be assumed that everyone else will renegotiate.</p>

The idea that the other 26 Governments, all of which will have gone through the process of getting the treaty ratified&mdash;which will have been politically costly for some of them&mdash;will then turn around and say to the Brits, &quot;Well, of course we shall now have to negotiate a European Union on a completely different basis,&quot; is, like many of the other arguments I have heard during these debates, absolute fantasy. It would not happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.1823.1/1">I will in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1823.1/2">I think the hard-core opponents of the treaty know that perfectly well. I have heard a lot of people say, &quot;I am not against the European Union, I am against the treaty,&quot; and there are a handful of them whom I believe, but I do not believe many of them. At the very least, the people who want the referendum believing that they will win a no vote&mdash;and none of them would demand a referendum if they thought they would lose it&mdash;know that it would cause a deep, deep crisis in our relationships with the rest of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.1823.1/3">Among the European politicians whom I know are many friends of Britain, who would despair on finding that yet another neurotic spasm was taking place in the British political system, and that we were asking for everything to be reopened. There are provisions in the new treaty allowing members who want to leave to do so. We could start a negotiation on the basis of an association agreement. It takes a long time to secure such agreements, but Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein have managed to achieve them, and we could do the same if that is where we wish to be. But if there were a no vote, our role in the European Union would be finished and the House would be left with the consequences. The majority of us would not agree with the position we were in. It would be quite a decisive moment for our foreign affairs policy and our role in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1823.1/4">I am not impressed with our position in foreign affairs. Both main parties supported the invasion of Iraq, the biggest foreign policy disaster in recent years, and we have a totally discredited American President and Administration. The President now has more support in the House of Commons than he has in Congress, and we do not know where we shall be with whoever wins the next American election.</p>
	<p pid="a.1823.1/5">The European Union is finally getting its act together in improving its decision-making capacity so that it can move on to deal with economic reform, energy security, climate change, international development and our relations with the Russian Federation. All those are areas in which we need a common position. I would include foreign and security policy in other areas as well, but let us start with Russia. The EU is trying to achieve what we ought to regard as a triumph: an enlarged Union of 27 nation states, including states of the former Soviet Union, ready to move forward. And what do the Eurosceptics say? &quot;We will carry on as we are, left with George W. Bush, and try to detach ourselves from the European Union as it embarks on these great issues&quot;? They do not even know themselves what they would negotiate if they found themselves in an isolated position.</p>
	<p pid="a.1823.1/6">I shall not go any further into the merits of the bigger issues, but they would all be affected by a no vote in a referendum, which would repudiate Government and the parliamentary majority. There are big, big issues facing the United Kingdom in foreign affairs, and I think that we have been handling them badly for most of the past 10 years. They should be resolved in this House of Commons by a Government who are accountable to parliamentary representatives. To resort to the populism of allowing the media to believe that they can determine such matters in referendums would take us into even worse waters than I believe we are in at the moment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1824.0/1">I agree with a great deal of what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> said. For instance, I strongly agree with his attitude to referendums. The only referendum of which I have thoroughly approved is the one that was held when I lived in Leeds, on whether cinemas should open on Sundays. That was a very sensible referendum, but I cannot think of many other sensible referendums.</p>
	<p pid="a.1824.0/2">Referendums are exotic European notions, held in countries such as Switzerland. Although I in no way make any comparison to Members of this House who favour a referendum in today's debate, it must be said that Hitler was a great one for referendums. When he held a referendum in March 1936, his campaign poster urged:</p>
	<p pid="a.1824.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Every vote for the F&uuml;hrer!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1824.0/4">That is the kind of populism that lies behind referendums, and I do not like them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1824.0/5">I was a member of the Labour Government who held a referendum on Europe in 1975. In my view, it was daft to hold it&mdash;but Anthony Wedgwood Benn urged it on the Prime Minister, and nothing more needs to be said about any notion urged on anybody by Anthony Wedgwood Benn. The result was not the one that Benn wanted, however&mdash;there was a yes vote with a majority of two to one&mdash;and he has campaigned against it ever since. I think that he might be out somewhere now with Brian Haw campaigning for a vote in favour of a referendum. The fact is that people accept referendum results only when they agree with them. Members of the Government had a free vote in the 1975 referendum, and I voted no, although I have since become a good deal wiser about the importance to this country of membership of the European Community and the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.1825.3/3" class="indent">&quot;It strengthens the voice of national parliaments and governments in EU affairs. It is a good treaty for Britain and for the new Europe.

He said that if the Liberal Democrats could get away with it, they would campaign in one part of the country for one thing and for another thing in another part of the country. That is not so. If they could get away with it, they would campaign in one street for one thing and in the next street for another thing. A Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament in Manchester was elected to this House on the false pretext that the Christie cancer hospital would close.

	<p pid="a.1826.1/1">I have just explained, laboriously, that we have no commitment to holding a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. There was no such thing as a Lisbon treaty in the 2005 election&mdash;it was not envisaged that there would be such a treaty when we were fighting that election. We were committed to&mdash;I was committed to&mdash;the constitutional treaty to which our Labour Government were committed. Although I will support the Lisbon treaty because I am so loyal to this Government that it actually hurts me, that is not the same as the constitutional treaty on which we had the manifesto pledge. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West talks about the explicit promise in the 2005 Labour party manifesto. There was an explicit promise, but it was to campaign wholeheartedly in favour of accepting, supporting and endorsing the constitutional treaty that was then extant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1826.1/2">It is interesting to reflect on the Conservatives' attitude to referendums up to now. In the 1990s, they signed up to the Maastricht treaty, which was fundamental&mdash;far more so than this treaty or the constitutional treaty that we committed ourselves to supporting in 2005. It turned the European Community into the European Union. It was much more far-reaching than the Lisbon treaty. Did the 1992 Conservative manifesto promise a referendum on the Maastricht treaty? You must be kidding!</p>

	<p pid="a.1829.1/1">I enjoy following <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>. We have agreed on some things; we do not always agree on everything. First, let me state my position, as he did not read my name out from his list. I voted for the referendum on Maastricht. I voted against a lot during that period, but for a referendum, and here I am, still on the Back Benches, which shows what follows all that rebellion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1829.1/2">I wanted to keep my remarks short, as I know that others wish to speak, but those who believe me when I say that will be mad, because I am a politician and will therefore go on a little bit. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1991" name="Ian Davidson">The hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson)</phrase> was right. At the Dispatch Box as Leader of the Opposition&mdash;wonderful days&mdash;I questioned the then Prime Minister about the issue with no effect, and I asked him for a referendum eight times. Eight times in a row he told me categorically that no such thing was necessary because what was about to happen was not consequential and&mdash;what was the phrase used by the Foreign Secretary?&mdash;not fundamental. Nothing was so important that it changed our relationship, and so there was no need for a referendum. It was not until after I had gone, sadly, that he gave the pleasure to my successor of agreeing to a referendum. I thought that was a bit mean at the time, because things might have been different&mdash;who knows? Never mind; I do not want to go back there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1829.1/3">That is the main point. The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right: we can only reach one simple conclusion. I know that there is a huge debate running and rolling, which is full of history and memory. I love these European debates, because we have a sort of private conversation with each other about what we did 10 years ago, what our antecedents did 100 years ago and what we might be doing in 10 years' time. However, he was right to say that the truth was that the then Prime Minister, with some trusted and confidential friends, made a decision. As they rolled towards an election, they decided that they would not survive it unless they answered the question about the referendum, which the Conservative party claimed was the way to settle the issues about the constitutional treaty. That was very simple.</p>
	<p pid="a.1829.1/4">We are all politicians&mdash;although that might have escaped the notice of one or two colleagues&mdash;and we have to win elections. That is the simple sine qua non of being on the Government or Opposition Benches. Occasionally&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;Governments make cynical decisions. The decision on the referendum was a cynical decision made by the Government to get them past the election, and they decided to deal with the rest as it followed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1830.1/1">Come on! I must tell the hon. Gentleman, who intervenes quite a lot, that the politics of the situation dictate what happens at the time. In the time running up to Nice, his Government were not in trouble or difficulty and were able to envisage the coming election with some sanguine sense of success. Things were different by the time they hit 2004 and 2005. The reality was that the decision was taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1830.1/2">The intriguing thing, which really bothers me, is that as I watched and listened to the Foreign Secretary, it occurred to me that I had never seen somebody speak for a Government who has looked so contorted and so twisted, and who has so turned in one argument against another. At one moment, his point was only that it was fundamental, but then it was not fundamental; then we were clearing the air, but then we were not because we were clearing fundamentals instead. The argument went round and round. If he reads it in <i> Hansard </i>tomorrow, he will say to himself, &quot;What an awful day I had. I had to say something that I know is fundamentally not true. There is no major difference between the Lisbon treaty and the constitutional treaty. What happened in between was a political imperative.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1830.1/3">It is worth remembering that Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing said something with which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> has agreed, although the latter supports the Government's position on securing the ratification of the treaty. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1830.1/4" class="indent">&quot;In the Treaty of Lisbon, the tools are largely the same. Only the order in which they are arranged in the tool-box has been changed. Why this subtle change? Above all, it is to head off any threat of referenda by avoiding any form of constitutional vocabulary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1830.1/5">I do not know why we dance around as though this were a silly game. The truth is that the Heads of State and Governments of all the countries that negotiated the constitutional treaty have said to each other, &quot;We have got ourselves in a real mess over this. We allowed the public and politicians who are not responsible members of the Government to play a part&quot;&mdash;politicians such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1411" name="Gisela Stuart">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase>, who speaks so cogently on these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1830.1/6">The member states believe that allowing the vox populi to get involved by having referendums in France and Holland put a kibosh on the whole thing, so they concluded that they would not do that again. They learned the lesson of all this nonsense about consulting the public, which is that EU Governments do not get what they want by doing that. They believe that they have a purpose that was laid down by their forefathers, and that they must see it through.</p>
	<p pid="a.1830.1/7">Europe's bureaucrats have known for years that the way to get things done is never to ask the public if they want them to be done, because the answer will inevitably be no.</p>

	<p pid="a.1831.1/1">It is, but that should not surprise my hon. Friend, because he has been a student of the matter for long enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/2">I draw the House's attention back to the intriguing one-sided correspondence with the Government after the collapse of the constitutional treaty and prior to their decisions and the intergovernmental conference. It is reported in the European Scrutiny Committee's third report of session 2007-08 that the Foreign Secretary's predecessor stated that there was</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/3" class="indent">&quot;no negotiation in the run-up to the June Council until we saw the text for the first time only a couple of days before the June Council itself&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/4">Everybody believed that that was when the new treaty was produced, but it was not. We know as a result of a leaked letter that Angela Merkel's Government contacted the other Governments as part of the process of rebuilding the treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/5">The Germans are wonderfully efficient. They are so efficient that they always keep their records and put everything in them. They are not trying to hide anything from their public, as our Government are. We can congratulate them on that. With ruthless efficiency, they rounded up what members of Governments had said to them in discussions and negotiations. They asked such things as how they could find ways to get the treaty through without having to show that the existing treaties would essentially have to be repealed. One question asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/6" class="indent">&quot;How do you assess the proposal made by some Member States not to repeal the existing treaties but to return to the classical method of treaty changes while preserving the single legal personality&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/7">Another asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/8" class="indent">&quot;How do you assess the proposal made by some Member States using a different terminology without changing the legal substance&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/9">Those are not just questions that the German Government or Angela Merkel wanted to ask. Essentially, they arose from minutes of meetings with either officials or Ministers of other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/10">The letter is fascinating because it blows the Government's position out of the water. The Government and Angela Merkel knew all along what the process was all about. Having learned the lesson of what had happened to the constitutional treaty, they wanted its provisions back. They felt that they could not proceed without them. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe is honest about that; he believes that Europe needs them to proceed to the next stage, as did Angela Merkel and many other European leaders. The letter shows that they needed to find a way to avoid any reference to the public, such as a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/11">The first point about which we should be clear is that the process is a classic, cynical political mechanism. If we believe that, we shall not go far wrong. I do not want to engage in the arguments about whether there were three or 38 things in the treaty&mdash;or, as the Liberal Democrats said on television today, that there are so many thousand words versus another so many thousand. It is all meaningless nonsense. The truth is that everybody believes the treaty is basically the same as the constitution. The collapse of the pillars and the nature of the debate are critical, so there is clearly some cynicism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1831.1/12">There is another reason for a referendum. People talk about the principle that the House should decide, but the truth is that the principle has become a bit of a joke. What do we really think we decide on in this place that the Government have not already told us we must decide? When did the House last manage to insert an amendment at any stage of a European treaty that reflected the will of the public or the House? It has not happened. We know about the wonderful whipping system on both sides of the House&mdash;I do not blame the Labour Government for that; I had to defy it myself in my day.

	<p pid="a.1832.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that in a referendum, which is itself authorised by&mdash;if I may say it&mdash;the humility of Members of Parliament who realise that they must hand the decision back to the people because it is so important, the people would be presented with a neutral question that cannot be whipped, so we would have genuine public opinion?</p>

Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase> and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, as they know. They have constantly and rightly made the argument about the principles of the House and we have debated them many times, yet they may offer a basis for a referendum. Both have complained&mdash;rightly&mdash;about the way in which the Bill has been railroaded through the House. Debate has been curtailed in the appalling nature of the Second Reading debate instead of the line-by-line discussion we were promised. As I said the other night, who would ever have thought that when the Prime Minister said line by line he actually meant only the top two lines of the treaty with no discussion of the rest. There has been next to no debate, so the argument that should stand&mdash;that the House is supreme so it should make the decisions&mdash;falls in this case, because we have had no opportunity to make any mark on the treaty or to debate it properly. That process shames the Government, but it leaves us with one question. If we are unable to make the debate work, if we cannot question the Government properly and have no real opportunities to discuss the amendments, the only option open to us is to go to the country, because our process is not working.</p>

	<p pid="a.1833.0/1">I respect my right hon. Friend's views on the matter, but if we took that line we should have to put almost everything that comes to the House to the people. The Government have destroyed the ability of the House to negotiate and discuss all issues. That is the fault of the Government and I can but hope that our Front-Bench colleagues will commit our party to pushing back all that so-called modernisation. However, he is not right to say that the situation is in any way unique&mdash;this treaty makes little difference to Britain's position in the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.1833.1/1">My right hon. Friend and I are as at one on much of what he said, but the difference between the treaty and all the other business in the House over the past 10 years is that once the treaty is passed, it is gone. That will be it. We shall not have another chance. At least we have a chance to revisit domestic legislation and change it, but we get only one shot at European treaties until the next time around. As custodians of sovereignty, we need to refer back to the public if we are letting some of it go. It is as simple as that.</p>

The point is that a mechanism was used to curtail debate in the time allocated. That mechanism provided for Second Reading debates, and not line-by-line scrutiny. The quality of the process has been appalling, because we have allowed ourselves to be sucked into holding generalised discussions, debates and arguments.

	<p pid="a.1833.4/1">My right hon. Friend is making a principled case for a referendum, but there is another principled case to be made in its favour: for good or ill, our membership of the European Union&mdash;the European Economic Community, as it then was&mdash;was eventually sanctioned by a referendum that was held when the EEC was a much more limited enterprise. The reason why ever more people, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase>, are changing their minds and agreeing that there should be another referendum is that there has been no popular consent for the arrangements that have developed over the years, as represented in the new treaty.</p>

	<p pid="a.1834.0/1">I agree. In the referendum that my hon. Friend mentions, I voted to go into the EEC. I do not resile from that; I was right to vote for what I did. I voted to go into a marketplace, and to share certain functions to create that marketplace, but we have gone a lot further than that. The problem is that there is dishonesty in saying, &quot;You all knew about this when you first joined. You all knew, for example, about the supremacy of European law.&quot; That is nonsense. People who say that know very well that they did not think about that issue when they voted on whether to join. That is the real reason why it is time to have a referendum on the treaty: it will allow us to tease out the fact that if we keep going down the road that we are taking, without making any change, things will go wrong.</p>

	<p pid="a.1834.1/1">Earlier, the right hon. Gentleman seemed to be saying that he would like the opportunity to amend the treaty. It has never been the practice of the House to amend treaties, particularly multilateral treaties. One has to accept or reject them, and there is no possibility of amendment. He says that the matter is final, but that is to disregard an important provision that I thought that he, and many of his more Eurosceptic colleagues, would welcome. For the first time in any European treaty, article 49A introduces the possibility of secession. It is possible for the House to avail itself of that provision, and to secede from the European Union, at any time. In that sense, the move is clearly not final.</p>

	<p pid="a.1834.2/1">I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman made that intervention, because there has never been a problem with seceding. We can talk about the details, but the reality is that nation states have always had the right to secede whenever they want, just by getting rid of the Act that brought them into the EU. I am not sure what he is saying; is he saying that the EU could have held on to us? If he is, and the EU is now giving us permission to secede, the situation is beginning to sound a little bit like the situation that faced the federal United States, and the battle between the confederacy and&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1834.6/1">I want to make progress, because I am conscious that other Members want to speak. Before I conclude, I want to say something about the Liberal Democrats. [Hon. Members: &quot;Why?&quot;] It is good to have a bit of light amusement at some point in a speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.1834.6/2">The Liberal Democrats have got themselves in a terrible mess. As has been pointed out time and again, they only agreed to hold a referendum because they thought that it would never happen. The moment that they thought that it would happen, they no longer wanted it. They can go on telling the public that one document is different from another, but as Lincoln said, you can fool some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time. That is what the Liberal Democrats set out to do and they have been found out. How can they have a principled position of sitting on a fence? Those who do that get splinters in their arse and then they get into trouble. The Liberal Democrats are in trouble right now and the best thing for them to do is to get off the fence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1834.6/3">In conclusion, I am in favour of a referendum because the arguments cannot be properly made unless the public are brought in. The Government gave a pledge to hold a referendum. I do not care what they called it; it is the same treaty. They may have behaved cynically, but they should be held to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1834.6/4">I do not know what it is about Europe that seems to change the mentality of Governments. As soon as parties get into government, they dare not do anything that might upset the European Union. Immediately, their arguments go to the extreme. The Government panic and say, &quot;We cannot hold a referendum because that would lead to the process of getting out. That would be a nightmare. We would be cast into the outer darkness. We would be on the periphery of Europe. Nobody will speak to us. We will be cast out, all because we want to vote on the treaty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1834.6/5">Who told the French and the Dutch that? Who said that they would be cast out when they voted against the constitution? Surprise, surprise, they were not cast out. Everybody said, &quot;Oh my God, we have to accommodate the French and the Dutch. Let's start all over again and have another look at it.&quot; As a sovereign nation state, we have every right to make that statement in exactly the same way as the Dutch and the French.</p>
	<p pid="a.1834.6/6">I ask the House to have a little self-confidence. All of us came here to state that we do not believe a word the Government say until they show it in the text, in writing and in detail. We do not believe or trust them until we see how the treaty will work. Too many Labour Back Benchers are too ready to trust their Government when the Government say, &quot;Please trust us.&quot; Tonight they should support the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West when he proposes his amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1835.0/1">I am firmly opposed to a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. The matter should be decided by Parliament. I have come to that conclusion not simply because all the previous EU treaties have rightly been dealt with in that way, but because of the different impact that a rejection by Parliament would have, compared with a rejection by referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1835.0/2">In the case of Parliament refusing to ratify the treaty, that would be after a comprehensive debate and the Government would be left in no doubt which measures in the treaty were unacceptable. In the case of a no vote in a referendum, the reasons for rejection would be unclear and would be subject to a wide range of interpretation. Nobody would have any idea which parts the public agreed with and which parts they did not agree with.</p>
	<p pid="a.1835.0/3">Such a situation would undoubtedly undermine the United Kingdom's standing within the EU and would mean that, for the foreseeable future, the much needed structural changes to the EU could not be implemented, leaving the organisation to lumber on in its present unsatisfactory way.</p>

	<p pid="a.1836.1/1">What can I say? I spoke in the House in about 2004 and was not in favour of a referendum on the then constitution. There have been sufficient changes since then to make it a different document to be put before Parliament. If Parliament decided to abandon its responsibility this evening to determine the matter, it would be performing a great a disservice to the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1836.1/2">I am well aware of the widespread public concern in my constituency and elsewhere about the reform treaty. I am equally aware of the substantial demand for a referendum on it. I accept that people in my constituency say that they would like a referendum on the treaty. Although I understand the justifiable concerns that people have about the contents of the treaty, I firmly believe that many of those concerns are a result of wild speculation and misinformation from a multitude of sources, some of them in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1836.1/3">I firmly believe that, if a referendum were to be held, a no vote would be the outcome, not because of any perceived or real flaws in the treaty, but because many people are currently deeply dissatisfied with many aspects of the European Union and its bureaucratic institutions and procedures. I share most of that dissatisfaction and I understand the desire to express it in a ballot.</p>

	<p pid="a.1837.3/1">I do not believe that they cannot do it; I simply think that they would not bother because they would not find it relevant to their lives. I do not believe that they would have time&mdash;many people live busy lives&mdash;and that is why they elect representatives to make some decisions on complex documents that are placed before us. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the referendum in France. He cannot have it both ways. Either the referendum made a difference and led to a new treaty, which was not the constitution, or the treaty is the constitution, so the people getting a vote made no difference. What is it to be?</p>

	<p pid="a.1838.2/1">The treaty before us is the end product of a long process of renegotiation and failed reform set in train by the Laeken declaration of 2001. We have ended up with a treaty that, instead of reforming Europe, has consolidated more powers at the top. Why does she think that her constituents and mine should be denied an opinion on whether they agree with that reform process and the treaty that has come out of it?</p>

	<p pid="a.1838.3/1">I do not accept that the treaty is all bad and does not reform; there are some very good things in it. I believe that the number of EU Commissioners should be reduced, and I am pleased that that is happening. I am also interested that the treaty provides a mechanism for member states that wish to change their relationship with the European Union or withdraw from it; it means that they will be able to do so in a negotiated fashion. That has not existed before, and I would have thought that any Eurosceptic would welcome it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1838.3/2">I shall try to move on. The European Union now represents 27 countries with a combined population of more than 490 million people. Its institutions and working practices are hopelessly out of date and failure to reform them will continue to constrain their ability to function anywhere near as effectively as they should. I am sure that few people, in the House or outside it, would disagree that widespread reform is essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1838.3/3">I should like to make it clear that I do not in any way perceive the Lisbon treaty as some panacea for reforming the European Union, but it will help it work slightly more effectively. It is difficult to see how an organisation that seeks to manage much of the economic, social and political affairs of 27 diverse nations&mdash;each of them answerable to their domestic voters with all their problems, aspirations and political agendas&mdash;could aspire to do anything else. However, I believe that a number of measures in the treaty will help. The Lisbon treaty offers significant improvements over the current arrangements, and that is why I am supporting it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1838.3/4">Finally, I want to comment on what I believe is a fundamental flaw in our relationship with and continuing membership of the EU. It is now 34 years since we joined the European Union and 32 years since we reaffirmed our membership in a referendum. In fact, nobody under the age of 50&mdash;I count myself in that group&mdash;has had the opportunity to vote on our membership of the organisation, which affects so many aspects of our lives, even more so in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1838.3/5">The passage of time, allied to the enormous economic and political change that has taken place in the EU, has undoubtedly created a democratic deficit that needs to be urgently addressed&mdash;I accept that. Throughout the period in question, no mainstream political party advocated withdrawal from the EU, and I suspect that that will still be the case at the next general election. That state of affairs has left the British people with no realistic option other than to accept that membership of the EU, whatever its faults, is synonymous with UK citizenship. I do not believe for a minute that those who voted to join the EU in 1975 believed that they were making an irreversible commitment. It is high time that the question of our continuing membership of the EU was put before the British people, not as a simple yes-no question, but as a choice between clear alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1838.3/6">I believe that many of the perceived benefits of belonging to the EU are not dependent on our continuing membership of it, such as co-operation with EU partners on measures to deal with terrorism, people trafficking, drug and gun smuggling and other forms of international crime. Is that co-operation really dependent on our continuing membership? I do not think so. It is more likely that withdrawal from the EU would curb the ability of those who engage in such despicable practices to enter our country in the first place. Nor do I believe that the impact on trade, jobs or investment will necessarily be negative. There is plenty of evidence that if the UK's economy was relieved&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1839.3/1">I looked very carefully at that amendment, but I am afraid that I will not support it because it mentions support for the Lisbon treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1839.3/2">Moving back, as you have guided me to do, Sir Alan, the Lisbon treaty contains mechanisms for member states to reclaim competences from the EU and to opt out of participating in a number of policy areas. It also provides machinery for member states to negotiate voluntary withdrawal from the EU or the establishment of a new relationship with it. That is what we should be looking at. We need to set up a royal commission to look at all the issues&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;A review?&quot;] It would not be a review; it would be a commission, which would look at all the options available concerning Europe. It might recommend options that would change our relationship, if necessary. We should not rush into anything, and we should carry out that process in an organised fashion. That is what the people of this country really want. They want a serious public debate on Europe, and at the end of that debate, they will want some options. I would also say that at the very end of the process, they should have a referendum on the options produced by that commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1839.3/3">I can put forward such a view and still vote against a referendum on the treaty, and I suggest that the Liberal Democrats should do the same. If they are against a referendum on the treaty, they should vote against it. That would not prevent them from putting forward other suggestions, as I have done today.</p>

	<p pid="a.1840.0/1">Towards <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1721" name="Geraldine Smith">the end of her speech, the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith)</phrase> was in danger not only of being out of order, but of putting across her preferred European dimension. The trouble is that there are 60 million people in Britain, and in practice, one cannot proceed to determine our relationship with the European Union in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1840.0/2">I have been following the most recent process closely. Indeed, I read the draft constitution before the French people rejected it. Personally, I thought that the contents were valuable, and I am glad to say that many of the most valuable parts are in the treaty of Lisbon, which is why I am happy to support that, too. Nevertheless, the constitution was an attempt to create a watershed moment in the European Union, which made it completely different in character from all the amending treaties that had gone before&mdash;from the founding treaty, the treaty of Rome, through all the others that have been mentioned, right up to the treaty of Lisbon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1840.0/3">That is why, as somebody who is not an enthusiast for referendums and who believes that many of the reservations that have been expressed today are valid, I nevertheless felt that a constitution that swept up more than 50 years of European Union history, from the founding treaty to the most recent amending treaty, was an appropriate moment to redefine the relationship and give people the chance, which they have not had for more than 30 years, to determine whether the new, reformed, relaunched European Union&mdash;that was the intention&mdash;was where we wanted to go. That is why I was happy to support my party's commitment at the last election to hold a referendum on a constitutional treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1840.0/4">However, at the very moment that we were committing ourselves to that, the French and the Dutch were deciding that no such constitutional treaty was likely to exist. I do not wish to repeat the arguments, which have already been rehearsed today, about the processes by which we moved from there to where we are now. What is a matter of concern, however, is that the process that we are using is far less transparent and consultative than it could and should be. One of the things that I particularly welcome about the treaty of Lisbon is that it gives national Parliaments a more clearly articulated role in that process. In the future&mdash;I hope that this will be in the long term, before we get to the next reforming treaty&mdash;the process may well involve the 27 national Parliaments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1840.0/5">At the end of the day, however, we must accept that treaties can be negotiated only by Governments. Governments can consult a lot better, but treaties cannot be negotiated by 27 Parliaments, and they certainly cannot be negotiated by 490 million people. There comes a point when, even with the best endeavours that have been made, people have to decide whether something is good enough for them to continue. The disingenuousness and dishonesty of many of the arguments come from ignoring the consequences of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1840.0/6">It has been said&mdash;but it must be said again and again&mdash;that Conservative Members are asking for a referendum on the treaty of Lisbon, which is not a constitutional treaty, because they want to defeat it and because <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">they know that, as the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> clearly articulated, the consequence of that would be to paralyse the Union and destroy Britain's competitive and effective relationship with it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1841.1/1">I do not think it possible to say that 80 per cent. of voters in the north-east of Scotland want any such thing. All tests of opinion, nearly all of which have been less than objective, have indicated that people want a treaty; but the majority of people would like a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, not on the Lisbon treaty, about which most of them have not been informed. As someone who reads and pursues the media of the north-east of Scotland every day, I have to say that people's ability to be informed on the contents of the treaty of Lisbon is not very apparent.</p>

The referendum is a principle that we like; what we do not like is the question. I do not wish to test the patience of the Chair, but the House will have noticed that our party has unfortunately been considerably frustrated in our attempts to get the words that we want put before the House and debated in ways that would make our position abundantly clear. We have to live with that frustration, but it has put us in the position of having to deal with what is before the House rather than with what we wish was before the House.

	<p pid="a.1842.1/1">No. Perhaps I should not be surprised by the way in which the hon. Lady's relationship with, and attitude to, Europe has changed because of her experience of the negotiating process. I would have thought, however, that she would understand that if the United Kingdom decided now, in the present circumstances, to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty, and if we failed to ratify the treaty as a result, we would be faced with an internal dilemma, in that two thirds of Parliament would have voted one way, while the people would have voted the other way. That would be a domestic problem, as the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe has articulated.

	<p pid="a.1843.9/1">Let me make this point. One thing that the Estonian people will tell us is that they spent 700 years trying to escape from outside oppression&mdash;most recently, escaping from the Soviet Union. They are certainly not interested in buying into some kind of European superstate, which the Conservative party is so afraid of. What they want is a functioning, effective, working Europe in which decisions can be taken by 27 countries, and in which a small country such as Estonia can have its proper place and influence. The Prime Minister of Estonia told me that he sincerely hoped the UK was not going to be instrumental in delaying or obstructing implementation of the treaty of Lisbon. For my part, I said that I would do everything I could to ensure that that did not happen, and that the treaty would be ratified, because I shared his view that ratification was in the best interests of Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.1844.0/1">It is interesting to note that the hon. Gentleman is willing to listen to the people of Estonia, but not to the people of Britain. Leaving that aside, however, will he clarify his earlier comment that if the House were to grant a referendum and the British people were to vote against ratification of the Lisbon treaty, it would in some way compromise our membership of the European Union? That did not happen when the French and Dutch refused to ratify the constitutional convention: they are still members of the EU and no one called that into question, so why does the hon. Gentleman think that it would be any different for Britain?</p>

Those of us who talk to mainstream political groups in pretty well every country in Europe could tell the hon. Gentleman quite categorically that the process by which the constitution was abandoned was painful enough. The follow-up process whereby 27 countries sought to reach agreement by delivering the Lisbon treaty and its many constructive and practical measures&mdash;the British Government, along with the German Government, played a constructive role&mdash;was also hugely difficult. If the hon. Gentleman believes that it would be willingly acceded to if the UK Government stood up and said, &quot;Sorry, guys, I know that 26 of you are already going to adopt this treaty, carry it forward and start working with it, but we are not, as we want another couple of years to rethink the whole thing,&quot; I have to tell him that he is living in cloud cuckoo land. The truth is that we do not know what the consequences of a no vote in a referendum would be, but it would certainly not be in the interests of the United Kingdom, of our reputation or of our influence within the European Union.</p>

Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> explain that an amendment that would allow the Government to write any question, or no question, as they liked, does not tell the House what is wanted clearly enough. That makes it a non-workable and non-functioning amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1844.3/2">To be honest, I take a very simple view. First, we as a party are unreservedly and unapologetically pro the European Union, pro Britain's membership of the European Union and pro a functioning Union of 27 states that can take decisions in an intelligent format. At the same time, we believe that the British people deserve the right to have a real debate about what kind of Union it is&mdash;because we cannot create it in our own image&mdash;and whether they want to continue with the enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1844.3/3">That is a risky venture, but one that we as a party would be willing, indeed enthusiastic, to take to the people. If we had been given a vote on it and the House had supported us, that is the referendum that people would have had&mdash;and I believe that it would have been won&mdash;rather than a referendum in which there is an attempt to persuade people that it is possible to vote for continued membership of the Union without ratifying the treaty of Lisbon. That is a dream world: it is not reality, it does not make political sense, and it will not be supported by our party.</p>

	<p pid="a.1845.6/1">I am not going to take any interventions, because I know that many Members wish to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/2">Let me make a simple point. In April 2004 the then Prime Minister and leader of my party, Tony Blair, announced that the EU constitution would be put to a referendum. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/3" class="indent">&quot;Let the people have the final say by way of a referendum... if we are to make the case... we will have to make it to the British people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/4">The Prime Minister was emphatic:</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/5" class="indent">&quot;There is no question of any constitutional treaty going through without the express consent of the British people... we will have a referendum.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/6">He went further, and said something that has not been mentioned so far today:</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/7" class="indent">&quot;What you cannot do is... get a rejection of the treaty and bring it back with a few amendments and say, 'Have another go.' You cannot do that. If the people vote no, they vote no&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/8">The problem is that we have ended up with a situation in which the treaty has been brought back.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/9">The most honest Member in the House today&mdash;I am not saying that everyone else has not been honest, Mrs. Heal, because I know that we are all honest <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">here&mdash;was the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. He said clearly and specifically as a pro-European that in his view there is no difference between the constitution and the treaty. He happens to be my constituent when he is in London, so I do not want to disagree with him when he says something like that. For me, he has summed the whole thing up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/10">The right hon. and learned Gentleman may be in a different party from me, but he has been so pro-European and so committed in principle to his opposition to a referendum&mdash;he has not shifted back and forth depending on whether his party leadership changed its view&mdash;that I am with him on that point. No matter what is said here today, no matter how many fine words are uttered and no matter how great the detail, the vast majority of the public know that what we are voting for in the treaty is exactly the same, and has the same intent, as the constitution on which the Prime Minister promised a referendum&mdash;a promise that was included in our manifesto.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/11">For me, this is about honesty in politics. It is about saying what you mean and then doing what you mean. We all have a responsibility to what we said in that manifesto, and we all have a responsibility to recognise the consequences if we do not support a referendum tonight. I hope that some of my colleagues have been influenced by the many good speeches today in favour of a referendum, but the matter is not over yet, because if we do not secure a vote tonight, it will go to the House of Lords. Do we really want to run the risk of the unelected House of Lords sending back measures that we have refused to agree to because we, as elected politicians, do not want to go along with our manifesto commitments? That would be ridiculous, and it would show what a farce the whole situation has become.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845.6/12">We have an opportunity tonight to put a little faith and trust back in politics and politicians. The public are so cynical about us as individuals, although not necessarily in all constituencies, and the overall political system. The big gap that now exists between Parliament and the people out in the country will be made even bigger if we all troop into the Lobby and vote against a referendum&mdash;I hope that will not happen. I will certainly stick to my manifesto commitment and to my personal commitment&mdash;I specifically said in my election address that I supported a referendum. I hope that many of my colleagues will join me tonight.</p>

	<p pid="a.1846.0/1">It is never comfortable to vote with another party in this House, especially when Labour has made such a pig's ear of the arguments that it seeks to defend, but I shall do so. At least I can say that none of us will have the distasteful task of having to go through the Lobby with the Liberal Democrats, so I shall be limited to a single disagreeable experience rather than a double one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1846.0/2">In Prime Minister's questions a few hours ago, the Prime Minister challenged the Conservatives to put a positive case for Europe. Given his behaviour, it struck me that he had either a short memory or an entirely unexpected sense of humour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1846.0/3">I explained the action that I shall take to my Whips when this series of debates started, and no pressure has been put on me to change my mind. There has been entirely honourable and civilised respect for the views that I have held for a long time, and if newspaper reports and Tea Room gossip are right, that contrasts with the amateur theatricals and hysterics that have been reported from the office of the Labour Chief Whip.</p>
	<p pid="a.1846.0/4">I must make a confession: I stood for election on a manifesto that promised a referendum on this treaty, but we all do things like that. When we stand for election on a party manifesto, we are basically saying that we support that party to form the next Government. It does not mean&mdash;it has never been understood to mean this&mdash;that we subscribe to every iota of that manifesto. Indeed, I am slightly surprised that a number of my party colleagues appear to have given their own manifesto such minute examination, as I usually give other parties' manifestos more examination than my own party's.</p>
	<p pid="a.1846.0/5">In making t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">his point, I appeal to my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>. If he regarded the manifesto as some sort of Biblical truth, he would find it difficult to be here in this House, as would I, and I suspect that an examination of the websites of some of my Conservative colleagues would reveal a declared intention to leave the European Union, which I doubt will appear in the next Conservative manifesto, but as far as I am concerned that should not disqualify them from standing as Conservatives or sustaining the next Conservative Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1847.0/1">Was my right hon. Friend a member of the Government in, say, the 1992 period? On being held to manifesto pledges, the truth is that hardly anyone in the country reads manifestos.

	<p pid="a.1847.1/1">I reassure my hon. Friend that I always set out my own election address. The party tends to offer a format, which I have never adopted because I wish to express my personal views to my constituents. One thing that nobody in my constituency can complain about is that they are not aware of my views on or commitment to engagement in Europe. Of course, a great many people have made representations to me, and I hope that each of them believes that they received a substantive response to their points. I respect their arguments, as much as I ask them to respect my long-standing arguments. If I wished to be epigrammatic about it, I would say that I am a representative, not a delegate. If I wished to be a delegate, I would stand for the Congress of the Chinese Communist party in what is wittily called the Great Hall of the People.</p>
	<p pid="a.1847.1/2">The argument whether this constitution is the same as the old one, or whether this treaty is the same as the old one, is totally barren. As it happens, I voted for the old constitution, so for me this matters rather less than it might do to most. One can quote Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing till the cows come home, but the fact is that if one approved the old constitution, one will say that it is pretty well the same thing; if one did not, one will claim that it is something different. That is the simplest ABC of political technology, which we find in every single democratic country. For my money, of course it is the same document; for most countries, it is the same document.</p>
	<p pid="a.1847.1/3">The argument in this Chamber has been to what extent the red lines and opt-outs have changed the nature of the obligations and commitment that Britain accepted. The United Kingdom's relationship to the treaty is different from the one we had to the old constitution, but I accept that there is bound to be a huge amount of argument about the extent to which that is bankable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1847.1/4">I have a fundamental objection to referendums. Of course I accept that there are occasions when a once-in-a-lifetime issue arises that we ought to refer to the country at large, but if one looks at the history of referendums, one finds that they are usually used to override democratic scrutiny and debate. That is the 19th-century history of referendums. They often seek a simplistic response to an often simplistic question, in which the consequences of the answer are never explored, and they usually take the form of a surrogate verdict on the Government themselves. The question and the answer are sometimes widely removed from each other.</p>

	<p pid="a.1848.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that the problem with referendums is that they often transfer the decision not from the representatives of the people to the people, but from the representatives of the people to the unelected press?</p>

	<p pid="a.1848.1/1">It is certainly true that a strong body of the press articulates vitriolic hostility to the European Union and to this treaty, and such comment is not always as informed as it might be. The comfort that I find is that I wonder how many people buy the red tops for the political comment, rather than for the coverage of media personalities, the world of sport and footballers' wives. That is quite legitimate, and occasionally all of us enjoy a surreptitious glance to relieve some of the rigours&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I invite colleagues in Portcullis House to look in the corner room where the newspapers are stacked and observe how rapidly they disappear through the course of the day. It is not always the coffee machine that people are in pursuit of.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/2">We constantly wring our hands about the decline of Parliament and its impotence in the face of the Executive. The real issue is the balance of power not between us and the European Union or between Parliament and the people outside, but between the Executive, whom we send into government, and elected representatives in Parliament itself. My party is devoting a huge amount of energy to looking at how we might redress the balance in the way in which our democratic processes work in the Westminster village. That is a far more urgent task than dealing with some of the fears that we are expressing at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/3">In the last debate in which I spoke, I said that the Eurosceptic motto might be:</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Present fears</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/5" class="indent">Are less than horrible imaginings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/6">I apologise for attributing that to Milton; if I were better read, I would have realised that it comes from Macbeth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/7">If we have a referendum on this treaty, how should I argue to my constituents about other things on which we might hold a referendum? What about detention without trial? That fundamental issue of civil liberties has far greater implications for our liberties than anything contained in this treaty. I am an old-fashioned liberal&mdash;I am sorry about that&mdash;who, in a sense, echoes Roy Jenkins's view that there were many merits to the permissive society. If we move from representative government to government by plebiscite, how much of the architecture of the liberal and tolerant society would be demolished?</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/8">I do not disagree with the thesis that there will be once-in-a-lifetime occasions when referendums are necessary. Our joining the European Union and the subsequent endorsement of that was a key point. I accept that if we were to join the single currency, it would be a sufficiently dramatic change as to require the endorsement of the people and the legitimacy that that would confer. I note that one of the biggest changes that has affected this House is devolution. Indeed, we constantly complain about the way in which the balance of power in this Chamber has been shifted by devolution, the creation of a Parliament in Scotland and an Assembly in Wales and the process in Northern Ireland. Some 85 per cent. of the British people were not consulted on the transfer of power that that brought about.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/9">This treaty is not a great breaking point or a hinge of our contemporary history; it is, broadly speaking, tidying up. It contains a lot of common sense, and five years down the road people will wonder whether all the terrible things that were supposed to flow from it actually happened&mdash;I suspect that they will not have happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/10">If we say no to the treaty, the European Union will not collapse and Britain will not be expelled. Europe is jolly good at muddling through. As soon as one negotiation is completed, Europe is condemned to begin the next negotiation. The one thing that cannot be done sensibly is to walk away from the negotiations, because the process is ongoing and grinding. The extent to which it works and what comes out of it at the end is amazing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/11">We should not assume that we are in the same position as three or four years ago at the point of the French and the Dutch referendums, because things have moved on and a renegotiation has taken place. It would be seriously dislocating for the UK to find itself demanding that process again, and it would also be seriously dislocating for my party. I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> will be the next Prime Minister, and when we look at this directionless and purposeless Government, that becomes increasingly plausible and desirable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/12">It would not be in my right hon. Friend's interests to inherit an intractable time and energy-sapping dispute with the European Union and to have it hanging over his head, so it is in my party's interests that this business is dispatched and that we move on to new business. If we do not move on, he would have to deal with nagging voices on the Conservative Benches and in the party seeking to question the whole issue of Britain's membership of the European Union. He would need three hands to deal with not only the issue of Britain's relationship with Europe in the short term and the treaty, but a bigger issue that would begin to emerge and that would threaten the success of his first term as Prime Minister. I want him to have his hands free to deal with the hugely important and urgent things that a Conservative Government would need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/13">Equally, I think that the European Union needs no more treaty making within the foreseeable future, because other agendas such as climate change, migration and asylum, which will flow largely from climate change, terrorism, competition and the protection of the role of developing countries in a global economy. Nothing assures us that the European Union will deal with such agendas, but the treaty gives it a better chance of doing so, if the political will exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.1848.1/14">We should start by dispatching the Lisbon treaty in this House, where the decision making belongs, for ratification across the European Union. We would then be able to move on to the agendas pressing on us&mdash;how the UK governs itself and how Europe can better represent the interests of all the citizens of Europe, which it increasingly encompasses.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-03-05a.1850.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1652" speakername="Mike Gapes" colnum="1850"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/debtext/80305-0020.htm#08030581002392">
	<p pid="a.1850.0/1">I shall try to be brief. I put a message to all Europhobes on my website, saying that I intended to vote for the Lisbon treaty. I did so because I wanted to provoke a reaction from my constituents. Many words have been spoken about the great interest in the subject outside the House, but I have had only one e-mail and one letter from my constituents&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am waiting for more to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.1850.0/2">The e-mail said that the treaty was &quot;introducing communism by stealth&quot; into this country, and the letter said that because of my views, I deserved a long, lingering and painful death. That indicates the level of interest of some people. However, I have had letters from non-constituents, both before I put the message on my website and subsequently. They spoke of the German plot to take over Europe, the Pope and many other examples of the fantasies that some obsessives have about the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.1850.0/3">Someone spoke of the need for honesty in politics, and I agree. We need to be honest about this treaty and about the basis of the debate that we are having. I will be honest: I have always opposed referendums. I was extremely disappointed and shocked in 2004 when our party leader bounced the party into that position. I cast no aspersions on the reasons for that move. I simply believe that it was a mistake then and has had some very serious and unfortunate consequences for the political debate. It has meant that there has been no open public debate on these European issues. For two years after the rejection of the constitutional treaty in France and the Netherlands, we did not really have a proper debate and discussion during the period of reflection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1850.0/4">I had hoped that this debate, over the 11 interminable days, would have raised the quality of the public debate, and that our newspapers and television media would have given it detailed consideration, but sadly they are interested only in process, personalities and splits. Indeed, some of the earlier debate in Committee today reflected that. The media are not interested in the detail of why the Lisbon treaty is in Britain's interests and how it will reform the European Union to ensure a more efficient and effective way of working after enlargement to 27 countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1850.0/5">I do not wish to repeat the arguments, and I also referred to the issues in the debate on the foreign policy aspects of the treaty and on Second Reading. However, it is not helpful to have a statement from the shadow Foreign Secretary that the Foreign Affairs Committee said that the Lisbon treaty was exactly the same as the constitutional treaty. That is not what it said, and I tried to intervene again, but the right hon. Gentleman would not take the intervention. I wish to place on the record that the Committee did not say that. It pointed out that the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs had been replaced with a high representative for foreign and security policy. It also pointed out that that there were two UK-inspired but non-legally binding declarations on common foreign and security policy in the text, neither of which were in the constitution. It is therefore not true to say that the treaty is exactly the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.1850.0/6">The people who are against the Lisbon treaty are trying to argue that there is no change or significant difference. As other Committees have commented, however, there are differences in some aspects of the treaty, such as the justice and home affairs issues referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase>. As has been mentioned, there are the UK Government's red lines, which mean that the treaty is different for the UK than it is for the other 26 member states&mdash;or the other 25, because Poland has some association with the UK on some issues. That is how the debate should have been conducted.</p>

	<p pid="a.1851.4/1">I want to conclude. The debate in our media has not helped to clarify the issues or people's understanding of them. The debate in some parts of the House has not helped to get that clarity either. I understand the frustrations of the Liberal Democrats, which were referred to by the Chairman of the Select Committee on International Development, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>. They feel that their position has not been put forward. However, if they think it through, they will see that their model of some cathartic &quot;big bang&quot; referendum will not solve the problem. The obsessive anti-Europeans will never accept the result. They will come back again and again, and keep demanding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1851.4/2">The situation will be like the referendum in Palau. I do not know whether hon. Members are aware of that case. There was an issue about whether the US could station some military facilities there, and those involved voted seven times until they got the right result. The Eurosceptics will never accept the outcome, and so they will keep coming back. That undermines democracy and parliamentary sovereignty, and I do not believe that it is in the interests of the House or the British people to move to a referendum culture. We need to strengthen the power of the Select Committees and this House to scrutinise the Executive&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> We need a more democratic second chamber or to abolish the one that we have completely. We need greater media understanding. Where are the media? They do not report these debates and so the public are not made aware of them. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> For that reason, I shall vote against a referendum and support the Lisbon treaty. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.1852.1/1">Conservatives believe in &quot;trust the people&quot;. The bottom line for the purposes of the debate is that we as a Parliament will decide whether a referendum will be granted, and I disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> when he says that we should not have referendums.</p>
	<p pid="a.1852.1/2">There are 27 million voters. That is what we should be concentrating on. Since 1975, 27 million voters have not had the opportunity to express their view on the extension and accumulation of all the European legislation and treaties. It does not necessarily follow that we cannot come to some accommodation in the process of renegotiation as to what it is that we would end up with if we produced a no vote, but it is absolutely right that the voters of this country&mdash;for whom we hold our positions on trust&mdash;must be allowed to have their say.</p>
	<p pid="a.1852.1/3">The Foreign Secretary rightly remarked mostly on the content of the treaty, but I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase> that promises have been broken. It is a complete fraud for people to suggest that that is not the case. My right hon. and learned Friend, for whom I have the greatest respect, was rightly able to make <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1820" name="David Curry">his case, as was my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry)</phrase>. I say that without prejudice to the reality at the heart of the process, which is that a vast amount of power is draining away from the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1852.1/4">We are elected by the voters, who have the right to have the final say. Why do I say that? It is simple. As the Foreign Secretary rightly said, the debate is about the content of the treaty, but it is also about what he called the constitutional balance of power. The structure of the relationship between the UK and the EU is being altered by the treaty, and that is the issue on which I shall concentrate and on which the debate should turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1852.1/5">The whole process was started off in a unique constitutional manner, with a mandate put forward by the German Government. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">My right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> mentioned their questionnaire. The mandate was agreed by the member states in a unique and unconstitutional manner.</p>

	<p pid="a.1853.3/1">No, I want to get through my contribution as rapidly as possible, which is only fair to other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.1853.3/2">The second fundamental constitutional change is the obligation on national Parliaments, which we have discussed in previous debates. Other changes are the merger of the existing treaties into a Union with a legal personality, and the collapse of the pillars. The intergovernmental method is being done away with on certain matters in favour of the Community method, thereby vastly increasing the powers of the European Court of Justice. That is another fundamental change in the constitutional relationship between the UK and the EU. We are giving enormous additional power to the ECJ. The accumulation of the new constitutional powers and the reciting of the primacy of law in declaration 17 mean that, for the first time, we have reinforced case law within the framework of a treaty. That is another constitutional change of the first order.</p>
	<p pid="a.1853.3/3">The division of competences lies at the heart of how the EU and the UK operate. A House of Lords Select Committee made a similar point about them. Competences are the powers that are provided, and if we give powers to the EU, we are taking them away from the UK. I am not talking about specific powers, which are bad enough in themselves&mdash;for instance, the charter of fundamental rights was another constitutional change of the first order. I am saying, in essence, that changing the division of competences moves powers between the UK and the EU. I am clear about that, as are all other constitutional authorities. Even the Foreign Secretary admitted that there would be constitutional changes, some of which I do not like. They are predicated on the assumption that the EU will rather arrogantly say that it will be good enough to give us new powers in relation to the national Parliaments. Well, thank you very much, but we are a national Parliament that has been going for quite a long time. We have a history and a constitutional system that has stood the test of time and saved Europe from itself in two world wars&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>Oh yes. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" name="Chris Bryant">The hon.

	<p pid="a.1854.1/1">I am dealing with the constitutional implications of what the Foreign Secretary said. It is clear that in a range of matters in the construction of the treaty there is constitutional change of the first order between us and the EU. That is why a referendum is required. The Foreign Secretary used those criteria for a referendum in his argument. He said that if there were a structural change there ought to be a referendum, and, with respect Mrs. Heal, I am indicating that structural change is exactly what is happening in the treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1854.1/2">Part of the issue relates to why we should want a referendum. It is because the House should have the humility to decide that we want to give the decision back to the voters. Furthermore, as I said in an intervention on a Liberal Democrat Member yesterday, there would be no point in staying in if we did not have the right to legislate in line with the wishes of the voters of the UK as expressed in general elections. That is the basis of our legislative process. We give effect to the wishes of voters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1854.1/3">The plain fact is that unless we reassert the supremacy of our Parliament, as set out in my new clause 9, on which I expect us to be able to vote later, we would not be able to maintain our position in the EU. We must have a provision stating that notwithstanding the European Communities Act 1972, we will continue to legislate on behalf of the voters of the UK and that the courts must give effect to the provision in any later Act even if it is inconsistent with the provisions of European legislation. That is not withdrawal. Case law is clear: such a measure would not repeal all the treaties; it is about particular provisions. My party agreed on amendments to the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, which was pushed through both Houses, and we should do so again today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1854.1/4">If the vote goes the wrong way, we need a post-ratification referendum, for the simple reason that the issues go to the very heart of the way our country is governed. We are elected to represent the interests of the people, and if we fall down we must give them the right to make their own decision in a referendum. That is why a referendum is required.</p>

There could be no two Members more diametrically opposed than him and me on nearly every issue, and certainly on Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1854.2/2">What has been interesting about today's debate is first and foremost the fact that the Tory party has exposed itself as having an enormous problem about the European Union&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>If the Tories can contain themselves, I shall move on to the Liberal Democrats in a moment. The Conservatives have form. Without a referendum they took through the Single European Act, which was probably the single biggest piece of legislation that dramatically affected the UK's relationship with the European Union, and they took through Maastricht without a referendum&mdash;in both cases on remarkably small majorities. So far, there have been 40 Divisions during our debates on the Bill and the average majority has been 170, almost a two-thirds majority in every case, so it is difficult to advance the argument for a referendum on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1854.2/3">Another problem for the Conservatives is that their party is radically split&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>They can moan and groan, but none the less they will have to face the truth. It is not just that a few Conservative Members will vote with us; the much bigger division, which is why they are campaigning for a referendum, is between those who want to leave the European Union entirely and those who are a little bit more sensible in their policy towards Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1854.2/4">The Conservatives' other problem is that they have no allies in Europe, so whenever they talk about renegotiating, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase> did, they know perfectly well that they are deceiving the people of Britain, as there is nobody with whom they could negotiate. They would have either to have the kind of hissy-fit that the Liberal Democrats had last week, or back down from their position.</p>
	<p pid="a.1854.2/5">It is for party management reasons, and from no point of principle, that the Conservative party has arrived at its position today, which is that there should be a referendum on any treaty whatever. That is what the shadow Foreign Secretary said; he said that any treaty that a Government brought forward should have to be put to a referendum. That is sheer nonsense, because the UK signs up to many treaties. None of them should be put to a referendum, because when any treaty has been negotiated, it is difficult to come to an informed position on it on the basis of a simple yes or no in a referendum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1855.1/1">I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman, because I am sure that there are many people in the House who would like me to stop as soon possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1855.1/2">The Conservative party's position is that if the Bill is passed and the treaty is ratified, they will not let the matter rest there, to use the phrase that was leaked over the Christmas period. Let us enter Planet Cameron for a moment and imagine what would happen if there were a Conservative Government. Let us imagine the Leader of the Opposition becoming Prime Minister and going to his first European Council, having chosen not to let the matter rest there. He would turn to the new President of Europe and say, &quot;Tony, as I'm your heir, could you possibly let us have a new treaty? Oh, and I apologise to you, Mr. Rodriguez Zapatero, Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel, for not co-operating with your political parties or your Governments over the past few years, but it would be nice if you signed up to a different form of treaty.&quot; That would not happen. Instead, he would do exactly what the Liberal Democrats did last week&mdash;walk out of the room. That just goes to show that the Conservative position is not that of a potential future Government. The Conservative party's foreign policy is the foreign policy of an Opposition party who know perfectly well that they will remain in opposition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1856.1/1">I shall follow your advice, Mrs. Heal. Let me turn to the Liberal Democrat position on referendums and on whether we should have one. It is time that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> came out. It is not that difficult in the end. It may mean being condemned by the <i> Daily Mail</i> and <i> The Sun</i>, but the truth is that it is fine to be a genuine pro-European. It is time that he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2002" name="Angus Robertson">the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase>, who is not in the Chamber, owned up to the fact that they are pro-Europeans. The Liberal Democrats cannot hide that fact from the electorate. They cannot pretend that they really want a referendum, but that the wording is not right. They should put their heads above the parapet and own up to being the most pro-European party in the House, and to the fact that they would have signed up to whatever Europe had thrown forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1856.1/2">The truth is that this is a proxy debate. It is not really about referendums. It is about whether people want to be securely and firmly in the European Union, because they believe that in an uncertain world it is important to have stronger international institutions, or whether they believe that Britain can go it alone. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Stone, who has moved but who, I am glad to say, is still in the Chamber. I believe that there will not be a fundamental change. We will still set our own taxes, and have our own Army and Navy, and our own foreign and defence policy. There will not be a substantial change, which is why there should not be a referendum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1856.2/1">It is normally a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase>, but whereas all other Members who have spoken have recognised that the debate raises issues of principle that transcend and divide party, he chose to make a purely partisan speech, and made little contribution as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.1856.2/2">Twenty-five years ago, I was elected to the House&mdash;as was the Prime Minister, as it happens. Unlike the Prime Minister, who was elected on a pledge to leave the European Community, I have always believed, and still believe, in remaining a member of the European Community. I have grave reservations about handing over further powers, and there are some powers that we have handed over which I would like to see returned to this country, but the reason that I have, for the first time, actively taken part in debates on a European treaty is nothing to do with Europe. It is to do with integrity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1856.2/3">Nothing in the 25 years that I have been in this place has made me so angry as to see members of two party Front Benches&mdash;or, should I say, the Front Benches of one and a half parties&mdash;who were elected on a clear pledge to the electorate that they would hold a referendum, telling their Back Benchers, as they themselves would be doing, to renege, to resile, to stand on their heads to renounce a clear promise that they had made to their electors. Nothing that I have ever seen in the House has made me so angry. That is why I resolved to participate in the debates and have done so every day since, in the limited number of days made available to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1856.2/4">I do not necessarily believe that there needed to be a referendum; perhaps there did not. Nor was it necessarily wise to promise a referendum; perhaps it was not. The constitution and the treaty may be desirable or may be undesirable. They may be more significant or less significant than previous treaties, but every party in the House made a promise that their electors would have a vote in a referendum on that constitutional treaty, and the treaty of Lisbon endorses and implements the substance of that constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1856.2/5">Today hon. Members face a test of their personal integrity. That is what is at stake. I have no issue with those who told their electors beforehand and made it clear that they did not believe in and would not support a referendum. They are as pure as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">the driven snow. My right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase>, who is present, is one of those and there are others on the Conservative Benches and in other parts of the House. However, if hon. Members repudiate a promise that they have made and from which they did not dissociate themselves at the time of the election, they bring contempt not merely upon themselves, but upon the House, the democratic process and the prospect of people voting in future elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.1857.0/1">The key point is whether there has been a change in what we are determining, compared with the previous position. Has the right hon.

	<p pid="a.1857.1/1">I will go straight to one of the arguments used by those who try to cover over the change of heart that they have had since before the election&mdash;that it should be a matter for Parliament that there has been a significant change. Parliament established a European Scrutiny Committee to investigate, decide and advise us on whether the Lisbon treaty was the same as the constitutional treaty. That Committee reported:</p>
	<p pid="a.1857.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Taken as a whole, the Reform Treaty produces a general framework which is substantially equivalent to the Constitutional Treaty. Even with the 'opt-in' provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and the Protocol on the Charter, we are not convinced that the same conclusion does not apply to the position of the UK under the Reform Treaty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1857.1/3">I think that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1857.1/4">Those on the Front Bench have made it clear what they are going to do. It was positively embarrassing watching the Foreign Secretary squirming like a worm on a hook, if that is not rather unfair to worms, which do not deliberately place themselves on the hook. I wish Ministers had been as straightforward as Huey Long, a notoriously cynical senator in the United States of America, who on election promptly broke a solemn pledge that he had made to his electorate. When his advisers came to him and said, &quot;What should we tell people who are asking why you changed your mind?&quot; he said, &quot;Tell 'em I lied.&quot; The trouble with the Minister, who is a charming and nice Member of Parliament, and the Liberal non-rebels is that they do not have Huey Long's integrity and they certainly lack his clarity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1858.3/1">I take your point, Mrs. Heal, and entirely withdraw my previous remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/2">The first argument that supporters of the change of heart deploy is that the Lisbon treaty is less important than previous treaties. The only question that faces those who made a promise about the constitution is how the treaty compares with it&mdash;not with Maastricht or any other reforming treaty, but with the one on which they promised their constituents a vote. The European Scrutiny Committee has said that the treaty is substantially the same as the constitution. We know that almost all the leaders in Europe who are free to do so have said that the documents are the same. No Minister has explained to us why the Spanish Prime Minister, the author of the constitution, Giscard d'Estaing, the Belgian Foreign Minister, the Italian Prime Minister and countless other leading lights should say things that are untrue. Why would they say that the two documents are fundamentally the same if they are fundamentally different? Ministers have not even the addressed the point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/3">The second argument is that no countries on the continent have held referendums on the Lisbon treaty. Of course they have not. Those that were required to hold referendums did so on the constitutional treaty. If they got a yes vote, they decided that they did not need another referendum on a document that is substantially the same. If they got a no vote, they decided not to get another biff in the face, and to pretend that the Lisbon treaty is different.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/4">The third argument is that all the Governments of Europe signed up to the statement that the constitutional concept had been abandoned. I have before me the words of the statement that was issued after the Council meeting. It does, indeed, state that the constitutional concept was abandoned, but it continued, in the same sentence and the next, that, instead of</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/5" class="indent">&quot;repealing all existing Treaties and replacing them by a single 'constitution'... the Reform Treaty will introduce into the existing Treaties, which remain in force, the innovations resulting from the 2004 IGC.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/6">That IGC endorsed and decided to implement the European constitution. The statement makes no bones about it. Therefore, every time the Foreign Secretary quotes the statement without the second part, he misleads&mdash;unintentionally&mdash;the House of Commons and the British people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/7">The fourth argument is obscure&mdash;indeed, it is designed to be obscure. As Samuel Johnson said, if you want to escape from a difficult hole, emulate the squid and squirt black ink in their faces while making your getaway. Supporters of the change of heart have adopted the argument that the constitutional treaty involved repealing all the existing treaties whereas the Lisbon treaty does not. They fail to say that the constitutional treaty abolished existing treaties but reintroduced all their powers in its text.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/8">There are always two possible ways in which to move from an existing treaty, or set of treaties, or existing law, or set of laws, to a new final text. The first is to amend, in detail, all the existing laws until they are brought into the relevant form and adjusted and amended until they equal a final text; the second is to repeal all the existing laws and treaties and replace them with a new text incorporating those laws and any changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/9">When we do that in this House&mdash;in respect, for example, of accumulated finance Bills&mdash;we normally call it a consolidation Bill. We consider it less, not more, important; we devote less time to it because it does not change any laws, but simply brings them all together. Essentially, what the European constitution did was to bring all the existing treaties together to make one document. If there is any doubt about the differences between those different routes, the Government have allayed them&mdash;they have published not only the Lisbon treaty, but the consolidated treaties that result from the Lisbon treaty. We know the final text that we have reached through the process of detailed amendment, and I have to report that it is almost identical to the consolidated text of the original European constitutional treaty. There is precious little difference, and the Government are adopting mere persiflage with their argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/10">The Government say that a referendum is incompatible with parliamentary government. With a great flourish, the Foreign Secretary ended by saying that we should do what electors pay us to do. Well, after the last election, they sent us to fulfil our promises. All of us, except those who had dissociated themselves from the manifesto promise, were sent here to implement the promise to have a referendum on this treaty. If we do not do so, we are not doing what the electors pay us to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/11">Those who believe in parliamentary government should be particularly wary, especially as that promise was made before the last election precisely to take out of the electoral arena the issue of whether the constitutional treaty should be ratified. People were told that that was done because they would have a separate vote on it in a referendum. If they are not to be granted that vote, Members were elected on false pretences&mdash;this House was elected having told people not to worry their little heads about Europe at the general election because they would face the decision later. It is an absolute abnegation of parliamentary democracy not to fulfil the pledge in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/12">Finally, people say that the treaty is only a modest step and is no bigger than previous treaties. However, each step brings us nearer to a final point. If someone is on their way to Beachy Head, the first few miles do not matter, but the last few steps near the edge matter a great deal. I shall cite Hegel and Marx, authorities who may have more force on the Government Benches. They said that beyond a certain point, quantitative changes result in a qualitative change. Beyond a certain point, accumulative slices of the cake through successive treaties bring about a substantive, qualitative change. Over a period, if we keep on allowing without any check such transfers of power from us to the European institutions, we will cease to be a nation delegating powers to ancillary bodies and ourselves become an ancillary body allowed only to exercise such powers as a nation called Europe allows us to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1858.3/13">I do not think that my electors or those of any hon. Member want that to happen. If they do, they ought to have the chance to affirm it in a referendum and see whether they carry the day.</p>

	<p pid="a.1860.0/1">I have enjoyed today's debate because of the new characters who have appeared in the cast of this great endeavour. Now that we are on the 11th day of our consideration, it is good that people want to get their names on the record. It would have been nice if they had read the treaty and heard the earlier debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1860.0/2">I disagreed with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> when he said that this was not a matter of detail. If people take the trouble to read the original European Scrutiny Committee report of October, they will see that it was matters of detail that flared up the treaty as a major item for public debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1860.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> said that he was loyal, ever loyal and, therefore, too loyal. That was probably the case for many who should have advised the former Prime Minister that he was making a major error when he felt that he had to call a referendum because of parliamentary considerations. I do not think that the question of a referendum was relevant to this treaty. Why did that happen? Was it a rush of blood to the head? I would say that it was probably a rush of fear in the focus groups, which seemed to have more influence on Government policies in the run-up to the election than the party's wishes on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1860.0/4">The Government benefit from being roughed up by Parliament, and from being roughed up by their own side. Being roughed up by the European Scrutiny Committee has made the Government and the Foreign Secretary go to Europe and fight our corner hard on a number of issues. They have brought back something different from the original treaty for a constitution. That is the reality; this treaty is significantly different. There would have been a European Foreign Secretary, a president of Europe and a constitution. It was a treaty for a constitution. Aided and abetted by the Dutch and French voters, who rejected it, there was a panic, and then a two-year period of reflection. Everyone is right: it was a question of getting the treaty under the wire so that it did not cause another series of referendums, at a cost to the progress that member states wanted after Laeken and after the Convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1860.0/5">We deal with many things every week involving EU powers that change the law-making relationship. Those EU powers are already in place in the Single European Act, Maastricht and Amsterdam. They are in processes we have had to opt into, such as the Schengen agreement, after the treaty of Amsterdam, to make a serious attempt to stop cross-border crime, terrorism, breaches of immigration and drug trafficking. That is why I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1721" name="Geraldine Smith">my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith)</phrase> was wrong&mdash;we cannot opt out and have a new relationship. We have to deal with such matters within the European Union.</p>

It sometimes chose to use half of a sentence, or even a quarter of a sentence. For example, it said that the Scrutiny Committee had said that the</p>

	<p pid="a.1861.1/4">That was not what was said in the report. What was actually said was completely different:</p>

	<p pid="a.1861.1/6">The campaign just took the last part of that sentence and presented it as a fact. The report went on to say that for countries that did not have opt-outs and derogations, the treaty was substantially the same, but that that was not the case for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1861.1/7">What the referendum campaign sent out said that there would be a cut in the UK's voting strength. Not true; it is a lie. The UK's voting strength in the Council is going up because of the treaty. The campaign referred to immunity for Europol officers. People should read the report that we put out last week, which showed that the Home Office has won an agreement that Europol officers will not be given immunity. That is a fact; we have won that fight. It goes on and on, it says&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1864.3/1">The Conservatives are judged by their words. The hon. Gentleman cannot identify a specific proposal in the Lisbon treaty that makes it more significant than the Maastricht treaty. He is a supporter and member of the Better Off Out campaign. He has the honesty of holding that view and commitment, and that is a growing trend among Back Benchers in the Conservative party, which continues to gallop ever closer towards Eurosceptic isolationism. The Conservatives also refuse to acknowledge the consequences of their isolationism, which has captured most&mdash;although, of course, not all&mdash;of today's Conservative party. No previous Conservative Government ever offered a referendum on a European amending treaty. No conservative Government anywhere in the European Union are even considering holding a referendum on this treaty. No conservative Opposition in any country of the European Union are demanding a referendum as our Conservative Opposition are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1864.3/2">We have heard today from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1652" name="Mike Gapes">my hon. Friends the Members for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes)</phrase> and for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty), the Chairs of the relevant Select Committees. The Foreign Affairs Committee voted against a referendum not once but twice, and the European Scrutiny Committee voted against a referendum not once, not twice, but on nine separate occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1864.3/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" name="Mark Francois">The hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois)</phrase> will have the opportunity in a moment to tell the House which other conservative parties or Governments in the European Union are opposing the treaty and demanding a referendum as his party is doing. It is clear that his once influential party&mdash;which was the party of Europe for 30 years, in a tradition set by Macmillan and Heath&mdash;has, in the main, been reduced to an isolationist, anti-European rabble. That is a policy set and dictated by the hon. Member for Stone. It represents a victory of ideology over national interest, and this Parliament should not give such a policy its consent this evening.</p>

	<p pid="a.1864.4/1">This has been a debate about broken promises. First, the Government promised a referendum. Then, in lieu of a referendum, they promised the House of Commons 20 days of detailed parliamentary debate. Then they broke that promise, and allocated only 14 days&mdash;less than half the number given to debate the treaty of Maastricht. Then they broke that promise. They told us that we would give the Bill line-by-line scrutiny, but they so manipulated the debate that the detailed scrutiny of the amendments was left until the end of the day, and large groups of amendments were not debated at all, including critical amendments on borders, visas, immigration, asylum, defence, social policy and the free movement of workers. None of those provisions was subjected to line-by-line scrutiny at all, yet such scrutiny was the Government's main excuse for not granting a referendum in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1864.4/2">I turn first to the Foreign Secretary's speech. At the risk of being ungallant to him, I must say that he did not have a very good day. First, he tried to argue that the Government had originally promised a referendum on the EU constitution because it represented fundamental changes to our relationship with the European Union. Then, when he was pressed further, the right hon. Gentleman said that it did not represent a fundamental change in our relationship with the EU. Taking interventions from all sides, he completely dropped the ball when he said that the reason why the Government promised a referendum in the first was that they needed to &quot;clear the air&quot;. Well, if we needed to clear the air then, why do we not clear the air now and give the people of this country the referendum that they were promised? If that is the only argument that the Foreign Secretary can put to the House, I look forward to the rapid promotion of the Minister for Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1864.4/3">Let me turn now to deal with those parliamentary statesmen, the Liberal Democrats, who are planning, I am told&mdash;with some honourable exceptions&mdash;to abstain constructively. They have no mandate for an in-out referendum in their 2005 manifesto, which promised a referendum on the EU constitution and gave no promise on an in-out referendum. They are arguing a case to paper over the cracks in their policies without any endorsement from the people who sent them to this House of Commons. That is the mess that they find <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">themselves in. My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase> made the point about the missing cojones&mdash;and I have to say that, at the end of this debate, they have still not been discovered. The Government lost a pair of discs; the Liberal Democrats lost a pair of something else&mdash;and they have not yet been found.</p>
	<p pid="a.1864.4/4">Tonight we are taking an important decision for our country, so what are the Liberal Democrats going to do? What is the party of Lloyd George, Asquith and Gladstone going to do tonight when the future of our country is in the balance? They are going to go and hide in the toilets because they do not have the guts to vote on the question either one way or the other! And it is the Liberal Democrats who promise us a new politics, a politics of change. If that is all they have to offer, they should go back to the starting board and start again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1864.4/5">The two documents are the same. The Council mandate of the intergovernmental conference 2004 brought forward almost all the same innovations. That is how it was done. The European Scrutiny Committee said that the two were substantially equivalent and Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing summed it up perfectly when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1864.4/6" class="indent">&quot;Public opinion will be led to adopt, without knowing it, the proposals that we dare not present to them directly... All the earlier proposals will be in the new text, but will be hidden and disguised in some way.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1864.4/7">In the latest poll, 88 per cent. of the British people wanted a referendum. This House collectively, and all parties, gave their word that they would have it. We dishonour this place if we do not keep that promise. We say: let the promise be kept, let the question be put, let the Commons retain its honour in the eyes of the public, and let the people decide.</p>

	<p pid="a.1882.2/5" class="indent">The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to seek to end the siege on the Palestinians and to support Palestinian democracy by stopping arming Israel; reconsidering the UK's policy of refusing to provide aid to the Palestinian Authority following Hamas' election victory in January 2006 and pressing Israel to release all elected Palestinian parliamentarians, as well as other political prisoners; to censure the decision by the Israel cabinet to impose sanctions on supplies of electricity, fuel, and other basic goods and services to the civilian population of Gaza, to cease colluding with this act of State Terrorism against innocent people; and to work towards a just solution based on international law and an end to Israeli occupation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1885.2/1">Last week, Plymouth was awash with rumours that our naval base was to close within five years, that our dockyard was in danger, and that the Royal Navy was being run down and let down. Some found this bizarre and bemusing, but others were worried, and, for those who were worried, I was angry because it was all so unnecessary. I was even more concerned to hear of one person, who was set to move their home from up north to Devonport, bringing with them valuable skills, who was nearly put off doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/2">I want to start by looking at the role of the Royal Navy in the 21st century, and at the threats that it is being configured to face. Understanding those factors is crucial to understanding the future for Devonport. Opportunities, as well as challenges, arise from the revolution in British military capabilities and, as ever, there will be a central role for the Royal Navy, which our city has such a proud record in supporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/3">In the cold war, the Navy existed principally to counter the threat of Soviet submarines in the Greenland-Faroes-Iceland gap. It does not take a strategic genius to realise that that threat has pretty much gone. There might be concerns about Russia, but they are now of a very different character and scale. The cold war gave rise to the need for large numbers of anti-submarine frigates, small aircraft carriers carrying anti-submarine helicopters, and deep-water minesweepers optimised for the cold north Atlantic.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/4">The threats of today and tomorrow arise from international terrorism and from rogue or failing states. These in turn are intertwined with a series of other issues, such as the rise of piracy, the trafficking of drugs and people, and humanitarian disasters. It is perhaps more difficult to articulate the threat now than it was during the cold war or in the first half of the 20th century. Indeed, the uncertainty that now exists in the world is in many ways the danger itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/5">Today, the deployment of our armed services most often takes place in coalition alongside the US and others. Forty other countries are involved in the NATO international security assistance force mission in Afghanistan, and more than 20 are involved in Iraq. As the years go by, a European coalition might become an increasingly likely basis for deploying a joint capability. It is against that background that the announcement about the 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers needs to be viewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/6">Britain is one of a handful of NATO countries that has largely got to grips with making changes to ensure that our armed forces, and their equipment, are relevant to the challenges that we face today and the threats that we may face tomorrow, and that they are interoperable with those of key allies. For the Royal Navy, that has meant a transformation from a cold war force to a versatile, multi-faceted fleet with a range of capabilities. Out have gone the large numbers of escorts optimised for anti-submarine warfare, and in their place have come larger aircraft carriers, new amphibious ships, better kit for the Royal Marines&mdash;as well as more Royal Marines&mdash;a new generation of nuclear submarines, and the maritime airborne surveillance and control aircraft, which will provide general situational awareness and be able to control the carriers' aircraft. There will also be a fleet of more flexible and agile vessels, in the shape of the future surface combatant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/7">Today's Navy is making a significant contribution to the present conflicts, in the form of landing forces, artillery bombardment in support of ground forces, the minesweepers that clear Iraqi ports, and naval auxiliaries delivering humanitarian supplies, to name but a few. Even in landlocked Afghanistan, huge numbers of naval personnel&mdash;including reservists&mdash;are involved. The Royal Navy is unique among the three services in operating not only at sea, but on the land and in the air. Many people outside communities such as Plymouth fail to realise that the Royal Marines, who have been fighting with such intensity in Afghanistan and Iraq are, in fact, part of the Navy. Likewise, many of the aircraft so vital to operations in those countries are naval aircraft flown by naval pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/8">This country needs a strong Royal Navy as much now as it ever has. In no way is it being sidelined, but it must be tailored to the needs of today and tomorrow. We need large carriers that can deploy significant numbers of aircraft anywhere in the world they are needed, so as to avoid relying on foreign airfields and the diplomatic implications and restrictions that that can bring. We need submarines armed with missiles that can strike deep inland with pinpoint accuracy, that can gather intelligence, or that can land special forces. That is why the Government have equipped all our fleet submarines with Tomahawk and are building a new generation of Astute class submarines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/9">We need amphibious ships that can carry troops and their equipment and that can deploy them ashore by landing craft, by helicopter or directly onside&mdash;or, conversely, evacuate British nationals or foreign civilians from harm's way, as we saw happening two summers ago in Lebanon. The helicopter carriers, assault ships and landing ships represent a complete modernisation of our entire amphibious flotilla. We need sealift vessels and support ships that can support forces ashore for extended periods of time. That is why the Government will renew the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service through the military afloat reach and sustainability project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/10">I sometimes wonder whether the Opposition have cottoned on to the importance and the nature of those changes. So much of what they say seems to be rooted in cold war thinking, just as their economic policy is in Thatcherism and their social policy is in Victorian thinking. Certainly, they seem very preoccupied with ship numbers rather than appreciating that what is really important is having a wide, balanced and flexible range of capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/11">The Navy has a very positive future, as central to UK defence policy as the other services. The transformation of capabilities to meet modern threats is covered in an excellent article by Dr. Eric Grove in the February 2008 edition of the parliamentary briefing, &quot;Tomorrow's Royal Navy for Tomorrow's World&quot;. He concludes that when all of this change has worked through:</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/12" class="indent">&quot;It would be hard to deny that such a capability did not make the UK a world power of significance, as one would expect from a country with one of the largest defence budgets in the world. Observers might well then be looking back at the Brown years as those when the seeds were finally laid for a renaissance of British Maritime power and global presence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/13">As my noble Friend the Minister with responsibility for defence equipment and support said loud and clear in an article for Plymouth's <i> The Herald</i> last week, Devonport, its naval base and its dockyard are central to that future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/14">Let me deal specifically with Devonport's role. I am pleased to see in her place on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" name="Alison Seabeck">the Front Bench my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> in her role as Whip. Devonport will be the only yard in the UK with the capability to undertake important work on nuclear submarines. I am certain that our prudent Prime Minister and our Chancellor of the Exchequer are not going to replicate the &pound;1 billion investment in the infrastructure that was made in the D154 dock any time soon. The dockyard has two more refuelling refits on the Vanguard class submarines, Vigilant and Vengeance. Thereafter, there will probably be two, if not three, life extension refits on the Vanguard boats, pending introduction of the new deterrent, for which Parliament gave the go-ahead for the design stage last year. That equates to 12 to 14 years' work for a Babcock Devonport work force of more than 2,500 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/15">In parallel, the yard's unique facilities mean that the dockyard will be there to carry out deep maintenance periods on the Trafalgar class&mdash;wherever they are based&mdash;because of the docking constraints at Faslane. There is also the de-fuelling programme, so it is nonsense to talk of our dockyard being in danger under current Government policy, as the contracts in hand amount to more than &pound;1 billion over the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/16">Of course, deep maintenance work on surface ships will be essential to help with the peaks and troughs of the submarine workload. Irrespective of base porting issues, as it moves to complete the terms of the business agreement with Babcock for the purchase of the dockyard during the course of this year and as it seeks to agree these matters with the other major marine companies through the surface ship support alliance, Ministry of Defence commercial arrangements will need to recognise that. As the new carriers are built, Rosyth's capacity will be fully occupied, allowing further surface ship refits to be allocated to Devonport&mdash;an issue to which I will return.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/17">We are, of course, already home to the Navy's biggest amphibious ships, Albion and Bulwark. Plans are under way to move Royal Marine assets into the south yard. With that, the naval base can become a centre of excellence for amphibious warfare. We are also home to the Navy's hydrographic surveying squadron&mdash;five ships that do vital work in charting the world's oceans. With the Met Office in Exeter, the Hydrographic Office in Taunton&mdash;both MOD agencies&mdash;and the fast developing, world-class marine science partnership based in Plymouth itself, our region has a cluster of complementary activities in marine science and engineering that can only grow with climate change, which is such a strongly emerging challenge. We are bidding strongly to become the home for the new marine management organisation, which will come with the marine Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/18">Since the Conservatives closed Portland naval base in the 1990s, we have been home to Flag Officer Sea Training and its staff. As First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jonathon Band says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/19" class="indent">&quot;It is the quality of our people that underpin all that the Royal Navy does: dedicated; motivated; well trained; and loyal. Their determination, courage and selfless attitude has been displayed time and again.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/20">FOST is what gives focus to that. It puts through their paces not just British warships, but foreign warships from numerous navies. Plymouth's hosting of scores of warships each year from every corner of the globe is a hugely valuable asset. However, if Devonport is to continue to provide its excellent service to the Navy, key considerations must be respected. I have made them clear in countless meetings with Ministers at both the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury, and I hope my right hon. Friend the Minister will confirm that the messages have sunk in.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/21">First, there is the constant need to ensure that the strategically important nuclear work force is maintained. Skills, expertise and experience must not be allowed to atrophy, or to be lost in the periods between submarine refits. As I said, it is vital for Devonport to secure sufficient maintenance and refit work on surface ships.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/22">Secondly, there is the importance of respecting our nuclear covenant. Devonport is currently home to operational nuclear submarines, to those undergoing refit and to those awaiting disposal. The people of Plymouth have always been supportive and understanding of that, but they will not tolerate Devonport without a broader thriving defence sector. Stripping out the fleet base porting and warship refit work and leaving only submarine work is not acceptable. Apart from the need for such work to maintain the skills base, we must gain positive benefit and local economic prosperity through a broad base of surface ship work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/23">Thirdly, Plymouth must remain an operational base for the Royal Navy. Refits and maintenance are not enough. In 1997 I inherited from my Conservative predecessor a constituency that contained the poorest ward in England, which was not unrelated to the careless way in which the Tories had allowed the dockyard to be run down in the 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/24">I think the message has been received that the MOD must play its part in removing jobs from the overheated south-east, which includes Portsmouth. I know that the MOD is delivering on its targets, but I know from my work in the Select Committee on Defence that it could do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/25">As I have said, I am grateful for the countless meetings to which my right hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues have agreed, but I am sure he will not be surprised to hear that I have a list of questions to put to him. Satisfactory answers to those questions would help us to chart the way forward for Devonport in the immediate future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/26">First, following the naval base review we need assurances that all possible help will be forthcoming to enable surplus land to be released quickly, along with the support and investment that will be necessary to deal with its decontamination. For decades we have complained that the MOD is slow when it comes to dealing with land release. On this occasion Project Roundel has been introduced in double-quick time, but we need to know that it will continue to proceed rapidly, and in a way that maximises benefit to the local economy beyond the term of the current base commander, Commodore Simon Lister, who has done so much to make this happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/27">Secondly, assurances have been given by the naval base review team leader to the Devonport task force group, which I chair&mdash;and at the recent meeting between my right hon. Friend, Plymouth Members of Parliament and trade union leaders&mdash;that work will continue be done to assess socio-economic issues associated with the follow-through from the naval base review, and any issues arising from the base-porting of ships.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/28">Will my right hon. Friend confirm that detailed information will be available to enable a full and transparent assessment to be made of any socio-economic impact that arises from any of the changes? How near are we to knowing where we are on base-porting issues? Is the date days, weeks or months away? Can he scotch the rumour unleashed among others last week that FOST will be moved from Plymouth?</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/29">My final question&mdash;for now&mdash;concerns the future surface combatant. I know that it is still at the very early initial-concept stage. Can my right hon. Friend tell us something about the role of those vessels, and will he ensure that serious consideration can be given to a role for Devonport in leading in-service support for them?</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/30">Plymouth's defence sector remains vital to our local economy, and as a city we need to be on the front foot to ensure that it remains vibrant. I believe that, as Babcock Marine has established its headquarters in Plymouth, we have every reason to be confident not just about naval-base activity and our traditional role in submarines but about new as well as traditional ways of supporting the Royal Navy, and the many activities associated with its surface ships of today and tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1885.2/31">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to present those issues to the Minister, and I look forward to hearing his response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-03-05a.1889.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1516" speakername="Bob Ainsworth" speakeroffice="The Minister for the Armed Forces"  colnum="1889"  time="020:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/debtext/80305-0026.htm#08030581004588">
	<p pid="a.1889.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> on securing the debate, and it is good to see that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" name="Alison Seabeck">my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> is present to support her. The comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton made it clear why she is considered to be a champion not only of her city but of the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/2">I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton and the House that recent suggestions that we are planning to close the naval base at Devonport are without foundation, and I can confirm that there are no plans for flag officer sea training to move from Devonport. I will address her other questions later.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/3">Devonport, along with the other naval bases at the Clyde and Portsmouth, will continue to provide the support that ensures that our Navy remains one of the best in the world. The defence industrial strategy laid down a challenge to the UK maritime industry to reduce its overheads and invest in the facilities and skills needed to meet the future demands of the Royal Navy. It was clear that we could not rely on industry alone to achieve the necessary rationalisation. Therefore, in September 2006, we launched the naval bases review. After a period of analysis, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced in July of last year that all three naval bases were to be retained and optimised. That decision secured the futures of the naval bases and remains the position today. Since that announcement, work has been progressing at each of the naval bases to improve the efficiency of the support provided. Going forward, this implementation work has now been incorporated into a single programme: the maritime change programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/4">Industry has a big part to play in the rationalisation, as Devonport has seen through the acquisition of Devonport Management Ltd by Babcock Marine. That is an important step in the managed rationalisation of the UK maritime industrial base. Along with the formation of the joint venture between BAE Systems and VT Group, it is a key component in ensuring long-term balance in supply and demand after the carrier. It will also help to embed the right behaviours and benefits into ship-build and support programmes as we move to through-life solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/5">Devonport is playing an integral part in the maintenance and upkeep of the Royal Navy surface fleet. Babcock Marine has recently completed the successful upkeep of the Type 22 frigate HMS Cumberland, and is currently undertaking a similar overhaul of the Navy's helicopter carrier, HMS Ocean. Babcock Marine, along with Fleet Support Ltd at Portsmouth, is working closely with the Ministry of Defence to allocate future upkeep packages through the auspices of the surface ship support project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/6">In addition, Devonport is a vital element of the UK's submarine programme. Babcock Marine is providing direct support to the Navy's submarine flotilla; for example, a significant milestone was recently achieved when HMS Victorious was successfully refloated in her dock. That was a significant step in a complex three-year project to refuel and refit the submarine. We have to be realistic, however, and must not lose sight of the fact that the number of ships requiring maintenance and repair has been reducing, and in the future as the older classes of submarines leave service and we introduce more capable vessels requiring less maintenance, it will be inevitable that fewer refits will be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/7">I know that my hon. Friend has been working hard with other stakeholders in Plymouth to develop further the city and build for the future. It is only right that its future should build on the success of its maritime past. While I know that the potential loss of jobs recently announced by Babcock is disappointing, there is still, as I have said, much to celebrate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/8">I can assure my hon. Friend that through the maritime change programme we will continue to work closely with Babcock Marine to devise an optimal programme of submarine and surface ship work in order to maintain what is a most valuable skill base. I can also reassure her that I, my ministerial colleagues and officials in the Department are fully aware of the local feeling in Devonport about the mix of submarine and ship support work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/9">As my hon. Friend knows, we are committed to making further investment in Devonport over the next few years. This includes the approval of a &pound;180 million investment to upgrade nuclear refitting facilities and to support the decommissioning of nuclear submarines. There has been recent discussion in various quarters that some of the Royal Navy vessels based at Devonport might be moved. I want to reassure my hon. Friend that we have not taken any decisions to change the base-porting arrangements for ships or boats at Devonport, or at the other two naval bases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/10">As my hon. Friend is aware, the Department is undertaking a planning round. In it, we always consider a number of different options, many of which are not taken beyond initial consideration. I stress that no decisions have yet been made, and while I am unable to give an indication of the timetable for those decisions, I can reiterate the assurances that I have given to my hon. Friend on other occasions that I am committed to keeping her and others informed throughout the process. As the maritime change programme moves forward, we will continue fully to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including the trade unions and other Government Departments, as well as those locally in the south-west, as more detailed plans become available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/11">As my hon. Friend said, it is important that the Department does not take decisions without understanding the socio-economic and environmental impact of any changes at any of the naval bases. I can assure her that my officials and I will be as open as possible with her and the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1889.0/12">To answer my hon. Friend's other questions, project Roundel&mdash;the sale of land at the Devonport estate&mdash;is at an early stage and it is too early to determine the time scales for disposal. However, I can confirm that our intention is to work closely with the local authority in a way that benefits the local economy. I can understand her concern that we move that project forward as soon as we are able.</p>

	<p pid="a.1892.0/1">As I said, I cannot give a time scale, but it is not my intention to delay the process. As I also said, I will be as open as I can with my hon. Friend going forward. We do not want to delay the process; we want to move forward with it as quick as we can.</p>
	<p pid="a.1892.0/2">The future surface combatant is expected to build on the capabilities of the existing Type 22 and Type 23 frigates. This capability includes delivering maritime force protection, providing maritime security to deployed forces, global maritime reach and maritime support to civil organisations. The FSC is at the early stages of concept design and the detailed user requirements have not yet been defined, so I am afraid that I cannot give my hon. Friend the assurances she requested. However, I can assure her that there are no reasons at the moment why Devonport should not be considered to have a role in the support of these vessels.</p>

	<p pid="a.1892.1/1">In concluding, could my right hon.

	<p pid="a.1892.2/2">Finally, I take the opportunity to reiterate that we have no plans to close any of the naval bases, including Devonport.
