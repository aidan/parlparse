<p>The general function of the Council is to consider and advise upon the broad and fundamental problems of the development and efficient utilisation of the nation's fuel and power resources as a whole. The Council is not so constituted as to be qualified to deal with such matters as the organisation and actual working of the various fuel industries, nor was it ever my intention to refer to them such problems, which are proper to other and quite differently constituted bodies, and are in fact being considered by such bodies.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Fuel and Power (1) what proportion of the thermal units generated in our larger power stations are converted into electricity; and what percentage would be available, if appropriate machinery were installed, for providing circulating district heating and circulating district hot water;<br/>
(2) whether the new electricity generating stations to be erected, under the auspices of the Central Electrity Board, will be equipped so as to use their surplus heat after the generation of electricity for the purpose of providing circulating district heating and circulating district hot water in the areas in which they are constructed.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-28a.2372.5" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Major Lloyd George" colnum="2372" time="">
<p>As explained to my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Mr. Parker) on 5th July, the subject of district heating is at present being considered by a sub-committee of the Heating and Ventilation (Reconstruction) Committee appointed by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The Government will wish to see the report of that committee before they can formulate any policy on this matter. The development programme of generating stations just published is so urgent that it cannot wait the formulation of a policy on


district heating which would require legislation. The percentage of heat units in the electricity sent out from the larger and more modern generating stations as compared with the heating units in the coal used ranges from 25 to 28 per cent. If certain difficulties were overcome and district heating from generating stations adopted, it might be possible to have made available 70 to 75 per cent. of the heat units in the coal for combined electrical and district heating purposes. The quantity of electricity, however, produced from every lb. of coal would be considerably less than with present methods and a proportionate increase in generating plant would be required to produce the same amount of electricity.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. and gallant Gentleman feel that it is desirable that we should go on generating electricity in this unscientific manner, when our national supplies of coal are getting less and less?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-28a.2373.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Major Lloyd George" colnum="2373" time="">
<p>I agree that we must use coal to the best possible advantage, and a committee is inquiring into the question whether it is possible to utilise the extra heat from generating stations for the purpose. While you could get a certain amount of heat from the thermal units you would lose a considerable portion of electricity. It may be that future generating stations will have to be proportionately bigger to meet the demand.</p>

Gentleman not aware that on this basis, manufacturers who wish to go ahead with new building are at a great disadvantage unless the Government are going to extend the same facilities to those who build their own factories? What is the position of those who wish to build factories to rent, or those who wish to build their own factories, because, according to this arrangement, the 1939 rent is equal to a subsidy of 50 per cent. from the Government?</p>

<p>This matter has been discussed in the House before. The question I am asked is about factories which now exist and which are being used by, or were built by, the Government in the development areas. It has been announced that these will, generally, be leased and not sold, and that the initial basis of the lease will be the 1939 value. At a later date, that can be readjusted in accordance with changes in conditions.</p>

<p>No, Sir, I do not think everybody is at a standstill. When we get more building labour&#x2014;and the essential problem here is the release of labour for building new factories&#x2014;licences will be


issued for new building in these and other areas, and particularly in these areas, and anybody who desires to build will be enabled to do so.

<p>On a point of Order.

<p>I should like to get my hon. Friend to see the point and I will try again. The factories referred to in the first part of his Question are to be let at 1939 values.

<p>As my answer is necessarily rather long, I will, with permission, circulate it in the OFFICIAL REPORT.<br/>
<i>Following is the answer:</i><br/>
In accordance with King's Regulations, paragraph 1001 (<i>a</i>), Private Felton's commanding officer issued an order on 18th September, 1944, that all emblems must


be removed from buttonholes and caps. This was a lawful command and Private Felton obeyed it. On 19th September in disobedience of this order, Private Felton was seen wearing the Belgian colours on a ribbon. He was ordered by the company-sergeant-major to remove the ribbon. He refused. He was then placed on a charge and brought before his company commander, who ordered him to remove the ribbon. Felton again refused. Felton was then brought before his commanding officer, who explained why emblems should not be worn. When ordered by his commanding officer to remove the ribbon, Felton refused. The commanding officer then ordered the regimental sergeant-major to have the ribbon removed. Felton threatened to fight anyone who tried to do so. Felton's blouse was taken off and the ribbon removed. His attitude remained so threatening that he had to be placed in handcuffs while under arrest. The unit was holding an extended front against the enemy and extra guards could not be spared. Felton was, on more than one occasion, told that his handcuffs would be removed, if he abandoned his threatening attitude; owing to persistent refusal to do so, the handcuffs were not removed. Felton was finally convicted by a field general court-martial of disobeying a lawful command and insubordinate language, and sentenced to one year's detention. The action taken by the commanding officer was approved by the corps commander.</p>

<p>I am not aware that parcels which are properly packed and correctly addressed are not reaching men in the British Liberation Army. If my hon. Friend will send me particulars of the cases to which he refers they will be investigated. It is very important that general complaints of this kind should be accompanied by specific instances. Sometimes the specific cases enable the machinery to be improved. Sometimes they are insufficient to sustain a general accusation. In one case, where an offi-

cial complaint reached us from an operational theatre, it was conclusively proved that not more than one in 40 of the parcels in question had, in fact, gone astray.</p>

<p>I will, with permission, circulate in the OFFICIAL REPORT a statement giving the facts so far as I have been able to ascertain them by the most exhaustive research. Broadly speaking, these facts point to the eminently suitable conclusion that both the hon.

<p>There are nine sites at which mixed batteries are or were operationally deployed in the area in question. In one of these, huts were available at all relevant times. In two others the unit in occupation at the time I gave my answer was in process of relief in the ordinary course by a wholly male unit. This leaves six sites, at two of which the hon. Member gave lectures on 13th November, the day before my oral answer was given. The hon. Member put down a Question to me on the Order Paper for written answer on 9th November. A reply in the same form as that subsequently given was sent to him on the same day. That answer was then premature in that the double tentage had not arrived on the sites although issue of it had been authorised. There was some delay in this authorisation owing to large competing demands from 21 Army Group.</p>

<p>The position on 13th November when the hon. Member visited two of the six sites which alone are in question, was as follows. On three of the sites winter tentage had been delivered. It had not


been erected owing to deficiencies of certain necessary accessories. On three others, including the two visited by the hon. Member, winter tentage had still not arrived. By 14th November, the day I gave my answer to the hon. Member's oral Question, it had been delivered to all six sites. By the night of 16th November the A.T.S. auxiliaries on the two sites visited by the hon. Member were actually housed either in huts, double tentage or civilian buildings. This was also the position on that day at the other sites, except one where the auxiliaries were not so housed until 19th November.</p>

The application of these increases to British personnel of the Indian Army and to British Service personnel attached to or serving with the Indian Army is under active consideration and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for India hopes to make a statement before long. As stated in the White Paper, Far East Allowance is issued to troops in receipt of pay under the British Pay Code.

<p>The answer to the first part of my hon. Friend's Question is that my attention was called to these precise facts by the terms of his Question, although I had, of course, realised the magnificent character of the Canadian war effort. Plans for the reconstruction of the Army after the war are under active consideration in the War Office, and these include such matters as terms of service and the means of attracting men to enlist under regular engagements. The question of national service as the foundation of our military system is also being examined.</p>

<p>We went through all this difficulty at the end of the last war. As the war progressed the terms of men's service reached their conclusion, especially in the Regular Army, with men who were already under arms when the war began. But, on the whole, the matter is being, I will not say studied, but thoroughly surveyed. Undoubtedly a great change-over takes place when war comes suddenly to an end but in this case the change-over will not be so violent, because there is another war which will open with greater vigour at the other end of the world, when the present one in Europe is finished.</p>

Since then further important expansions have been made, and I am prepared to say that, providing factory workers maintain&#x2014;and they may even improve upon&#x2014;the present planned output, there is no reason to suppose that the British Armies will be short of the necessary ammunition to fight their battles. We have also very considerable reserves, the use of which depends upon the varying estimates made as to the duration of the German resistance.</p>

<p>No, Sir, I do not think that argument follows. There are precedents for Ministers who were conducting their work in another place with great satisfaction having retired because of the growing interest the House of Commons


took in their particular topics, and the temporary and special need of having someone to deal with these matters here.

<p>My Noble Friend the Minister of Reconstruction has a general responsibility for ensuring, on behalf of the War Cabinet, that due progress is made with the preparation of post-war plans. This responsibility naturally extends to housing, which claims a

<p>The Minister of Reconstruction is a member of the War Cabinet, and, as such, has continual opportunity of putting his views forward where they are most likely to lead to results being obtained. But in regard to housing, especially war damage and prefabrication, a great deal of active executive work has to be done.

<p>There is a matter to which I would like to draw the attention of hon. Members. I have been thinking about the arrangements now in operation for the half-hour Adjournment Debate. It has very often been the case that subjects have not been selected for raising on the Adjournment Motion until the date has been secured. I propose to lay down the Rule in future, to operate from the beginning of the new Session, that the half-hour Adjournment may not be booked for more than a fortnight in advance and must be booked after 10 o'clock in person at my office. The subject then must be given. I suggest we might follow this arrangement during the coming Session to see how it works.</p>

<p>If there is a last-minute cancellation of the subject that has been booked, either because the Member himself cannot be there or because, as has happened on occasion, the Minister is unexpectedly called away and cannot be there to answer, will that half-hour then be available, as usual, for any hon. Member who chooses to raise anything at quite short notice?</p>
</speech>

<p>Will you, Mr. Speaker, make perfectly clear that the right of hon. Members to raise subjects in the half-hour Debate on the Adjournment still remains? This new procedure of stating the subject some time in ad-

<p>I understand from what you have said, Sir, that at any time the Adjournment may be booked up, probably for a fortnight ahead. There must, nevertheless, be other Members rising from day to day, and giving notice that they want to raise matters at a later time. Will note be taken of these, and at the end of the 14 days will you, Sir, allocate the Adjournment, in the order in which Members have given notice in the House?</p>

<p>Will you Mr. Speaker, make clear what will be the position in the event of a Member who has the Adjournment, and has named the subject, wishing to raise another subject?
