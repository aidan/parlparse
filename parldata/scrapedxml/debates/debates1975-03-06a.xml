<p>Is the Minister aware that my constituents and I are grateful for the tremendous work done by the Cheshire Constabulary in its fight against crime?

<p>I welcome the Minister's statement about the Cheshire police force, but we are not quite so sanguine in Sussex.

<p>That is one of the highly controversial features of the Erroll Report. It is known that the problem of drunkenness and alcoholism, especially among young people, is substantial. The Government, therefore, have to give careful thought to any change in the law which might aggravate it.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that I received an exactly similar answer to a question which I asked on 19th December last?

<p>I recognise that there are disagreements, but there is a

large measure of agreement that the Home Secretary should introduce legislation and that the licensed trade is ready for an extension of hours, provided that a global total is chosen by the trade. Would not that action secure greater liberalisation and, at the same time, effective control? There has been a long delay, for which we are all responsible. I do not blame the Government for that.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Lady aware that many of us applaud the cautious note which she has sounded this afternoon?

<p>I thank the hon. Lady for that information, which shows a slight decline in the number of licensed firearms.

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that a useful body to consult on these matters would have been a central advisory committee on the control of firearms&#x2014;a body which I have suggested from time to time? Is it not more important to control the pool of illegally-held weapons, including automatic and other weapons, rather than the pool of the legitimately-held weapons, which includes only single-shot and semi-automatic weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. Warren and Mr. Tomlinson were transferred on 4th February to Lincoln and Leicester Prisons respectively because their refusal to work or wear prison clothes meant that their continued presence in an open prison was disruptive of the co-operation between prisoners and staff upon which the r&#x00E9;gime in open prisons is essentially based.</p>

<p>I thank my right hon. Friend for that information. Had some of my hon.

Friend for the facilities which his office is making available to my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) and Sheffield,

Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery), who are to visit the Leicester and Lincoln Prisons tomorrow as a mark of solidarity.

<p>In accordance with precedent I always allow hon. Members of this House to see prisoners who wish to see them. My hon. Friends so concerned are able to go to Lincoln and Leicester.

<p>As a result of the recommendations of the working party in 1973, chief police officers have been consulting to see whether there should be greater uniformity in the way in which prosecutions are brought. Although my hon. Friend says that the acquittal rate is persistently high, he will note that it compares with an average of about 51 per cent. of all criminal offences in the Crown courts, and in relation to the totality of shoplifting offences only 5 per cent. of those charged with the offence are acquitted.</p>

<p>Is the right hon.

<p>I am aware of disquiet on this matter. A couple of weeks ago I received deputations from the Magistrates' Association and the Justices' Clerks' Association, and this week from a body representing a somewhat different point of view&#x2014;the Social Service Officers' Association. Anybody who says he is wholly satisfied with the situation would be complacent and foolish. On the whole the fault lies in lack of resources under successive Governments more than in the failure of concept.

<p>Does the Minister accept that there is frustration not only among the magistracy but in a wider sphere, especially regarding the lack of secure accommodation, and that because of this there is an increasing number of certificates of unruliness issued by the courts?

<p>Yes, I do. As I indicated in my reply to the question of the hon. and learned Member for South Fylde (Mr. Gardner), I accept that there is a real problem here. It is sometimes easier to state the problem than to provide the exact answer to it. The old approved school system, which it is fairly generally agreed, had run its course, was not completely successful. On the whole, the change was desirable. However, there are imperfections, at the margin at any rate. I am aware of that and I shall do what I can to improve it. However, I cannot promise a magic solution.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend appreciate that it is precisely because some senior officers in the Metropolitan Police force were allegedly so successful in covering up their activities allegedly involving the payment of &#x00A3;5,000, for example, in the opening of a pornography shop, that some hon. Members are concerned that a further cover-up attempt may now be tried? Will he consider whether it would not be in the best interests of both the police and the public that this matter should be handed over to an independent inquiry, so that at least the fears of a cover-up can be allayed?</p>

<p>This matter is being rigorously investigated. I think that if I were to make a statement at present it would be prejudicial both to the individuals involved and also to the progress of a rigorous inquiry, which I am sure both my hon. Friend and the House are anxious to see carried forward.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that there is grave disquiet among the general public that every time anything involving the police occurs, the inquiry is always conducted by the police themselves? For instance, some time ago, in Sheffield, the Labour movement wanted a public inquiry into a case about pickets

in which the police were concerned. However, as usual, the people were fobbed off with the idea that there would be a police inquiry into their own conduct. Does my right hon. Friend consider that this is unsatisfactory and that in future there should be some other method of inquiry in cases where the general public is involved?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has raised a number of issues which go considerably wider than the original Question. As regards complaints by the public, I have indicated, following the view taken by my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Carshalton (Mr. Carr), that I am in favour of the introduction of an independent element. I wish to see that done. Another Question on the Order Paper refers to this. However, as regards the investigation of certain allegations against police officers who have been suspended, I do not think that my hon. Friend is living in a real world if he thinks that the present Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is not extremely vigorous in pursuing, rooting out and disciplining such behaviour on the part of any officers.</p>

<p>In relation to the length of time that it has been under discussion, it has not dawdled for an immense time under me, though I should not wish to see it dawdle at all. There are a few points remaining to be settled in consultation. There is the problem of avoiding any question of double jeopardy&#x2014;to which the Police Federation attaches great importance&#x2014;while providing adequate powers to chief officers to maintain discipline over their forces and to investigate most rigorously. This bears upon the previous Question, concerning matters of discipline and possible corruption within the police. I hope that we can find a satisfactory solution. I should then wish to bring forward the legislation as quickly as is reasonably practicable.

Gentleman accepts that both his view and the view of the Lord President of the Council is much more realistic than the views of some of his backwoodsmen from Scottish constituencies, especially one with a majority of 367?</p>

<p>If the size of majorities were a qualification for expressing views in this House there would be some rather odd silences, including some from the Scottish National Party.<br/>
I do not think that one needs to go to Bannockburn to discuss these matters. Those were the days when there was certain evidence of divisiveness, I am too gentlemanly to refer to the Battle of Pinkie, in 1547, and what happened. They all had different conclusions. Surely we are all now working together, and no one, apart from the small minority represented by the hon. Gentleman, supports separatism.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister referred again to the important discussions that he had with the Scottish TUC, to which the Leader of the House referred last Monday. Do not these discussions and the documents that came forward make it all the more important that the House should be informed about them in a White Paper long before we consider any question of legislation on the subject?</p>

<p>The discussions were important. I shall certainly consider how these matters can be made available to the House. These documents were, in fact, published. They were very forward-looking and to a high degree represented the views expressed on both sides of the House. It is not necessary to have a White Paper, because in the debate my right hon.

<p>On 28th February some 9,000 London dockers stopped work. The stoppage is unofficial and followed unofficial action both by dock workers and road haulage workers.<br/>
The dispute originated with the picketing of the Dagenham Storage Company at Barking and F. J. Robertson at Millwall with the objective of securing employment there for registered dockers. Additionally, dockers began to refuse to handle vehicles which it was alleged served these and other establishments where it was claimed cargo handling work should be undertaken by dock workers. This action led to counter-picketing by road haulage workers, who endeavoured to prevent goods from reaching the docks.<br/>
At the request of the Transport and General Workers' Union and with the agreement of all the other parties, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service established an independent inquiry on 24th February into the issues at Barking and Millwall, and this inquiry is now proceeding.<br/>
The workers concerned are in the main members of the Transport and General Workers' Union, and the union has consistently urged that all industrial action in this dispute should cease. On 27th February the haulage workers accepted the advice of the union and removed their

pickets. Dockers at Tilbury, however, continued to refuse to handle some vehicles, and this led to the stoppage. The union's national executive has this week urged a return to normal working, and its general secretary met all the London dock port stewards last night in an endeavour to persuade them to accept the executive's decision.<br/>
The issues involved are of long standing. They were largely responsible for the national dock strike in 1972 and have been a potent source of industrial unrest for many years. During this period there has been a substantial reduction in the employment opportunities available for registered dock workers, while at the same time changes in the ways goods moving to and from ships are handled has led to work traditional to the docks and to dock workers moving from them. Under existing legislation it has not been possible to extend the coverage of the Dock Labour Scheme to all such activities where this might be judged appropriate.<br/>
On 15th July 1974 I told the House that I proposed to begin consultations on the extension of the scheme to non-scheme ports and on possible changes in the statutory definitions which define the scope of the scheme. These consultations led me to conclude that significant changes are necessary to reflect the changes which have taken place in the industry and to ensure that satisfactory arrangements are established to deal with possible future changes. In the Queen's Speech the Government undertook to publish proposals for ensuring further safeguards for employment in the docks. I hope to publish proposals for legislation very shortly.<br/>
As the Government are shortly to begin consultations on these proposals and an independent inquiry is currently considering the particular problems at Barking and Millwall, I hope that the dockers will respond to the advice of the Transport and General Workers' Union so that normal working can be resumed and progress quickly made in establishing new arrangements to deal with the vexed problems. Any stoppage in the docks can only increase our economic difficulties and, indeed, threaten the number of jobs they provide.</p>

<p>Can the right hon. Gentleman say whether those directly involved


in and affected by the dispute have submitted evidence to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service inquiry? Can he say when this inquiry will be completed, and whether it is his intention to extend the Dock Labour Scheme by legislation to be brought in during this parliamentary Session? Will the right hon.

<p>I cannot say when the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service will complete its inquiry, but those concerned appreciate the need for speed, as do the different parties who are giving evidence&#x2014;and evidence is being given to the inquiry. We hope that it will be able to report as soon as possible.<br/>
It is the Government's intention to introduce in this Session the legislation required to extend the scheme. How long this Session will be is another matter, but certainly we wish to proceed with the legislation as speedily as possible. I hope that very soon we shall publish the consultative document about the legislation so that people can see clearly what we propose and the parties concerned can make any representations they want.<br/>
I have already indicated my view, and the Government's strongly held view, about the whole dispute. We believe that it should be brought to an end at once. We believe that people should resume work at once. We believe that this is urgent in the interests of the dock workers themselves.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend referred to another inquiry into this industry. Does he realise that it has been subject to a number of inquiries, under both Governments, which have come out with recommendations which the dockers have accepted but which have not been implemented, though the Labour Government have now said they will implement them? Is it not time to step in and take action in view of the fact that yet again the docks industry is being threatened by private employers? First it was the stevedores, and now it is the lorry driving companies which are disrupting this important industry.</p>

<p>I appreciate what my hon. Friend has said. I was informed by some of the docks representatives whom I met yesterday at the meeting of the T and GWU executive that they had already had 17 investigations into the docks, and therefore another one would be the eighteenth. We are not proposing another investigation. We are proposing a consultative document to be put before the House as a preparation for legislation and for action on the basis of that legislation. We are not proposing another inquiry. We are proposing action to deal with the matter.</p>

<p>As with some other things, these are delicate matters. This is a dispute involving two branches of the same union, and it is a delicate matter for the union and also for the country. However, will the right hon. Gentleman accept that the Opposition do not believe that the remedies proposed by him this afternoon or by the Government are any long-term answer to the problems facing the docks and will merely add to costs and restrict our trade even more than at present? In a situation where jobs are at risk in this way one does not, in the long term, preserve them by this sort of action. Will the right hon. Gentleman remember that when he comes to discuss further the Dock Labour Scheme? In the meantime, we join him in urging a return to work, otherwise more jobs will be lost.</p>

<p>We are glad to see the right hon. Gentleman recovered so speedily from his unofficial absence&#x2014;although many might wish that he would extend it. I cannot accept what he says about our proposals. I do not think that he should condemn them before he has seen them. I have the advantage that I know what they are. I hope that when he sees them he will bring his usual, or shall I say his unusual, objective view to bear upon the matter. Then we shall be able to discuss the matter in the House, which is the proper place to settle legislation on this issue.</p>

<p>The most effective action which we believe can be taken to deal with this question must be through legislation. It cannot be done by edict. It has to be done by legislation approved by this House. The dock workers would be wise, in their own interests, to call off this action immediately, to examine the proposals we are making carefully, and to make any representations that they wish, together with other parties, about those proposals. That is the proper way to proceed in the interests of the dock workers and of the country.</p>

<p>Would my right hon. Friend agree that the present dispute in the docks is the culmination of the concern and fears of many dock workers? Is he aware that in London the number of dock workers has been reduced from 22,000 to 9,000 and on Merseyside from 16,000 to 8,000 with no indication that the numbers will ever be made good? Does he further appreciate that this causes real concern? Is he aware that the sooner we have the consultative documents and legislation the sooner will there be confidence about employment prospects among dock workers?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has certainly shown what are the anxieties and fears of many dock workers. We are seeking to learn from these and to produce proposals which will assist in allaying these anxieties. If this action continues it can only add to the difficulties,

The dockers have an interest in this but there are other parties concerned, too. That has to be taken into account in the legislation we produce.</p>

Concerning the reference of the issues that had been before that Committee to the Committee of Privileges, that was not known to the House. It was not available to Members until yesterday morning.

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 42, in page 16, line 23, at end insert:
<q>'or at a price such as might be expected to have been freely negotiated at the time of the sale'.</q>
This amendment honours an undertaking I gave in Standing Committee to reconsider provisions dealing with the transfers of unquoted shares. The effect of the provision was that a sale of unquoted shares for less than their full market value could not be exempted from charge as one made without donative intent and on arm's length conditions unless it were at a price freely negotiated at the time of the sale.<br/>
The amendment allows a sale to be excepted also if it were made instead at a price which might have been expected to be freely negotiated. This deals with the problem where in an unquoted company it is possible, as the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson) appreciates and pointed out in Standing Committee, that there are problems in the case of the sale of unquoted shares. There


may be a situation in which there could be a sale at less than the full market value but still a perfectly reasonable transaction. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is no problem in that respect.<br/>
I know that the Opposition have tabled Amendment No. 529, which would seek to exclude all unquoted company transactions in this respect. But I hope that the Opposition will agree that that would be to go much too wide. I think that the Government amendment would deal with the problem that was pointed out in Standing Committee.</p>

<li>(<i>a</i>) the settlor's spouse was at the time of the death domiciled in the United Kingdom and resident (within the meaning of the Income Tax Act) in the United Kingdom in the year of assessment in which the death occurred; and</li>

The amendment and its counterpart in paragraph 4 of Schedule 5&#x2014;Amendment No. 172&#x2014;arises from our consideration of the argument in Committee for the provision of exemption from the capital distribution charge where property reverts to the settlor from a discretionary trust.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 502, in page 19, line 12, at end insert:
<q>'(4) A dwelling is excluded property if on the death of the person with an interest in possession of that said dwelling and which is occupied by him at the time of his death it passes to an ancestor or descendant, brother or sister, or spouse thereof who has lived with him for not less than two out of the three years preceding'.</q>
The amendment is designed to deal, so far as we can, with the fact that the new capital transfer tax designed and introduced by this Labour Government will prove to be, in a way that estate duty never was, a tax on homes, on the family and&#x2014;if I may be forgiven the phrase, despite the mocking of the Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday&#x2014;on the natural bonds of love and affection that exist within a family. The Chancellor derided that concept.<br/>
Perhaps that is not surprising. We know that in Labour's house, or at least in those parts above stairs that are reserved for members of the Labour Cabinet, there are many mansions. Labour Ministers appear to collect houses with as much enthusiasm as commissars collect dachas. But that is not the life they visualise for the ordinary people.


They have no natural sympathy with those who save, with those who own their own homes. I am sorry if the Chief Secretary feels underprivileged in having only one home when his colleagues have so many.<br/>
It is not surprising that the tax will impose a new and growing burden on exactly those thrifty and hard-working people who own their own homes. It will impose a new and growing burden on right to keep the benefits of thrift within one's family. I am not dealing with the rich minority, on the subject of whom the Chancellor loves to dwell, and of which he is such an outstanding, if undistinguished, Member. I am dealing with that half of the families of this country who live in their own homes. Many of those homes already come near to facing the lower limit of the new tax, because it starts at &#x00A3;15,000. The average price of a new home in the South-East of England is now estimated at about &#x00A3;14,250. If inflation continues at the pace we have unfortunately come to expect under this Government, that figure will soon be reached in other parts of the country.<br/>
It is true that the rate of tax payable on death is no higher than under estate duty, but that argument, which we have heard so often from the Chancellor, overlooks the extent to which it is a cumulative tax, assessed over the transactions effected during the lifetime of the taxpayer or his family. The tax burden must take account of the lifetime gifts of any other part of the estate of the original house-owner above &#x00A3;1,000, whether in the form of savings, chattels, cars or anything of that kind.<br/>
The tax will inevitably impose a new and growing burden on dispositions within the family. Even if it did not do that, there is a good additional social reason for seeking to encourage home owership, as the amendment would. There is a good reason for seeking to encourage disposition of homes within the families of those who have saved in order to buy them.<br/>
Moreover, there is a good reason for encouraging succession to the family home by others than just the surviving spouse, although that certainly is desirable. One acknowledges that the legislation at least has that effect, as did the provisions made by the Conservative

Government in 1972. But we want also to encourage succession to the home by, for example, a child or children living with the person who wishes to pass it on at death or at any other time. Perhaps even more, we wish to encourage the possibility of a home being passed on to elderly relatives, quite often dependent relatives. There is something positively socially desirable in the transmission of homes and dwelling houses to other members of the family.<br/>
That desirable aspect of policy has been recognised in many other parts of housing policy and taxation policy over many years. I begin by citing the remarkable example of the practice in local authority housing, where the original tenant has no continuing title, nothing resembling a freehold title to which he has contributed anything by any act of thrift on his part. I do not say that critically. In most parts of the country the members of the family living with the tenant who dies in practice have a title to succeed to the house.<br/>
Paragraph 208 of the Cullingworth Report says:
<q>So far as transfer of tenancies to adult children is concerned, a distinction is made between children who have been living in the parental household for a considerable time &#x2026; and those who have been living separately &#x2026; In the former case the transfer of tenancy is common; in the latter less common&#x2014;though much depends on the nature of the local housing shortage.</q>
Even in these circumstances of local authority housing, with no title, no acquisition, no thrift and no saving, our social policy recognises the desirability of allowing the family of the original tenant to succeed, and the case is even stronger where rent-controlled property or regulated property is concerned.<br/>
Here again we are dealing with property where the tenant has no continuing title, nothing resembling a freehold or a leasehold to the property. He has a statutory right to remain there at the expense of the owner of the freehold who is often poorer than the person who is enjoying the right to remain on. Yet even in that situation as set out in Schedule 1 of the Rent Act 1968 there is a right to the family of the original tenant to succeed to the statutory tenancy. The original tenant can pass his tenancy on to his widow who was residing with him at his death or to a person who was


a member of the original tenant's family who had resided with him for six months before his death. If that first successor dies leaving his widow who was residing with him at the time of his death or a member of the family living with him for a minimum period of six months the tenancy can be transferred to them. There is therefore a statutory right to double inheritance to a tenancy which may be no more than a monthly tenancy. There again we see the extent to which social policy recognises the desirability of allowing families to continue living in their original homes.<br/>
Although that provision is in the 1968 Act, it dates from the original rent-control legislation passed in the palmy days of Messrs. Asquith and Lloyd George during World War I. Here at least is a residual contribution by the Liberal Party to one aspect of our current social policy. More recent legislation concerning capital gains tax allows for relief in respect of owner-occupied houses. In that situation relief is allowed without limit as to the amount, and beyond that it extends to a house that is occupied rent-free by a dependent relative. In that situation the dwelling is also relieved from capital gains tax.<br/>
That is another example of sensible social policy to adjust the impact of tax on actual social conditions. The reasons for the exemption are
<q>to encourage home ownership, to avoid any feeling of resentment there might be&#x2014;and I think that it would be widespread if this was subject to tax&#x2014;and, also, from a social point of view, to assist greater mobility, which is an important matter from a labour point of view. The effect of it, as I say, is to make home ownership very attractive front the investment point of view".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 27th May 1965; Vol. 713, c. 997.]</q>
Those are not my reasons; they are the reasons for such an exemption from capital gains tax produced by the previous Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Mr. Niall MacDermot, as he then was. He held the office for, as far as I recollect, very many years, but thereafter advanced no further within the ranks of his party. I do not know whether that fate will befall his successor today.<br/>
The additional relief to which I have referred, again recognising the importance of social policy and taxation policy working together, is the one granting exemp

tion from capital gains tax to the dependent relative living rent free in the house. That provision was enacted in 1965 as a result of the initiative by my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Sir J. Hall). He moved an amendment on that same day's proceedings, and he was fortunate enough, again, not merely in the identity of the Financial Secretary but in the response of that Minister to the amendment. Mr. MacDermott said
<q>There is a popular fallacy that Treasury Ministers are cold and hard-hearted and never moved by an emotional appeal, and that it is only cold, remorseless logic which will make them shift at all.</q>
In present times that fallacy has indeed given way to fact in the case of present Ministers. Mr. MacDermott went on,
<q>I would only point out in answering the hon. Member that in this case we do not feel that cold, remorseless logic is on this side, but, nevertheless, we are moved by the sympathetic and emotional considerations to support his case.</q>
Those were the days, and would that we should see a similar compassionate response from present Ministers. Mr. MacDermott went on to commend the proposal to the Committee, saying
<q>I think the Committee will agree that this is a proposal which has an obvious appeal to it, that it is not unreasonable that someone who provides a home for a dependent relative should have some benefit in respect of such property, as he does in respect of a house he occupies himself."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 27th May 1965; Vol. 713, c. 1003&#x2013;4.]</q>
That is the way in which we should tailor our tax legislation. We should not be introducing, as the Government are, a new tax with the mechanistic automatism of people without humanity or heart, with no exceptions, and designed to impose a tax of this kind upon the home and the family. The amendment is well designed to fulfil legitimate social purposes, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>I hope that in their response to the amendment the Government will not be over-influenced by the fact that it appears in itself to be ungrammatical and, much more serious, that as it is drawn it would clearly provide an immense scope for avoidance which cannot be the intention of those who designed and moved it. That is my belief and I detected no evidence in what the right hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe) said that any such consideration was in


his mind. There are circumstances in which it would be thought unreasonable that a dwelling which is a legitimate home, and probably the sole home and a home of long standing of the deceased person, should attract, in all circumstances, capital transfer tax along with the rest of the estate.<br/>
I do not wish to waste the time of the House by proposing what will more readily occur to the Government by way of methods to introduce safeguards which would reduce this innovation to its intended scope. For instance, one could imagine that there could be a fairly low upper limit upon the value of the property.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to intervene in a discussion between an ex-Treasury Minister and Treasury Ministers about tax avoidance, but the right hon. Gentleman is entirely right. If it were found necessary and sensible to propose limitations in order to prevent undesirable tax avoidance we would accept them, but the objective of the amendment is clear.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1793.1" hansard_membership_id="5592" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30196" speakername="Mr. Powell" colnum="1793" time="">
<p>It is most helpful that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has made that clear, and I will not elaborate except to say that there could also be safeguards regarding the domiciliary connection with the particular house of the recipient under the will of the deceased person. Quite obviously as the provisions stand it would be possible to buy an immensely expensive dwelling and to arrange for the intended legatee to occupy it for two years so that it would be outside estate duty. Therefore I hope that the Government will overlook the obvious grave defects of the new subsection and have regard solely to the intention.<br/>
We are in a stronger position than usual, I believe, in making that kind of plea. I say that first because none of the rest of us has had an opportunity adequately to consider these amendments and therefore perhaps to bring points forward by amendments to amendments. That would be the proper way, rather than by this kind of debate. But even more, the fact that we are just looking forward to our next Finance Bill makes it possible for the Government in this case almost to treat it as one stage of legislation which will presently be succeeded by the next.<br/>
Whereas, therefore, it would normally be absurd for the Government spokesman to say, in responding, that he would see what could be done at the next stage, I hope that, since the next stage in financial legislation is so near in time, the Government spokesman in this case will find it in his heart to use some such well-honoured formula as that.</p>

<p>I rise to support what the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) has said. I am entirely in agreement with him on the amendment. It had occurred to me that it might be possible to seek your leave, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to introduce a manuscript amendment to the amendment which would make it very supportable on all sides of the House and even perhaps acceptable to the Government. Even as it stands, it is a very attractive amendment and I believe that its principle will gain sympathy on all sides of the House. But as the hon. and learned Gentleman has acknowledged, it is too wide. It would enable somebody, presumably on his deathbed, as has happened with agricultural land in the past, to buy an enormous house of prodigious value and thereby to a certain extent to overcome the problems of capital transfer tax. In that sense, I suppose one could say that as it stands this is almost a wrecking amendment.<br/>
I do not want to suggest to the Government how a change could be made if they were prepared to accept it in that spirit. Certainly, changes could be made to schedules later in the Bill, and on the Orders Paper there is an amendment which has not been selected which mentions an upper limit of &#x00A3;25,000. Whether or not that is the right limit is difficult to decide. We always discover that a limit that will do for one part of the country will not do for other parts, but that is probably as good a figure as any. Therefore, I suppose the insertion after the words "a dwelling" of the words "of a value of not more than &#x00A3;25,000" might well solve the problem, if not to the satisfaction of the parliamentary draftsmen.<br/>
I would say to the Government that hon. Members on all sides of the House accept that a dwelling is a rather special type of property and wealth. We accept


that in relation to capital gains tax, and therefore it seems sensible that we should accept it in relation to capital transfer tax. In the spirit in which the right hon. and learned Gentleman moved the amendment, bearing in mind what he has said and what has been said by the right hon. Member for Down, South, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept its principle, and perhaps he can do something to overcome its wrecking nature, if that is not too strong a way of putting it. I do not know whether we can dignify the Opposition stance&#x2014;is "mechanistic automatism" better than categorising that stance as "wrecking"?&#x2014;but I hope the Government can meet the arguments put forward on this side of the House.</p>

<p>I hope that I do not have to reply in kind to the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Shadow Chancellor every time he gets up, because that would be rather tedious. But when he starts by criticising my right hon. Friend and myself for being hard-hearted and for damming up the milk of human kindness, and then criticises us for giving way, after so many proddings and so many amendments moved at his behest or by those of his hon. Friends who have studied the Bill, then the illogicality of his remarks stands out in stark clarity without further comment from me. As the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) has observed, this amendment suffers from obvious grave defects, to use his own words and would allow a coach and horses to be driven through the whole principle of the capital transfer tax. If one accepts the good motives of right hon. Gentlemen opposite, one can only marvel at their incompetence in producing so technically defective an amendment.<br/>
It is important to point out that in many ways the reliefs that the Government are already giving under the Bill are far in excess of those contemplated in Amendment No. 502. In the first place, we have introduced for the first time in British history the principle that there shall be no charge at all to the surviving spouse on the death of a spouse with respect to any property whatsoever that is passing from the deceased spouse to the surviving spouse. For the first time, a

widow suffering bereavement and the additional economic loss of the breadwinner of the family will not simultaneously be faced with a liability to estate duty and perhaps the need to sell the home in which she has lived all her life, with a consequent rupture of friendships and social connections on which she would be particularly dependent at a time of bereavement.<br/>
This is a relieving provision which has been in the Bill from the beginning. It was introduced by my right hon. Friend without any suggestions or prodding. The idea was not even in the mind of hon. Gentlemen opposite in their proposals while in Opposition, let alone in their election manifesto.</p>

<p>Lest the hon. Gentleman should become too puffed up with glory, may I point out that this is one of the foundations of the argument that I have been putting forward, that a previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Barber, introduced in his Finance Bill in 1972 provisions giving precisely to the surviving spouse a doubling of exemption from estate duty up to a figure of &#x00A3;30,000 in order to cover a dwelling. There are very few dwelling houses occupied by a surviving spouse that have been helped by the generosity of this Government except those occupied by the tiny minority, for whom it has had little benefit.</p>

<p>Clearly the hon. and learned Gentleman has failed to recognise that the impact of estate duty on a widow's other assets might make it necessary for her to sell the house in which she is living. I would have thought even the level of economic sophistication that the hon. and learned Gentleman has managed to reach under the tutorship of his colleagues would have instructed him on that. I am sorry that the hon. and learned Gentleman is being churlish. It is obvious that this relief, being provided by the Government without any prodding, for a widow or a widower at the time of the death of a spouse, goes far beyond anything that is on the statute book or was even conceived before my right hon. Friend entered office. Furthermore, in the terms of the amendment, the relief contemplated would be available only to a spouse who has lived with her husband


for not less than two out of the three years preceding his death. Our relief in no way relates to how long they have been married, let alone how long they have been living together. Had such a provision entered into our proposal, I should have been very surprised had there not been a storm of protest from hon. Gentleman opposite that it was an impertinence to include such provision in this relief, that it was an outrageous intrusion into people's privacy, and stuff of that kind. The relief we are offering is an absolute relief, regardless of the time that a man and woman have been married and regardless of whether they are living together at the time that death occurs. It would be only gracious of the right hon. Gentleman to acknowledge that.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe) pointed out quite clearly that there was a provision in capital gains tax law recognising the particular and peculiar nature of property, in addition to the property of a deceased, where it is held for a dependent relative. Certainly I take his point, but I am sure he will recall that only yesterday evening the Government brought forward an amendment to the Bill extending relief on transfers to dependent relatives as defined under capital transfer tax. I am obliged to him for acknowledging that.<br/>
I have to tell hon. Gentlemen opposite that we see no reason why any relief which could be given for particular types of assets should be tied to the ownership of a dwelling house. It is a matter entirely for the discretion of the family whether they choose to buy a house to live in or whether they choose to rent accommodation and to invest their savings elsewhere. We see no justification for benefiting the first category more than the second. That would introduce an unjustifiable degree of favouritism and distortion. If it became possible to reduce the rate of tax we would wish to spread it over a much wider class of beneficiary than the class to which the amendment relates, and I therefore have to advise my hon. Friends not to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I had not proposed to intervene until I heard the words of the Financial Secretary. So outraged was I by his callous indifference and by the flimsy nature of

his arguments that I felt obliged to rise to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.<br/>
One might have accepted from practically any hon. or right hon. Gentleman on the Government benches other than the Financial Secretary the stringent criticism which he made of the technical defects of the amendment. Had we in Committee or on Report been aware that the Financial Secretary had even a glimmering of understanding of the technicalities of his own Bill, we might have been able to accept that criticism. But the notes that passed to and from the Box and rained on him like confetti&#x2014;with which he has grappled with manly incompetence&#x2014;convince me and my hon. Friends that he and the Chancellor, of all members of the Treasury Front Bench, have not condescended to master the technicalities of the Bill, and when he tells us that this well-conceived, modest, charitable amendment is so grossly technically defective, and pours ridicule on it and its authors, I am moved to intervene.<br/>
The Financial Secretary made great play of the fact that the Bill, for the first time, introduces total exemption from tax for transfers between husband and wife or wife and husband. That is the one redeeming feature of this odious tax. However, mere concentration of that feature will not commend the tax either to the Opposition or to the country.<br/>
The Financial Secretary is clearly busy mastering his brief for the next set of amendments. The House would appreciate a little more courtesy from him and more concentration on the arguments addressed to him. His present stony indifference suggests to us that, far from listening to our argument, he and his hon. and right hon. Friends had made up their minds on this important question long before my right hon. and learned Friend moved the amendment. The Financial Secretary does not appear to appreciate that homes stand in a special category. They are not like other assets. Indeed, his hon. and right hon. Friends recognised that when they conceded a measure of relief yesterday for historic homes.<br/>
4.45 p.m.<br/>
We have the bizarre situation, which gives the lie to the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Cornwall,


North (Mr. Pardoe), that a person buying Blenheim Palace may obtain a measure of exemption from capital transfer tax but a person buying a modest home in Hampstead or Highgate&#x2014;to which the hon. Gentleman referred during the watches of the night upstairs&#x2014;will obtain no exemption. It is not that I feel particularly tender of the interests of the spokesman for the Liberal Party, but I am moved to add my voice to that of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell). It may be that, at the margin, if the amendment were accepted some people might be moved to take advantage of it in a way in which the Financial Secretary and his hon. and right hon. Friends who prefer to live in rented accommodation would find unattractive.<br/>
I do not believe that one should judge these grave issues by such paltry considerations. We must take a broad view of fiscal matters. That is what the country elects us to the House to do. We must not concentrate on them the dogged gaze of the tax collector. In saying that, I intend no disrespect to that honourable and dutiful body of men. They have their duty and we have ours. Our duty is to look in a broad, farseeing, generous spirit at the fiscal measures which the Government put before us.<br/>
If a precedent is needed for this measure I remind the Financial Secretary that a special measure of relief from capital gains tax is given to those who sell their homes. If the Financial Secretary is looking for a precedent, I see no reason why a similar definition should not be inserted in the Bill.<br/>
There will be many situations in which the imposition of capital transfer tax on the death of the home owner will entirely disrupt family life. Transfers between husband and wife have been covered, but there are many widows and widowers who maintain a family home to whom the benefit of that exemption will not be available.<br/>
The Financial Secretary will say that there is relief for the first &#x00A3;15,000. I am sorry to have to tell him that in the South-East, in the part of the world which I have the privilege of representing, &#x00A3;15,000 will buy a house but not much more. It will not buy the chattels and furnishings

necessary to keep the house going, and family capital invested in real estate will be so much dead capital. It cannot readily be realised or cut up and offered to the tax gatherer. I foresee that as a consequence of this ill-conceived measure a number of family homes, in circumstances of great melancholy, will have to be sold. I hope that that will rest on the conscience of the Financial Secretary and the Chief Secretary. It obviously will not rest on the conscience of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, because we know that in these matters he is conscienceless. His personal convictions are too well known for me to comment on them.<br/>
It is interesting to note that often the cut-off point for relief is just sufficient to allow relief to Ministers on the Treasury Front Bench who have a house in Highgate, one in Sussex and a few more chattels, but for those who just transgress that limit there is no mercy. In the fullness of time they may be receiving considerable sums from the Press and, although it may be too late their attitude will alter. I ask the Financial Secretary to search his conscience once again and to allow full rein to the generosity that peeped through on occasions&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am saying that it is a curious coincidence. The Financial Secretary can rebut this if he likes.

<p>If the Chancellor had paid the House the courtesy of coming more often to listen to our debates, he would not perhaps have derived the wrong impression from my remark. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer."] I shall answer in my own way and in due time the challenge which the Chancellor put to me. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer the Chair."] I shall direct my remarks to the Chair. The Chancellor&#x2014;who, if I may say so, is never hesitant in making personal attacks on whoever happens to be speaking from the Opposition Front Bench&#x2014;is showing undue sensitivity. Since he feels slighted by my remarks, I hope that in future he will exercise a litte more discretion and self-restraint.<br/>
I do not happen to know the Chancellor's financial circumstances, except to the extent that he has disclosed them to the Press. We know that he has a house in a somewhat favoured part of North London and a house in the country. We do not know whether he has a family business. All I was saying was that if he had a family business, he might have thought a little more carefully about the level of tax he has imposed. He seems to be quite unconscious of the damage he will inflict on a great number of family businesses, farms and woodlands.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is within the recollection of the House that in the earlier part of the speech made by the hon. and learned Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees), in the context of the amendment with which he was dealing, he referred to property that I own. Perhaps he gave the impression that I had spoken on the amendment because it was relevant to the price and value of the property that I own. I do not believe that was said in an offensive spirit. I do not believe that there was anything more offensive in what he said about the Chancellor of the Exchequer than in what he said about me. The Chancellor is being unnecessarily sensitive.

If Treasury Ministers owned family businesses, farms or woodlands, they might have been a little more sensitive to the damage which they will inflict. I shall not be deterred by a flurry of indignation from the Financial Secretary. We had to endure him for five weeks in Committee upstairs&#x2014;</p>

<p>Of course I realise that because of my inexperience and my inept use of language, I frequently blunder. I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for the guidance which you have given to me. If in any way I have trodden on or affronted the sensibilities of the Chancellor or of the Financial Secretary, of course I unhesitatingly withdraw. I have tried to explain that.</p>

<p>Although the House may long ago have lost the thread of my discourse, I was addressing myself to the amendment.</p>

<p>Just as the Opposition have uncovered, not for the first time, the sensitivities of the Government Front Bench, so the Opposition also have their sensitivities. Our sensitivities are for the continuance of family life. That is the point of my brief intervention, which was slightly prolonged. I was prompted to speak by the intemperate remarks of the Financial Secretary.<br/>
The Opposition are concerned to maintain the continuance of family life, and that is the argument behind the amendment. I believe that the Financial Secretary should rise above his indignation, ignore the technical defects, and accept it with as much a good grace as he can now muster.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Howell) has implied that the delay in the proceedings was due to the ill humour of the Treasury Bench, whereas it was at your specific request and command, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the hon. and learned Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees) withdrew his totally unfounded imputation.</p>

<p>I shall do that, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I did not intend to delay the House. But I think that Ministers should be a little less sensitive about this matter.<br/>
I was referring to the considerable importance of the amendment and to our desire to secure the family home from the onward march of this tax and Socialist

policy. The Financial Secretary rested much of his defence or rejection of the argument on the repeated claim of the Chancellor, the Chief Secretary, and the Financial Secretary that this legislation exempted the spouse and was an improvement on what had gone before. None of us has been churlish enough to deny that.<br/>
It is worth pointing out that if the spouse owns any assets, there will be a powerful incentive for the husband or wife to leave assets in a way which will leave less to the spouse and more to the children in order to minimise the capital transfer tax so that only in a case where the spouse has very little property will the benefit claimed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer work. Like so many of these other examples, it depends on the circumstances and the details.<br/>
I hope that neither the Chief Secretary nor the Financial Secretary will suggest that, if that advice is followed in the case of the spouse and the husband leaves assets not entirely to the spouse in order to minimise the liability to CTT, that should be described as a loophole, though I have no doubt that it will be so described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We gain the impression sometimes that in the right hon. Gentleman's view life is a loophole to escape death. That seems to be his attitude about estate duty&#x2014;that anyone ill-judged enough not to die and who hands on during his life avoids death duty by doddering through a loophole. That is an absurd concept of taxation which we reject.<br/>
As for the amendment, the Financial Secretary made play with the point about there being no upper limit proposed. If he prefers an upper limit, there is a later amendment to Schedule 6, although it has not been selected, which would put an upper limit on the residence of &#x00A3;25,000. If the Government think that that is the right way to go about it, I have no doubt that they can submit a manuscript amendment which may find favour with the Chair for debate later. I hope also that that later amendment will stand up to the very proper grammatical demands of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell).<br/>
If the Government were interested in preserving quite modest family homes from this tax and in preventing people


from having to sell homes and the furniture in them in order to meet the tax, they could accept such an amendment. However, they have indicated that they are not interested in doing that. They are interested in smashing up family homes and preventing them and the furniture in them from being passed on. They will cause much misery and suffer</p>

No. 56, in line 25, after 'transferee', insert:
<q>'Provided always that the transferor and the transferee or, when appropriate, the personal representatives of either of them, may within two years of the date of a chargeable transfer, Jointly state by notice in writing to the Board that one or the other shall be primarily liable, in which event the other shall be discharged from all liability unless and until the one made primarily liable shall fail to pay the tax assessed on him;'.</q>

<p>This is a paving amendment to Amendment No. 56. I hope that this will be a briefer debate than the last one. Now that the Chancellor has left the Chamber it will be a much more courteous debate. What is at issue is a problem that we came up against in Standing Committee. Unfortunately it was not satisfactorily resolved on that occasion. I do not think that there is any fundamental difference between the two sides of the House on this issue. What is wrong with the Bill as it stands and what the amendments seek to put right is that the Bill is not precisely as

the Government intend it to be. If we can we intend to persuade the Government to accept these amendments and so to put the Bill right.<br/>
The question is whether the liability for paying tax rests with the donor or with the donee or whether it is the Government's intention&#x2014;and we believe this is necessary&#x2014;that the two parties to a transfer shall have the right to elect which one will bear the tax. At first sight it may seem relatively unimportant whether the tax is paid by the donor or by the donee. In terms of a single transfer the same amount of tax will be payable either way. In fact, it is very important whether the donor or the donee pays the tax. Under Schedule 4 the donee can pay by either eight annual or 16 half-yearly instalments with no interest payments if he pays on the due date, whereas the donor has no right to spread his payment of the tax over eight years. That makes a big difference.<br/>
The difference between whether the donor or the donee pays the tax is further increased because of the &#x00A3;1,000 exemption. If the donor pays, and he has to pay in one year, he receives only the &#x00A3;1,000 exemption, whereas if the donee pays he can spread the payments over eight years and he will have an &#x00A3;8,000 exemption. It is a matter of considerable importance whether the donee can elect to pay the tax.<br/>
As I have said, this matter was discussed in Standing Committee. On 12th February, which was one of the days on which the matter was discussed, the Financial Secretary said:
<q>As regards the grossing up provisions, it is immaterial when the transferee and the transferor make the agreement between them, if they do make such an agreement, as to where the burden of the tax shall fall. In the absence of any agreement, it falls on


the transferor, and recourse is had to him until his assets are exhausted. The hon. Gentleman</q>
&#x2014;the Financial Secretary was referring to me&#x2014;
<q>is quite right. But that presumption can be rebutted if there is an agreement between the transferor and the transferee that the transferee shall pay the tax."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 12th February 1975; c. 1336.]</q>
We are seeking to make it clear that there is the possibility of such an agreement. Clearly that is the Government's intention. On 17th February the Chancellor, rather surprisingly, made a statement to the <i>Daily Express</i> rather than to the House. I refer to the article which appeared on 18th February. I shall not read it at length, but there was a section headed "Spreading the payments". The Chancellor was asked:
<q>Suppose I own a filling station or a shop valued at, say, &#x00A3;50,000. I give it to my son. How much tax must be paid and&#x2014;assuming there are no other assets&#x2014;would the filling station or shop have to be sold to pay the tax?</q>
The Chancellor replied:
<q>The tax cannot be spread in this way if you are paying it, but, provided your son undertakes the responsibility of paying the tax, you can, in practice, get the benefit of the instalment arrangement by making a gift to him of the amount of each tax instalment as it becomes due, which he can then pass on to the Revenue.</q>
That is very important. It is slightly surprising, but we understand that the Chancellor does not feel up to facing the interrogation of my hon. Friends in the Chamber; it seems that he is prepared to answer only questions put by the reporter from the <i>Daily Express.</i> But we are grateful for his answers.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend says, "They are wrong." However, I think that we must take it that the Chancellor intended to do this. There is nothing in the Bill which makes the position clear. This was conceded by the hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), a distinguished lawyer, who said, when the point was raised,
<q>The hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) was, I think, on a good point when he asserted that there was nothing in the Bill to state that one could elect as between donor and donee. My understanding also was that the

liability was a joint and several liability, according to the Bill".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 12th February 1975; c. 1344.]</q>
That is how the Bill is drafted. We had hoped that there would be an amendment, but there is no amendment other than that which we are now discussing.<br/>
This is an important matter because it affects the amount of tax that is payable and the time over which it is paid in view of the &#x00A3;1,000-a-year exemption over the period. If it is not clear that the donor or the donee can elect who is to pay, the Revenue will be able to go for the tax against the donor and get the money in one year instead of eight years and, indeed, get more money that way. Clearly, that was not the Government's intention, as was made abundantly plain by the Chancellor's answer in the <i>Daily Express,</i> which I am sure the Government will wish to honour, but which has not been honoured in the Bill.<br/>
There is another point about the Chancellor's interview which is reported in the <i>Daily Express.</i> The right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;I will repeat this section&#x2014;said:
<q>&#x2026; you can, in practice, get the benefit of the instalment arrangement by making a gift to him of the amount of each tax instalment as it becomes due, which he can then pass on to the Revenue.</q>
Hon. Gentlemen opposite may not appreciate that there is some curiosity about this point. It would appear that if a father passes money to the son to pay the instalment of tax, that instalment will be liable to capital transfer tax. Therefore, he will not be able to pass it on to the Revenue.<br/>
Therefore, we have put down Amendment No. 153, which is being discussed with this group of amendments, which ensures that no capital transfer tax will be payable on payments made by the transferor to the transferee to enable the transferee to pass them on to the Revenue. That appeared to be what the Chancellor was saying in the <i>Daily Express</i> interview. We wish to allow him to keep faith with what he said there. Despite the performance that we have witnessed recently, we believe that the Chancellor will wish to keep faith with what is printed in the <i>Daily Express.</i> We had various other debates in which it was clear that that was the sense of what the Government intended.<br/>
Finally, in commending the amendment to the House and hoping that the Government will accept it because it fulfils what clearly is their intention, I point out that the rates for this tax are very high. The Government have sought to reduce those rates, but the reduction is not very great. When the rates first came out, the tax payable on the transfer of a business with a net value of &#x00A3;250,000, according to a Written Answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for St. Marylebone (Mr. Baker) by the Financial Secretary, worked out at roughly 117 per cent. When the new lifetime scheme was introduced, which reduced the rates, which the Government accepted were too high, the tax payable on a business worth &#x00A3;250,000 seemingly&#x2014;again this appears in a Written Answer by the Financial Secretary to me on 21st February&#x2014;went down to 74 per cent., which was a very big drop.<br/>
When I asked, in a further Written Question, to which the hon. Gentleman gave a Written Answer on the same day, 21st February, what would happen if capital gains tax were included, assuming, looking to the future, that the business had been held for 25 years and that there had been inflation at 10 per cent. per annum and during that time the business had merely maintained its value in real terms&#x2014;in other words, had gone up by 10 per cent. per annum in money terms but was worth no more&#x2014;the amount of tax payable as a proportion of the asset transferred was given as 121 per cent. That is a staggeringly high figure, which the Government originally conceded was too high, which gives the lie to another of the Chancellor's remarks about the rates being no higher than estate duty.<br/>
Under the old estate duty, during lifetime one paid capital gains tax on disposal, not estate duty, and on death one had estate duty, not capital gains tax. However, under the Government's proposals we have both taxes both in lifetime and on death. Therefore, what the Chancellor has been saying <i>ad nauseam</i> about the rates of tax being no higher than the old estate duty is sheer nonsense. That can be put down only to his ignorance of the tax which he is nominally fathering. Therefore, anything which can minimise the savage impact of this tax is important.<br/>
The amendment would seem technical, but, if accepted&#x2014;I am sure that the Government's intention is that it should be accepted and that there should be a right of election whether the donor or the donee should pay&#x2014;it would slightly mitigate the severity of the tax. I hope that the amendment will be accepted without a Division.</p>

<p>How calm and pleasant the atmosphere has become now that the Chancellor has again left the Chamber. I hope that he will not attend our debates too often because he generates more heat than light. Whenever the right hon. Gentleman has talked about this tax he has revealed his total lack of comprehension of it. It is all good, clean fun in the House of Commons, but when he starts extending it to the <i>Daily Express</i> it is going too far.<br/>
I must remind the Financial Secretary of what we read in the <i>Daily Express.</i> That paper, unlike Hansard&#x2014;nobody reads <i>Hansard</i>&#x2014;is read by millions of people. The <i>Daily Express</i> has the biggest circulation of any newspaper.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend always puts me right on matters of fact. Referring to this famous shop or garage having been transferred, the Chancellor said that the donor, the transferor, could pay the instalments of tax if the transferee accepted liability for the tax. That is not so. If the transferor pays the instalments they are capital transfers which attract further taxation.<br/>
It is no good saying, as the Chief Secretary said in Committee, that he was not defending the Chancellor and was not interested in his remarks, but merely wanted to talk about the amendment. We want to know how that article, with its terribly misleading statement, appeared under the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Chancellor showed himself woefully ignorant of everything to do with the tax by using his brute force rather than the skill and expertise that we have come to expect from the Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary. We welcome their careful attention to the details of the tax. We wish that the Chancellor would emulate them. The


matter must be cleared up. Is what is reported in the <i>Day Express</i> right?<br/>
I have put down some amendments to meet all the Chancellor's points in the <i>Daily Express</i> article. I am surprised and saddened that his name has not appeared under my name on the amendments, signifying that the Government wish to accept them. I put down amendments all over the Bill. I spent a whole evening working out the legislative implications of the article in the <i>Daily Express</i> and I have drafted the amendments with great care. I am surprised that I have not yet seen the Chancellor's name on my amendments. However, we know that the Treasury is very late in getting its amendments down and is having great difficulty in doing the drafting. Therefore, I am living in hopes that it has not yet got around to it and that the amendments will appear on Monday with the Chancellor's name on them.<br/>
Another worry arises from the amendments. I should like, for the sake of example, to take Mr. Freeman and Mr. Hardy. Mr. Freeman gives Mr. Hardy a sum of money. Shall we say it is shares? Suppose Mr. Freeman gives &#x00A3;100,000 worth of shares in the National Enterprise Board to Mr. Hardy, and two years later Mr. Freeman dies. The original transfer will have been taxed at lifetime transfer rates. The tax liability arose at the time of the transfer, and Mr. Hardy, who received the gift, had agreed to pay the tax. Unfortunately, in those two years the NEB does not do frightfully well and the &#x00A3;100,000 worth of shares which Mr. Hardy received are worth &#x00A3;10,000&#x2014;a likely forecast of how that corporation will proceed. On the death of Mr. Freeman the tax has to be increased because it counts for tax within the three-year period and Mr. Hardy is called upon to pay a far greater sum of tax. Indeed, it may be greater than the amount he has left of the gift that was given to him if he has been foolish enough to invest in the NEB.<br/>
That is a possible set of circumstances, and it is directly relevant to the amendment. It shows how iniquitous is a tax when somebody who is a recipient of a gift carries a liability of unknown dimensions till such time as three years are up. In no sense, under estate duty, did anybody

carry this liability, because the assessment to tax was on the value of the estate at the time that the transferor died, whereas in the case of an earlier death the liability to tax arises two years before and the valuation is taken then.<br/>
This is an example of a gross injustice, and the amendment would go a long way to meeting it. If the Financial Secretary is not keen on the amendment will he consider that at any time when there is a death after a lifetime transfer, a death within a three-year period following a lifetime transfer, the person who is liable to pay the tax can elect to pay the tax either on the value at the time of the transfer, or on the value at the time of the death? That election is not possible under the Bill at present&#x2014;if we know how the Bill is at present, which, of course, we do not, but perhaps there are some who do. But it does not seem to be possible, and it is very unfair and onerous that it should be so.<br/>
It is the sort of point which the Government should deal with on the next Finance Bill. We have not long to wait for that&#x2014;next month, I think&#x2014;and we shall be looking for about 100 new clauses to tidy up this tax. Could one of them be that the taxpayer has the right to elect for payment if he is made responsible for paying the tax either at the value pertaining at the time of the transfer or for payment at the time of the death which caused him to go into the death rate rather than the lifetime gift rate?<br/>
This potential tax liability, now that the lifetime concession has been made, is the most obnoxious feature of the tax. I suppose it was inevitable in a tax which was originally drafted on the basis of a flat rate of tax whether one died or gave property during one's lifetime. The switch to a lifetime concession, welcome though it is, has raised a whole series of complicated problems at the margin, which is another reason why it would have been better if the Government had taken away the tax and put it to a Select Committee for proper consideration.<br/>
As the Government are obstinate and stubborn and will not do that, will they address themselves to the point that it is necessary to allow an election as I have described? Otherwise there could be cases of real unfairness and hardship


Being given something by somebody could result in a person being bankrupted by having to pay taxes on a totally unrealistic valuation when the money is no longer there simply because somebody else dies. That, surely, cannot be the intention of the Government.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Members for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) and Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) that the atmosphere has calmed considerably, though it has happened for reasons quite different from those put forward by the hon. Gentlemen.<br/>
The hon. Member for Blaby addressed himself to Amendments Nos. 56 and 153. The debate has centred around those two amendments, and in the interests of despatch, which I think is what the Opposition want, I shall confine myself to dealing with them.<br/>
Amendment No. 56 would give the transferor and the transferee the right between them to decide which of them should be primarily liable to the Revenue for the tax on a lifetime gift. Clause 25(2), to which Amendment No. 56 attaches, imposes a liability on both the transferor and the transferee. As between the transferor and the transferee the clause lays down no rules as to priority. Each of them is liable for the whole tax, except in so far as the position is modified by Clause 27(5) which postpones the transferee's liability until it becomes overdue. This is normally a period of six months, but there is a Government amendment to extend that period in certain cases.<br/>
Clause 25, to which Amendment No. 56 attaches, is concerned with identifying the persons from whom the Revenue can collect the tax. It is not concerned with who bears the tax at the end of the day. That is a matter which the transferor and the transferee are already free to decide between them, and the effect of their arrangements must, of course, affect the quantum of the gift and, consequently, the amount of tax that will be chargeable.<br/>
Since the transferor and the transferee are free to decide who will bear the tax and thus, in effect, to decide whether the grossing up provision should come into effect, and whether we are talking about a gross or net gift, there is no good reason

for giving them the further right by agreement in effect to limit the powers of the Revenue to collect the tax. Let me explain how that consequence would come about.<br/>
The transferee might be overseas, and the Revenue might within a period of a couple of years allowed by the amendment have already embarked upon proceedings to collect the tax from the transferor. At some subsequent time just before the end of two years the transferor and the transferee may say that it is not the transferor but the transferee who should pay the tax. That would put the Revenue back to precisely where it started, and might make its claim unenforceable.</p>

<p>That problem could be met by the fact that election of who is to be liable has to be made at the time of the transfer. There is no problem of something happening later. The problem that is worrying us is that, in the Bill as drafted, if the transferee decides that it will be paid by him in eight yearly instalments and in the first year he pays one-eighth, but the Revenue decides that it wants the other seven-eighths that year and that the transferor is liable, the charge will go to him. Therefore, the privilege of spreading the payment over eight years which the Chancellor showed in his <i>Daily Express</i> article, was intended, will have been removed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1822.1" hansard_membership_id="2362" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15243" speakername="Dr. Gilbert" colnum="1822" time="">
<p>The hon. Member for Blaby is under a misapprehension. If the right exists for the tax to be paid by eight annual instalments, that right remains. There will be no question whatever of the Revenue suddenly saying in the middle of that process, "We want it all at once". The hon. Gentleman is putting up an Aunt Sally that does not exist. If that is his concern, I can put his mind at rest.<br/>
The purpose of Amendment No. 153 is to exempt gifts made for the purpose of enabling the donee to pay tax by instalments. The basic principle of the tax is that a gift includes the tax upon it in so far as the grossing up provisions are concerned. There is no difference between an instalment of tax and the whole tax in this respect.<br/>
In logic, if we were to concede the principle that an instalment of tax should be


free of the grossing-up provisions we should have to extend the principle to the whole tax. This would mean that the principle that the gift includes the tax upon it could be entirely sidestepped, if the donor made his gift on terms that the donee should bear the tax and then gave him money with which to pay the tax and that was not taxable.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) made a good point when he referred to the case of a death after a lifetime transfer of the assets which subsequently had a different value. There could be difficulties there and I certainly give him the undertaking he sought, that I will see whether any relief can be found to meet his anxieties.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Financial Secretary. Could he tell hon. Members what he will do about the article in the <i>Daily Express</i> when the point of the amendment, which he denied, was put forward as policy by the Chancellor under his own name? If he does not have a copy of that article I am sure he can be provided with one.</p>

<p>I wish to address myself briefly to Amendment No. 56, which might appear to be technical in form and content but which raises a point of considerable importance. Since the Financial Secretary says that he has not had time to deal with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) I hope he will do the House the courtesy of listening to other interventions on this point.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has singularly failed to appreciate the genuine concern of Conservative Members about this matter. The quantum of tax is different depending on whether it is paid by the transferor or the transferee. This is the first time that this provision has been implemented under the British fiscal system. The Revenue will be tempted to look first to the transferor. Indeed, the primary liability, as we were told in Committee, rests with the transferor. There should be some "let out"&#x2014;I am sure that will be expanded to mean a loophole by the Government benches&#x2014;for the taxpayer. The taxpayer should be given the right to elect who should pay the tax. The Financial Secretary has

said that who bears the tax is a matter for decision between the transferor and the transferee but according to the Bill that is not so.<br/>
The Revenue could decide to proceed against the transferor because it will get a larger measure of tax on a lifetime gift and it is possible that it will pursue that through the courts. It would be idle for the transferee to say "But we have agreed between ourselves that the transferee should bear the tax", it being a lesser amount, because the Financial Secretary's minions would then say "Ah, but the prime responsibility rests with the transferor and we are entitled to enforce this charge against the transferor."<br/>
Amendment No. 56 is directed to guard against this situation. Nothing that I have heard from the Financial Secretary reassures me on this point. What prejudice would there be to the Revenue if Amendment No. 56 were adopted? If it were adopted there would be a right of election as between transferor and transferee. The transferee could elect to pay the tax. If the Revenue is unable to collect from him it could go to the transferor. It is a novel principle in English tax law that the quantum of tax from the same transaction differs depending on whether it is collected from the transferor or the transferee. Therefore, it is of crucial importance that those who are likely to be affected should be entitled to opt for the conclusion that will benefit them most.<br/>
The Financial Secretary sought to reassure us in Committee that the Revenue would not endeavour to collect the greater amount of tax from the transferor. However, there will always be that temptation, especially if the transferee is not immediately available. This amendment is to make sure that the fire of the Revenue will be directed, in the first instance, at the transferee. The Revenue's position is protected should it not be able to reach that target. It can then go against the transferor.<br/>
If the Financial Secretary cannot reassure hon. Members on this point we shall be left with the unworthy suspicion that there will be many cases where a larger amount of tax will be collected from the transferor because it suits the Revenue's book and that the interests of the taxpayer will once again go by default.</p>

<p>I should like to speak on this interesting point of principle. There is something quite extraordinary in the grossing-up provision. If there is no grossing-up in a transfer tax of this kind there will be a net tax which will be constant, independent of whether it is paid by the transferor or the transferee. Therefore, the joint wealth of both parties would be reduced exactly by the amount of the tax. However, the moment the grossing-up principle enters into the process of taxation we get, between the net tax on the joint wealth of both parties, a distinction which is different in one circumstance from what it would be in the other. This is the most extraordinary philosophical basis of taxation the House has ever been asked to consider.<br/>
By what extraordinary criterion has this grossing-up provision been introduced into the Government's thinking? By what strange set of criteria do the Government decide that in one case the net wealth of the two parties should be reduced by an amount &#x00A3;X and in another case that it should be reduced by an amount &#x00A3;Y? I am sure that this has been explored in some detail in Committee. However, I, the House and the country would like a little more elaboration from the Chief Secretary of what lies behind the Government's thinking in developing this fiendishly ingenious and fiendishly destructive tax.</p>

<p>I refer to Clause 25(2), which is a complicated subsection. The Opposition may well have understood it correctly, but I believe there is a slight misunderstanding among some Conservative Members when they say that the primary liability falls on the transferor. Clause 25(2) deals with the liability for payment of tax. Subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) says that the persons liable are:
<q>the transferor and the transferee".</q>
They are put together. That means that there is joint and separate liability on the transferor and transferee. That is legal language.<br/>
Leaving aside grossing-up and the complications following from that it means that the transferor and transferee can get together and pay the whole amount of tax or the transferor can pay the tax. If the transferor pays the tax

he discharges the full, several or separate liabilities. If the transferee pays the tax he discharges the full liability.<br/>
6.0 p.m.<br/>
So it is not a case, I should have thought, of the Revenue being able first of all to go against the transferor, because if the transferee discharges the full liability, the separate or several liability has been discharged and the whole of the tax has been paid. If the tax has been paid by the transferee the gross income does not apply. If, on the other hand, it is paid by the transferor&#x2014;again, discharging the whole liability by himself&#x2014;then the grossing-up provisions do apply.<br/>
I am glad that my hon. Friend mentioned instalments. Where there is some difficulty is where the transferee decides to pay the tax, but over eight years. In the first year only one-eighth of that joint and several liability has been discharged, and grossing-up does not apply to that one-eighth. But what about the second, third and fourth years? Presumably, if the transferee pays the tax in the second year, again grossing-up does not apply. The transferor cannot discharge the tax in the second year, presumably, because he is not allowed to pay by instalments.<br/>
I understand the principle of the joint and several liability, but if my hon. Friend says that the Revenue would not go back against a transferor in the case of a payment by instalment I should have thought that sufficient to satisfy the Opposition. There is some difficulty here. Because the transferor is not entitled to pay by instalments and because there is a spreading over eight years, one can see some difficulty in theory.<br/>
I am happy to abide by the assurances that we have had, and I hope that the Opposition will do the same, but it is not a question of a primary liability on the transferor: it is a joint and several liability which either party could fulfil completely.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), who made a notable contribution in Committee on this point and in many other parts of our debates, have put their finger precisely on the difficulty and the apparent conflict in the Bill. It has been said many times&#x2014;I have here a particular example when the Financial


Secretary said it, but the Chancellor has, too&#x2014;that this is a donor- or transferor-based tax and that the primary liability is laid on the donor. In case there is any doubt, the Financial Secretary said in Committee that
<q>the primary liability &#x2026; is laid upon the donor".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A;</i> 12th February 1974, c. 1347.]</q>
This is clear.<br/>
Treasury Ministers have made some play with the importance of the principle that the donor is liable to pay the tax. I do not see how there can be any ambiguity about what the Financial Secretary and the Chief Secretary believe to be the central principle of the Bill. If the Bill becomes an Act, no doubt that is the principle upon which those who seek to collect and levy the tax will base all their calculations. To be fair, without any amendment or clarification of this point, they would be right to do so.<br/>
That is the present position. In case not every hon. Member has been able to follow all the appalling ins and outs of the tax, let us make it clear what an important principle this is. If the donor pays, we know that the grossing-up takes place and the tax itself, as well as the amount, is a chargeable transfer. We know that he will be paying anyway in relation to any previous gifts that he has made, so the accumulating principle will come into play. We know that, when the donor pays, he will not be allowed&#x2014;so both Ministers have told us&#x2014;to pay by instalments, nor will he have any of the other rights regarding interest and so on. It will literally be the difference between the gift, particularly if it is a family firm or a farm, being smashed up or sold to another firm, or remaining intact. That is a crucial difference, affecting the jobs and interests not just of the transferor, the proprietor or farmer, but of all the workpeople who derive their livelihood from that concern. It matters intensely that we get this matter right, and we cannot let it rest until we do.<br/>
It should be made clear in the Bill that there is a right of election. Both the Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary have got a little confused&#x2014;who can blame them, with all the complexities of this matter?&#x2014;and the donor liability

point which they have made several times is not entirely right. What they mean is that an election is necessary. We have that on high authority. The Chancellor said explicitly in the <i>Daily Express</i> that that was the situation.<br/>
I make no apology for quoting the Chancellor's words yet again, because they are explicit and they reinforce precisely the point that there is an election, there is freedom to choose, whether the donor or the donee shall pay. If that is so, we say that that situation should be reinforced in the Bill. The Chancellor said:
<q>The tax cannot be spread in this way if you are paying it, but provided your son undertakes the responsibility of paying the tax you can in practice get the benefit of the instalment arrangement by making a gift to him of the amount of each tax instalment as it becomes due, which he can then pass on to the Revenue.</q>
That is an absolutely explicit and clear statement which the Chancellor is entitled to make.<br/>
I know that there may be some small print or things unsaid which may be brought into play to suggest that perhaps that example is rather special, but the ordinary reader&#x2014;indeed, the reader who is familiar with the ins and outs of the tax, like my right hon. and hon. Friends who have studied the matter closely&#x2014;can draw only one general and crystal-clear conclusion. It is that there is a freedom to choose between the donor and the donee paying.<br/>
The reason that it matters so crucially is precisely that, as the hon. Member for Llanelli has so clearly said and as my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) has said, ambiguity is bound to arise, if, after a year, an instalment is paid by the donee and the Revenue, taking their lead from the Financial Secretary and the Chief Secretary, and reading that, apparently, the Bill unamended&#x2014;or the Financial Secretary's interpretation of it&#x2014;still insists that the primary liability is on the donor, will proceed, rightly, in its professional capacity to collect the revenue due from the donor. When it does so, of course, it will be getting much more revenue much sooner than it would if the instalments were paid ungrossed-up by the donee.<br/>
It is important that we know. It is clear that there is a right of election and


that that election is made in precisely the sort of transaction about which the Chancellor was talking&#x2014;the garage with a turnover of &#x00A3;50,000, or the shop or farm with a turnover of &#x00A3;100,000, or any small business employing 20 or 30 people.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1829.0" hansard_membership_id="11415" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30568" speakername="Mr. Ridley" colnum="1829" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend should not mention a garage. A garage might not be exempt to permit payment by instalments under the schedule. It is only land and private company shares on which the tax can be paid in instalments, and a garage or shop is a very bad example because it might not fall into either category.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1829.1" hansard_membership_id="6027" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29045" speakername="Mr. Howell" colnum="1829" time="">
<p>That may be so, but my hon. Friend will see from the following paragraph that there are further definitions. I would join him in being confused, as paragraph after paragraph makes qualifications about what is exempt and what is not, but it may be that businesses, of which a garage can be described as one, are included. I sympathise with him in being unclear about what is and what is not excluded.<br/>
The basic issue is, either the Chancellor or the Bill is misleading us. There is no middle way. Either there is a right of election and the Chancellor is right when he says that it is possible for the transferor to hand over the instalments&#x2014;no mention of additional grossing-up, and Amendment No. 153 would reinforce the points implied so clearly by the Chancellor that no additional tax is attracted&#x2014;or the Bill, the Financial Secretary and the Chief Secretary are right.<br/>
From the point of view of future management of the tax, I hope that the Chancellor is right, but having watched the other two Ministers struggle over the weeks with their briefs trying to understand the Bill, I hope that they do not have to renege on their oft-repeated undertaking that the primary liability is laid upon the donor. One or other must be the position.<br/>
I would ask whether it were possible for the Financial Secretary to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to try to explain, with the leave of the House, this matter to us once more to clarify it. This is important. The hon. Member for Llanelli has emphasised, with his great experience and skill in these matters, what confusion exists. If it were possible for

the Financial Secretary to intervene again in the debate, with the leave of the House, that would help matters.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1830.0" hansard_membership_id="2362" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15243" speakername="Dr. Gilbert" colnum="1830" time="">
<p>I was hoping to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. With the leave of the House, may I say that I am grateful to the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Howell) for his invitation. I shall see what I can do to clear up the difficulties.<br/>
First, perhaps I may address myself to one or two of the general points made by the hon. and learned Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees). He suggests that this tax involves a novel principle and that the quantum of tax will vary according to who pays the tax on the same transaction. But they are quite different transactions, depending on who pays the tax. I am glad to see the assent of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell). That is the whole principle of grossing-up.<br/>
The hon. Member for Havant and Waterloo (Mr. Lloyd) was not, unfortunately, with us in Standing Committee. We missed his good nature there. Quite understandably, he did not have the advantage&#x2014;if I may so put it&#x2014;of our discussions there. He talked about the distinction between the tax on the joint wealth of both parties. The whole purpose of the tax is to distinguish between the wealth of the parties separately. This is a tax on a transfer from one individual to another.<br/>
I rather gathered that the hon. Gentleman thought that the whole principle of grossing-up was a totally novel concept in English tax law. I am sure he will be the first to recognise and acknowledge that the principle of grossing-up is provided in relation to estate duty. If someone were to be given something entirely free of estate duty, different consequences would apply if the beneficiary were to be paying the tax. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's acknowledgement of that.<br/>
I turn to some of the technical difficulties involved here Not for the first time, my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) has it absolutely right, as I understood him, and he put it much more lucidly than I ever could. But I think that I could go a little beyond what he said. He rightly points


out that under Clause 25(2) the transferor and the transferee are the persons liable. If, however, one looks forward to Clause 27(5), on page 22, one sees that
<q>Where a person is liable for any tax &#x2026; under subsection (2) of section 25 of this Act otherwise than as transferor</q>
&#x2014;in other words, if it is the transferee&#x2014;
<q>he shall be liable only if the tax remains unpaid after it ought to have been paid.</q>
In other words, I had in mind when the tax is overdue&#x2014;and, as I said earlier, this will normally be six months after the due date or, I should says, six months after the end of the months in which the transfer is made.<br/>
I say to the hon. Member for Guildford that when I said that the transferor is primarily liable, I meant that for the first six months until the tax becomes overdue it is the transferor who is liable and then subsequently, after the option of Clause 27(5) comes into effect, they are jointly liable.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1831.0" hansard_membership_id="1659" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30586" speakername="Mr. Lawson" colnum="1831" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman does not meet the point. What subsection (5) is concerned about is to protect the transferee from having to pay the tax in certain circumstances. It obviously does not protect the transferor. What we are concerned about is the point that the hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) made and the point that I have made in moving the amendment. It is the one point at issue here. How can we be sure in the Bill as it is drafted&#x2014;I do not believe that we can be sure&#x2014;that if, after one yearly instalment of the eight is paid by the transferee, there is not immediate recourse by the Revenue to the transferor for the whole of the remainder?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1831.1" hansard_membership_id="2362" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15243" speakername="Dr. Gilbert" colnum="1831" time="">
<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman is on to a different point. I shall try to come to that shortly. We ought to get this absolutely clear. As far as the first six months are concerned, the liability is on the settlor as the result of the operation of Clause 27(5). Subsequently there is the joint liability on the transferor and the transferee under Clause 25(2).<br/>
Nothing in the operation of Clause 27(5) excludes, as I understand it, an arrangement whereby the transferee

should pay the tax. It would, therefore be a net gift rather than a grossed-up gift within the first six months. The option is always there as between the transferor and the transferee. As I said in my original remarks, they are already free to decide who is to bear the tax. Clause 25(2) lays down no order of priority. Each of them is liable to the whole tax, but the amount of the tax will depend on who pays it.<br/>
6.15 p.m.<br/>
I come now to the point raised about instalments. As I understand the situation, if the transferee takes advantage of the instalment provisions under Schedule 4, paragraph 13(5)(<i>a</i>), and pays the first instalment properly and then subsequently, shall we say, it is impossible for the Revenue to collect from him, for whatever reasons, the right to pay by instalment is not affected by that, even though the Revenue's rights revert back to the transferor. But in those circumstances a higher rate of tax would be involved because if the tax was no longer being paid by the transferee the grossing-up effects would apply to that proportion of the tax which was unpaid.<br/>
We had a detailed discussion in Committee about how one calculated the grossing-up provisions with regard to the unpaid portion of the tax when the transferee had started paying and then, after a period, it had become impossible for him to pay any longer and the transferor would take up the payments.</p>

<p>I see the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make, but it appears to contradict flatly what the Chancellor said in his prepared reply in the <i>Daily Express.</i> He makes no mention of an additional tax being allowable if the transferee starts paying instalments. There is no mention of that. How can it be that both the Chancellor and the Financial Secretary are right? It does not make sense.</p>

<p>By the leave of the House, I am trying to assist the House. I think I have given an accurate exposition of the matter. The hon. Gentleman has me at a disadvantage. I do not have that newspaper article in front of me. I do not think it is helpful to bandy newspaper articles about at present. I have gone


carefully through the effects of Clauses 25 ad 22 and Schedule 4 and I think that I have made matters clear.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1833.0" hansard_membership_id="1659" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30586" speakername="Mr. Lawson" colnum="1833" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman says that if the transferee pays one instalment and then the Revenue cannot collect any more from the transferee because the transferee refuses to pay, the Revenue can go to the transferor. What we are concerned about is the Revenue going to the transferor simply because there is a liability all the time with the transferor even though the transferee may be well content to pay the second instalment in the second year, the third instalment in the third year and so on. There is nothing in the Bill to ensure that the Revenue does not seek the tax from the transferor, because they are both liable.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1833.1" hansard_membership_id="2362" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15243" speakername="Dr. Gilbert" colnum="1833" time="">
<p>Again, there is a possible misunderstanding here. I shall look at the matter again. As I am advised, the situation is quite clear. Quite obviously, in situations of this sort different people may come to different interpretations of any statute, and these things are eventually determined by the courts. However, we should prefer to get the matter clear between us across the Floor of the House this afternoon if possible. My explanation does not, apparently, satisfy hon. Members of the Opposition.<br/>
The right to the instalments is enshrined in Schedule 4. That right is available only to the transferee in the first place. Therefore, once it is agreed that the transferee is to be liable and he has begun his payments under Schedule 4, clearly the Revenue will not proceed Against him unless for any reason he is unable to make payments.</p>

<p>May I ask the Financial Secretary to take this as an illustration of the many unresolved difficulties still existing in this legislation? Listening to this matter for the first time, as it were&#x2014;although I have attempted to understand the argument before coming to the debate&#x2014;it is clear that there is here real scope for misunderstanding.<br/>
The hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) draws attention to the importance of the point. There are many comparable points littered throughout this legislation. It is not sufficient to say, if it is humanly

avoidable, "Well, let that be resolved in the courts by litigation in due course." I am sure that the Financial Secretary appreciates this.<br/>
May I have the hon. Gentleman's assurance that in preparing the next Finance Bill, which must now be cooking, he will ensure that attention is given to this and many comparable points? With legislation on a new tax we have no opportunity of putting it right in another place, but we have the opportunity to do so in the next Finance Bill, as the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) pointed out.<br/>
I give notice that we intend to deliver to the Chancellor of the Exchequer a well-intentioned and reasonable schedule of all the remaining outstanding points of importance. I hope to receive the Minister's assurance that serious attention will be given to all those points, otherwise many difficulties will arise for the taxpayers.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his constructive intervention. I accept that there are difficulties. I acknowledge straight away that he has come on to the Opposition Front Bench with his present responsibilities in the middle of a Finance Bill. It must be difficult for him. As one who arrived on the Opposition Front Bench in a junior capacity in the middle of a Budget debate three years ago, I know the sort of difficulties that confront him.<br/>
I accept that difficulties are present in what is an extremely complex piece of legislation, as all legislation introducing a fundamentally new tax must be. I undertake to consider seriously the memorandum that the right hon. and learned Gentleman proposes to put before my right hon. Friend. I give him that assurance without any reservation.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, may I say that if there were another stage to the Bill we would accept the Financial Secretary's undertaking to look at the matter again, which is roughly what he is saying. But there is no such further stage. All this confirms that we shall approach the next Finance Bill constructively. The present exchange also confirms our belief&#x2014;if it


needed confirming&#x2014;that the Bill is an unholy muddle. Another of the central principles appears to be riddled with ambiguity and shrouded in doubt. I must urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to press Amendment No. 56 in an attempt to get some clarity back into the Bill and to underpin the undertakings of the Chancellor, which appear to need increasing underpinning these days.</p>

<p>Amendment No. 77 and the other Government amendments introduce into the clause a reduced scale of rates for lifetime transfers. If I have the opportunity to catch your eye at the end of the debate, Mr. Speaker, it might be for the convenience of the House if I save my remarks until then.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1843.2" hansard_membership_id="388" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16357" speakername="Sir Geoffrey Howe" colnum="1843" time="">
<p>The pace at which we are moving indicates the constraints under which we are operating. We have now reached the point at which we have an opportunity to consider the quite monstrous and unjustifiable rates at which this ill-designed tax will continue to operate even after the concession contained in Amendment No. 77.<br/>
It is important to bring home to all hon. Members and to people outside this House the grave damage which will be inflicted by the tax on firms and farms, families and thrift. It appears&#x2014;I say this advisedly&#x2014;that even now the Government Front Bench has no comprehension of the scale and nature of the damage it is doing through its tax proposals. I return to the question which has baffled me ever since I began studying these proposals in detail: whether it is more serious to conclude that Ministers know and understand what they are doing and are, therefore, guilty of wilful destruction than it is to conclude that they still do not know and do not understand what they are doing and, therefore, should be subject to a verdict of not guilty by virtue of insanity.<br/>
I shall give an example which could apply to many different industries, companies

and firms. It affects the building industry. Small firms are dominant as they are in the garage trade, in which there are many small garage businesses. There is also the farming industry, and in that context perhaps I should mention egg farming, many representatives of which are currently in the precincts of the House seeking to speak to hon. Members. Those of us who are taking part in the debate may not be able to see our egg farmers in person as they would wish, but I hope they will feel that we are fighting their battle for them in representing their case against the tax.<br/>
Perhaps I may quote the example of a farm worth, say, &#x00A3;100,000&#x2014;a business which has been built up to that value over 25 years. That is by no means a high valuation in terms of small businesses or companies engaged in any of the activites to which I have referred.<br/>
It is, therefore, not an unreasonable example. Let me analyse step by step the effects of the Government's proposals on such an undertaking.<br/>
Let us suppose that a firm of that kind is being disposed of either by death or by gift to another member of the family to whom it is to be passed on. If we understand the Government's intention correctly, there will be payable, first, capital gains tax at the rate of 30 per cent. Under the amendment we are now considering, capital transfer tax will also be payable at a rate, now reduced in the case of a lifetime interest, of 50 per cent. on death. Let it be noted that if the tax is to be paid by the transferor or donor, the grossing-up provision applies and it is assessed on &#x00A3;150,000.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1844.1" hansard_membership_id="388" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16357" speakername="Sir G. Howe" colnum="1844" time="">
<p>It is indeed scandalous. The scale of the scandal is set out in the answers to which we have referred, which cannot be studied too often and which appear at cols. 573 and 574 <i>et seq.</i> of the <i>Official Report</i> of 21st February, that were given to my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson).<br/>
If one contemplates the position shown there under Table 1, which sets out the capital transfer tax and capital gains tax combined as a proportion of the assets transferred on a &#x00A3;100,000 business, one sees the quite astonishing figure of


&#x00A3;106,000, rounded up by a pound or two. On that footing, therefore, the tax payable is in excess of the actual value of the business being transferred. Of course, a substantial element in that sum is represented by capital gains tax, but only by that tax payable on the growth in the cash value of a firm as a result of an assumed rate of inflation of 10 per cent. over 25 years. On that footing one has the absolutely ludicrous situation of tax being exacted in excess of the value of the assets in question. It can only be described as expropriation, as robbery without violence. That is only one of the ways in which one can approach it.<br/>
If one looks at the more generous Table 2 proposals, now the subject of an amendment moved by the Financial Secretary, in the case of somebody transferring as a gift during lifetime one sees that the rate of capital transfer tax is reduced. Even so, for a business of that kind worth &#x00A3;100,000 the cumulative tax payable, as set out in Table 3 of the answers given to my hon. Friend&#x2014;&#x00A3;52,000&#x2014;represents more than one-half of the value of the business in question. I have some questions to ask on that later. How far do the thousands of small business men up and down the country, in spite of all the letters we have been receiving from them, even now appreciate what is meant by that?<br/>
To take another example, that of a business worth &#x00A3;250,000, again under Table 3, the cumulative addition of capital gains tax and capital transfer tax, even on the reduced rate for lifetime transfers, makes the combined tax payable, on the assumptions I have indicated, more than &#x00A3;300,000. If one had not studied these things closely one would not believe one's eyes, one's ears or anything else. It is a wholly fantastic situation and I do not understand how any explanation or exposition from the Government can begin to justify such things.<br/>
Let us look again at the way the Chancellor, in the less-than-candid series of answers he gave in the <i>Daily Express,</i> described the situation of which I have just been speaking, which I hope you will remember, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;a combined rate of more than &#x00A3;300,000 in capital gains tax and capital transfer

tax on a business of &#x00A3;250,000. The Chancellor was asked:
<q>The Confederation of British Industry has said that the tax will damage small firms and therefore employment. How do you answer this charge?</q>
The Chancellor answered:
<q>I do not accept that the tax will have this effect, particularly now that we have reduced the rate on small- and medium-sized gifts. &#x2026; On a gift of &#x00A3;250,000 the lifetime tax will be about two-thirds of the tax on death. We have introduced this relief to help small businesses in particular.</q>
Some help! It is absolutely lunatic. One thing that has been made clear by the amendment that the Financial Secretary has just moved is that the original lifetime rates proposed in the Bill as introduced in this House were far too high. The amendment which the hon. Gentleman is seeking to move is not just an admission of error, an admission that goes nowhere near far enough. It is a confession of gross folly, and it is a pity that the standard by which we have had to judge it is the standard underlying this whole legislation.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
The Government still do not go and have not gone anything like far enough. They have not brought their proposals within 1,000 miles of sanity or justice. Be it noted that the schedule now introduced by the Financial Secretary applies only to lifetime gifts, and then only if the transference between donor and donee is made more than three years before death. The point of Amendment (b) is to reduce the period to make it comparable to that provided for charities, a period of 12 months. Even so, the exemption that the Government are seeking on relief provided in Table 2 is a first step.<br/>
Let us hope that we shall not in any subsequent discussion hear that referred to as a loophole. I would not put it beyond the rather ghoulish characters who have been occupying the Government Front Bench throughout these debates to begin suggesting, in a way suggested earlier but rather differently by my hon. Friend, that in face of this burden of taxation life itself should be regarded as a loophole which ought shortly to be stopped up. That argument would not surprise me. It would not


surprise me if the more benevolent proposals of the second table were merely paving the way for the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) when he finally succeeds to the distinguished position of the Financial Secretary, or even, God forbid, something more distinguished, to stop up even these loopholes.<br/>
Seriously, how is a family business expected to cope? I ask that in a genuine spirit of inquiry. On transferring a business worth &#x00A3;100,000, how does one find &#x00A3;106,000 of tax, even if the cost of doing so is at the new lifetime gift rate? How does one find &#x00A3;52,000 to pay the tax? How does one set about it? These are questions that I am being asked in letter after letter from all over the country. What is the intention in imposing this extraordinary and destructive burden on such businesses?<br/>
Amendments (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>), standing in the names of my right hon. Friends and myself, would offer some relief from that burden though probably still nothing like enough; but they are an attempt to improve the horrors that confront us. Of course it is true that similar problems could have arisen when we were facing only estate duty but&#x2014;let the Financial Secretary hold his peace&#x2014;they seldom did because of the existence, under provisions carefully worked out by advisers of the calibre of the Chief Secretary, who is not now with us, of trusts and other arrangements.<br/>
By those means businesses and farms were able to pass from one generation of a family to the next and to survive and prosper. By those means businesses and farms grew, prospered and created jobs and wealth for people in the communities in which they lived, creating wealth of all kinds for the community. That desirable effect, apparently, is said to be a loophole. It is the survival kit within the pattern of estate duty that is to be snatched from small farms and businesses and others, since it is identified as a loophole.<br/>
It is uncomprehending rubbish for that to be described as a loophole. The existence of continued capacity to make arrangements of that kind is the result of conscious decisions of successive Chancellors in face of the nature of estate duty to allow successful enterprise of that

kind to continue to exist. It is wholly destructive to seek to stop up that so-called loophole.<br/>
Now that that is intended, I ask again not merely how business men, businesses and farmers are intended to cope, but what is the purpose of the change projected by the Government in relation to those businesses? What will be its effect? I can see only one way in which the situation can be met. The effect is bound to be to compel the sale in whole or in part of thousands of successful, thriving enterprises. One asks, sold to whom? They will be sold to giant public corporations if they, in face of the Government's other economic policies, can raise the cash to make the purchase, which is doubtful. They will be sold to the chiefs of satrapies in the Middle East or elsewhere, if they still have the courage to invest in the kind of Britain which will survive the imposition of that tax, or they will be sold, as it was suggested last night, by compulsion to the right hon. Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn), the ignoble Lord Stansgate. There can be no other consequence.<br/>
I have nowhere seen any attempt to answer the question I ask about what will be the effect. What other way, therefore, is to be seen? In what sense is it any exaggeration to say that enterprises will be destroyed within a generation and that workers in those enterprises and their jobs will be taken over and threatened? As sane men are presumed to intend the consequences of their acts, one can only conclude that the Labour Government mean to achieve just that desolation which lies in prospect. It is unbelievable.<br/>
I wish to give time for my hon. Friends to join in this extremely important debate, but I hope I may be forgiven for recounting to the House a conversation I had a year or two ago with a distinguished representative of the Chinese People's Republic. Finding myself short of immediate material for launching the conversation, I asked him to what extent dogs were in evidence in the Chinese People's Republic. I was told&#x2014;perhaps not surprisingly&#x2014;that there were only worker dogs to be found in that happy country. Dogs were found on farms, with jobs to do, but nowhere else. I asked what happened if such a worker dog strayed out of its agricultural compound and into the town. I received the crisp


reply "Such a dog would not exist." Will someone please explain to the House why these taxes will not work in just that way? What is to be the future of small business in Britain? Within one generation of the Government's carrying through this legislation such a thing will not exist.<br/>
Is it any wonder that there are cars on the roads of this country displaying on the back window a sticker which will be the epitaph of the present administration, if they last that long, and which, if we are not careful, may turn out to be the epitaph of Britain. The legend is simple:
<q>Will the last small business man to leave Britain please turn out the lights?</q>
That is the prospect before many people in face of the Government's policies. We are determined, as we have been throughout the proceedings on the Bill, to do everything possible to protect people from that damage, and my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has already told the House of the Conservative Party's attitude towards this tax. It is a bad tax. I renew, on the Conservative Party's behalf, the pledge already given. We shall, therefore, repeal the tax. We shall take account of the fact that capital taxation in one form or another has existed since the latter part of the last century, but that which will replace the tax will bear in mind, as it should, first the weight of other capital and income taxes on the taxpayer, secondly the beneficial treatment of gifts to the family in other countries which have a gift tax, and thirdly the need to keep in this country those who can create the new wealth upon which our future depends.</p>

<p>I wish to refer Amendments (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) to the Amendment. Amendment (<i>c</i>) refers to unquoted companies. Amendment (<i>d</i>) may, perhaps, appeal to the Financial Secretary because it includes a reference to trading close companies and may close a conceivable loophole. Amendment (<i>e</i>) puts on a limitation of &#x00A3;250,000 and provides that the recipient shall work for five full years before the transfer, the donor shall have been in the business for three years and the recipient shall continue to work in the business.<br/>
In Amendment (<i>e</i>) we deal specifically with the family business, the sort of business which passes on from generation to generation and is in many parts of the country the backbone of the local economy, particularly in the regions, including Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where family businesses dominate in the economy.<br/>
Amendment No. 77 is in response to the debate in Committee of the whole House. We are grateful that there is to be some help, but regret that it is totally inadequate. The House may recall the definition of "gratitude in politics" made by Lord Boyd-Carpenter, who said that it was "a lively anticipation of further benefits to come". I trust that the Financial Secretary will act in that way tonight.<br/>
In the debate in Committee of the whole House, the Chief Secretary said that he could not accept an amendment which treated one group of assets differently from other assets. His words were that:
<q>it would be unfair, all other things being equal, for one taxpayer to pay considerably less than another. That would not be right."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 22nd January 1975; Vol. 884, c. 1662.]</q>
On that basis he rejected our amendment.<br/>
Having set out that basis the Chief Secretary proceeded to shoot it to pieces in Standing Committee when he gave preferential treatment to certain deserving groups&#x2014;in agriculture, with the 20-year valuation, and in forestry, where no payment is made till the asset is sold. That is a principle which is incorporated in Amendment (<i>e</i>), which might be favourably received by the Financial Secretary.<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
It works on the same principle. A business is like a tree. It takes years to grow, but can be cut down overnight. One of the major problems which small businesses will face in the next few years is the situation that will follow the Government decision to cut down family businesses, small businesses and growing businesses&#x2014;concerns which have taken years, sometimes generations, to build but which could be quickly destroyed.<br/>
Last night we had a brief debate, lasting 20 minutes before midnight, on the


subject of small businesses. The Financial Secretary revealed the Government's defence. He said, if I may paraphrase his words, "What is the fuss all about? These businesses have survived estate duty, and capital transfer tax is at a lower rate than death duty. Since we are conferring a benefit on those businesses, why are the Opposition getting so worked up?" The Minister knows that most people did not pay estate duty. It was paid by those who were unlucky or ill-advised. Certainly many of those in small and medium-sized businesses did not pay estate duty. Because they were not prepared to see their life's work end up as a donation to the Treasury they sought advice on how to avoid it.<br/>
The Financial Secretary does not need to attack my argument&#x2014;I am aware that he will try to do so&#x2014;since he will find that in his speeches and in the remarks of his right hon. Friend the Chancellor in introducing capital transfer tax it was said that it was necessary to take this action to stop up the holes in estate duty. In other words, it was admitted that very large numbers of firms and people did not come within the scope of estate duty and used legitimate means to avoid the tax. Therefore, the whole of the Minister's defence is founded on sand. Since the majority of businesses did not pay duty it is not true to say that the CTT is less onerous than was the estate duty.<br/>
Yesterday at lunchtime I was with a man who was the third generation in a family business. It is not untypical of the sort of business we are dealing with in this debate. It provides jobs for 150 people. It is run by a go-ahead young man who has been trained for the job. Ever since he went to school he knew that one day he would go into the business and would try to build another storey on to the business which had been built up by his father and grandfather. He told me that he had introduced a system of worker participation&#x2014;indeed, he had a meeting yesterday to consider how to extend that system. He was determined to see that the business forged ahead with the most modern concepts of management and that he would disprove the legend of clogs to clogs in three generations. What situation would now face that business if it had had to

pay capital transfer tax when the young man got his hands on the levers of management?</p>

<p>I agree that he could not have afforded them.<br/>
Assuming that the business is worth &#x00A3;120,000, as a lifetime gift the tax would amount to &#x00A3;19,000, plus capital gains tax. If we ignore capital gains tax&#x2014;and we cannot ignore it&#x2014;we must envisage the person concerned paying &#x00A3;2,400 a year over a period of eight years. The salary of the man in question is about &#x00A3;6,000 a year. How can anybody, on such a salary gross, find &#x00A3;2,400 a year net, for eight years with which to pay the tax?<br/>
Let us consider the position of a larger company worth &#x00A3;250,000. In that case the capital gains tax liability could be &#x00A3;37,000 or more. If paid by the recipient on a lifetime gift, if we take the best possible option, the CTT liability would be &#x00A3;76,000. Over eight years the figure would amount to &#x00A3;13,000 a year. To obtain &#x00A3;13,000 a year a man would need a salary, before income tax and higher rate tax, of about &#x00A3;40,000&#x2014;that is, assuming he has no money to live on. Even the Financial Secretary would admit that a person would have to keep himself, pay his mortgage and so on. Therefore, if he is to have just as much money as a moonlighting plasterer he would need to have &#x00A3;50,000 a year to pay the tax and to be able to live at a modest rate.<br/>
Where is the money to come from? We should repeat that question time and again. The Government seem to assume that a young man in this situation is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and has a small fortune behind him. But that is not the situation. Most of the people concerned are young men coming into business who have not a bean to their name, apart from what they earn from the business. How can one take &#x00A3;50,000 a year out of a business worth &#x00A3;250,000 for eight years to pay the tax? It is just not on the cards, and the Financial Secretary knows it. If he wishes to disprove my figures, I shall be happy to allow him to do so.<br/>
I have an interest in this matter, as do many of my hon. Friends, and countless people have written to me and my colleagues on this topic. The import of those letters is "There is no possible prospect of my business going on for another generation. Why sweat it out? Why work at it? What is it all worth? "John Chown, in a brilliant analysis in the <i>Financial Times</i> at the beginning of the week, showed what a small amount those working to build up a business can ever hope to pass on.</p>

<p>I am sure the hon. Gentleman will recall that in the course of that article by the distinguished commentator, Mr. Chown, it was made clear that there should be little difficulty for businesses up to a value of &#x00A3;250,000 in paying the tax.</p>

<p>I hear what the Minister says, and I shall be interested to hear him describe how somebody can take enough money out of a business&#x2014;bearing in mind that that person must pay income tax on the money he takes out&#x2014;to pay CTT and to meet the capital gains tax liability. In the most favourable circumstances in respect of a lifetime gift involving a &#x00A3;250,000 business, he will be required to earn about &#x00A3;50,000 a year. If the Minister wishes to dispute that figure I shall be delighted to give way to him. I invite him, and indeed challenge him, to do so in his reply.</p>

<p>Will he also include recognition of what will happen to a business over a period of eight years with inflation running at 20 per cent. per year?

<p>My hon. Friend is right. Inflation means that one needs more money to undertake the same volume of business. We must consider this matter against the background not only of CTT but of other taxes&#x2014;income tax, corporation tax, advance corporation tax, capital gains tax and the promised wealth tax. If one envisages the impact of only half those taxes one sees how impossible is the situation.<br/>
One has only to consult those in industry to see what is happening. I do not know how greatly the Financial Secretary and the Government have consulted with the Small Businesses Association, the Small Firms Council of the CBI, the National Chamber of Trade, and the like. I have been conducting a careful analysis with those bodies.<br/>
Earlier this week I received a deputation of people involved in running these businesses. They told me what they are doing or planning to do. The Financial Secretary wants a growing and strong economy. The Government have said that that is their aim. However, the Financial Secretary should realise exactly what is happening. I was told: "We have spent our lifetime building up the business and ploughing back. That is the way in which a small business exists. We have put our lives into our business. Now we have to run it down, for otherwise it cannot pass on to the next generation."<br/>
I was also told "We have built up a major export business. We have been encouraged by the Government to do it. We put our backs into it and we have been proud of it. Now we have to seek to turn orders away, to wind our business down to make it small enough to be able to pass on."<br/>
A third person said: "At my board meeting last Friday we solemnly sat down and discussed ways in which to reduce our business, to reduce our turnover and to reduce our investment programme, and, unfortunately, to reduce our work force."<br/>
That is not my invention. There were 40 representatives from different parts of the country at that meeting, every one of whom would confirm the accuracy of what I have said.<br/>
Since this Government came to office, a new phrase has appeared&#x2014;the terminal business. We have heard of terminal wards in hospitals but now we have a terminal section of the business community, comprising those who know that they cannot pass their business on to the next generation and those who do not see any motivation to go on working to build up a business for the benefit of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<br/>
Such people see that there is no prospect either for themselves or, desperately


unfortunately, for their employees, those who have joined the team, who have helped to build up and run the business. From my personal experience I know of the importance in a business of the team and the team spirit which makes it a success. Those people will say to themselves "How can we tie our careers to a terminal business?" They know that if they start such a job at 25 or 30 and the boss dies they will be out of a job in 10 or 20 years' time. Such people will not put themselves into that position.<br/>
We now have a serious situation about which the Government do not care and&#x2014;looking at the empty Government benches&#x2014;Government supporters do not care a damn, either. We shall have a situation in which the Government will terminate many businesses which provide much employment and the Government do not appear to care.</p>

<p>The House knows of my own interests as a small business man.<br/>
Any concession is gratefully received by the business community, which is threatened so gravely by the new measures. My advisers tell me that if my wife and I died it might be virtually impossible for the business, in which we have worked so hard for so long, to survive, without reliefs other than those already proffered. It is not nice to hear that. It is dangerous threat to a useful part of the community, and to businesses which are of benefit to the economy.<br/>
There should be upper limits on the total capital taxation which can fall on any business. When a business grows it sometimes acquires substantial property assets. In these new circumstances those assets are a threat to the life of the business. However, there are many businesses with limited turnover that cannot survive without substantial property in which the work is done. Such businesses are at greater risk of destruction than those where there is substantial output in relation to the total property assets. That aspect deserves to be separately looked at and given further consideration.<br/>
How are the burdens of debt to be met? Insurance would cost far too much. The proprietor of any business of substance

would not be able to afford the premiums, especially if the life assurance policy were taken out in middle age or later. I know that an opportunity is given to pay over eight years. However, most progressive businesses which are in a continuing phase of expansion require all the capital that they can find for investment. If that investment is taken out of the business and used to pay the debt for such taxation, it will be necessary to borrow money or to sell part of the business. That is nothing but destructive.<br/>
In any case how will that money be readily raised? What bank would advance money on any substantial scale in circumstances where the business must either be run down or at least not expanded? We know from common experience that a business either grows and prospers or shrinks and goes downhill.<br/>
In spite of the natural instinct of business men to make their businesses grow and expand, since the new tax was proposed, I have heard of cases where family firms were planning to reduce the size of their businesses, contrary to the national interest and to natural instincts. They see no other way of being able to pay the tax involved. The Minister has observed that it will be possible for smaller businesses to pay the tax. However, as soon as a business has reached a substantial size it is for the chopper!<br/>
Is that desirable? Why should a private family business suffer if it has assets or, say, &#x00A3;1 million, if the people working in it are happy and are doing a good job, and if the service it provides is excellent? Why wield this extraordinary tax to destroy the spirit of enterprise which has made our nation so great? Why destroy the profits on which the Government must draw if we are to pay for social services, defence and the other facilities needed by the community? What will happen to the staff in these businesses if their sense of security is removed? They may not know whether the business can survive the death of the proprietor. Every time the proprietor goes out for a walk they will wonder whether he will be run over by a bus. The livelihood of the people working in these firms will be placed at risk.<br/>
What will be the consequence? People will seek jobs in larger firms, in the bureaucracy, or, if they are anxious still


to work where enterprise and effort are rewarded, they will go abroad. The Government wish to drive the proprietors of these businesses and their staff out of the Kingdom. It is wrong to put this element, of fear behind every person working in a medium-sized family business. I ask the Government to think again, to look at the figures, and to speak to business men running such businesses.<br/>
The Minister laughed. However, this is not funny. This tax is a destructive measure. It is not merely a revolutionary measure to change society. It is a measure designed to kill one part of our society. It is divisive of our community as a whole.</p>

<p>When we debated the Finance Bill in Committee on the Floor of the House, a number of Government supporters thought that I was exaggerating when I said that the Government seemed bent on creating a mixture of peasant economy and corporate State. I repeat that, because that is exactly what they are creating. There will be no room for the individual business owned and run by a family who care for it and have built it up over generations. There will be no room and no opportunity for the ordinary person of his own initiative to prosper.<br/>
I thought that my hon. Friends the Members for Basingstoke (Mr. Mitchell) and for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge) made extremely powerful speeches based on deep personal experience. I have no interest to declare. I have no small business in my family. I wish that I had. But I admire the talents of those who have developed, from what Napoleon scoffingly called a nation of shopkeepers, what I still believe to be the greatest nation in Europe.<br/>
In this Bill, the Government are discouraging talent and in some cases possibly perverting it. There will be two results from this measure. Many of the people referred to by both my hon. Friends will be discouraged from expanding their businesses for their own good and for the good of the community&#x2014;enlightened self-interest has always been the best guide to any decent society. Others will be encouraged to use their talents to find ways round these provisions, and no doubt some will be suc

cessful. In other words, talents which should be used in a creative and constructive way will be either discouraged or even perverted.<br/>
One of the most moving experiences that I have had in recent weeks occurred when I went to Wolverhampton Town Hall three weeks ago to attend a meeting of the self-employed. There were 1,250 people in Wolverhampton Town Hall that night. They were not fly-by-nighters. They were not people who wanted to cheat. Nor were they people who wanted to fold up and go away. They were ordinary decent men and women&#x2014;not people born with silver spoons in their mouths. They were people who by their own efforts had created businesses or inherited them and made them prosper for the good of the community as well as for themselves.<br/>
Those people attended that meeting because they realised that this Government were acting in a way which would make life impossible for them. I do not mean just by means of the pernicious tax that we are discussing now. I mean the blow to the self-employed from the increased contributions which they will have to pay from April and the enormous difficulties created by the swingeing increase in rates. Of course, to talk about either of those now would be out of order. But it is appropriate to mention them because they illustrate the triple blow which has been aimed at the self-employed and the small business this year.<br/>
When I spoke to the people in that hall and they felt that I had some message of good cheer for them, in a way I sensed that I was cheating them because I knew that the Government would not be persuaded of what I consider to be an unanswerably good case. I knew that the Government would not give them the opportunity for which they were asking&#x2014;the opportunity to serve the community, the opportunity to prosper and, yes, the opportunity to make money and to build up the capital of the nation.<br/>
I just hope that the eloquent plea of my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, who knows possibly more about these matters than anyone in the House, will have not fallen on deaf ears. He talked about terminal wards. There is a terminal illness threatening the very existence


of businesses in this country. It is the cancer of Socialism.<br/>
If only the Financial Secretary could take a leaf out of the book of some social democrats in other countries in Europe, who talk of their fine ideals, many of which the Opposition share, but do what they can to foster enterprise, to encourage initiative and not to snuff out the very life of our society, which is what this Government are in danger of doing.<br/>
The Government talk as though sums like &#x00A3;250,000 are vast sums of money. The Financial Secretary intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke to say that Mr. Chown argued that businesses worth less than &#x00A3;250,000 need not worry. Does not the hon. Gentleman understand that in terms of the inflationary society in which we are cursed to live, that is not a vast sum? If the Government propose hitting that type of company and business, they will be hitting at the root of society.<br/>
We are forced to one of two conclusions. The Government are bent on their destructive acts either through naivety, or by malice. It may be that it is a combination of the two. Being a charitable man, I prefer the first view. I hope that it is because of their naivety.<br/>
It may be that the lessons which have been put across by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, backed by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster, have not fallen on deaf ears. I hope that there is a desire in the Financial Secretary to learn from those who know from experience about this great problem.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend says that there is no desire. I hope that he is wrong. Up and down the country there are tens of thousands of ordinary decent people who hope that he is wrong.<br/>
Let the Financial Secretary show his good intentions by accepting just one of these amendments, and we shall believe that there is a little hope. If he does not, all that we can do is to encourage those people to hope for the future and to pray for the day when another Government, less envious and less malicious, will occupy the Treasury Bench and sweep away from the statute book this evil scheme.</p>

<p>My purpose in intervening is to ask my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for some information about the purpose of the amendment and its relationship to the Bill.<br/>
I want to assure the Opposition, having listened to the muck thrown at my right hon. and hon. Friends earlier, that I have no business connections. I do not have a business. I do not have any stocks or shares. What I do not know about these matters would fill volumes. But I have been asked for some information about the operation of this tax, and I should like some facts and figures confirmed or denied by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary.<br/>
One Scottish newspaper has been running a campaign designed to discredit the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government about the operation of the proposed tax. It has dealt in one article with the principle of the amendment which we are debating. I should like to know from my hon. Friend whether the facts and figures quoted in that article and quoted to me personally are accurate.<br/>
The writer of the article takes a number of examples of businesses of differing values which their proprietors propose to pass on to their sons so that they may take over the running of the firms. The writer claims that the cost of the application of this tax will be too high. He quotes the example of a business worth about &#x00A3;500,000, and he claims that that will attract &#x00A3;224,000 in tax.</p>

<p>In setting the tax as low as he has, the writer of the article must have ignored the likely effect of capital gains tax. Can the hon. Gentleman say whether capital gains tax is taken into account?</p>

<p>I had the impression that the writer was quoting the capital transfer tax. He set out to show that the tax was imposing an inordinate burden on the recipient of the transfer. I was interviewed about the matter in my constituency and, frankly, I could not come up with all the answers. I am hoping that my hon. Friend will be able to do so when he winds up the debate.<br/>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
It was put to me that when the man comes to transfer his business to his son,


with a view to maintaining the business in Scotland, the proposed tax will amount to &#x00A3;224,000. That would be the taxation that would result from the transfer of the undertaking. Even accepting that the payments could be spread over eight years, that would mean &#x00A3;28,000 a year to meet the cost of the tax. The question is asked, Where is that to come from? "That is the question that I ask my hon. Friend.<br/>
I must give an answer to my constituents. I hope that my hon. Friend will pay attention. The undertaking may be valued at &#x00A3;500,000, but that does not mean that there is liquid capital of &#x00A3;500,000. That value may well include buildings, land, plant, equipment, stores and even credits. My constituents want to know how the payment of tax is to be made. That is the question that I am asking. That is the question that we have all been asking. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to give me the answer.<br/>
I want to look at this matter from the point of view of practical politics. It is put to me that when a transfer is made to the young member of the family he cannot possibly produce &#x00A3;28,000 out of the hat. Therefore, he is face to face with what has been described as an inevitable implication&#x2014;namely, the sale of the business to raise the money to pay the tax. Perhaps my hon. Friend will comment on that. Given the example that I have put forward, that would mean that 250 jobs could very well disappear in an area of persistently high unemployment.<br/>
I want to know how it is that the Chancellor expects to deal with the problem that I have outlined. When a father reaches the age when he wishes to hang up his boots and retire he will want to hand over his business to the young, vibrant, energetic and enthusiastic members of the family. He will do so with the intention that the business shall continue and that the younger members of the family will carry on the tradition of the business and the provision of employment in such parts of Scotland as I have in mind. I have been asked for information, but so far I have been unable to obtain it. I am very anxious to give a satisfactory reply to my constituents.<br/>
The newspaper that is running this tirade against the Government is no doubt

giving an incomplete report. I am not saying that it is giving an inaccurate report, merely an incomplete report. I am hoping that when my hon. Friend replies I shall be able to pass on the information that is at the moment hanging in the air. We are a democratic assembly and it is our duty to give this information. It is our duty to provide facts. It is our duty to prove that this tax will create no undue hardship. If it will not do so, we should be able to glean the facts which are obviously missing from the newspaper article to which I have referred. The newspaper concerned is a well-known and reputable Scottish newspaper although it has unquestionably a Conservative bias and slant. Nevertheless, it is reputable in the presentation of facts.<br/>
In discussing this amendment I can understand the feelings of Conservative Members. I say that on the basis of the facts as they have been presented and portrayed to me not only by the business community but even by some of my own colleagues. They are anxious to ascertain the true implications of the operation of the tax. It is only fair that we should have the information for which I ask. I am hopeful that when my hon. Friend replies he will be able to disabuse the minds of those who believe the tax to be anomalous, unfair, inequitable and an imposition.<br/>
I happen to believe that in this country there must be two sectors of industry&#x2014;namely, a public sector and a private sector. If we have a private sector we must be strictly fair about how it should operate. It must be encouraged to operate efficiently. We must ensure that a fair profit is earned not just to provide a decent standard of living for those who own the undertaking but to ensure regular consistent employment and an adequate investment policy so that the industry can be modernised and maintained in a competitive fashion to enable it to be successful in winning orders. I am especially concerned about such undertakings providing and maintaining jobs.<br/>
I have been asked to raise this matter and to get my hon. Friend to confirm that it is the Government's intention to ensure that if this tax is applied and becomes operative it will be implemented without any undue hardship being imposed on any individual or number of individuals.</p>

<p>I am only seeking to obtain information. I do not belong to this aspect of life. I am a person who has always had to work with his own hands. I have never managed, owned or possessed. I hope that Opposition Members will bear with me. I am not concerned with the management of industry. All I want to do is to ensure that what we are doing is in the best interests of the community. Of course, the community includes industrialists. It also includes management and work people.<br/>
My only concern is to ensure that the operation of this tax is not as vicious as we are led to believe and that it is not as unacceptable as has been claimed. I want to ensure that we have regard to all the factors that I have mentioned before any fiscal policy is determined. After all, the aim of any fiscal policy should be not only the provision of full employment but the provision of a rising standard of life for those who manage and those who work.</p>

<p>First, I must declare a small interest in a small business of which I am a director.<br/>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey). He has made the best and the most farsighted speech on the Bill that we have heard from the Government side of the House. It was better than some that have been made from this side.<br/>
I should like to help the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie who slightly exaggerated the tax in the example that he gave. The hon. Gentleman read from the newspaper that the transfer of a business worth &#x00A3;500,000 might involve the payment of &#x00A3;224,000 tax. The actual figure is &#x00A3;223,875. That is capital transfer tax only. It does not include capital gains tax, development gains tax or any other tax which might be payable on the transaction. That is the capital transfer tax payable if the gift is made during the transferor's life. If he is unfortunate enough to die and the business passes to his son, the tax is considerably increased. The first thing that the hon. Gentleman should do if he has

a constituent in this position, as we gather he has, is to advise him not to die. Otherwise the tax will be considerably increased. That is the rate of tax that applies if the transferee, the son, pays it.<br/>
We had a debate earlier on the various circumstances in which the father or the son might pay the tax. The figure of &#x00A3;223,875 is the lower rate if the son pays the tax. I do not know what the amount will be if the father pays the tax, but I believe that it will be more than &#x00A3;500,000. Again, the hon. Gentleman's constituent should be careful to take advice before he does anything. If he is well advised, if he is careful and lives long enough, he may get the capital transfer tax alone down to &#x00A3;223,875 in that instance.<br/>
The question which the hon. Gentleman quite properly asked&#x2014;I hope that the Financial Secretary will do his best to reply to it when he winds up the debate&#x2014;is, how can people pay? I do not believe that they can pay. I shall be interested to hear what the Financial Secretary has to say in answer to his hon. Friend's question.<br/>
I am delighted that the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie should have come into the debate and perceived the point which we have been trying to put across and which has been put across to us by small business men in this situation. People faced with these problems are wondering how they will find the money to pay the tax if they die or pass on their businesses during their lifetime.<br/>
The debate tonight is not about the principle whether there should be special cases in the capital transfer tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Mitchell), in an excellent speech, made it clear that that was the case. Nor is it about whether small businesses should be a special case in capital transfer tax because they are already to the extent of being allowed to make payments by instalments if the transferees pay. This debate is about how special a case small businesses, however defined, are in this tax or how special they should be.<br/>
I think that there is a difference&#x2014;the tax is correct to recognise it as far as it does, but I think that it should recognise it further&#x2014;between the owner of general assets which are relatively easily realisable and useable and the owner of a small business. That difference lies in the ability


to value the assets in the first place and to liquidate them in the second place. Primarily the difference lies in the fact that one cannot produce the tax which will be required without selling the business as a whole in almost every case.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
If people have money outside their businesses which they are able to use to pay the tax, they need not sell their businesses, but most people do not have such assets. I am almost certain that those who own shares in businesses will do their utmost to get and to keep money out of those businesses as much as possible from now on to build up funds of more realisable assets with which to pay the tax when the time comes. That will undoubtedly damage investment in the very sector where we would like to see a good deal of investment in future.<br/>
We know that some hon. Gentleman opposite want to see the last generation of every family business in this country. We also know that the intention of this tax cannot be to redistribute wealth, even in the sense in which Socialists use those words&#x2014;that is, to take wealth away from the richer members of the community. The purpose behind the tax is simply to lock people into family businesses until the steamroller of the wealth tax can catch up with and squash them into the ground. The purpose of the tax is to prevent farms and other assets passing from one generation to another. If it is not amended, it will undoubtedly succeed in its purpose.<br/>
Frankly, I do not believe that that is the purpose of all hon. Gentlemen opposite. I do not believe that they want that to happen or that they think it is desirable from the country's point of view. Among hon. Gentlemen opposite who do not want this to happen I would include the Minister responsible for small businesses who was good enough to look into our debates last night when we briefly touched on the problems of small businesses. I am sorry that he is not here today. I know that he is an assiduous attender at debates on small businesses, but he has broken his record today. I expect that he had a good reason for doing so.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out on behalf of the Minister. I think that the Paymaster-General wants to encourage the small business sector and to see it flourish, not destroyed. I hope that hon. Gentleman opposite who have the same views will continue to hold them. We have had a good example today from the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie. I hope that we shall have more examples in the weeks between now and the Budget and between the Budget and the next Finance Bill of hon. Gentlemen opposite pressing their Front Bench to look at and consider these difficulties and doing their best to convince the Government that changes must be made in this tax if these businesses are to survive.<br/>
I am not hopeful that we shall get very far with any of these amendments tonight, but we shall do our best by going into the Lobby to carry them. That will not be the end of the matter. These businesses will not go overnight. They will be destroyed over a number of years. Until the last one has gone we shall continue fighting to try to keep them.<br/>
I do not know whether I shall be the small business man to whom my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe) referred who will turn out the light, but until the light goes out we shall do our best to keep the light of small businesses burning. One way to do that is to vote for the amendments.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) made an excellent speech in which he posed a clear and precise example. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will give him the kind of answer that his constituent would like.<br/>
My hon. Friend was not referring to a typical small business when he referred to assets of &#x00A3;500,000. That does not mean that the example was bad for that reason. I suggest that he should tell his constituent that if, sadly, he had fallen under a bus before 25th March 1974 he would have paid at least &#x00A3;223,875 in estate duty, and probably more. I do not


know the exact figure because I have not got the estate duty figures. He could have paid slightly less, but the figure would not have been very different under the old estate duty.</p>

<p>The point I am making is that if my hon. Friend's constituent owned all the shares in this company on the day before this tax came into operation, and if the shares were worth &#x00A3;500,000, the sum payable wouid not have been very different. That was the position then, and it is much the same today. I am saying that the bill for estate duty would not have been less than he would have to find today should he give away the shares under the old r&#x00E9;gime or do so now.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman seems to have missed quite a lot. The fact is that &#x00A3;223,000 is not 100 per cent. of &#x00A3;500,000. I do not have the figures, but if what I have is incorrect no doubt my hon. Friend will put me right. I do not think there will be much difference between the position under the old estate duty legislation and what it will be now. If that is right, one can go further and say that if my lion. Friend's constituent had given away his shares in one block&#x2014;which would be unusual&#x2014;less than seven years before his death&#x2014;and he could not with the best will in the world predict the exact date of his death&#x2014;about the same amount of tax would have been paid under estate duty as will be paid under CTT.</p>

<p>It is not possible to say exactly what amount of estate duty would have been paid, because one cannot say what proportion of the assets would have come under the small business

relief under estate duty. If all the assets came under that relief the tax would have been &#x00A3;170,000 if he had died owning all the shares in the business, but if he had been well advised he would not have owned them all.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1868.0" hansard_membership_id="3086" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2628" speakername="Mr. Davies" colnum="1868" time="">
<p>Given the most favourable interpretation, with all the reliefs, he would have paid &#x00A3;50,000 less, but, as the figures were put, the fact is that there would not be much difference under estate duty and under CTT with figures of that amount. That is perhaps a not wholly unsatisfactory answer.<br/>
But one is not concerned with a person who holds his assets and dies owning them all. The position will not be very different if someone gives away his assets less than seven years before he dies, though there will be a difference if a longer period elapses.<br/>
The next situation about which my hon. Friend's constituent is complaining is that under the old r&#x00E9;gime if assets were given away more than seven years before death&#x2014;and this was done legitimately in many instances&#x2014;there was no tax bill when the person died, but that has changed because of CTT. To that extent, my hon. Friend's constituent is worse off in the sense that he cannot avail himself of the opportunity of giving away his assets more than seven years before his death. Conservative Members have said that if such a person were well advised he would not have got himself into that position, but he seems to be in just that difficulty, so one must conclude that he was badly advised under the old law.<br/>
I come back to the argument about a small business worth &#x00A3;100,000 on which a person would pay a certain amount of tax. I suggest to Conservative Members that they know very well that a person in that position would not, for many reasons&#x2014;some of them not fiscal&#x2014;give away all his shares in his company in one block. There may be an isolated case in which that is done, but a person would not do it if he were well advised. He might give for example his two sons 24 per cent. each, or give away 48 per cent. or 51 per cent. but it is unusual that a person will give away all his shares. In any case, he may not own all the shares. His wife may own some, his son may have some shares and trustees may own some shares in the company.<br/>
We are not challenging the figures, and the Opposition are entitled to put the extreme case. Reference has been made to a company worth &#x00A3;100,000. I am saying that that kind of situation would rarely occur because people would rightly and legitimately be advised to give away their assets over a period of time, and to that extent the burden of the tax would not be considerable.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that on his slim figure of &#x00A3;100,000 this infant prodigy would have to start at birth, live to be 100, and give away &#x00A3;1,000 a year in order not to pay tax?</p>

<p>If he had a 100 per cent. interest in a family company, his son would pay &#x00A3;14,000 spread over eight years, which is &#x00A3;1,750 a year. I am not saying it is a minimal sum. Nobody likes paying tax, but that money would have to be found on a business worth &#x00A3;100,000 if all the shares were given away, and that amounts to &#x00A3;1,750 a year for eight years. It is a burden, but not an unreasonable or unfair one in all the circumstances.<br/>
We then have to consider the fact that a man might give away minority interests. The value of those minority interests would not be proportionally less than the total interest, but they would be less all the same. That is what happened in the past, and it will happen in the future. I do not think we should exaggerate the position. There is a problem, but the Opposition have marred their case by exaggerating it, especially in Committee, where they did so night after night, with the result that the case was not put as well as it should have been.<br/>
I am prepared to accept that CTT heaped on CGT makes life more difficult. In Committee, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary did not say very much, but he did say that he was going to look again at CGT and I hope he will do so. I do not see that it makes sense to heap one tax upon another. I do not know how it is possible to do it, but one has to be fair between taxpayers. I think that something should be done, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will pursue his investigations into the matter.<br/>
I now come to the question of reliefs for CGT. If a person gives away assets on his retirement, there are certain reliefs. It does not follow that the total value of the shares will be subject to CGT, because that may not be the total value of the gain. Nevertheless, there is a problem with capital gains tax and I hope that my right hon. Friend will look at it.<br/>
8.0 p.m.<br/>
We are concerned not only with business assets but with other assets. In Committee we considered what I would call a small farm, which in the Welsh context would be one of less than 200 acres. I was satisfied on that basis, especially by the new lifetime rates that there was not a problem. Let us consider the larger farm. I read with interest the speech of the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) yesterday, who seemed to forecast the demise of British agriculture. He said that we would be turned into a peasant community as a result of this tax. That, again, is an example of exaggeration which does not do Conservative Members any good.<br/>
Let us consider a farm of 500 acres which is a large farm, even by English standards. Assume a rental value of &#x00A3;10 an acre. Hon. Gentlemen may say that that is not high enough. I do not know. It is not too wide of the mark. If we take the valuation in this legislation it produces a farm worth &#x00A3;100,000 for capital transfer tax purposes. A gift of the whole of the farm to a son would be a gift of &#x00A3;100,000. Under capital transfer tax that would represent &#x00A3;14,000 spread over eight years&#x2014;&#x00A3;1,750 for each year. In their quieter and calmer moments I believe that Conservative Members will agree that that could not be described as the destruction of British agriculture. People do not like paying taxes but I do not think that that is an unreasonable burden.</p>

<p>I believe that the hon. Gentleman will, on reflection, agree that his example is a little misleading. First of all this is because very few 500 acre farms, apart from the part of the world from which the hon. Gentleman comes, would be sold for &#x00A3;100,000. Beyond that the hon.

<p>I do not know about stock. I accept that the value of stock would be in addition and so the taxation figure would be a little higher.<br/>
Many farms of that kind would be owned by companies and the shares would not be given away immediately in one block. I understand that there is an amendment to enable a &#x00A3;1,000 exemption to be accumulated and passed on from year to year if it is not used. That affords a certain amount of relief if the assets have been held for a long time.<br/>
I do not believe some of the exaggerated statements made by Tory Members. They cannot be justified. I accept that there are some problems about capital gains tax when it is heaped on to capital transfer tax. Conservative Members have said that they do not like this tax and want to repeal it. But they have not said what they will put in its place. It is their duty to do so. Do they want the old form of estate duty? Presumably not, because many people in all parties saw the old system as being capricious, unfair and depending entirely on whether a person gave property away more than seven years before his death.<br/>
If this tax is not to be replaced with estate duty, what will be put in its stead? Will it be the inheritance tax system produced by Lord Barber in his Green Paper? There are advantages, in that assets can be moved around in the family at lower rates. But if the Conservatives wish to maintain the same yield as that which obtained under estate duty and the yield which hopefully, in a few years, will accrue under this tax, the rate of the inheritance tax would have to be high. I predict that hon. Gentlemen would scream in the same way as they are screaming now.<br/>
There is also the accessions tax. That is extremely complicated. I predict that in Committee hon. Gentlemen would be

complaining and raising anomalies about it. They should explain to us what kind of tax they want, or else they should be honest and say that they do not want a tax on capital transfers. Alternatively, they should say that they will reduce the rate significantly, in which case the yield would be reduced. They must then tell us how they would make up the difference. There are problems, but these have been exaggerated by Conservative Members who consequently have not done justice to their case.</p>

<p>This is a tax that has changed its nature. Once upon a time taxation was something that redistributed part of the wealth of an individual or business, but did not destroy the capacity of that individual or business to continue generating wealth. With this tax we cross the frontier between taxation, as it has always been considered, and confiscation&#x2014;the destruction of the wealth-producing assets grouped together in a business.<br/>
In the South-West the representative employer is a small employer, not a large firm. This is generally true in the private sector throughout the South-West. Indeed, this applies to a large proportion of employment in Britain.<br/>
The point that has been missed is that once we bring about a situation where capital assets are transferred, the point at which they are transferred&#x2014;whether by death or a capital transfer more than seven years before death&#x2014;is the point at which the business is no longer viable. In a taxation system where that happens, such businesses are no longer creditworthy. The banks and financial institutions will not gamble on supplying the working capital needed by a business knowing that it will suddenly become nonviable at a point in time which it is impossible to predict. That point is when death forces the dispersal of those assets or when their transfer in advance of death generates a situation in which the business either completely runs out of working capital&#x2014;because working capital is the only liquid capital. Alternatively, when the assets are transferred the person or persons to whom they are transferred become so encumbered by debt to meet the tax liability that the annual interest payments to service those debts makes the business or the person, or both,


uncreditworthy. That is the situation we have now reached.<br/>
I might say <i>en passant</i> that inflation has completely destroyed the distinction between a capital gains tax and a capital levy. The distinction is real only when there is a zero rate of inflation or a controlled rate. At the moment, because of inflation, what started as a capital gains tax has become a capital levy, although the arguments for the two and the effects of the two are totally different.<br/>
When anyone says that it was the Conservatives who brought in capital gains tax that is perfectly true, but it has to be remembered that it was brought in as a tax on capital gains at a time when inflation was about 3 per cent. per annum&#x2014;a totally different situation from today. One of the factors that the late fain Macleod had closely in mind in his thoughts about the alterations that were necessary in taxation was that, so as not to blur the distinction between a capital levy and a capital gains tax when assessing liability for the latter, there should be subtracted from the accountable gain that which was the reciprocal of the changing value of money, which is something entirely different.<br/>
What should be taxed as a capital gain is a real increase in capital, irrespective of the change in the value of money. Our present inflation of over 20 per cent. means that what started as a capital gains tax has achieved the characteristic of a capital levy. When this is superimposed on a capital transfer tax which is itself grossed up, we have completely confiscatory legislation.<br/>
It is clear that some Labour Members have grasped this point. However, since at this crucial moment for every British business only four Labour Members are present on the back benches, clearly the point does not worry many of them.</p>

<p>The effects of the Bill on small businesses are crucial. Part of this matter was discussed for a

trivial time, less than half an hour, last night before the guillotine fell. We are having the rest of it today. It will be too late for Labour Members to say that they had not realised the consequences, when business after business in their constituencies collapses and unemployment caused entirely by this tax stalks their constituencies.<br/>
Too late then will Labour Members say that they did not know the consequences. They have been warned. It is not too late for them to heed that warning in the Division Lobby. But it will be too late if they merely trust to their Front Bench to have another think at some unspecified time, arriving at some unknown conclusion when it is too late for it to be effective anyway.<br/>
Even without paying a penny of this tax, businesses large and small are running out of working capital every day. Three weeks ago in my constituency, 40 men were laid off by one firm which collapsed. Twenty-five were laid off last week by another company running out of capital and 50 were laid off a few weeks before that at the other end of the constituency.<br/>
It is the creditworthiness of every firm that is at risk, even before this tax begins to bite. Merely knowing that these firms will be brought to their knees, no sane bank manager could regard them as creditworthy. The damage will be done the moment the Bill become law. Then they will have to go to the marginal financial institutions, some of which have already tottered&#x2014;even hon. Members who should have known better have taken part in activities of that kind&#x2014;to be charged a punitive rate of interest. The normal commercial banks recognise a bad risk when they see one, which the marginal firms do not.<br/>
Therefore the costs of these firms will increase further and further as they have to finance their increasing needs for working capital in a period of chronic inflation by going to the fringe so-called banks to pay usurious rates of interest for the working capital without which they cannot continue in busines at sufficient throughput to cover their overheads. Banks at the moment have claims on their available resources to lend far more than they can lend and, incidentally, far more than the Government want


them to lend. The Treasury keeps a tight control on these matters at the moment.<br/>
8.15 p.m.<br/>
Where is the working capital to come from? That is the question that the Government have not answered, although their own Members have been asking them. The only available liquid funds will come from the businesses concerned and at an excessive rate because of grossing-up. Who will buy these little businesses which can be sold only as going enterprises? The alternative is simply to break them up and sell them for redevelopment, in which case the employees will lose their jobs, as we have seen so often.<br/>
That will happen throughout the country. Too late, the Labour Party and its supporters will suddenly discover how much employment depends on the small businesses as one after another collapses. The cascade effect will be set off remorselessly, and it will then be beyond the Government's power to arrest or reverse that process. We have seen the cascade effect of depression before, in the 'thirties. This cascade effect will have been deliberately generated by a Government who know what they are doing. If they did not know before, they should know now because they have been adequately warned.</p>

<p>We are still hearing a repetition of generalisations about the capital transfer tax. The hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) talked about the effect on small businesses. He should concede that, following the Committee debates, the Government recognised that the effect of the tax as it originally stood on small businesses might have been more serious than anyone could reasonably justify. They have substantially lowered the rates on lifetime gifts and have introduced new lower levels to apply right across the range&#x2014;not only to agriculture and small businesses&#x2014;in order to avoid distortions.<br/>
For most small businesses, particularly shopkeepers, who have not been able to afford sophisticated advice to enable them to avoid tax, capital transfer tax will be a big improvement on the present situation. Widows will be able to inherit businesses without the tax applying and

children will pay far lower rates than under estate duty. There have been accusations of discrimination and bias against small enterprises, yet most of the areas in which complaint has been made the lower rates of capital transfer tax will lead to substantial improvement.</p>

<p>I am making my own speech. I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman wants to talk about the effect of capital gains tax and catches the eye of the Chair, the House will be only too interested to hear what he has to say.<br/>
On the particular problem of small businesses, we are comparing the effects of capital transfer tax with the effect of estate duty where in both circumstances capital gains tax applied. In many of the issues about which we are concerned the small business is preferentially treated now under the new proposals as compared with the situation which would have existed under estate duty.</p>

<p>I have not that degree of charity. Many hon. Members of the Opposition wish to speak in the debate. We want to make progress and to have as much discussion as possible.<br/>
I come, therefore, to one particular point of concern in the general tenor of the debate in the last couple of days, which has been re-emphasised this evening. Many people are suggesting that


the rate of tax ought to be cut even further. Even after all the concessions in so many of the Government's amendments on Report, hon. Members are asking for more and more. The loss of revenue that is proposed with equanimity is reaching very serious proportions.<br/>
We ought now to contrast the enthusiasm of Opposition Members for cutting the revenue with the kind of hysteria they demonstrate so regularly about the level of the public borrowing requirement. This is hypocrisy of the first order. To complain about the level of public borrowing requirement and then to come before us with such monotonous regularity pressing further and further diminutions of the revenue from capital transfer tax is something that the House cannot accept.<br/>
I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies). If Opposition Members have serious doubts about capital transfer tax&#x2014;which they clearly have&#x2014;it is obligatory that when they are criticising that tax and opposing it, as the hon. Member for Tiverton did, they should say clearly with what they would replace it. We have had totally destructive criticism and, so far, no adequate alternative.</p>

<p>That point has already been dealt with in the debate. I do not recognise the interpretation that the hon. Gentleman puts upon it.<br/>
I want to emphasise the point that it is far too easy to come before the House, after all the concessions have been made and when the Government are proposing losses of revenue by their own concessions, and to propose far greater losses of revenue and, at the same time, to have

this concern about the public borrowing requirement. I am concerned about the level of the borrowing requirement. During the Budget debate I criticised my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. I said that we must be seriously concerned about that matter and that our concern should manifest itself in trying to find better ways of raising revenue. I believe that capital transfer tax makes a substantial contribution to that process. That is why I hope that we shall leave the tax as it stands and not be receptive to the destructive ideas of Opposition Members.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may leave the lush industrial Midlands of England and go a little further north to Scotland and, for example, to my constituency of West Aberdeenshire. Small businesses there form a far higher proportion than they do elsewhere in the country. When dealing with questions of small businesses and their taxation, we are not dealing with questions of rich men or people who can pay taxes out of money held. We are dealing with people who do not have liquid capital. We are dealing with small firms, farms, garages, small shops and small traders.<br/>
In Scotland, one in four persons is employed in a small business. That leads on to the fact that nearly half of those in productive industry are employed in


small businesses. It is not for me to display the economic and technical arguments which have been so well put by some of my hon. Friends, not only at this stage but in Standing Committee. I want merely to point out the inevitable truth that we all know&#x2014;that such businesses will have to sell.<br/>
Labour Members do not seem to realise that these businesses and the men who run them have no cash. They have stock, property and machinery, and probably an overdraft. Therefore, if they have to sell they can sell only their businesses. They are not directors of large companies. They are not in nationalised industries or getting large salaries and owning shares in other companies which they can sell. They have committed everything they have to their own enterprises.<br/>
Leaving aside the economic arguments, what also happens when such businesses are driven into the ground? If they are sold, we know perfectly well that they can be sold only to the State or to large corporations. The first thing that happens is that the local link goes. Some businesses support local charities. That will all stop. It gets covenanted from headquarters because they do not understand the necessity of supporting local charities. Where small businesses have contributed people to the local council, all this goes. A directive comes from head office indicating that there is no time to allow people to take part in local community activities.<br/>
That has been the result all over the country when small businesses have been taken over by large businesses. The community in which the small business exists suffers economically, socially, and in every other way.<br/>
The next thing we hear when small businesses are taken over is the word "rationalisation". That is the polite name for inefficiency. When a local or small business becomes less efficient, an excuse is made and it is closed. From the small business sector come the future entrepreneurs and the people on whom the nationalised industries and the large public corporations will rely to keep going. That is the sector we are damaging.<br/>
All the household names have come from small businesses, in textiles, the retail

trade and the motor industry. They were all people who were prepared to risk their own money and to work any number of hours. We are killing the most efficient and least costly sector of British enterprise. When a small business gets into trouble it goes out of business, but when a large or nationalised industry gets into trouble the State steps in with money. We are doing something criminal affecting the whole of Britain. We are killing those upon whom we must rely in the future to lead the country into prosperity for all its peole.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Tomlinson) and the hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) said that the Opposition should come forward with their alternatives to the tax. They cannot accuse me of having no alternative, because even the Chief Secretary will recognise that I have advocated an accessions tax. I believe that that is the tax the Government should have introduced. I agree with the hon. Member for Llanelli that if I were introducing an accessions tax the Tory Party would be baying like the Society for the Preservation of the Rich that it is. I have no doubt that Conservative Members would squeal just as hard as they are doing today. An accessions tax would be a vast improvement on what we have now.<br/>
The hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) spoke forcefully about the possible effect of the tax on a firm in his constituency. We have had replies from Labour Members which indicate that they do not take these remarks too seriously.<br/>
I do not intend to debate small businesses tonight, because I want to turn my attention to another amendment. However, it is at least likely on the basis of the facts we have had&#x2014;although we do not have too many&#x2014;that the firm about which the hon. Member for Coat-bridge and Airdrie spoke was an industrial hereditament and that therefore, under estate duty, it would have had the 45 per cent. concession. Therefore the situation with estate duty, whether or not the owner of the firm had walked under a bus and had made no provision, would probably have been much better than may well be the position in this case.<br/>
The debate on the Government's amendment and on Amendment No. 80 in the name of my right hon. and hon. Friends and myself, to which I wish to turn my attention, is not primarily about small businesses. It is about the fundamental nature of the tax. As I am sure the Chief Secretary will recognise, I am not endeavouring to plead a special case in Amendment No. 80 but am trying to save the Chancellor and the Government from making an appalling error in the very character and essentials of the tax which they have introduced.<br/>
I understand that there were two things the Chancellor wanted to do when he introduced the capital transfer tax. He originally intended that it should be an anti-avoidance measure. I want to save him from the mistake he is making. He made it quite clear yesterday when he said that the central fact was
<q>that the Government are now replacing a tax which was ineffective and unfair&#x2014;ineffective because it was avoided on a colossal scale and unfair because it was avoided by only a minority of those affected and observed by the rest&#x2014;by a tax that we believe to be fair and effective".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 5th March 1975; Vol. 887, c. 1492.]</q>
The right hon. Gentleman spent a considerable portion of that speech on the whole question of avoidance, primarily the avoidance through the lifetime loophole. I do not split hairs about this. I think it was a loophole, but that does not mean that it was illegal. Of course it was not. We all know that there was avoidance on a scale which the Chancellor thought was much larger than I supposed it to be, but it was obviously substantial and interfered with the basic concept of estate duty. To that extent I entirely agree with the Chancellor's motives for introducing the capital transfer tax.<br/>
When the Government have introduced a tax to get rid of the lifetime loophole, what on earth is the point of introducing an amendment which brings it right back again? The purpose of estate duty was presumably&#x2014;we do not have to go back to Sir William Harcourt to find it&#x2014;to reduce inequality of wealth caused by inheritance. Sir William was a Liberal, and I am a Liberal. I do not believe that the span of years distinguishes between us. That purpose is certainly something I wholeheartedly

accept in principle, though how far inheritance causes inequality may be a matter of debate.<br/>
The only research that has been done on how far inheritance causes inequality in the distribution of wealth has been done by Professor Harbury. In yesterday's Press we were informed that he had renewed his dedication to the task by undertaking a study into where rich women get their riches. You will notice, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that he does not call it a study&#x2014;</p>

<p>Indeed not, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was going to point out that this gentleman was conducting a study not into how rich women get their riches but where they get them. If he had adopted the former course he would have had a best seller.<br/>
Inheritance is not the only cause of inequality. Estate duty may have stopped inequality getting worse but it did not do much to reduce it, and that was not only because of the lifetime loophole. Owners of great wealth usually get a higher return on their wealth. Certainly they get a much larger capital gain on their wealth than do owners of small wealth. Large wealth owners are also far better able to take advantage of the lifetime loophole because they are far better advised. They are able to pay for the advice. Now the Government are reintroducing the lifetime loophole. If it had not been for the fracas earlier over the remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees), I might almost have been inclined to think that it would be in the interests of the Chief Secretary, when in some future incarnation he goes back to his practice after having deserted the Front Bench to reintroduce the loophole. To do so would create a bed of roses for accountants. Our amendment, therefore, urges the Government not to go back to the lifetime loophole.<br/>
Let us take a step further the logic of what the Government are proposing


concerning the rates. Without a gifts tax the avoidance of estate duty was far too easy, and because this reduced the power of estate duty to cut down the inequalities caused by inheritance the Government introduced the capital gains tax. The case of avoidance was lessened by the seven-year <i>inter vivos</i> provision for gifts. We know very little about the giving of gifts in Britain but we know a great deal about the giving of gifts in the United States. There the gifts tax is at a different rate from estate duty. The two taxes are not fully integrated. There is, therefore, considerable incentive to give gifts <i>inter vivos.</i> It is not as great an incentive as has hitherto existed here because in this country, provided that the donor survived the seven years, the gift was free of tax altogether.<br/>
The evidence in America suggests two things. First, among the less wealthy the giving option was not fully exercised. It also suggests&#x2014;this is the point I want the Government to deal with&#x2014;that the wealthiest people in America indulge in <i>inter vivos</i> gifts almost as a way of life. That will be the case here if the amendment is made in its present form. The wealthiest will find it easier to give their money away. After all, they are giving away only some of their wealth, not all of it. If a person has &#x00A3;1 million, it is not too irksome for him to give &#x00A3;300,000 of it and get the benefit of reduced tax rates. Under the American experience, however, someone who is less wealthy finds it very much more difficult to do that because he then loses his independence.<br/>
The Government's lower rates on gifts tax cover only cumulative gifts of &#x00A3;300,000, and this will still help the very wealthiest. The figure of &#x00A3;300,000 does not represent poverty by any manner of means. At lifetime rates &#x00A3;300,000 has a net value of &#x00A3;196,000, which is what remains after the tax has been paid. At the full rate &#x00A3;300,000 has a net value of &#x00A3;155,000, so that there is a saving of &#x00A3;40,000 on a total amount of &#x00A3;300,000, which is not to be sneezed at.<br/>
I wonder whether the Government in introducing this quite appalling principle of the lifetime loophole have looked at the American evidence and, if they have, whether they reckon that that experience will be repeated over here. I do not need

to prove to the Government's satisfaction the exact extent of avoidance by the lifetime loophole. The Government have already stated that that is a major method of avoidance. They introduced the tax to remove the incentive to avoid estate duty. They have now reintroduced it, and I want to know why. They have never begun to tell us. I hope we may be told in the course of this debate.</p>

<p>Since this sum is so often represented by a business, if &#x00A3;10,000 represents one job we cannot go on arguing in this way without coming back to employment. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us how the Liberal Party would deal with that?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman had looked at Amendment No. 80 he would have realised what we are doing. For every gift on death, what the Conservatives' amendment is seeking to do affects a very limited number of legacies on death; and I marvel at their moderation. They have been unnecesarily timid in limiting their amendment. But I do not actually believe that Opposition Members make their case much stronger by pretending that employment and small businesses will collapse and that the whole British economy will collapse and slide into the North Sea as a result of this tax. It may well be that the whole British economy will slide into the North Sea, but it will not be because of this tax. I can think of many other things which are much more likely to get us there.<br/>
Distinguishing between the rates of tax on gifts and on legacies produces great unfairness. Again, I do not quite understand what the Government are at. Not all people are as well able as others to make gifts. Some property or parts of property are easy to give while other property is not. Therefore some people will be able to avoid the full rate, not because they are generous or good people. There may be some who have patriotic objections to this method of avoidance. There will not be many of them today I suspect, but there may still be some left.<br/>
It is also a negative tax on gambling. It is gambling on death, and the price is a reduced rate of tax under the Government's amendments. The Government are saying "You may take a gamble on your death. If you win, we will reduce your tax. If you are dead, it does not


matter to you anyway. But we will tax you more heavily as a penalty for dying too soon." That was what estate duty did.<br/>
I cannot think why the Government have introduced capital transfer tax at all. We might have gone on with estate duty at slightly lower rates. The greatest argument as between lifetime and death rates is the effect on inequality. The Chancellor and I both wish to reduce the inequalities of weath but I would make a better job of it than he has done. That is the essential difference between us. Here the right hon. Gentleman has introduced the wrong tax for that purpose and has changed it to produce an even worse effect on equality. He has decided that the rate to be introduced was too high for lifetime gifts. Therefore, he should accept the logic of the argument and reduce both rates. If he does not want to reduce his revenue because he is worried about his borrowing requirement&#x2014;and I do not wonder at that&#x2014;I would far rather he had introduced an amendment providing a compromise rate, somewhere between the two, so that at least it was the same for both types of gifts and ensured that his revenue would be maintained.<br/>
I hope that the Government will accept the argument I have adduced on the single rate of tax which is contained in our Amendment No. 80. I hope they will recognise that it is a totally logical argument and would produce a very much better tax than that originally introduced, and certainly very much better than the one we are to be stuck with this if the Government amendment goes through. We have taken the table which the Government introduced for the lower-level gift and have sought to apply it right across the board to all types of gift. That seems to be by far the most sensible thing that the Government could do.</p>

<p>I should like to bring into the debate the Scottish dimension which was introduced by the hon. Members for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) and Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve). They might perhaps be more helpful to their constituents if they supported Amendment No. 439 on page 667, which seeks to give greater relief from the tax

to small companies and goes further in the tax slice than do the Government for companies which are moving towards public quotation.<br/>
Large companies are well able to look after their growth and financial affairs, whereas small companies are not. When a company is worth &#x00A3;1 million or &#x00A3;2 million, I suggest that the time has come for an even more significant redistribution than that proposed by the Government. Small companies are different. They do not just happen. They are created by men and women of vision and imagination. I hope that the Minister will accept that my arguments are not made from a hyperbolic and doctrinal standpoint, as were the arguments put forward by the Conservatives, but from a practical point of view.<br/>
I am not talking about thousands of pounds being made in a few minutes on the Stock Exchange. I am not talking about companies like Wm. Lowdon &amp; Son which has donated generously to the Scottish Labour Party. I am talking about what causes a seed to flower or an acorn to grow, or what causes one job to become two.<br/>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Mitchell) referred to Scotland and Wales. In Scotland there are proportionally more small businesses than there are in England, and the proportion will grow because of what the Scottish National Party calls Scottish oil. That development is spawning small companies in Aberdeenshire, in the North-East of Scotland and throughout the whole country, and similar developments are taking place in electronics.<br/>
The Under-Secretary of State for Industry recently said that almost 90 per cent. of all manufacturing establishments in Scotland employ fewer than 250 people. He went on to say that these smaller firms were specially important in a number of industries of key importance to the Scottish economy. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State and the Treasury will speak with one voice when they seek to promote small industries in Scotland.<br/>
The growth of locally-owned industries of high technology in Central Scotland is vital if we are to break away from our dependence on heavy industry. I am sure that the Minister wishes to see more&#x2014;not fewer&#x2014;indigenous jobs in Scotland. The severity of the level of the tax will lead to


the break-up of Scottish-owned companies and asset strippers will be the first to benefit. It will also lead to the takeover of Scottish companies by London-based institutions, against which the Scottish Council, the STUC and the Scottish Council of the CBI have consistently and continually inveighed.<br/>
Let us take as an example a small Scottish company with an annual turnover of &#x00A3;300,000 or &#x00A3;400,000 and a net asset value of &#x00A3;100,000, &#x00A3;120,000 or &#x00A3;130,000. Let us assume that it has been going for 10 years and employs 100 people, and that it was started by a man aged 35 who is now 45. If that man dies, his wife and offspring must find &#x00A3;40,000, or even &#x00A3;50,000, and that effectively will lead to the end of the company. Therefore, the takeover of that company no doubt will soon follow by a London-based institution, thus once again bringing about centralisation.<br/>
We in the SNP do not wish this to happen. For the sake of the creation of more indigenous companies in Scotland and to prevent their takeover by institutions in London, we ask the Government to think again about Amendment No. 439. It seeks to give more relief at the lower end of the tax scale and is even more penal than is the Government's own provision at the top end of the scale.</p>

<p>It is absurd to say that the tax will destroy family businesses. It will not. I am concerned not about the fact that the tax is too hard but about the fact that it is too soft. The Labour Government made a number of concessions in Committee. For example, a joint business involving a man and wife will have to reach a value of &#x00A3;30,000 before it even contemplates paying any tax. Over a period of time, with the allowance of &#x00A3;1,000, the couple could manage to move a considerable amount of wealth from one person to another without the possibility of paying tax. That alarms me.<br/>
The Government Front Bench has been generous and has taken account of some Opposition representations. When the Opposition speak of the destruction of family businesses, it is all part of a united campaign to frighten people outside the House into believing that it is a penal tax. What is certain is that the tax will be difficult to avoid. That is the basis of the Opposition's fear. The CTT will not be like the old estate duty. It will be a tax that will be applied. If the Opposition are so keen on tax loopholes, why do they not say to the PAYE man, who has no alternative but to pay tax, "Look for loopholes and we shall provide you with accountancy services free." In the past the payment of tax has depended, not on eligibility but on the degree of the accountant's ingenuity. Ordinary working men and women do not employ an accountant to scrutinise their wages.</p>

<p>I am appalled at the hon. Gentleman's intervention. Is he saying that a doctor would conspire to provide an employee with a certificate to enable him to take several weeks' sick leave in a spurious circumstance? That is characteristic. If a small business man is ill, that is an onerous circumstance. However, if an employee is involved, that is a dodge. That is characteristic of the attitude of the Opposition towards this tax.<br/>
I shall quote evidence to support my point. The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) said:
<q>This is not a tax which, in the words of the Opposition, is voluntary and avoidable. This is a tax which will have to be paid because all the loopholes have been stopped up. As I explained earlier, the only reason I always believed estate duty to be tolerable was that there were loopholes. Not that there are no loopholes in this tax, it is not tolerable."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report Standing Committee A;</i> 4th February 1975, c. 658.]</q>
It is not a question of equity, of redistribution of wealth, of a fairer society, of people making a contribution to society. Nor is it a question of the benefit of mankind or of the community. The question is what people can get out of it for themselves and what they can grab and put into their own pockets. That is the basis of the Opposition's attitude towards this tax. What do they say when they must pay it? They say, "It is a dreadful tax and we are embarking on a Marxist society. Family life will break down." That is the extraordinary overemphasis which the Opposition have produced. Yet the Government have given tax concessions to the do-it-yourself builder, who is the creator, more than anybody else, of the family home. The Labour Government did that&#x2014;not the Conservatives when they were in power.<br/>
The Government are accused because greedy people have decided that this tax cannot be avoided and that they will have to pay it. Those greedy people are alarmed. When the Opposition say that the &#x00A3;30,000 allowance is not very much they will hear hollow laughter from the millions of working men and women for whom &#x00A3;1,000 is almost unattainable.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Watt) and I share a good deal of concern for people with small businesses. The hon. Gentleman is critical of people owning big businesses such as Mr. Cummings, and obtained valuable publicity from a critical letter which he wrote to a Sunday paper. I do not think that there is much to divide us.<br/>
We must set the record straight. This tax is not onerous, nor is it heavy. I am concerned that Ministers have given away too many concessions. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that when this tax has been in operation and the position has been reviewed, it will be made to work even more equally than it does now, and that some of the concessions already granted, albeit in a generous, co-operative spirit, will be reviewed upwards rather than downwards.<br/>
The message must go out from the House of Commons that the Labour Party is embarking on a taxation system in which tax avoidance and loopholes are being stopped and that the man on the shop floor who pays his tax before he receives his money is not in a position to manipulate anything, since he cannot afford to employ an accountant to see what loopholes there are, and must face a greater burden of everyday life than some of the small business men who have been described by the Opposition.<br/>
I do not dispute that some business men make a useful contribution to the community. Those who do will be prepared to pay this tax because they are not the kind of people who pursue tax avoidance. Any person playing a part in the community will see that tax revenue provides the services and needs which the whole community shares. But those who say that the Labour Government are producing a tax which will burden the rich are people who for many years have been avoiding tax.<br/>
Outside this House people will say that that is precisely why they elected a Labour Government. They did not elect a Labour Government to provide those who have all the wealth with loopholes. The Labour Government represent the vast majority of working people who earn their livelihood either by brain or by hand. They have put us here to make


sure that our policy of redistributing the nation's wealth is carried out so that those who have the wealth see it transferred to those who have not.<br/>
That is our policy. That is what this tax is about. We welcome this tax, and we shall go out from this Parliament proud of our Front Bench and proud of the Treasury. That is not a view which is universally maintained, but certainly on this issue they have done a good job. We shall remember the snide innuendoes from the Opposition, made in a discreditable and disgraceful attempt to disgrace the Treasury Bench. We shall remember how that attempt was put down firmly by the united action of back benchers and the Treasury Bench.<br/>
We are here to see that Labour policy is put into action, and the Treasury Bench need be in no doubt that when Labour Party policy is put into action, Government supporters feel proud of them and will go out in the country to spread the message that the Labour Government are working to redistribute wealth. That is why we are here.</p>

<p>I for one am glad to know why the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) is here, though his statement that the capital transfer tax was a splendid tax because it had appeared in two Labour manifestos was not a reason which I think would be shared universally. But it is the case that throughout the years Labour Governments have produced new taxes, additional taxes and even taxes which have not appeared in Labour party manifestos. One example was the selective employment tax. But I do not think anyone can claim rationally that the capital transfer tax is a good tax.<br/>
The hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) made a most striking intervention and raised a number of matters which his right hon. and hon. Friends on the Treasury Bench have been quite unable to deal with during the course of our debates in Committee and on the Floor of the House. Although the hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) attempted in part to answer the hon. Gentleman's questions, his colleagues on the Treasury Bench failed to point out that the difference between the capital transfer tax and the estate duty is that,

when the capital transfer tax is payable, the capital gains tax is by definition payable as well, whereas with the estate duty there is no capital gains tax to pay. For that reason, it is impossible to say what the rate of effective tax will be in any given disposition. It depends on the value of the asset at the time and on the appreciation in that value at the time.<br/>
What is certain is that the capital transfer tax will be a very considerable burden on businesses both large and small, but especially on small businesses. Again, the Government have failed to deal with inflation. Here, this will be a most difficult matter if inflation continues at anything like its present rate of some 20 per cent. a year. If it goes on like this&#x2014;I do not believe it can without a collapse&#x2014;it means that the table in the Bill for the capital transfer tax will bite very hard indeed. Of course, the capital gains tax will also come into play. That will make life for small businesses almost impossible.<br/>
I give a practical example of what could occur from what the Chief Secretary has said. The right hon. Gentleman gave us an example of a business worth &#x00A3;250,000 which is given by the owner to his son. The capital transfer tax payable would be about &#x00A3;76,000. That could be paid over eight years. What the Government have failed to point out is that most businesses of that kind are incorporated. How are the assets to be produced to pay the tax? That can be done only by selling assets within the business. It is very difficult to understand how the business can continue if the plant and machinery is sold. I suppose that the money could be provided, if the cash were in the business, by paying higher dividends, but dividends are taxed at a very high rate. Similarly, if a loan were made by the company to the son to pay the tax, that would be accounted for as if it were a dividend payment. The fact that most small businesses are incorporated makes the position extraordinarily difficult. That is a practical point which neither the Government nor their supporters have taken on board.<br/>
The Chief Secretary and other Treasury Ministers have talked a great deal in comparing the capital transfer tax with estate duty. They say that there is now an opportunity of blocking loopholes and putting right the situation which has


existed for far too long. Estate duty has persisted in its present form for so long because previous Chancellors, both Labour and Conservative, have recognised what would happen if a capital transfer tax or a gifts tax were to be imposed. I do not know whether Sir Stafford Cripps or Mr. Snowden were Chancellors who were unwilling to raise taxation. I would not recognise them in that r&#x00F4;le. I am sure that in the past Socialist Chancellors have considered many ways in which taxation could be increased. The reason that they have not reverted to a capital transfer tax is probably that they recognise that the business of this country has been formed because of the existence of small businesses. What is likely to happen now is that the structure of industry and business will be affected by the capital transfer tax. It is difficult to know where the assets and resources are to be found to pay the tax. What is certain is that great difficulty will arise.</p>

<p>Perhaps my hon. Friend would like to deal with the position of a company which is assessed for capital transfer tax and capital gains tax combined. A company could be assessed for a figure in excess of the total value of its assets. How are those called upon to pay the tax to find the money.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is one of the great drawbacks of the tax with which the Government have persistently refused to deal. We cannot consider the capital transfer tax in isolation. It is a tax that must be considered in conjunction with the capital gains tax. That is something that the Government have persistently refused to consider. It is clear that small businesses will be greatly affected. The Government have given great attention to the position of those who own the businesses and we have paid a great deal of attention to the employers who will be placed in the difficulty of finding the tax. But what will happen to the employees in small businesses? There are no fewer than 6 million people employed in small businesses. That is a matter to which the Government have not addressed themselves.<br/>
There can be only one solution to the problem. In many cases the tax will not be able to be found out of the resources

of the businesses concerned. The only alternative will be to sell the business. Everyone knows what the position will be if the business is sold. It will be sold to a larger concern. The larger concerns will have much wider selection than before in picking out the small companies that they wish to buy and the price will in all probability be lower in consequence. It will not be a good bargain.<br/>
What will be the position of employees in these myriad businesses all over the country? The outlook is that the company will be taken over by a large concern. We all know from experience in our constituencies what happens when that kind of event takes place. The company loses its identify and direct contact with management, and employees lose the interest that they may have had in that company's direct success because they do not feel tied to the success of the larger organisation. They feel remote from the control. However successful that organisation may be in a general sense, the transfer of ownership and management to a remote centre will do great harm to the efficient running of a small business. This is a matter of grave concern.<br/>
The trend towards larger concerns has been going on over the last 10 years. Though it was popular at that time, I think that it is probably a mistaken trend. The trend towards large takeovers for the good reasons that have often been provided, such as economies of scale and so forth, have in retrospect largely been mistaken, and I believe that industrial organisations are finding that to be the case.<br/>
For example, one wonders whether Leyland Motors would have been greatly more successful had the merger not gone through. Leyland Motors in its old way was successful making buses, lorries, and some cars. In my view, that concern would have operated more successfully had it continued to act independently.<br/>
The result of large mergers and reorganisations in many companies has led to loss of identity which in turn has created great problems with the loss of management skill in being able to get through to the workers and, even more important, in the employees' ability to


get through to management and the people who can take decisions. The capital transfer tax will exacerbate this tendency. We shall find many small companies getting into the net of large companies. We should do our best to reverse that unfortunate trend.<br/>
In this morning's <i>Financial Times</i> I read an interesting article by Sam Brittan who was contrasting the position in this country with that in other countries of the trend of working people going towards non-productive jobs. He suggested that 29 per cent. of the population are now employed in either the Civil Service or local authorities and services. That is a higher figure than in any comparable country. That is another bad trend. It is a trend both towards large organisations and out of production into non-productive and Civil Service organisations of one kind or another.<br/>
The capital transfer tax will have unfortunate social implications as well. It would be wrong to leave this point without recognising the effect of capital transfer tax and the wealth tax, whenever the provisions are made known, combined with the capital gains tax.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
The future for small businesses is very bleak. I am certain that hon. Members on both sides of the House will have had letters from constituents, small businessmen, who now see the future in very bleak terms. I wish to quote from one such letter:
<q>After years of study and then experience in the electrical industry I qualified for membership of the Association of Supervisory Electrical Engineers, now the Association of Supervisory and Executive Engineers. Now I am self-employed, having my own small business, and there are two factors worrying me.</q>
<q>Firstly, the measures designed with either malice or sheer ignorance to tax small businesses out of existence mean that I have now a powerful incentive to do what our enemies always accuse businessmen of doing&#x2014;fiddling every penny possible. This I have never done in the past, having some respect for a system that seemed&#x2014;if not quite fair&#x2014;at least a reasonable compromise.</q>
<q>Colleagues who operate in Sweden tell me that the introduction there of extreme socialist measures similar to those now going through Parliament have resulted in the widespread growth of bribery and corruption. I can well understand this and unless there is some drastic moderation of the capital transfer measures

and of the obvious bias against small free enterprises which cannot easily be nationalised I shall consider I am justified &#x2026; in doing everything I can to hang on to every penny I earn &#x2026; I have been approached by Canadian, Australian and South African organisations which are actively encouraging entrepreneurs to quit the United Kingdom for a more invigorating atmosphere in their countries, and may yet follow their advice.</q>
I am certain that many small businesses throughout the country have had a similar experience. This trend towards larger concerns will bring about massive unemployment, and the situation is already extremely serious.</p>

<p>The letter which the hon. Gentleman just read is important, but it is equally important to hear how he replied to it. It is imperative that people who write that kind of letter should receive a lecture on law and order as it relates to tax evasion in the way that one hears one delivered in respect of so many other areas of policy.</p>

<p>That intervention demonstrates the hon. Gentleman's attitude to this whole matter. The writer of the letter was not talking about evading taxation. There was no question of evading taxation under estate duty. Small businesses were properly able to make their own arrangements.<br/>
Unless CTT is modified, and unless the wealth tax is far less onerous than we apprehend, the future for small businesses will be extremely serious. Productive enterprises in this country will suffer greatly as the result of this tax. That feeling is shared by many people and many small firms throughout the country. This provision will be carried through at great risk of further unemployment, which is already serious, and at the risk of damaging the economy of the country.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Tomlinson) seems to have developed a habit this week&#x2014;I do not know whether he acquired it in Committee upstairs&#x2014;of prolonging the speeches of Conservative Members by intervening 30 seconds before they decide to sit down. I assure my hon. Friend that I may need his help on occasions, but I am certain that Tory Members do not need any additional inducement to take up the valuable time allotted to the House for this debate.<br/>
I propose to take up two points made by the hon. Member for Horsham and Crawley (Mr. Hordern). He referred to non-productive jobs in local government. I do not know to which jobs he was referring but, having spent many years as an elected local government member, I view that as a slur upon the hardworking individuals who are employed by local authorities. They are men of integrity and they work extremely hard, and the hon. Gentleman's language does nothing but denigrate them. I deplore slanderous language of that kind.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to small businesses, and I propose to say something about them. I am the Member for Leicester, South. As hon. Members probably know, Leicester is famed as a relatively prosperous city. That prosperity has been built up by small private firms.<br/>
Last Tuesday a delegation of Leicester hosiery manufacturers came to see their Members of Parliament about the capital transfer tax. I said that I would report their views to the Chancellor. I have not yet conveyed that information to the Chancellor. Leicester is fortunate in having three Labour Members of Parliament, for which my right hon. and hon. Friends are in debt to the wisdom of the electorate of that city. I may have referred to Leeds on one or two occasions. I am not a Member for Leeds although I spent some of my formative years there, and if I refer to Leeds it is due to my enthusiasm for that city.<br/>
I shall mention a few of the points which the hosiery manufacturers made to me. The Minister has to reply to the points made by other hon. Members and I hope that he will be able to spend a little time on the points I wish to put to him so that the potential fears of the hosiery manufacturers and their employees can be allayed. I shall mention five points. The first is that companies will sell out to larger companies, if possible, who will then rationalise and thus reduce employment. Secondly, companies will decide to reduce their scale of operations to reduce the amount of tax they have to pay. Thirdly, many companies will refuse to spend money on a dead duck; they will not invest in new machinery and there will be a loss of employment. Fourthly, owners will refuse to face the difficulties facing them and will go out of

business. Fifthly, many companies will not have sufficient finance and will simply fade away.<br/>
The Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary have answered these points in Committee. I shall be grateful if they will indicate to the employers and employees of Leicester that it is the Government's intention not to reduce the level of employment in Leicester but to ensure that the present low level of unemployment will be reduced even further by their wise and commendable economic policies.<br/>
Having done my duty to my constituents I turn to Labour Party policy, because it is that policy which we are implementing in the Bill. I said on Tuesday that I fought two elections last year on this policy. It is our intention to redistribute not only income but wealth. This legislation is designed to bring that about. My hon. Friends do not intend to achieve that at the expense of employment, which lion. Friends opposite assert that the Bill will do&#x2014;</p>

<p>Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that the Bill will do precisely what he says it will not do&#x2014;that is create unemployment&#x2014;simply because it does not differentiate between those who will not and those who cannot pay the tax?</p>

<p>I am sure the hon. Member knows the answer to that, which my hon. Friends on the Front Bench have provided <i>ad infinitum.</i> I refer him to the answer which already appears in <i>Hansard</i> this week. We are implementing Labour Party policy to which we are committed and we will ensure that it is implemented, we hope by Monday.<br/>
Only the unwise had to pay estate duty. I was delighted when the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe) agreed with our policy and criticised us only for its lack of severity. It is good to know that Liberal Members support the Bill and will show by their votes that they want it passed as soon as possible. We must replace estate duty by a tax which is not paid only by the unwise. I and my hon. Friends support that aim.<br/>
I have put several points to the Ministers which were put to me by the Leicester deputation. If they can reply and give some assurance to the people of Leicester, I shall be greatly in their debt.</p>

<p>It is as well that we have largely been free from the headline-seeking jibes and political antics of the Chancellor yesterday and have returned to the cold reality of some of the implications of this tax. There have been one-and-a-half speeches from the Labour side, which have conscientiously and fairly reflected many of our worries. The speech of the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) was particularly telling, and it is a pity that the hon. Member for Leicester South (Mr. Marshall) did not stop when he had put his five telling questions.<br/>
As the Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary know, we have had many debates over the last few weeks about the overall effects of this tax as well as its details. I want to use this opportunity to make one last attempt to put to the Financial Secretary what I think is the main thrust&#x2014;to use his favourite phrase&#x2014;of our concern about this tax, which has nothing to do with the preservation&#x2014;as he would seem to put it&#x2014;of the position of a privileged few, but has everything to do with the deeply damaging effects the tax will have on many aspects of the economy.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
I want to put my case as coolly and practically as possible, without emotional or philosophical overtones, so that the Financial Secretary can try to answer my points at the end of the debate. He has signally failed to do this so far.<br/>
The Government have always concentrated, to date, on the total wealth of the transferor or transferee. However, it seems that throughout all our debates the Financial Secretary and the Chief Secretary have totally failed to distinguish between free assets&#x2014;such things as houses, marketable stocks and shares and other personal assets&#x2014;and assets which are tied up. I want to concentrate on that matter.<br/>
Regarding free assets, I suppose that it could be argued that individuals who are

in the position of having totally free assets will not be severely affected by this tax because they will spend those assets during their lifetime. Indeed, I thought that a cartoon that I saw recently fairly aptly summed up the sort of situation that we shall see in solicitors' offices on the many occasions when wills are read&#x2014;that the deceased had quite substantial assets not very long ago, but, being of sound mind, he had spent them. In this situation, therefore, it could be argued that the only people who will suffer will be the successors of those individuals.<br/>
I leave aside the argument that there is a general effect on the economy in the sense that savings will be severely affected, particularly when one takes account of the other capital taxes and the very high rates of taxation on savings income nowadays. We have heard those arguments many times and I shall not elaborate on them now, because I despair o; ever getting the present Government to see the point.<br/>
I want to return to the situation in which the assets are tied up. It is here that the economic effects come through&#x2014;to the farms and the firms. I should still like to know what representations the Ministry of Agriculture has put to the Treasury about the effects of this tax on farming. But I deal now with the situation in regard to firms.<br/>
There are three arguments to which we have still not had satisfactory replies. The first is that in these situations the assets themselves are tied up. In other wards, they are not free to be spent by the family. The second argument&#x2014;this has been brought out time and again in this debate&#x2014;is that there is a genuine problem about where the money will come from to pay for this tax. The third argument is that it will have severe economic and employment effects in many areas, to which we have drawn attention time and again.<br/>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) is not in the Chamber at present. As he usually does, he made a very fair speech. He said that the tax, particularly on lifetime gifts, was not unduly onerous up to total assets of &#x00A3;100,000. Thanks to the concession which we obtained in Committee about lifetime gifts and the halving of the rates up to that point, it could be argued


that that is so; although, as we have constantly pointed out, the levels of tax, even up to &#x00A3;100,000, are much greater here than in most other countries. However, I am concerned about the situation above the &#x00A3;100,000 point. This matter was not brought out by the hon. Member for Llanelli.<br/>
First, after the case where the total assets of the firm, let us say, are more than &#x00A3;100,000, the tax rates start to rise very steeply indeed. Second, at current rates of inflation increasing numbers of small businesses will be moving into the &#x00A3;100,000 position. Third, at current rates of inflation the houses and other personal assets of the owners concerned will have to be added to the assets, and that will immediately put up the tax rates on the business. Fourth&#x2014;the most important point&#x2014;we are talking about small businesses and private companies.<br/>
It is worth bearing in mind that it is the firms whose total value is well over the &#x00A3;100,000 mark&#x2014;I shall come shortly to a &#x00A3;400,000 illustration&#x2014;which are the major employers of substantial numbers of people. The very small businesses, shops and so on, up to the &#x00A3;100,000 mark are, by and large, not big employers, taken on their own. But firms above that level often employ substantial numbers of people and are the main employers in many of our smaller towns and villages.<br/>
The &#x00A3;1,000 annual exemption can easily be exaggerated. I believe that the hon. Member for Llanelli said that there was a Government amendment which would enable that exemption to be rolled over. As I understand the amendment, the rolling over is for only one year. We welcome the concession, but it does not have the implications that the hon. Gentleman suggested. The other point about the &#x00A3;1,000 exemption is that in the early years of the build-up of a firm, or when the owners are younger, they will not want to use the concession year by year.<br/>
The real point, however, is that the capital transfer tax rates, even on a business worth up to &#x00A3;100,000, must be added to the other capital taxes. It is the accumulation of different types of capital taxes which will cause the biggest damage. We now learn that the Government are to bring back the capital

gains tax on top for the transfer on death.<br/>
The answer to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Tomlinson), who put his case fairly, is that he may well be right about many businesses worth up to &#x00A3;100,000 but that there are all the other effects. We are particularly concerned with the smaller and medium-sized private companies valued well above that figure.<br/>
The point was brought home to me one evening in Standing Committee. I am glad that the Financial Secretary is to reply, because he will recall that I raised the illustration of a company worth &#x00A3;400,000 and pointed out the cumulative effect of capital transfer tax and capital gains tax on the original transfer, which I put at 100 per cent. in that case. I also said that if assets were realised to pay the tax, if they were available to the transferor or transferee elsewhere, capital gains tax had to be paid on those assets.<br/>
I shall not give the figures, because I do not want to quote too many, but the figures on those facts were horrifying. The hon. Gentleman said at that time that I had taken an extra example, and that he would put forward a more realistic and reasonable example.</p>

<p>I was about to come on to that point. Even where businesses can find a willing buyer, there will be implications of the sort my hon. Friend has mentioned.<br/>
But there will be other implications. The large public company, which will be the normal buyer in such situations, will often be looking for different rates of return on capital from those that the family business would be prepared to accept. If the family businesses are small and in peripheral areas, they will be less likely to give proper top management time to them. Therefore, the large firm may often run down the business, or simply eliminate the competition. Therefore, the situation will arise where, in times of economic stagnation or squeeze on profitability or cash flow, such as we


now have, parts of the larger organisations will be vulnerable in a way in which they would not have been in if they had remained in private hands and control, and therefore that will immediately have implications for local economy and local employment.</p>

<p>I, too, am a Scot and, as I have told the hon. Member before, he must not be too partisan. There are many parts of England, including in my own constituency, where this effect will be felt, but I take the hon. Member's point that the provision will very much affect Scotland and Wales.<br/>
Another alternative is to find another private buyer. But again, knowing that he will eventually have to meet the heavy CTT and capital gains tax burden himself in due course there is no incentive for another private buyer to take on that extra burden knowing that little will come out of it. If the owner cannot find a buyer he will be unable to sell the business intact. The view may be taken that it is worth little and could therefore be pased on to the next generation at that price. However, since the business will be valued on the assets price the only way to meet the situation in which he wants to sell but cannot do so will be to break up the assets, with the consequential adverse effect that will have on local employment.<br/>
Another possibility is that the business may be run down and parts of it sold off to meet the tax. Perhaps it would be run down so that the owner could enjoy the fruits of his earlier labour in the knowledge that he would face a smaller tax bill in the end. There is therefore an element of the geriatric charter in the capital transfer tax. It is certainly correct to say that it will act as a disincentive to new investment in firms and farms. It will act as a disincentive to building a business up and it will have dangerous effects on employment.<br/>
I make one final plea to the Financial Secretary and the Chief Secretary to accept that there is a genuine argument that, with the higher rates on firms or

farms where the assets are tied up and worth a fair amount of money, and where at some point because of the high rates of tax, the assets will be culled, there will be the most severely damaging economic effects.<br/>
I am all in favour of reform of capital taxes and I favour a great spread of wealth. I am strongly in favour of equality of opportunity, although I believe that part of the incentive to build up from that must be that it is possible to pass on a reasonable amount of the capital one has built up to one's children and future generations. In its present form, the capital transfer tax will have the most adverse effects on businesses and farms. If the Government are intent on introducing the capital transfer tax, as they obviously are, surely it is not beyond the wit of man to devise one which will take account of the situations of businesses and of farms.<br/>
On this account alone, the capital transfer tax is a devastating failure, hence our critical objections to it. It would be an advantage if we were considering much wider reforms of capital tax generally which would bring us more into line with other countries. In our debates we have considered the situation abroad a great deal. The more I look at the situation in Europe, the more I see a case for speedy harmonisation of taxation both of company and of personal taxation, certainly while this Government continue on their merry way.<br/>
Short of starting afresh with capital transfer tax and capital taxes generally, it seems to me that some of the amendments which are being put forward in this group would at least help to diminish the worst effects of the Bill on the businesses I have been describing.</p>

<p>Tonight's debate, like the debate on the Finance Bill generally, shows that the subject under discussion is one of the two great subjects which divide the two sides of the House. Issues that always divide us are the distribution of power and the distribution of influence. Another, which we are now debating, is the distribution of wealth. One of the reasons that I have spent my working life in the trade union movement is that I was persuaded at a very early age that there was


a great maldistribution of wealth. It was not that I subscribed to the politics of envy although I could not help sometimes being envious of those very much better off than I was; and I could not help but feel sorry as a child for those children who were very much worse off than I was.<br/>
I will not pursue tonight the politics of envy. This is an issue which is of very great concern to many of us. Before underlining why I feel strongly in favour of the introduction of capital transfer tax, and why I feel the Government have erred on the side of generosity, I suggest that the argument about the small business is one which has to be answered because if it were true that this tax would lead to reduced incomes for working people and reduced employment for them, I would listen to that argument very carefully.</p>

<p>The argument is evenly balanced because it has been my experience from observation that whereas some small businesses have brought advantages to our economic life, there is an argument that should be carefully considered that the r&#x00F4;le of the small business in British industry has been to minimise production, that the small business epitomises at the present time the lack of investment that has taken place in British industry and that it is in the small business that one finds inefficient, outdated methods and the second-generation inefficient management that has been so harmful to British industry.</p>

<p>Of course I have heard of the Bolton Committee Report. I was involved as PPS in the then Department of Technology as far back as 1969 when this subject was a matter of great concern. From my observation, bad pay is to be found in the small business and bad working conditions are to be found in the small business. If one wants to find the cowboys in the road haulage business one looks to the small road haulier. If one wants to find the most foul conditions in foundries, one looks at some of the small foundries. In North Staffordshire if one wants to see the worst conditions one goes not to Wedgwood or Doulton but to the very small potteries.</p>

<p>I would certainly compare the strike record in Wedgwood with that of any of the small potteries or brickyards in North Staffordshire. I have no precise figures, but from my own knowledge workers generally are happier in my locality with the larger than with the smaller employers. The advocates of the small business will have to work hard to persuade me that the death of the small business would be harmful. I do not bemoan the loss of the small shopkeeper. I prefer to shop at the large co-operative store rather than at the corner shop.<br/>
The nub of the argument is not the small business but the distribution of wealth. In a letter that was quoted earlier, a most revealing phrase was used&#x2014;"every penny I earn". The money that goes into the pockets of many business men has been earned not by their efforts but by the people who work for them. If the distribution of income was fair and rational there might be a case


against a capital transfer tax, but anyone with eyes to see knows that the distribution of income is unfair.<br/>
There is no way in which one can demonstrate that the rich have earned their money in the way that the baker, the miner or the engineer has earned his money. A great deal of wealth has been inherited. In no sense can it be said that those who have inherited wealth have earned it. The inheritance of wealth is a fortune of birth.<br/>
The Opposition are defending the unjust distribution of wealth. Many rich people have gained their wealth from speculation or from gambling. Speculation is a form of gambling. There can be no moral justification for the wealth that some people acquire. Those of us who defend the capital transfer tax say that it is only right that the wealth that has been acquired in this haphazard and unjust way should be redistributed. I feel as though I am living in a different world&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "You are."]&#x2014;from that of Opposition Members when they say that the first &#x00A3;100,000 is not too bad but that it is after that that the injustice comes. Of course I am living in a different world. The constituents I know best do not have &#x00A3;5 in the bank after Christmas or following their holidays.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman said that they spend it. Their average wage amounts to &#x00A3;50 a week before tax. It means that in a year they will earn at most &#x00A3;2,000. Over a lifetime those earnings amount to roughly &#x00A3;80,000. That is the sum Conservatives should be doing. The people I represent will earn only &#x00A3;80,000 during a lifetime of work. It is nonsense for the Opposition&#x2014;rich, affluent, privileged&#x2014;to scoff at my constituents who are broke after Christmas or after their summer holidays and who have no savings at all.<br/>
Many of my constituents who work in the potteries, electrical component factories, down the mines or in bakehouses have to think twice about going on strike for three weeks because they have not the capital resources to last them for that time. They have little share in the wealth

of the country. Therefore, it does not become Conservative Members to scoff at the fact that those workers have so small an amount of savings from their earnings.<br/>
If one sees those men working in their bakehouses, in the potteries, in the mines or at conveyer belts, one does not take the view that they do not work hard to earn their money. Of course they do. If one goes into a classroom and sees a teacher one knows that she too works hard to earn her money, and yet at the end of the year she has little left to invest. Compare that situation with the situation of the bookmaker, the stockbroker or the barrister.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore), who has belonged to that privileged group, will appreciate that in no sense did he earn so much more than the miner, the engineer or the factory worker. What he can say is that he received more and that his income was greater. I am sure my hon. Friend has never earned in any real sense more than the faceworker or the car component worker in my constituency. It has been a matter of luck that his standard of living has been so much greater than that of so many of my constituents. I cannot accept the Opposition's argument that the money which some people have earned should be kept and not taxed, because they did not earn it in the first place.<br/>
It is very important at the present time&#x2014;indeed, at all times&#x2014;that the distribution of incomes should be fairer. I find it repugnant to have to face constituents who have not enough to live on. We all have constituents trying to live on &#x00A3;18 to &#x00A3;20 a week from social security. We are discussing whether the edge can be taken off that poverty at the expense of richer people. The issue is whether the poor should benefit at the expense of the better-off.<br/>
10.0 p.m.<br/>
The wealth referred to by the Opposition means not only income but also security. They demand for themselves and their kind massive security compared with the lack of security experienced by many of my constituents, who cannot face old age with a feeling of security since


they have no savings. Although the Opposition may say that our people have spent it, they do not realise that men and women retiring today at 65 have received low pay during much of their lives and have not had the opportunity to save.<br/>
Wealth and title are possessed by a few people who can face a secure future. The Opposition, their class and their kind benefit from the poverty of the people I represent. That is the nub of the argument. That is why it is important for the Government to proceed with the capital transfer tax. My only regret is that the tax is not severe enough. When I hear the Opposition say that the tax is not too bad up to &#x00A3;100,000, my immediate reaction is that that means that the tax is not severe enough.<br/>
Referring to the figure of &#x00A3;80,000, if that is the total wealth which one of my well-paid constituents can earn in a lifetime&#x2014;does the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) wish me to give way?</p>

<p>I should be grateful if the hon. Member would stop being rude. He is shouting once again from a sedentary position.<br/>
This is what we expect from the Conservative Party when it is faced with a Government measure to bring about the redistribution of wealth for which we have worked so hard. The possession of wealth has not only meant that the Opposition and the class they represent have enjoyed greater security than that enjoyed by the people I represent. The possession of wealth has also given them greater privileges in respect of health, housing, education and power.<br/>
We have a situation where there are still two nations in this country. There are still clearly defined rich people who are over-privileged and who take more than their fair share. There are others&#x2014;the great majority, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Roberts) reminds me&#x2014;who are distinctly underprivileged in every way.<br/>
The only way in which the Labour Party can tackle this problem is by taking the wealth and the privilege away from those who have them and transferring

them to the vast bulk of the poor working people of the country.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend rightly said that one of the arguments related to giving the poor some benefit by taking away from the overprivileged section of the community. In addition there is an enormous benefit to be obtained in terms of the feeling of justice which it produces in our society. One of the great things operating against the effectiveness of our society is the injustice of society in the sense of injustice to working people, and this tax will make an important contribution towards reducing that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1910.6" hansard_membership_id="4936" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32579" speakername="Mr. Golding" colnum="1910" time="">
<p>It so happens that I was about to deal with that after making one or two further points. My hon. Friend's argument is a very good one. It has been one of the very great difficulties for Governments in this country since 1945 that appeals for restraint have generally had to be made against the background of conspicuous expenditure on the part of very many people in our society. Whether it be 1948, 1968 or 1975, it is very difficult for a Government to ask working people to restrain their expenditure when they see others living in conditions which are very much more comfortable than their own.<br/>
I do not believe that the argument of initiative carries very much weight in our society. It seems to me that, generally, the position to which we get in life is determined by&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not know whether you wish to call the Opposition to order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was tempted to talk of one-sided deafness.<br/>
I have never been persuaded of the argument that how far an individual progresses in life in this country is due to the amount of personal effort or initiative that he puts into his career. It seems that very much more important in our society is how much an individual has when he starts life. It seems that success is more dependent on the starting point than on the effort that the individual puts into his career. Basically that is unfair.<br/>
Many Conservative Members and the people they represent would have made a greater contribution to society had they not been given so much to begin with, had they not had handed to them a privileged place in our society. If they had not started life in that way they would have had to work very much harder and develop much more talent to arrive at the position that they now occupy.<br/>
It could well be argued that by taking privilege from individuals at an early age we shall get from them greater effort and greater achievement than we have seen so far. I apply that argument to the family business. A young person going into a public company is likely to exert far more effort and is likely to show much more initiative if his or her progression through the company is dependent upon effort and initiative. Such people will demonstrate much more initiative than those who have been given the golden pot and who are free to fritter it away.</p>

I think that hon. Gentlemen opposite must sort out whether they are or are not in favour of capital taxes. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor), who is not in his place, told us that he was in favour of capital taxes. Indeed, upstairs in Committee we heard other hon. Members say that they were in favour of capital taxes. But of what capital taxes are they in favour?<br/>
I should like to quote the words of one of the more revered Members of this House who, speaking of a certain capital tax, said:
<q>Many will mourn the passing of the loopholes more than those who will mourn the passing of the estate duty. What was so admirable about estate duty was that it was not always necessary to pay it. &#x2026; The great virtue of estate duty was that it was very often avoided. That seems to me to be the reason why it survived for so many years and grew into a state of respect, if not affection, among so many people. I gladly join in the tribute to the Estate Duty Office. I am certain that the officials there are as sad as the vast majority of people in the country that this admirable tax is now passing from us".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18th February 1975; c. 2237&#x2013;8.]</q>
It seems that in the end Conservative Members will come to love CTT in the same way as the hon. Member for Cirenceter and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) came to love estate duty.<br/>
The House of Commons is basically a happy place, but a tear came to my eyes

as I listened to the hon. Member for Horsham and Crawley (Mr. Hordern) telling us about patriotism and developing it as a theme in relation to this clause and CTT. A similar theme was developed in Committe upstairs, and the hon. Gentleman this evening read a letter to show how delicate a flower patriotism can be with his kind of people.<br/>
There seem to be a large number of people in this country who are playing this never-ending game of monopoly. They are for ever moving blocks of wealth and capital and capital into and out of Kruger-rands, into and out of real estate, into and out of hotels and when they fail they write a letter&#x2014;</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that CTT will be a stimulus to patriotism? These people will feel that they are making a greater contribution to the nation and to the working people whom my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Golding) mentioned.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend that this tax is a genuine test of patriotism, but it seems extraordinary that when these people have moved blocks of capital into and out of this sort of income for the purpose of tax avoidance and tax evasion they write to the hon. Member for Horsham and Crawley, and when that fails they decide to take themselves off to the Channel Islands or some rat-infested swamp which serves as a tax haven in some curious part of the world.</p>

<p>One of the best things we can do is to ensure that they get their &#x00A3;10 million as rapidly as possible.<br/>
The other thing that disturbs me is the ingratitude of Conservative Members for the unfailing efforts of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Chief Secretary, the Financial Secretary and other spokesmen from the Treasury to try to meet their needs. Tory Members make these proposals and ask for reductions and concessions, and when they get them they complain that they are not enough.<br/>
I want to raise one serious constitutional point about the operation of CTT in


respect of this clause and in relation to the changes that have been made. I do not go all the way with the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe) in claiming that the whole apparatus of Government in this country is rotten and in need of reform, but there is something slightly strange about the way in which we have introduced this amendment.<br/>
It was many months ago that we published a White Paper in which we set out the rates of tax which eventually appeared in Clause 35. The Bill was then published, and we had plenty of time to look at it. There followed a Second Reading debate, and there were no complaints from the Government benches about the rates in Clause 35. The House went into Committee and debated Clause 35, and I believe that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was involved in that debate on the Floor of the House. There was a long discussion about the merits and demerits of CTT in relation to the rates in the Bill, and we agreed them. Then we went into Committee and for 60 hours every speech made by Government spokesmen defended the rates of tax in the Bill.<br/>
Suddenly we find bits of paper on our desks telling us that rates of tax for transfers in life up to &#x00A3;100,000 are to be halved and that the rates are to be cut by one-third for transfers during life up to &#x00A3;250,000. Even with my admiration for the Treasury Front Bench team and for the civil servants&#x2014;I speak as a former civil servant&#x2014;this seems to be an extraordinary way to run a country.<br/>
Why did this come about? Was it because the Chancellor, the Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary decided that the rates had been pitched too high? I do not believe that it was. Or was it related to the threat by the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) that she would repeal this tax? We all know that that is an idle threat. It is easy enough for Opposition spokesmen to tell us that they will repeal this or that tax. When the crunch comes, the Treasury never repeals these taxes. Somehow income tax did not disappear and I very much doubt whether capital transfer tax will disappear.<br/>
What is the effect of the right hon. Lady's threats on the sensitive minds of

the Revenue officials? They might conceivably argue that if she really means it people will not make transfers of capital in life and therefore the Revenue will suffer. If those officials are unpatriotic, they may also say that it is conceivable that the Labour Party will lose the next General Election. The combination of the right hon. Lady's threat, the insensitivity of the Revenue and the lack of common sense in believing that it is a genuine possibility that Labour will lose the next election might be the real reason for these tax reductions.<br/>
In that sense some of us are worried about the scale of the reductions. I shall not vote against the Government tonight because I believe that we should show our good faith towards small shops and businesses, small farms and the like. We should say that we are prepared to give this a try. If, once the tax has settled down and people start to pay it and are not encouraged to adopt Poujadiste excesses, we can raise the rates to appropriate levels.<br/>
It is a pity that Conservative Members have used this harum scarum, hocus pocus nonsense about the effect of this tax on small shops and businesses. It does not behove them to create panic and carry on with these scare tactics. On Monday I told the House that I had received one letter objecting to the capital transfer tax. As a result of the hysterical pressure of Tory Members this week, I have now had another letter objecting to this tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) is right when he says that this exercise is part of the virility symbol of the right hon. Member for Finchley.<br/>
I see that the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) is about to leave the Chamber. Before he does, may I say that the contortions&#x2014;the hon. Member has come back. May I say that even a second's absence is too long for all of us. The hon. Member's remarks on this tax have summed up the contortions and distortions that have gone on about its effect. I distinctly remember his telling the House on Second Reading that this tax would lead to a Marxist State. In Committee I heard him say that the tax would mean that every small business would be bought out by Arabs and Americans, thus, presumably, developing


the capitalist State. It is that sort of nonsensical dialectic in the hon. Member's mind which brings the House into disrepute.</p>

<p>I am grateful to find that the hon. Member listens to my speeches with case. If he had listened with more care he would know that my thesis was that, although the intention, which I queried, was to create a Marxist State, the result would be that the conglomerates and the Arabs as well as the

<p>Not for the first time, I am in the difficult position of having to resolve the problem of not trespassing on the time of the House and yet at the same time not, unintentionally, failing to refer to any of the speeches which have been made.<br/>
Without going into detail on all the points raised, I would say that certain themes have come through clearly in the debate. First, many of the examples put to us by hon. Members opposite have assumed, as is perfectly proper for debating purposes, extreme situations&#x2014;small businesses with no assets outside their business or businessmen who had taken no previous steps to mitigate the possible incidence of capital transfer tax. If all those assumptions were true in any one case, of course the effects on the business concerned would be far worse under estate duty than that under our proposals. That is a fact which Conservative Members have been unable to deny. The more fair minded of them have recognised this. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor) is not in his place. He made one of the most reasonable speeches here, as he so frequently did in Committee, and I am sure that he would be one of the first to recognise that.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that agreement.<br/>
I recognise that many Conservative Members have legitimate concern about the whole array of capital taxes existing and proposed. That is why the House has set up a Select Committee to consider the wealth tax. Its terms of reference enable it completely to review the incidence and interaction of taxes now on the statute book and those contemplated for the near future.</p>

<p>I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. I am glad to see him.<br/>
My main text tonight would have served as the text for my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Golding) and Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore). It is true, of course, that one does need a text. I took down most carefully the words of the hon. Member for Basingstoke. They are akin to the words of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), which were quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West. The hon. Member for Basingstoke said that most people did not pay estate duty and that most small and medium-sized businesses did not pay tax. I gather that it is suggested that I have admitted that. I do not know whether that is the right verb to use. I certainly said that I never conceived that estate duty was a totally avoidable tax&#x2014;I have made that quite clear&#x2014;otherwise the Treasury would not have benefited from the yield it has had from the tax down the years.<br/>
What I said about estate duty was that it was largely paid by the unlucky, the ungenerous and the unwise, and that I could not see that that made a foundation for a fiscal system which would commend itself to reasonable men, whatever their political philosophies. Again, I am glad to see that some of the more enlightened Opposition Members are acknowledging that, though, despite the reassurances from the right hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir. G. Howe) and some of his hon. Friends that the Conservative Party is now unequivocally in favour of a tax on lifetime transfers, I am sure that he will have difficulty in persuading all of his hon. Friends to join him in support of that general principle.</p>

<p>On the point about the unlucky, the ungenerous and the unwise, the Financial Secretary will be aware that the tables of the Inland Revenue published every year show the


figures for the payment of estate duty over the whole range of estates, over a complete distribution. These tables show that several hundred millions of pounds were paid in estate duty last year over a wide range of estates. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that all these people&#x2014;and there are many thousands of them paying sums varying from a few hundred pounds to millions of pounds&#x2014;are either ungenerous, unlucky or unwise?</p>

<p>I would say that they were one of those three, if there were so many others who could have avoided paying it altogether. I am glad to have the acknowledgement of the hon. Member for Basingstoke. I hope that the hon. Gentlemen will communicate with each other and resolve their problems. The view of the hon. Member for Basingstoke was that most people did not pay estate duty.</p>

<p>By all means. I do not go as far as the hon. Gentleman. I accept what the hon. Member for Havant and Waterloo (Mr. Lloyd) said&#x2014;that the revenue from estate duty was considerable.<br/>
But the fact remains that it has been possible for many years for those who are well advised in these matters and who have the funds at their disposal to hire the best advice to be able to arrange their affairs so as to attract virtually no tax in the transmission of inherited wealth from generation to generation. As my hon. Friends have pointed out many times during the debate, that is what the capital transfer tax is all about. It is to bring a basic fairness into our tax system, to reduce the rates of estate duty, and to make sure that transmissions of wealth, however they occur&#x2014;whether of free assets or settled property, or whether the discretionary trust is used or some other form of trust instrument&#x2014;are taxed in the same way as they would be if those

assets were kept free from arrangements or settlements.<br/>
There have been many suggestions from Opposition Members that my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary and myself, with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, are deliberately setting about a course of trying to destroy small businesses. That, of course, is a preposterous accusation. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] Of Course it is. Hon. Members of the Opposition know better than that. I accept the hyperbole of debate. I am quite prepared to stand here and take the hyperbole seriously and deal with it in a moment.<br/>
If we were persuaded that the rates of tax were such as to lead to serious difficulties for small firms or lead to unemployment, of course we would look at them again. But my right hon. Friend and I are persuaded at present of nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not fail to reply to the question which has been repeatedly posed from the Opposition side, and was posed by the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey)&#x2014;where is the money to come from to pay the capital transfer tax on a company valued at &#x00A3;100,000 or &#x00A3;200,000?</p>

<p>I was about to discuss the three general types of business which one may encounter. First, there is the unsuccessful business, which, almost by definition, will have no tax problem because its assets will not be growing at a great rate, so that the higher rates of capital transfer tax will not apply to it. Then there are two other types of business&#x2014;the successful business which is growing very fast and is ploughing back all the money into the business, and the successful business which is not growing all that fast but is taking money out by way of dividend or payments to the proprietors, however it may be done.<br/>
For the third type of business, almost by definition there is virtually no problem because, in the situation I posed, there will be a constant flow of free assets into the hands of the owners of the business.</p>

<p>It depends on whether the business is successful. We had these discussions in Standing Committee at great length. I should have thought it self-evident, and we had various examples given in Standing Committee. If businesses have been making considerable profits such as we are talking about and have then been distributing them, it will be quite possible for the owners to pay the capital transfer tax out of that [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] All right. Hon. Members say that that is madness and that no one can accumulate capital in that way. All I can say is that if that is the case, we come back to what we were saying last night, that if it is impossible to accumulate assets in that way, and it is impossible to accumulate substantial amounts of wealth in that way, it follows that substantial amounts of wealth must have been inherited. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme said, it depends where one starts.</p>

<p>With a 20 per cent. rate of inflation, for most companies the replacement of assets means that they are on a negative cash flow. Unless one earns more than 30 per cent. after tax, one is on a negative cash

flow. It is the incompetence of the present Government which has organised the 20 per cent. rate of inflation, which must, in these terms, be ruining every company in the country.</p>

<p>The Minister has just accepted that in a time of high inflation, capital gains tax is a heavy burden. At least the last Conservative Government removed capital gains tax on death as an additional burden, and inflation then was nothing like as high as it is now. Why, then, are the Government allowing the continuance of the heavy burden of the capital gains tax here, which is what makes the burden penal on the small and medium-sized businesses?</p>

<p>It depends entirely on the structure of the capital gains tax. As the hon. Gentleman is well aware, the absence of capital gains tax on death created a distortion of economic markets and a locking-in effect of which the hon. Gentleman has been one of the first to complain.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. If he thinks that the absence of capital gains tax at death


created distortion, the remedy is simple: abolish it during life. As the Financial Secretary talked about the free flow of funds from a company to its shareholders, will he explain in simple language, so that the House can grasp it, just how shareholders can extract funds from those companies without incurring tax.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman also addressed himself to Amendment No. 80, in the name of his right hon. Friend the Member for Devon, North (Mr. Thorpe), which would in effect reduce the death rates to those we are suggesting for lifetime rates. That amendment would cost about &#x00A3;8 million in 1974&#x2013;75 and &#x00A3;60 million in 1975&#x2013;76. It will be no surprise to the hon.

<p>That is less than a satisfactory reply to what was quite a long speech, which was not at all about accession tax but entirely about the fact that the tax should be at one rate on gifts and deaths. I made the point that as the Government had accepted the principle right at the start of the tax, I expected that they would compromise on the rate, meeting us half way, so that they retained their revenue and did not increase their borrowing requirement.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford) spoke of the effect of the CTT on Scottish agriculture and forestry.

<p>What is so surprising about that? The rates of income tax fall to be varied at any time. The surprise of the hon. and learned Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees) is extraordinary. The rates of capital transfer tax, as of any other tax, fall to be reviewed from time to time. That is almost a banality. If it transpired that they appeared too low, or that certain reliefs were inappropriate, we would review them.<br/>
The affection and nostalgia of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury for estate duty are so great because it is a tax that one does not have to pay. We hope that we have successfully blocked all the major loopholes on the transfer from one generation to another of settled property and trusts. That is what the tax does, and that is why I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>With my recognised and well-known talent for understatement I have to say that the Financial Secretary's speech was not a particularly good one. This is probably the last of our major debates on the effect of capital transfer tax. It has gone on for many hours, and the speeches made by Opposition Members have been of a high quality. I regret one or two interventions from Labour supporters who had not sat through the debate and heard many of the questions posed by my hon. Friends, none of which has been answered by the Financial Secretary.<br/>
Every speech from the Opposition side emphasised the threat to the continuing identity and even the existence of small firms and the possible bankruptcy of the proprietors. Unless the Government change the whole basis on which capital gains tax interacts with capital transfer tax, the rate of tax will be in excess of the total value of the business. It is the manner in which one tax is being heaped upon another&#x2014;to use the words of the hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies)&#x2014;that makes the proposals so outrageous.<br/>
In reply to a question asked by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees) a few minutes ago, the Financial Secretary said that it was up to the Select Committee to consider the interaction of all these capital taxes. In that case, why does this measure have to be put on the statute book at this time? Under the Bill the tax takes effect from 26th March and there was never the slightest need to push the Bill through in the way in which the Government are doing. The matter could have been referred to the select Committee on Wealth Tax and dealt with in a thorough and proper manner.<br/>
The Financial Secretary even resorted in his summing-up to saying that the rates would fall to be reviewed at any time. In five weeks' time, we have another Budget and expect to see the rates of tax brought down to reasonable levels.<br/>
Since my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe) told one anecdote in opening the debate, I shall do the same in closing it. I was reminded of the old tramp who had a cart which was drawn by a donkey. But on the route the tramp took the cart and the donkey through a tunnel. The donkey kept knocking its ears on the ceiling of the tunnel and eventually the donkey became very demoralised indeed. The tramp took a chisel and began to channel a little route on the top of the tunnel so that the donkey's ears could be accommodated. One of his friends came up to him and said, "Why do you cut those channels in the roof of the tunnel? Why don't you cut a channel in the ground so that he can walk along it?" The tramp said, "Don't be ridiculous. It is not his legs which are too long. It is his ears." I accept that my


little anecdote is not particularly relevant to the Bill, but it is very much more relevant than was the Financial Secretary's reply.<br/>
I come to the central question which has run through the debate. It was posed by one speaker after another and was not put better than by the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey). He posed the question "How will the owners of these businesses pay the tax? Where is the money to come from?" We have had no answer to that question from a single member of the Government throughout the passage of the Bill.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Mitchell) gave an example of a firm where it would be necessary to take &#x00A3;50,000 a year out of the business for eight years to pay the tax liability on the lifetime receipt of a business worth &#x00A3;250,000. The Financial Secretary said, "The company would pay dividends and there would be no problem. The proprietors could build up a fund from which to pay the tax."<br/>
Let us take my hon. Friend's example. I have in my hand the Government's tax tables which were published with the Budget. To generate &#x00A3;10,000 from investment income, the individual would need to have dividends of &#x00A3;100,000 a year. The amount of money which would be necessary to generate a fund to pay capital transfer tax on a business of that size would involve dividends of up to &#x00A3;1 million a year on a company worth only &#x00A3;250,000. How can the Financial Secretary in answering this debate have made such a fatuous statement?<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) pointed out that the banks will not lend these sums. He said that if they foresaw eventual liquidation facing a business of that size they would not support the proprietor by lending him the money to pay the tax.<br/>
The Financial Secretary said that the proprietors must take steps to mitigate the tax. However, any money that they fail to put into the business will mean less investment in those firms and therefore fewer jobs. Is that what the Labour Government require? Do they require the proprietors of small businesses to withhold money, to put it in a fund to

pay the tax, and thereby to ensure that there is less investment?<br/>
The Financial Secretary did not refer to the example given by the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie. It falls to me, from the Opposition, to answer the question asked by an hon. Friend of the Financial Secretary.<br/>
The hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie asked what would be the effect on a &#x00A3;&#x00BD; million business in Scotland, which he understood would have to generate &#x00A3;28,000 a year to pay the capital transfer tax. He did not include capital gains tax but referred only to the CTT. I think that the hon. Gentleman was interrupted by the Financial Secretary, who implied that the proposed rates on death were no different from those during the time the Conservative Government were in office. Since the Treasury Ministers seem to be ignorant of the comparative situation, I remind them that while the Conservative Government were in power the estate duty on a business worth &#x00A3;&#x00BD; million, including the small business relief, could have amounted to &#x00A3;170,000. The capital transfer tax on death would amount to &#x00A3;264,000. Therefore, under the original arrangements the tax would have been about &#x00A3;100,000 less.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Nott) will be the first to acknowledge that those figures depend on arbitrary assumptions as to the type of assets involved.</p>

<p>Certainly. The 45 per cent. rebate applied to particular classes of asset. However, if the Financial Secretary suggests that the class of assets involved would be unlikely to be sufficient to close the margin of &#x00A3;100,000, he is wrong. Throughout the passage of this measure, repeated statements were made by Treasury Ministers that the taxes on companies were less under their proposals. That is not necessarily true on death.<br/>
Our forebears in the House who devised our tax legislation, which had the approval of many Labour Chancellors in its time, produced what were known as death duties. They did not intend to impose a duty on lifetime transfers. The seven-year rule for gifts <i>inter vivos</i> did not exist on the statute book by default. It was there because it was intended to be there. It has enabled


prospering firms to survive through the generations to the great benefit of the nation and of the firms' employees.<br/>
The Chief Secretary shakes his head. Does he suggest that small firms do not benefit their employees and the nation? If so, the right hon. Gentleman should say so.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Nott) quotes an extreme example. I could quote 100 extreme examples where, under the system of estate duties, small companies would do much worse than under the capital transfer tax. Let the hon. Gentleman quote an average case, not an extreme case.</p>

<p>Let me take the type of company which has been referred to many times in these debates, which is the type of thriving British concern probably employing about 200 to 300 workers which might be endeavouring to go public. The right hon. Gentleman must have many in his constituency. Shall we see a company go public worth about &#x00A3;1 million if the capital transfer tax and the capital gains tax that it will have to pay will possibly be in excess of the total net worth of the firm? If the Chief Secretary suggests that a &#x00A3;1 million business will be able to generate enough capital transfer tax and capital gains tax to meet its liability, perhaps he will demonstrate this.</p>

<p>When he is floating off, say, 40 per cent. of the shares, there is no question of liability to capital transfer tax. The 40 per cent. of the shares are transferred at the proper value. I wish that the hon. Gentleman would understand the tax.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1931.5" hansard_membership_id="9187" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18976" speakername="Mr. Nott" colnum="1931" time="">
<p>I understand the tax perfectly well. The CTT may not be payable on the actual disposition in value. That is the case. But it does not alter the fact that a business of this size will meet a liability on lifetime transfers which is totally out of proportion to what the tax was in earlier times. In my view, it is a

travesty to suggest that the new tax will lead to lower rates than those prevailing under the previous administration.<br/>
We cannot have anything but a feeling of amazement at the incompetence which has characterised the handling of this measure. Only at 6.30 this evening, the Government were still tabling manuscript amendments to their own Bill. How are we meant to consider this matter in a mature and sensible way if the Government are still tabling manuscript amendments on the evening that we are meant to be considering the clause?<br/>
It is clear that this measure was forced upon on ill-equipped Revenue Department with a timetable which the Department was not able to honour. The rates have been shown to be confiscatory as more and more people outside have begun to understand the full impact of the tax. Having found themselves facing a monumental degree of confusion, misunderstanding and criticism as a result of the measure, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has fallen back upon the tactic of abusing the critics among business of this tax as being tax avoiders. Even when we have quoted to the Chief Secretary from reputable newspapers, he has simply smiled and implied that <i>The Guardian,</i> the <i>Financial Times</i> and <i>The Times</i> are all politically motivated against the Labour Government&#x2014;and that is hopelessly untrue.<br/>
I deal with one final matter. The Financial Secretary said that it was totally preposterous for us to make the accusation that the Treasury Bench sought to destroy the small business. That is what he said tonight. I remind him of what he said last night in answer to a speech made by the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore), because it shows the depth to which Treasury Ministers will descend to pacify their supporters.<br/>
The Financial Secretary said:
<q>It might well be to the greater health of the British economy if those businesses</q>
&#x2014;small businesses&#x2014;
<q>which are relatively successful were sold outside the family before a second, third or fourth generation was running them. All the most successful businesses that were quoted to us in Standing Committee time after time were examples of businesses which had started as family businesses and had then gone public or been taken over by bigger enterprises."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 5th March 1975; Vol. 887, c. 1599.]</q>


The hon. Gentleman said clearly last night that he did not mind at all if a business passed out of the hands of a family in the second, third or fourth generation. But tonight he is saying that it is a preposterous accusation to make against Treasury Ministers that they are trying to destroy the small firms.</p>

<p>That is a totally different proposition. The hon. Gentleman, who is usually so fair about these matters, must recognise that. I was saying last night that it was of great economic benefit to the country that small businesses grew big enough to move outside the family business concept, and that there was no reason to think that entrepreneurial talent was handed down from generation to generation. I said that it was in the interests of the employees of such firms that they were successful enough and big enough to be sold off to larger companies.</p>

<p>The Financial Secretary cannot wriggle out of it like that. Anyone reading his words would say that he said something quite different. Furthermore, when discussing the distinction between lifetime and death transfers last night the point was made that a lifetime transfer was more satisfactory and at a lower rate than a death transfer. The margin was referred to, and the Financial Secretary said that it would be widened subsequently as the Government would be introducing capital gains tax on death. Where does it end?<br/>
We all know that the undertaking to introduce a gifts tax was in the Labour Party's manifesto, but that assuredly gives the Government no mandate to introduce this tax at these rates. It is more than likely that within a generation it will change the whole structure of the small firm sector and the agricultural sector as well.</p>

<p>There are 6 million people who are employed by small firms, and I do not believe that many of them understand what the Treasury Bench is doing by means of this tax or would agree with it if they knew.<br/>
I conclude by saying that the State can go so far but it cannot require of any citizen that he works for a lifetime, and successfully so, only to find that his heirs wind up in the bankruptcy court in trying to meet the unjust claims of the Revenue and to see his employees redundant on the streets. That offends all laws of natural justice. It is in that spirit, and it is because the Government's measures offend against natural justice, that I must ask my right hon. and hon.

<q>(5) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply in relation to any such matter as is therein mentioned if the transferee, borrower or permitted user is a person or body of persons, whether incorporated or not, which is carrying on an activity in the nature of a trade otherwise than for profit, or is a members' club or registered friendly society, and the loan or permitted use is in connection with that activity or with the activities of such members' club or registered friendly society; nor shall subsection (1) of this section apply if the transferee, borrower or permitted user is a church, chapel, synagogue or mosque'.</q></p>

<p>The Government undertook in Committee to put down an amendment on Report so that the charges under this clause&#x2014;then Clause 36&#x2014;would not start to run until 6th April 1976. This is an area of considerable complexity. My right hon. Friend and I have undertaken to consider quite a few matters relating to the clause. That is why we propose to postpone its coming into effect. By the time it has come into effect I hope that we shall be able to meet some of the points made in Committee. I shall be happy to answer any questions.</p>

<p>This will have to be a very brief debate, although it is on a very important clause. In many ways it is the most iniquitous clause in the Bill, as it is an attempt to levy tax on a purely notional transfer.<br/>
We had an undertaking in Standing Committee, as the Financial Secretary has stated. We believe that undertaking should go further at present and that there should be no charge at all until 1980, so that at least there could be a General Election before there is any question of this tax being imposed.<br/>
Meanwhile, we want to hear from the Financial Secretary whether he will reiterate the undertakings he gave in Standing Committee that he would table particular amendments on Report&#x2014;which he has been unable, it seems, to do.<br/>
I shall refer to various columns of the <i>Official Report of</i> our proceedings in Standing Committee on 12th February, although it was in the small hours of 13th February when we debated this matter. As reported at column 1526, the Financial Secretary conceded that loans to partnerships and loans by one partner to another partner in a partnership would be exempt.<br/>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will pay attention to what I am saying and not to what the Government Chief Whip is saying.<br/>
At column 1528 the hon. Gentleman conceded that there would be exemption of "loans to companies" and that there would be an amendment on Report. At column 1544 he changed this to "loans to businesses".<br/>
At column 1575 he said that it would be loans to partnerships and close companies. He promised again that he would table an amendment on Report. He has not done so. We want to make sure that he is going to do that and not use this delay as any excuse for getting away from the commitment he made in Standing Committee.<br/>
Again, the Financial Secretary said in Standing Committee&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014;that for the purposes of this&#x2014;I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would pay attention to me and not to the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes), interesting though he is. The

Financial Secretary conceded that for the purposes of this clause relating to a notional income&#x2014;because what we are talking about is a notional income&#x2014;the gross difference between the nil interest which is charged normally in these cases and the notional interest which might be expected to be charged would be deemed to be part of the net income of the putative transferor. We want that undertaking restarted tonight. This is very important indeed. In particular, the Financial Secretary also said in Standing Committee that it would be treated as normal expenditure and as a normal income of the transferor&#x2014;in other words, that there would be an out-of-income exemption in Schedule 6 for such transfers.<br/>
It seems to us very strange that there is any longer any reason for the clause to be in the Bill at all, because the out-of-income exemption, coupled with the other exemptions about which the Financial Secretary gave solemn undertakings that he would table amendments on Report, means that there are virtually no cases in which this particular notional transfer would fall to attract tax. Indeed, it is very right that that is so.<br/>
In conclusion I shall say only that a large number of close companies and private companies are financed by interest-free loans from the proprietors or the participators. The Chief Secretary knows that very well. Their premises may be rent-free premises provided by the participators and proprietors of the business. Indeed, there is also the case in the private sphere of rent-free accommodation provided to former employees.<br/>
What the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been able to say on this clause appeared in <i>Hansard</i> for yesterday. He said:
<q>The answer that I gave to the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) was on advice that I received.</q>
This was the Chancellor's excuse for having got it wrong, as so often he gets things wrong, on Second Reading. He continued:
<q>I have read with interest the points made by the hon. Gentleman in Committee upstairs. It is true that the precise juridical meaning of the word 'use' in the clause is open to argument. For that reason, as I think the hon. and learned Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees) knows, we have put down an amendment,


which will be considered in the next few days, which will prevent the clause applying until April 1976. By that time we hope to have a completely satisfactory juridical formula."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 5th March 1975; Vol. 887, c. 1494]</q>
It is most unsatisfactory that at this stage, on a clause which is of the utmost importance for every private business, the Government still cannot find a juridical formula, as it is called, not merely for the case cited by me and then cited by the Chancellor but for all these cases of loans to close companies, loans to partnerships, loans to non-profit-making organisations, clubs, churches and the rest in whose case also interest-free loans fall to be caught.<br/>
I want a solemn undertaking from the Financial Secretary that in the next Finance Bill the undertakings which he gave will be implemented in the form of amendments, including, most important of all, an amendment making clear that the notional income which is alleged to be caught will be the net income of the transferor and will therefore be exempt under the out-of-income exemption under Schedule 6.</p>

<p>We have reached a stage of legislative farce which has seldom been paralleled in the history of any Parliament. The clause sets out to apply capital taxation to what are, in effect, income payments. I have suggested that the clause may well be out of order, and, though I do not wish to pursue that now, I find it a curious anomaly that a tax which is called a capital transfer tax should be deemed to apply to notional income payments, whether or not they have been received.<br/>
In addition, the clause has been applicable since 26th March 1974, but it will not apply until 6th April 1976. Thus, we have here a clause which is out of order, which applies capital taxation to income payments, which has been on the statute book for two years, but which is not to be applicable until the end of that two-year period, by which time it will have been totally remodelled and brought forward again.<br/>
I assume that this is the sort of legislative gobbledygook which endears itself to the Labour Party&#x2014;that citizens are told for two years that they are subject to this tax, though they will not be told

the details of it and the payments do not have to be made till 1976, so that transactions which might be entered into at any time over those two years will have been taxable under the clause although they are income transactions, and the Treasury in its wisdom will in due course make up its mind what it thinks the clause is supposed to mean and who is supposed to pay tax under it. This is the glorious Socialist heaven which hon. Members have been fighting and working for, and I congratulate them.<br/>
For so long as I am able to recall the events on this Bill, I shall always remember the words of the Chief Secretary ringing out when we were in Committee on the Floor of the House&#x2014;"We believe that we have here a good tax, and we are sticking to it". Does he still think that?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) said that this is an absurd clause. I wish to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) said. He found no reason for the clause being in the Bill at all. I can find one reason and one only of any merit, and that is to provide a convenient place for the making of our Amendment No. 438.<br/>
This is a matter of interest to many small and medium-size companies, especially those in which the executive directors and managers hold an equity stake. I hope that the Financial Secretary will at least agree with me that those companies play a valuable r&#x00F4;le in our economy, and are more than the average dependent upon retained earnings for their investment and therefore the continuity of the employment they provide.<br/>
The shareholders in those companies will include a number of institutions, such as Finance for Industry, as well as retired managers and employees and widows of retired managers. Therefore, it is necessary for the companies to pay dividends. Yet it has been the practice for many years for the working directors and managers who have an equity shareholding to waive the dividends to which they would be entitled to help the retained earnings of those companies, to help their investment, to help them provide more employment and more growth in the economy.<br/>
It may seem absurd that we have this extraordinary capital taxation on an income transaction. It seems to me even more absurd that we should have a capital tax on an income transfer which has not taken place. Therefore, I particularly commend Amendment No. 438. Under existing legislation, the Inland Revenue has powers to prevent the abuse of dividend waivers. The vast majority of companies to which this would apply are close companies. Therefore, if there is any thought that the provision is being abused there is already legislation which would allow for that to be stopped.<br/>
If we are to allow retentions, which are essential to investment, dividend waivers must be clearly shown not to be a transfer, and therefore in no way caught by this extraordinary and unnecessary clause.</p>

<p>The clause is peculiar, in that it appears to have been drafted without the dimmest understanding of the way in which close companies or partnerships work. That is not surprising, because Labour Members want to wipe most small businesses off the face of the earth by the tax. In its original form, the clause would have gone some way towards having that effect on close companies and partnerships.<br/>
The Government are planning to postpone the whole thing until April of next year, which we believe would have been a good idea for the entire tax. We want to make sure that they are not just shuffling it forward, and going back on the undertakings in Standing Committee that in any new clause full allowance would be made for two amendments which were pressed.<br/>
The first was that the gross interest would count against net income. We want to make sure that that is kept on board and not lost in the year during which the search for the better juridical form takes place&#x2014;the absurd search for the Snark of a clause which appears to be very elusive. When the clause was drafted and approved by the Chancellor and Treasury Ministers they did not have a clue about the effect it would have on small business, and the damage it would do. Now that they have heard our arguments, we want to be sure that some understanding has penetrated their minds and that they are sure that their undertakings will be kept.

If the clause had been left as it was, that would have been the end of close company finances of a normal kind, and of partnership finances in many instances. That is why we pressed hard that these changes should be made. It is essential that we have reassurances on these two points before we pass on. We must have a clear undertaking in view of the rumblings from the Chancellor about the juridical form. I find it hard to believe that the Chancellor had any clue of what the clause was about. The junior Ministers had only a dim understanding and it was left to the Opposition in Committee to give them an explanation.</p>

<p>It is a sobering thought that today as we debate the proposed closure of the Heysham to Belfast ferry service more than 60 people have received notice terminating their employment on it, and in three weeks time another 120 will receive the same. The issuing of these notices need not have happened and, even at this late stage, the closure of the service need not take place.<br/>
I support that statement with three arguments. First, there has been a calculated commitment to the removal of this sea link over a number of years. In other words, a hole has deliberately been made in the base of a bucket and


that bucket has been discarded because it cannot hold water. The express parcels service ceased using the Heysham-Belfast service, and its custom was transferred to the Stranraer-Larne service in October 1973. In that year, however, the Belfast-Heysham service was noted for its excellent handling of that parcels service. Why then was the custom transferred?<br/>
Most troop movements use the private enterprise P &amp; O Line to the exclusion of British Rail Sealink. Why cannot British Rail at least share in this traffic? From 1967 sundry traffic was given away. Livestock traffic ceased to be carried on the Heysham route. The lift-on, lift-off service was largely conceded to private enterprise. The proper roll-on, roll-off vessels for container traffic were denied to the Heysham link. A properly-designed vessel has been available for this route since the spring of 1974. The union and the staff involved in the Heysham link requested the use of that vessel, but the request was denied.<br/>
These examples are surely concrete evidence that there has been a deliberate run down of the service over a considerable period.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that the transport users' consultative committee for the Western Region laid evidence before the inquiry that the brochure printed by British Rail had already omitted the Belfast-Heysham link, so that tourists wanting to use the route this year cannot even know that it exists?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is quite right and I shall return to that point.<br/>
A considerable amount was spent recently on providing ramps at Fleetwood, and millions of pounds have been invested in the initiation of the new service between Larne and Fleetwood. The nationalised dock at Heysham is capable of receiving that container traffic, and manpower is available to run the service, but the operation is being transferred to a completely new route. That is strange action for a Government who claim to encourage nationalisation. If these submissions are inaccurate, I invite the Government to disprove them. It is ludicrous to argue that the Belfast-Heysham route

is not a viable proposition. It is a question of proper management.<br/>
There is need for an informed, committed British Rail shipping division management. British Rail closed the service which used to operate from Southampton, and that service is now being worked successfully by private enterprise. At one time British Rail considered axing the Larne-Stranraer route, which has been viable for many years and even now is holding its own. Is it possible that British Rail is arbitrarily initiating a closure on the basis of misinformation? That would be another grave mistake.<br/>
It is true that the vessels remain in the dock for about 14 hours, but that is because the wrong type of vessels are in use. I have been assured by the unions and workers that they could turn round vessels within about three hours, so that they could make twice as many journeys and carry a great deal of container traffic, thus making the route viable. Yet management makes no effort to provide the proper vessels to run this important roll-on, roll-off service.<br/>
At no time has the shipping division of British Rail consulted the staff or their representatives about the difficulties involved in maintaining the service. That is staggering. As early as 1972 there was notice of closure of the route, but unions and workers were not informed until July 1974. That is not evidence of a committed and concerned management. The lack of communication leaves one with many unhappy thoughts and suspicions. The findings of the transport users' consultative committee to which my hon. Friend the Member for Antrim North (Rev. Ian Paisley) referred have not to this day been published. Yet men have been placed on notice. There are fears that high-ranking members of that committee may have vested interests in a Liverpool stevedoring company. It is also feared that the deputy general manager of the Shipping and International Services Division of British Rail may have interests in a competing service. That is sad and, if true, it is insidious. There is need for an informed, committed management of the British Rail shipping division.<br/>
This is the psychologically wrong moment to remove a link between


Northern Ireland and England&#x2014;indeed, the only link. Not only will many people lose their jobs, but there is no way of absorbing those who will become unemployed in Northern Ireland, where unemployment is double the national average.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the level of unemployment in Lancaster and Morecambe is nearly double the national average at 5&#x00B7;8 per cent., and that the loss of 300 jobs would be a total disaster to our part of the world?</p>

<p>Yes, I am aware of that, and I agree that it spells an ominous future for those who work on both sides of the channel. If stability in Northern Ireland is not too far away, as we all sincerely hope, Northern Ireland needs all the encouragement it can get to bring back the tourist industry and to assist us to increase our exports and to make those export services realistic and attractive. However, the vehicle through which this is possible is now being removed by British Rail&#x2014;or is being left to somebody else who may want to take the chance of taking on this so-called non-viable route.<br/>
Apart from creating a monopolistic situation, this is not the reaction expected of a Government who are well aware of the heroic struggle by the people of Northern Ireland to rise above the destruction of the economy wages in that part of the realm.<br/>
The unions and staff assure me that in two years, with the proper vessels, they could make this route into a very viable proposition indeed. It is interesting to note that today British Rail stated its intention to provide the Dun Laoghaire route with three new vessels. It has about &#x00A3;60 million now available because the Channel Tunnel project has been scrapped. We understand that that money is to be used for expansion in other directions. Why cannot two of the three vessels be placed at the disposal of the Belfast-Heysham route&#x2014;vessels of the kind that will facilitate this modern roll-on, roll-off service?<br/>
Therefore we ask the Government to look seriously at this matter. It is now time to take the initiative; to look at the

findings of the consultative committee; to declare the findings of that committee; to consult with workers and management; to look at the facts as they are; and to save this route not only for the people of Northern Ireland but for the kingdom as a whole.</p>

<p>I shall try to confine my remarks to only two minutes.<br/>
I wish to refer the Minister to Early Day Motion No. 321 "Financial Assistance for Industry (Heysham-Belfast) Ferry Service" which reads:
<q>That this House calls upon Her Majesty's Government to assist by way of financial assistance under Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972 in respect of the Heysham-Belfast Ferry Service.</q>
At the moment the motion contains only one signature, but I understand that by next week quite a number of signatures will have been added to it.<br/>
There is no doubt that the Minister has his brief already made out; he will have his instructions what to do tonight. But this is not the end of the road. As a member of the Labour Party and with an interest in railways, harbours and shipping, I believe that one thing we require more than anything is to provide the nation with a comprehensive transport policy. From there we can then do something about harbours, shipping, roads, railways and waterways in general.<br/>
This country has a great potential for the building of a really first-class transport system and unless we take proper action the only alternative as has happened under successive Governments, will be to close down any service that fails financially.<br/>
When they read parliamentary reports business men must shiver down their spines. I deplore the fact that a first-class service has been allowed to decline. Thirty-five years ago I visited Heysham harbour, and saw that it was working as busily as any beehive. It was a first-class, successful industry, with hundreds of men working there, dealing with cattle, parcel traffic, cars and passengers. Today there are only two out-of-date vessels which have been converted to carry passengers and two or three vehicles. A business of this kind cannot compete with out-of-date equipment. I believe in the statement


which was made during the war&#x2014;"Give us the tools and we will finish the job." That still applies.<br/>
I regret the fact that Adjournment debates are so short. I appeal to my hon. Friend not just to pass over this matter and treat it as something to be buried, nor to send the ships to a place where no one can see them and then to the scrap-yards. Let us do something about this, using the provisions of the Industry Bill if necessary.<br/>
I appeal to the House to give the fullest support to the matter and to make sure that every Member of Parliament knows about the Early-Day Motion to which I have referred so that the Government can again be approached.</p>

<p>Hon. Members will know that a large number of Adjournment debates are taken by my Department. However, from the number of hon. Members who have stayed behind at this late hour, if for no other reason, I am compelled to realise that this is a very important debate.<br/>
A great deal of consideration has been given to this difficult and complex problem, which has not been treated lightly by my hon. and right hon. Friends. However, I wish to try to set out the problems faced by the Government in dealing with the proposal to withdraw this ser

vice, the background against which we took the decisions, and the reasons for the decisions which were taken.<br/>
During the 1960s, tourist traffic to Northern Ireland grew very quickly. As we all know, this growth of people going to new places for their holidays was accompanied by an equal growth in the number of families with cars. Not surprisingly, the market for car ferry services from Britain to holiday areas also increased rapidly. Thus in 1968 the British Railways Board, with the approval of the Government, took the decision to adapt its existing passenger-only ships on the Heysham-Belfast service, so as to enable them also to carry cars. The physical construction of the ships made it impossible for them also to carry more than one or two lorries on each trip.<br/>
Tonight, criticisms have been laid against the board for this original decision, and there was criticism when the decision was taken. It has been said that it should have invested in new, multi-purpose vessels, capable of carrying goods vehicles in much higher numbers as well as cars and passengers. I do not intend now to go into this question. It is sufficient to say that the decision was taken as a matter of commercial judgment in the light of the best information and advice available and in accordance with the guidelines the Government had then laid down.<br/>
The two ships which were adapted, the "Duke of Argyle" and the "Duke of Lancaster", came into service in 1970. The House does not need me to remind it of the sad events which have taken place between the decision to make innovations in this service and the introduction of the service. Those events completely changed the tourist market for Northern Ireland, with a result that the financial situation of the service has never been anywhere near the original forecasts. This is not surprising when one looks at the estimates of the numbers of visitors to Northern Ireland prepared by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. In 1968, the year when the decision was taken, there were about one million visitors. Last year, there were, sadly, about 300,000. This means that the whole basis of the market for which the service had been planned had disappeared. As one might expect, this has led to very large and growing losses on the service.</p>

<p>I can appreciate that in 1968 there may have been financial reasons for this decision. There may not have been the money available to produce the right craft. But surely the hon. Gentleman does not defend the decision to convert vessels to hold only two roll-on, roll-off container systems as a proper business and commercial judgment. The tourist traffic could have generated business only for, at the most, three months of the year.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-03-06a.1957.1" hansard_membership_id="2140" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30544" speakername="Mr. Carmichael" colnum="1957" time="">
<p>The usage of the shipping services is a matter about which I could go on at length. Even the English Channel ferries are working at anything like capacity for only two or three months a year. Full capacity comes only in a remarkably few weekends in the year.<br/>
When I said that the decision was taken not to go for specially built ships, I referred to a commercial judgment. I was not talking about the shortage of money. It was a matter of the Railways Board's commercial judgment of how much traffic the service was likely to carry, taking into account the other services. I hope to be able to explain a little more fully the obligations of the Railways Board's shipping services and the difference between them, and the way that the economics and bookkeeping of the services operate against the railway itself as we know it.<br/>
Here, we ought to consider the way in which Parliament has decided that British Railways Board should operate its shipping services. Unlike the railway services&#x2014;and indeed unlike most other nationalised industries&#x2014;the Railways Board does not have any monopoly in its shipping services. It is in open and unregulated competition with not merely British shipping companies but also with any other shipping services which wish to join in the business. For this reason, Parliament decided in the 1962 and 1968 Transport Acts that the Government should be given very few controls over the way in which British Rail operates its shipping services, and that these services should be operated within the general commercial remit of the board to cover its costs taking one year with another. In fact, the only powers which the Act gives the Minister over shipping services is to direct in what form notices of withdrawal should be given. In addi

tion, there is a general power to give directions to the board about any of their services if the Central Transport Consultative Committee so recommends.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has said that this route is not flourishing because of the unfortunate episodes in Northern Ireland.

<p>The hon. Lady should realise the extent of the losses. I know that she has had correspondence on this subject with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. The losses are estimated at approximately &#x00A3;800,000 a year. That is a considerable sum in these times. Last night on an Adjournment debate a Member was asking for &#x00A3;400,000 for another purpose. On many Adjournment debates Members make suggestions for spending a great deal less than &#x00A3;800,000. There is always the problem of deciding priorities. What happens when the difficult situation in Northern Ireland has changed is a matter that British Railways Board and the shipping section of the board will consider with great care.<br/>
I shall not deal with the allegations of corruption that have been raised by the hon. Member for Belfast, South, save to


say that if that is the case I should like to know the source of his information. If the hon. Gentleman cares to get in touch with me I shall be delighted to discuss the matter further. I am very keen on railways and I cannot believe that railwaymen of whatever level deliberately tried to close down&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] That is not my experience of the railway people that I have met at all levels.</p>

<p>I am coming to that.<br/>
British Railways were clearly reluctant to conclude that the Heysham&#x2014;Belfast car and passenger ferry service should be withdrawn. Nevertheless, the time came when the losses which were being incurred were so significant that the future of the service clearly had to be re-examined. Here again, the board looked at a wide range of options. First, it considered operating the service with one ship. The estimates showed that because of the commercial unattractiveness of such a service, which would operate only on alternate days, the loss of revenue would be greater than the saving achieved. Secondly, it looked at various combinations of reductions of service level in summer and winter. Here again, estimates showed that the loss of revenue would be greater than the savings. It looked at the possibility of rationalising the Heysham&#x2014;Belfast and the Stranraer&#x2014;Larne services so that the two routes could be covered by three multi-purpose ships. While this plan showed substantial economies by the elimination of one ship, these would have been more than offset by losses of revenue because of the unattractive timings of services which

would have been offered and the loss of lorry traffic on the Stranraer&#x2014;Larne route.<br/>
Finally, the board considered building two new multi-purpose ships capable of carrying lorries on the Heysham-Belfast route. Not only did the board judge that this plan would fail to meet the financial criteria which the Government have to set for nationalised industries investment, but it would still have left a serious loss-making situation. Having exhausted all the possibilities of alternative types of service, British Railways were forced to the conclusion that heavy losses were unavoidable without a substantial recovery in traffic, and they arrived at the broad estimate that an overall increase in current traffic of approximately 80 per cent. would be necessary to eliminate the current loss.
