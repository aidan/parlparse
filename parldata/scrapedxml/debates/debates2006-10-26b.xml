<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-10-26b.1675.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="1675"  time="012:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061026/debtext/61026-0006.htm#06102646001607">
	<p pid="b.1675.2/1">I thank the Leader of the House for his business statement. He read out a list of those subjects that will be included in the business of the House motion on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November</phrase>. Does he expect anything to be added to that list and, if so, what?</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/2">Last week, when pressed for a debate on Iraq, the right hon. Gentleman said in so many words that it was up to the Opposition. For example, in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase>, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/3" class="indent">&quot;there will be a five-day debate on the Queen's Speech. It is a matter for the Opposition, and not for us, but I hope very much that one of those days will be used for foreign policy.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-19">19 October 2006</phrase>; Vol. 450, c. 1022.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/4">I can confirm to the House that we will indeed be setting aside one whole day of the Queen's Speech debate for foreign policy and defence matters. So we are playing our part. Can the Leader of the House confirm that the Foreign Secretary will be available for that debate?</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/5">I welcome the fact that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government was willing to come and make a statement today on her local government White Paper, but inserting that statement into today's business means that today's international development debate will be squeezed, possibly to only an hour and a half. I ask the Leader of the House to consider redressing that balance in the future, with a longer debate on international development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/6">On Tuesday, the Home Secretary issued a written statement about access controls for those coming from Romania and Bulgaria. He did not make an oral statement, which meant that he could not be questioned about the Government's policy. But then it does seem that the Home Secretary is a little reluctant to answer questions in the House. On Monday, Home Office questions covered prisons, asylum applications, detection of rape, reoffending and police pay. Did the Home Secretary answer any of those questions? No. But he did answer two questions on mini-motorbikes and gopeds. So will the Home Secretary come to the House and make a statement on the operation of the Home Office so that Members of the House can question him on his policies and his running of the Home Office?</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/7">The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation will soon make a decision on the use of the new cervical cancer vaccine. When that decision is clear, will the Health Secretary make a statement to the House on the Government's policy on the use of that vaccine?</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/8">May we have a debate on nursery provision? Government guidance means that nurseries cannot charge top-up fees, which means that many private nurseries will probably close, cutting the availability of child care. We need a debate so that the Government can explain how they can claim to be interested in increasing child care when their policies will cut provision?</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/9">The Prime Minister has frequently spoken about the need to address climate change. Indeed, recently he told his European Union counterparts:</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/10" class="indent">&quot;We have a window of only 10-15 years to take the steps we need to avoid crossing catastrophic tipping points.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/11">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-17">17 October</phrase>, the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford university published &quot;Predict and Decide: Aviation, Climate Change and Policy&quot;. The leader of the project, Dr. Brenda Boardman said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/12" class="indent">&quot;Unless the rate of growth in flights is curbed, the UK cannot fulfil its commitments on climate change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/13">Yet the very next day the Department for Transport issued a document on railway closures, in which it said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/14" class="indent">&quot;Where long distance travel might be affected by a closure proposal, domestic air services may also be a relevant alternative.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.2/15">May we therefore have a debate in which the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and for Transport are brought to the House to explain the contradiction that is occurring in Government policy? Or maybe we should simply leave it to the Foreign Secretary, who of course was talking about climate change earlier this week at the very same time as the Deputy Prime Minister was travelling around the far east doing the Foreign Secretary's job. Today, the Chancellor is doing the Culture Secretary's job by talking about competitive sport, although, given the drubbing that the Chancellor was given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1868" name="George Osborne">my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)</phrase> in Treasury questions this morning, I suspect that the Chancellor will not be quite so interested in competitive sport in the future. So may we have a statement on ministerial responsibilities?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-10-26b.1697.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" speakeroffice="The Solicitor-General"  colnum="1697"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061026/debtext/61026-0010.htm#06102646001688">
	<p pid="b.1697.1/1">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> rightly recognised, we had a very constructive and full discussion in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-20">20 June</phrase>. I have not changed my mind since then, but I hear the points that he makes. We hope in due course to be in a position where we can take the view that conspiracy to defraud can be removed from the statute book. Until then, there is guidance, which has been passed to Front Bench of other parties to look at. I would welcome hearing their views on that. We intend that the conspiracy to defraud offence should be used sparingly, while, in the meantime, we would examine the impact that repeal would have.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697.1/2">However, let me just say that there is a difference in law, albeit not so much politically or in policy terms, between what the hon. Gentleman wants and what we want. The difference in law is about the prosecutor being able to use conspiracy to defraud if that is appropriate. If there is a guillotine&mdash;a sunset provision&mdash;in respect of that law, it risks to some extent discrediting it, and therefore I am opposed to the hon. Gentleman's proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697.1/3">Let me give seven good reasons for taking the view that we have, in the hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his new clause. First, the Government plan to review conspiracy to defraud in the course of the next three years. Secondly, as Lord Rose's Committee representing the views of judges stated, some issues are not covered by the Fraud Bill as it stands, and we need to look at how they would be covered&mdash;in particular, where it is intended that someone outside a conspiracy would commit the final offence, and also cases where the accused cannot be proved to have had the necessary degree of knowledge of the substantive offence to be perpetrated. We want to look at how we will deal with such issues, if we repeal the offence of conspiracy to defraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697.1/4">Thirdly, we want to look at the impact of the new laws under the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which we hope to implement soon, in respect of making changes on conspiracy to defraud. Fourthly, the Law Commission is studying the law covering forms of participation in crimes that do not amount to a statutory conspiracy. We want to see what its recommendations are, and the results of its inquiries. Fifthly, the Law Commission published in July a report on inchoate liability in crime, and we want more time to examine the impact that that might have. Sixthly, we also believe that it is useful to look further at the consultation paper on organised and financial crime, which was published in July. We want to examine the responses to that and see how these issues affect the whole ambit of conspiracy to defraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697.1/5">Finally, the fraud review itself only finishes its consultation period tomorrow, and we want to examine how that review will affect the overall way in which this country deals with fraud. Hopefully, that will also enable us to take a broader view of conspiracy to defraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697.1/6">So for all those reasons, I hope that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome feels able to withdraw his new clause.</p>

	<p pid="b.1714.5/1">I had better make some progress, as other hon. Members want to take the opportunity to contribute to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714.5/2">The June European Council also welcomed the citizen's agenda communication and its proposal to produce a 50th anniversary declaration. It is right that we should celebrate the anniversary of the treaty of Rome and 50 years of European achievement, including the spread of peace, security, prosperity and democracy. The Government look forward to engaging constructively on the declaration setting out Europe's &quot;values and ambitions&quot; next March.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714.5/3">Following the successful model of an autumn informal summit a year ago at Hampton Court, the European summit at Lahti on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-21">21 October</phrase> provided a welcome opportunity for EU leaders to take forward the &quot;delivery agenda&quot;. Discussions at Lahti focused on tackling the twin challenges of climate change and energy security, improving Europe's record on innovation and addressing our citizens' concerns on migration. EU leaders also discussed the grave situation in Darfur, and had a working dinner with the Russian President Putin.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714.5/4">The Lahti summit provides us with a good basis for further delivering the policy agenda outlined at Hampton Court. It is central to building an EU that continues to make life better for its citizens. Our vision is of an EU with a fully liberalised energy market and a strong dialogue with key energy-producing states, leading the way globally in tackling climate change by exporting ideas such as the emissions trading scheme. Our vision is of an EU that is more prosperous, because it will attract investment and compete effectively with the new economic giants of India and China. Our vision is of an EU where businesses can work across borders without red tape and be the home of European champions; an EU that is more effective, with a powerful voice in the world, working to eliminate poverty and promote development; and an EU that has successfully enlarged to include the western Balkans and Turkey, and has supported reform in neighbouring countries to bring them closer to European standards. Above all, we want an EU that is more relevant as it continues to make life better for its citizens, and one that enables Europeans to take advantage of, rather than retreat from, a changing world. This Government are at the forefront of that European agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714.5/5">The Commission's commitment to delivery is entirely welcome. This Government are a long-time advocate of a modern European Union, assertive in tackling and responding to the challenges of the 21st century. We have an unequivocal and proactive engagement in the EU, working with our European partners to push for progress in those areas, such as climate change, terrorism and globalisation, in which</p>
	<p pid="b.1714.5/6" class="indent">&quot;by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714.5/7">Only by tackling those issues confidently and collectively can we build an EU that our citizens recognise as adding value to their lives. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

He may have been the longest serving Chair of a Select Committee. He made many friends and many important contributions to progress in Europe, especially in strengthening the role of COSAC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720.0/3">I want to represent the Committee's position, much of which has been quoted selectively. The Committee doubted that the communication provided a new vision for the future of the EU&mdash;which future would be of great importance to everyone in the UK. It doubted that the proposed agenda, which was not new, would be effective in bridging the gap between the EU and the public and found that the Government were generally unwilling to give more than, at best, a sketchy view on the proposals in any of the important communications. We found that the Government's position seemed to be to shelter behind the obvious absence of any consensus in the EU on the future of Europe. Instead, they preferred to say, in their explanatory memorandums and in the ESC Sub-Committee debate on &quot;Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate&quot;, that there was no consensus on the future of Europe and that they would inform the House when one emerged.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720.0/4">The Committee thought that it was right to recommend the communication, along with the documents tagged to it, for debate on the Floor of the House, to give Ministers an opportunity to set out their views on it and the outcome of the discussion in the European Council. As the Minister noted, in paragraph 8 of our 38th report of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase>, we invited him to discuss the issues in today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720.0/5">When we look at the huge scope of the communications&mdash;on Europe in the world, neighbourhood policy, trade and competitiveness, development, strategic relations, political dialogue, common foreign and security policy, disaster response, crisis management and European security and defence policy&mdash;we find that there is a huge range of agendas. A question on our agenda was asked by House of Lords Sub-Committee C. We repeated it in our 38th report, but it remained unanswered. It was about</p>
	<p pid="b.1720.0/6" class="indent">&quot;which of the proposals in 'Europe in the World' could be implemented without further consideration of the Constitutional Treaty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1720.0/7">Having listened to the Minister today, I am not convinced that Members serving on the European Scrutiny Committee and other hon. Members have a clearer notion of the Government's view. I am not convinced that any of us know whether the Government take the Foreign Secretary's view or the Minister's view, as they seem to diverge on the double-hatting of EU officials in defence security policy. The question has not been answered, but we hoped that it would be answered before today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720.0/8">We should welcome substantial elements of the European transparency initiative document, including what it says about consultation, the disciplining and registration of the lobbying process in Europe, and transparency. I thought that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1991" name="Ian Davidson">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson)</phrase> would welcome the document, because it will introduce a binding EU-level framework on member states that will ensure a consistent approach to access and transparency with regard to all beneficiaries of EU funds. From the Committee's point of view, when anyone asks the Commission for the facts, it either says that it does not have them to hand, or it says that it cannot give them to anyone because it must first obtain the permission of the member state that spent, or mis-spent, those EU funds. The document will be a great step forward, if it is introduced across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720.0/9">I thank the Minister for his considered view, which appears in the addendum to our 38th report of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase>. It is an excellent document, and it represents progress. I would have liked him to explain further what he said in that addendum, because it gave us some heart that we would be able to engage in serious dialogue. Although it has not yet been deposited by the Government, the Commission's 2007 legislative work programme has been introduced, and I look forward to a dialogue with the Minister, as well as the opportunity to work with our colleagues in the other place, on the programme's details. I should be grateful if we secured a debate on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720.0/10">We received a disappointing result to a perfectly courteous request from the Committee for a detailed explanation of the Government's position on the items in the document, although the items themselves are to be welcomed. I welcome the Minister's statement that the EU is seeking no new competences; that is what everyone wanted to hear. People want a position of stability, so that we can have a genuine debate in this period of reflection, as it is called, after the constitution failed to be adopted in some countries.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-10-26b.1727.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1411" speakername="Gisela Stuart" colnum="1727"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061026/debtext/61026-0015.htm#06102646001769">
	<p pid="b.1727.2/1">Yes, extremists, whether from the right or the left, appear to be offering certainties, and people want certainties. That is worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.1727.2/2">But I want to look at our own house, before we criticise the rest of Europe. There are two options. We can either draw more of the decision making up into Brussels, which clearly has not worked, or we can draw it down to member states, which is what I think we need to do. In that regard, we should start at home. Let me give an example of what I mean. Early in October, I turned the radio on and tuned into the &quot;Today&quot; programme, hoping to have my daily rant at John Humphrys. Our Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was talking about age discrimination legislation. I thought that it was very good legislation, and that I would have enjoyed, and have felt proud as a Labour MP, and campaigning and saying, &quot;This is what we have done.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1727.2/3">But what happened? That is the first I had heard of that legislation, so I sent an e-mail to the Library, asking whether the House of Commons had ever debated that it. The Library wrote back saying that the legislation was statutory instrument 2006/2408. It could find no debates on it in the Commons, but there was a debate in the Lords, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">30 March</phrase>. Of course, the Lords cannot amend statutory instruments. I read the relevant Lords<i> Hansard</i> and discovered that they did indeed debate it&mdash;from 4.22 to 4.54 pm, which is a grand total of 32 minutes. I did a little more reading, and I was given the website link for the relevant research paper. This morning, I asked for a hard copy of it. It has not been printed yet.</p>
	<p pid="b.1727.2/4">Since 1997, there have been nine attempts to introduce anti-age discrimination legislation&mdash;via ten-minute Bills and amendments to existing legislation, for example&mdash; so this issue has exercised the House. That is good, but I would have liked to know about it. There is another reason the House should debate such legislation at length. When Ministers stand at the Dispatch Box and explain their understanding of such legislation, courts then refer to such statements in interpreting that legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1727.2/5">There was another element of that &quot;Today&quot; programme that really upset me. When the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was asked whether the new anti-age discrimination legislation would be incompatible with certain UK legislation, he said that it had yet to be tested in the courts. I do not have a problem with legislation being tested in the courts, but we need to give courts guidance on how we regard it. When such legislation affects all our constituents&mdash;indeed, this legislation will have ramifications that we have not even dreamt of yet&mdash;we need to be much more realistic about how we deal with and debate it in this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1727.2/6">I have three suggestions. First, we should have a proper Europe Minister. By that I mean a Minister who is in the Cabinet, who has regular<i> &mdash;[Interruption.] </i>The current Minister for Europe is a perfect candidate and I would propose him for that role. Indeed, I want to enhance his role. In addition to being in the Cabinet, he should have regular question sessions at the Dispatch Box as the Minister for Europe, during which he explains all the decisions taken at European level that impact on domestic legislation, and how matters will be co-ordinated across Whitehall. That role is currently fulfilled by our permanent representative in Brussels, but I would like it to be fulfilled by someone of Cabinet rank who is regularly answerable to this House. Indeed, in terms of its political significance, that role is almost one for the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-10-26b.1730.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" speakername="David Heathcoat-Amory" colnum="1730"  time="015:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061026/debtext/61026-0015.htm#06102646001774">
	<p pid="b.1730.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. The House has a crucial contribution to make to openness and transparency. A notable feature of the wonderful plan D is that it advances the proposition that people should be better informed about decisions that are made on their behalf but does not tackle the problem of the vast number of committees in Europe that are submerged from public view. When Lord Kinnock was vice-president of the Commission, he told an Austrian newspaper three years ago that</p>
	<p pid="b.1730.1/2" class="indent">&quot;the citizens do not know that there is a secret governing system in Europe... We have more than 300 formations in which officials from the member states meet and pass decisions. That is the largest source of bureaucracy and the black hole in European democracy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1730.1/3">At the same time, Professor Larsson, an academic from Sweden, noted the existence of 1,352 other committees under the Commission that meet in private.</p>
	<p pid="b.1730.1/4">However, plan D tackles none of that. The submerged part of the iceberg will therefore remain hidden from public view and parliamentary scrutiny. Let me give the House another relevant example. I am interested in trade reform and fulfilling all the promises that we made last year in the public debate and lobbies about making poverty history. We need to reform our trade procedures, tariffs and quota systems for the benefit of not only those whom we represent but the poorest people in the poorest countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1730.1/5">I naturally turned to the European Union debate on the subject because it takes the lead on trade policy. It transpires that most of the decisions originate in a committee called the &quot;article 133 committee&quot;. I asked to see the minutes of the discussions on those crucial subjects in the first half of the year. On 15 occasions, I was told that I could not access the minutes. They were blocked&mdash;indeed, censored&mdash;by something called the &quot;general secretariat&quot;. The one set of minutes that I obtained was of a meeting that officials from this country attended on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-17">17 February</phrase>. The decisions and the discussions are interesting, but, in 16 places, the word, &quot;deleted&quot; appears. In other words, the especially interesting part of the discussion has simply been erased from the record. As an elected person, trying to do my best for my constituents in delivering the agenda on trade reform, I not only have no influence on the discussions but cannot find out what is being discussed. However, none of that is the subject of plan D. The much-heralded initiative on openness and transparency does not tackle the issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-10-26b.1769.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" speakername="Tom Levitt" colnum="1769"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061026/debtext/61026-0020.htm#06102646002208">
	<p pid="b.1769.2/1">Part of my political credo is that technology should be man's slave, and not his master. Therefore, I welcome the introduction of satellite navigation in principle, even though I have not yet got it and have never used it. Four million drivers in this country use it already and satellite navigation is fitted as standard in one in every five cars. Half of all motorists have planned routes using internet mapping, which is a closely associated technology. We have seen a commodity grow from an expensive gimmick for the few to a more affordable must-have for the many in little more than a few months&mdash;high street stores have already noticed that Christmas is coming.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/2">The aims of satellite navigation are worthy: simple navigation with updated mapping information; onscreen mapping that is not too intrusive or dangerous; avoiding hazards or congestion, thus saving time and fuel; and even, perhaps, someone to talk with on long journeys. If only it were that simple.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/3">Millers Dale is a quiet village on the southern border of my constituency. Through it runs a narrow road in a steep-sided valley under a tall bridge carrying a former railway line. It is a poorly lit stretch of road, with no pavement underneath the bridge. It is bad enough for children to navigate that road on foot in the dark after the school bus has dropped them off, but the situation has got more frightening than ever recently and has become more dangerous since the number of HGVs using the road&mdash;the A6049&mdash;has increased considerably.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/4">Why has that happened? Long-distance lorry drivers, perhaps from eastern Europe, who are not familiar with the geography of Britain might find themselves making a delivery in Liverpool or Manchester. If they seek the quickest route back to the southbound M1, the satellite navigation system will direct them through Millers Dale. That does not make any sense, but someone who does not know any better than to follow its advice will take that route.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/5">In Brookbottom, on the western border of High Peak, a coach load of 40 tourists from London spent more time than they had planned enjoying the Peak district after their coach became wedged on a tight bend. A tanker lorry did something similar a week earlier. Typical of satellite navigation's idiosyncrasies is to take people down short cuts that turn out to be anything but. Coming west on the A624 from Chesterfield, heading for Stockport or Manchester via the A6, one reaches the picturesque village of Sparrowpit, where a pub called the &quot;Wanted Inn&quot; perches on a hairpin bend. Satellite navigation tells drivers that if they turn right immediately behind the pub and then first left, there is a straight road over to the A6, which cuts off a corner and saves 3 or 4 miles. It is up a short hill and then down a very long one. There is a great view of Manchester from the top, for those who like that sort of thing. At the bottom of the hill, however, around Blackbrook, there are a couple of hairpin bends that can only be described as mean. Woe betide the articulated lorry that tries to take those blind bends at any speed&mdash;as some have, aided and abetted, no doubt, by the helpful person who removed the weight restrictions signs from the Sparrowpit end of the road.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/6">Once drivers have navigated that road, they have another problem, according to my constituent, Guy Martin. His TomTom satellite navigation system apparently shows the A6 as a single carriageway&mdash;in effect directing drivers the wrong way up a lane of a dual carriageway. Mr. Martin complained to TomTom when his device told him that its memory was full and he could not upgrade the information that it carried. He wrote to the local press about it. His letter in the local paper said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/7" class="indent">&quot;I complained to Tom but after several weeks had no reply.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/8">Now, being slagged off in the local press is nothing new to me, except that I had seen Mr. Martin's original e-mail, which he kindly copied me into. He actually wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/9" class="indent">&quot;I complained to Tom Tom&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/10">but a helpful sub-editor removed the duplicated word and thus committed a calumny against me. I am delighted to report that the following week's letters page contained both a correction from Mr. Martin and grovelling apology from the paper's editor for criticising my status as a Member of the House so unjustly. I hope that TomTom replied in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/11">No discussion of satellite navigation would be complete without a reference to Swansea City's football ground, the Liberty stadium. Apparently, satellite navigation systems still direct people to the club's former ground, the Vetch, which it has not used since the end of last season. A visiting team from Bradford nearly missed a game recently due to delays caused by incorrect data on the satellite navigation system. It is said that the police trawl Swansea every Saturday lunchtime looking for lost and literally misguided motorists in search of a football ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/12">Stories about satellite navigation have acquired the status of urban myths, but it is difficult to believe that they are not all true&mdash;after all, they have been in the newspapers. There have been stories about vehicles being directed down steps at Sheppards Barton, or the wrong way down one-way streets in Glasgow. Thirty pensioners were stuck for four hours when their coach became caught between the grassy banks of a lane in Forest of Dean. Signs showing weight restrictions, and even no-through roads, are being flouted by the score in Somerset, Cornwall and Devon more often than ever. Cars have courted disaster when attempting to ford the River Avon at Luckington, or when being directed to the edge of a 100 ft cliff in north Yorkshire. All those stories have appeared in the national or regional press in the past two weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/13">It is easy to blame satellite navigation for the problem, but weight restriction signs exist to guide motorists, and being in possession of satellite navigation gives them no excuse to ignore such a sign. No one tells a motorist to ford a stream that is too deep, or to risk driving a car off a cliff edge. Most pedestrianised streets are pretty well marked. As the Royal Automobile Club said in the <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-15">15 October</phrase> edition of <i> Scotland on Sunday</i>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/14" class="indent">&quot;Just because a computer tells you to drive into a ditch or whatever, it doesn't mean you have to do it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/15">So, what is all the fuss about? Frankly, I am not too worried about what happens to cars, even though research shows that a fifth of all young drivers no longer carry a road atlas and that two thirds of them do not know the significance of a road being marked in red&mdash;it is an A-road&mdash;on a map. However, lorries can do an awful lot of damage even at slow speeds, whether that is to a bridge in Bodmin, or to garden walls in Shaftsbury. Such damage is also testified by the experience of Mr. Isherwood of Chapel Milton, which is in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/16">Mr. Isherwood's case relates to lorries travelling along the A624 from Glossop without realising that there is a height limit under the railway bridge outside his house. Rather than getting stuck under the bridge, the lorries try to turn round and go back to the previous junction at Hayfield, which is some three miles back, but there is simply no room on the road for them to do so. Cars in the car park of the Crown and Mitre pub and Mr. Isherwood's garden wall have thus been the frequent victims of lorries that have tried to carry out multi-point turns. &quot;Ah, but,&quot; the industry will say, &quot;height limits are not our responsibility.&quot; That is my point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/17">I wrote to the Department for Transport some weeks ago to ask what it was going to do about misleading, out-of-date and unhelpful data being incorporated into, or downloaded on to, satellite navigation systems in vehicles. The Minister of State, Department for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, who will reply to the debate, acknowledged that there was a problem, but said at that time that voluntary regulation by the industry was the answer. That was at a time when even the AA and the RAC&mdash;those champions of the deregulation of driving&mdash;were calling for the recognition of possible hazards caused by satellite navigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/18">I congratulate my hon. Friend, however, because I read in the <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-15">15 October</phrase> edition of <i> Scotland on Sunday</i> that the Department has set up a review because:</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/19" class="indent">&quot;As the use of satellite navigation becomes more common, there is a need to ensure that devices do not pose a safety risk through driver distraction. It is also necessary to ensure that their routing strategies do not encourage the use of 'rat-runs' or give ill-advised or illegal instructions to the user.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/20">I hope that that will be achieved by licensing the production and sale of satellite navigation equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/21">Several satellite navigation systems offer the driver the option of telling him or her&mdash;I suspect that it is mostly him&mdash;the location of speed cameras, and we can debate whether that is a justifiable purpose of satellite navigation. In the future, we might expect satellite navigation to tell us where congestion can be found and how to avoid it, where roadworks are to be found, and where congestion charging is in place. In the more distant future, it might tell us the different rates of road pricing that will apply in any given area. Yet I think I am right in saying that at present no publicly available satellite navigation system can tell us what weight, height and width limits apply to any particular road. Even the Ordnance Survey, whose data are the source of much satellite navigation information, has only just started to collate information about the width, weight and height restrictions on 110,000 of our bridges&mdash;there are probably more. The Ordnance Survey spokesman said very sensibly in the <i> Birmingham Mail</i> just two weeks ago:</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/22" class="indent">&quot;A single bridge strike can lead to a loss of business and higher insurance premiums as well as the costs of the repair. Other drivers can also be affected if surrounding roads have to be closed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1769.2/23">Height and width restrictions on roads are intended to protect structures, vehicles, drivers and passengers. Only a fool would not heed the advice that is given on these matters. Weight limits exist, by and large, for the same reason, but they are also used as a tool for traffic management by local authorities to improve the quality of life in certain communities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-10-26b.1773.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="1773"  time="018:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061026/debtext/61026-0021.htm#06102646002213">
	<p pid="b.1773.2/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend in that respect. The point that I am making is simply that satellite navigation might give us an opportunity to improve people's routing, and to do things that we might not have been able to do in the past when we had the old, paper-based sort of routing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/2">I must confess that I have no sense of direction, so the satellite navigation system in my car is invaluable, and it also steers me past traffic jams, which often saves me a great deal of time when I am travelling to Parliament on Monday mornings. On the other hand, it recently sent me down a road that turned into a cart track, where I was up to my wheel arches in mud. So, like many people, I see both the strengths and the weaknesses of satellite navigation systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/3">There are different kinds of in-vehicle electronic routing systems. Some of them simply provide routing advice based on digitally mapped roads, and I suspect that many of the problems that my hon. Friend has detailed have come about as a result of those systems. Others, which are known as dynamic route guidance systems, provide routing instructions according to real-time prevailing traffic and road conditions. Those types of systems are automatically updated with the latest information available to the company that provides the service, including on roadworks and the location of traffic jams. Some systems are integral to vehicles; others are portable devices that can be moved from vehicle to vehicle. Well-designed route guidance systems have the potential to reduce congestion and improve safety on the road. For example, drivers can listen to guidance without taking their eyes off the road. There is no need for them to look at their maps while moving, or to cause congestion by stopping to study their maps.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/4">The software used to determine a given route is based on a hierarchy of roads, with motorways and dual carriageways favoured over slower, smaller, and generally local and residential roads. The route selected should always use principal roads, except at the start and end of a journey, where that might not be an option. That approach would normally avoid unsuitable routing, for example along single-track roads. However, it is possible that dynamic route guidance systems would suggest such a route as a diversion, in the event of problems on motorways and A-roads. Non-dynamic systems would not normally suggest unsuitable roads, provided that the area required is served by motorways and A-roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/5">However, we are aware of concerns about vehicles, especially large or heavy vehicles, being guided on to unsuitable roads&mdash;my hon. Friend has given many examples of why we should be so concerned&mdash;and about the safety and traffic problems that can arise. We have legislation on in-vehicle information systems, including a licensing regime for some devices, but it dates back to 1989 and 1990. Since then, technology has surged ahead at great speed and may well have overtaken that legislation. We have few hard statistics to illustrate the scale of the problems that might be arising, so the Department for Transport carried out a brief survey of local authorities earlier this year. Analysis of the responses showed that a majority of the authorities that replied had received no complaints about inappropriate routing within the last 12 months. However, all the complaints that had been received related to heavy vehicles, and the local authorities' view was that the number of reported incidents is rising, which could lead to problems in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/6">The survey highlighted examples of vehicles being directed to local roads with access restrictions of some kind&mdash;such as weight, height or width limits&mdash;and heavy vehicles, especially foreign vehicles, being diverted from motorways on to inappropriate local roads. Many of the reported problems arise from satellite navigation systems designed for cars being used in trucks. Clearly, this is unwise. Heavy vehicles might be directed along a route that, although entirely suitable for a car, is inappropriate for a lorry. Local highway and traffic authorities do of course have the ability to make traffic regulation orders and to place traffic signs to restrict access on the part of some or all types of vehicles. Orders can include limits on vehicle weights, widths and lengths. Unsuitable roads, bridges and tunnels can therefore be made &quot;off limits&quot; to inappropriate vehicles by means of orders and signs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/7">It is obviously essential for drivers of heavy vehicles always to act with common sense, and to look at, and take action on, all relevant road signs. But if truck drivers follow a guidance system designed for a car slavishly without paying proper attention, they might breach these orders. I am aware that satellite navigation systems are coming on to the market that are aimed specifically at heavy vehicles and trucks. Although they have yet to be tested by the Department, one would hope that they will avoid some of these errors. But such drivers are required to ensure that they are using a system that is designed for their vehicle, and not for a car.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/8">While the map used by a navigation device should be up to date, whatever system is used&mdash;be it cutting-edge electronic gadgetry with all the bells and whistles of dynamic route guidance, or a simple paper road map&mdash;drivers are responsible for ensuring that their driving decisions are legal and appropriate. Drivers cannot blame their satellite navigation systems for their failure to drive lawfully. They certainly cannot blame their systems if they drive the wrong way down a one-way street, because there are clear signs at the entrances to all such streets showing that it is not appropriate to enter at that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/9">The police and courts can take a range of appropriate enforcement actions. For example, the offence of failure to comply with a traffic sign can be punished with a fine, points on a driver's licence, or even discretionary disqualification. Car drivers, too, could conceivably breach traffic regulation orders or other road traffic requirements, were they to follow route guidance without taking account of road signs and their own common sense. We have heard some anecdotal evidence of that happening, but it appears from the results of the local authority survey that problems with trucks are more common.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/10">System and map providers are aware of the problem of heavy vehicles using car route guidance. Some heavy vehicle-specific systems, which include information such as bridge heights and width and weight restrictions, are now available on the continent. I believe that a system with some of these features has recently come on to the UK market; I have no doubt that others will follow.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/11">I am sure that the market will deliver a solution to this problem in time, and I do not want to interfere in that market without good reason. But I do take very seriously the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, and the Department for Transport has just launched a full public consultation on route guidance systems. This is an initial consultation exercise and, depending on our findings, it might be followed by a full statutory consultation on possible changes to the current licensing regime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/12">The consultation has two aims. First, we want to ensure&mdash;by legislation, self-regulation or some other option&mdash;that satellite navigation and other route guidance systems are safe for drivers and other road users. For example, we need to ensure that these systems do not cause serious distraction to drivers. Secondly, we want to ensure that the guidance offered by such systems avoids the problems of inappropriate routing. Our wider approach to better regulation suggests that a deregulatory approach would be best, perhaps in association with a self-certification process, but I have an open mind and I want to hear all good ideas. I assure my hon. Friend that I am not in any way prejudging the outcome of the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1773.2/13">Our consultation began on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>, to coincide with the opening of the intelligent transport systems world congress, which this year was hosted in London and at which I saw plenty of innovation. The consultation ends on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-09">9 January</phrase>. We have sent consultation papers to a large number of individuals and organisations, and they are available on the Department's website. We are inviting all stakeholders' views on the best way forward. I will ensure that the views that hon. Members expressed today are fed into the consultation process and that today's <i> Hansard</i> is made available to the consultation team.</p>
