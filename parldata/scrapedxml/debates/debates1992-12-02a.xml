<p>Does my right hon. Friend accept that we in Ealing respect his effort for jobs in the east London corridor, but ask him to remember west London? Is he aware that 10 years ago all the Hoover jobs were sucked out of Ealing and went to Scotland and Wales and that it has taken us 10 years to get jobs back on that site, which we did last week with the opening of a Tesco store? Will he try in any way that he can to give proper help to west London, and especially to Ealing where we can do with it?</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that London has never before needed the special pleading that it now needs as a result of the Government's economic policies? Will he bear in mind the Engineering Employers Federation view about London, which I fully share, that the lack of an industrial base is at the root not only of Britain's economic problems but of those of west London and London in general? Until the Government take engineering and manufacturing seriously and put real money into them, as other countries do, we shall continue to have a weak pound and a weak economy.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon.

He will be aware that manufacturing employment is important in London, but that it forms a

lower proportion of total employment than in most other areas. We shall certainly take account of unemployment in London and all other relevant facts when reviewing the matter.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that those schemes are totally inadequate and that while in previous recessions Leicester's traditional industries&#x2014;knitwear, footwear, hosiery and textiles&#x2014;survived well, they now face catastrophe and high unemployment, and businesses are closing by the day?

<p>Leicester's economy has successfully diversified over the years and its unemployment rate is below the national and the regional average. The hon. and learned Gentleman did not mention in his usual litany of lament about Leicester that textile exports by one of Leicester's traditional industries jumped by 8 per cent. in the first half of this year to a value of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;4 billion. He did not mention the measures in the autumn statement. We now have one of the lowest rates of inflation in the EC and the lowest rate of corporation tax. Those are the sort of measures that will promote business in Leicester, rather than the measures promoted by his party to allow secondary action and a minimum wage. I challenge the hon. and learned Gentleman to name one business man who is currently asking for a minimum wage.</p>

<p>May I ask the Minister to allow his blood pressure to come down a little? Does he accept that one of the reasons for the textile industry being able to export in the manner in which he has outlined is that it has been assisted by the multi-fibre arrangement? There is some concern in the local textile industry about the phasing-out of that agreement as part of the new GATT arrangements. Could he tell the House and the industry whether that phasing out period started at the beginning of the present GATT negotiations or whether it will commence when the new agreement as a whole is signed?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman can be assured that my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade will ensure that there are adequate safeguards for the textile industry in the period until the GATT review is agreed. Over the years, the textile industry has successfully restructured and that is how we have ensured its record level of exports in the first half of 1992.</p>

<p>Before the President of the Board of Trade next meets the chairman, will he publish the Boyd report and then demand of the chairman why he included among the 10 pits for closure five collieries, including Parkside in my constituency, which that report identified as profitable pits with a viable future in Britain's deep-mine industry? Will he also use the meeting to condemn the chairman of British Coal for his niggardly and Scrooge-like attitude in stopping the attendance payments to the miners at the 10 collieries?</p>

<p>As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows, as part of the review that is being carried out, Boyd has been engaged to give a full review of each of the collieries, both the 19 and the 21, and, as has already been made clear, that will be published as part of the review.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that some of the 10 collieries have specialised markets for their coal&#x2014;I think that it is called niche marketing in anybody else's industry&#x2014;and that there is great interest from the private sector in purchasing some of the mines? Is he also aware that British Coal is refusing to give any information about the collieries and is therefore making it difficult for people to put in bids?</p>

<p>I am very much aware of a point made by my hon. Friend, which has been made by a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House. This is a matter for British Coal, but it would not be appropriate for British Coal to be considering the sale or the licensing of pits in advance of either the statutory consultation period or the end of the review. Once that consultation period and the review have been completed, then, in the light of the review and the interest in the private sector, British Coal will have to consider how to respond. I dare say that, as a result of the review, the Government will make clear their position.</p>

<p>When the Minister meets the chairman of British Coal to talk about the 10 pits, will he remind him of the commitment given in the House that the review will be open and honest? Given that commitment, why will not the Minister instruct British Coal to share with the work force the financial statements&#x2014;the F23s&#x2014;for those pits? If the work force are to be able to put up a case for keeping those pits open, they need the figures. If the Minister is open and honest, he should give them.</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows, the matters to which he refers are the subject of a judicial review, so I must be careful about what I say. However, both my right hon. Friend and I have stressed that there must be full and proper consultation. It is our understanding that that is exactly what British Coal has pledged to do.</p>

<p>When can I have a reply to the letter that I delivered to the President of the Board of Trade on the day of the pit closure debate, in which I asked a number of questions that, as yet, remain unanswered? Will my hon. Friend let me know whether any Minister has signed a public interest immunity certificate to prevent the disclosure of information that is relevant not only to that matter but to both the Select Committee review and the Government's review?<br/>
Will my hon. Friend make certain that the response that I had from the Secretary of State for Wales in an intervention during that debate, that British Coal must prove its case, will be carried out to the letter, and that those completely failed consultation procedures will be sorted out so that we know that the people who work in those pits are being properly looked after?</p>

<p>A reply to my hon. Friend's letter is on its way. <i>[Laughter].</i> I may tell him and other hon. Friends that it may literally be in the post. A number of the issues that my hon. Friend raised, particularly with regard to Trentham, will be covered in the statutory consultation that is under way between British Coal and the unions. As to public interest immunity certificates, there has been a considerable degree of misreporting by the press in respect of the current judicial hearing, and I assure my hon.

<p>Does the Minister accept that many of the pits threatened with closure have substantial reserves? Does he agree that the cost of mothballing the pits would be between &#x00A3;3 million and &#x00A3;6 million a year, whereas the cost of reopening them would be about &#x00A3;400 million? Will the Minister ensure that an independent review of reserves will be undertaken and published before any pit is closed&#x2014;and that if British Coal is not prepared to operate those pits, they should be offered to others who may be able to do so?</p>

<p>I note the hon. Gentleman's remarks about mothballing, but the figures may be rather lower and rather higher, depending on the particular pit. Mothballing will be considered in the review, and I presume that the Select Committee on Trade and Industry also will examine that aspect.</p>

<p>Given that the electricity inter connector with France, through which we import huge amounts of subsidised French nuclear electricity, displaces the equivalent production of coal from the 10 pits in question, does my hon. Friend agree that it would be highly popular in coalfield communities and the country as a whole if that contract were renegotiated?</p>

<p>That undertaking, which was entered into by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn), has potential consequences for the amount of coal burn in this country and is bound to be considered as part of the review.

<p>Does the Minister appreciate that there is widespread cynicism about the manner in which the 10 collieries appeared on the list? We know that negotiations about which collieries were to be included went on until 10 o'clock in the evening, or certainly until 4 o'clock in the afternoon&#x2014;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I am sorry, Madam Speaker&#x2014;I was thinking of another debate. Obviously the price was not high enough for a number of hon. Members who took part in the coal debate, as it was in the other debate. Seventy per cent. of Grimethorpe colliery's output does not go to the electricity industry, and that is true of 90 per cent. of Houghton Main's output. Betws produces anthracite and has no need to take account of the electricity generating industry. At least three of the 10 mines are completely independent of the electricity supply industry, so there is no reason why they should be


considered in any way uneconomic. They should immediately be reconsidered for inclusion among the 20 pits that are considered possible contenders for a long life in the coal industry.</p>

<p>I do not know the source of the hon. Gentleman's information, but given the accuracy with which he put it across at the Dispatch Box, I am sure that it is inaccurate. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that Betws is an anthracite mine, and he will have noted the exchange between the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) and myself during the debate on pit closures. As to the two other mines, the hon. Gentleman may be correct in claiming that some of their output potentially goes to domestic and industrial markets rather than to generators, but a significant amount goes into the generating market. None the less, I can categorically tell the hon. Gentleman that when the statutory consultation period ends&#x2014;I am sure that he accepts that it would not be right for British Coal actively to consider the sale of either the 10 or 21 pits in advance of the consultation period for the 10 or the review of the 21 mines&#x2014;British Coal will remain responsible for licensing coal mines and must consider applications from responsible organisations seeking licences. That must of course be subject to the current statutory limitations. It is a complicated subject, but I note the hon. Gentleman's remarks.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend realise that the answer that he has just given and that the answer that he gave to my hon.

<p>The Minister has not yet answered the question put to him by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford).

<p>I take my hon. Friend's point, but repeat my point: my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade and my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade are committed to promoting British exports.

<p>I agree that the CBI welcomed the Government's autumn statement, which was made with just the same intentions in mind that the hon. Member has referred to. The CBI welcomed the fact that we got rid of the car tax; that we increased capital allowances and reduced interest rates to the lowest level for 15 years, saving something like &#x00A3;10 billion a year from the costs of industry; that we preserved the capital programmes; and that we increased Export Credits Guarantee Department cover by &#x00A3;700 million.

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his reply. Does he agree that some of our European partners have not reduced their aid and subsidies to industry to the same extent as the United Kingdom, despite agreeing to do so? Will my hon. Friend continue to do all that he can to ensure that there is a truly level playing field so that excellent and competitive British companies are not disadvantaged in their trade in Europe?</p>

<p>Of course. The fact that we have reduced the value of the pound by 12 per cent., the fact that we are working toward a successful GATT round, and the fact that we are now working with industry in a partnership at local level, national level and overseas level mean that we now have in place just as good an export strategy as any other nation in Europe. It is high time that the Opposition read it.</p>

<p>With permission, Madam Speaker, I wish to make a statement about public expenditure in Scotland.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the Government's expenditure plans in his autumn statement on 12 November. On the same day, I announced my decisions for aggregate external finance for local authorities. I am publishing today details of the council tax transitional relief scheme which will accompany the introduction of the council tax in Scotland next year. As a result of settling the final details of that scheme, I have been able to increase the level of aggregate external finance available for distribution to local authorities from 3&#x00B7;2 per cent., as previously announced, to 3&#x00B7;5 per cent. I am also able to announce how I propose to allocate the remainder of the resources available for my programmes in Scotland. As usual, a table summarising my decisions will appear in <i>Hansard.</i> Full details will be included in my departmental report, which will be published in February.<br/>
My right hon. Friend made it clear that the Cabinet had set a remit for the public spending round which would keep public expenditure under firm control. The resulting overall settlement has, as a consequence, been a tight one. Nevertheless, the net public expenditure resources available to me for allocation in 1993&#x2013;94 amount to no less than &#x00A3;13&#x00B7;45 billion. That is around &#x00A3;1 billion higher than last year's settlement and the largest ever annual spending total available to my departments, not just in cash but in real terms.<br/>
Our commitment to continue to fund growth in the health service in real terms, year by year, is an important one. But this year, with a tight public expenditure settlement, that is a demanding target. However, I am glad to say that, despite the tight limits on total resources and the priority given to economic recovery, I have once again been able this year to make substantial provision for the national health service and to plan for real growth in its funding. In 1993&#x2013;94 the health programme will amount to more than &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;75 billion of net expenditure, an increase of &#x00A3;151 million over plans for the current year, and a real terms increase of 1&#x00B7;4 per cent. At that level, expenditure on the NHS in Scotland will be 47 per cent. higher in real terms than in 1979&#x00B7;80. That amounts to an all-time record of &#x00A3;744 per head in Scotland.<br/>
In deciding the disposition of the reminder of my resources among my various responsibilities, my first priority this year has been to invest in Scotland's economic recovery and longer-term growth. The House is already aware of the additional &#x00A3;340 million economic package for Scotland announced as part of my right hon. Friend's autumn statement. The promotion of economic recovery is also at the heart of the expenditure plans that I am announcing today.<br/>
Provision of national roads over the next three years will enable the programme of investment which we published last year to proceed as planned. More than &#x00A3;233 million will be invested in 1993&#x2013;94, a 2 per cent. increase in real terms over plans for the present year. In addition, there will be new opportunities for the private sector to invest in Scotland's transport infrastructure. Resources available for local authority roads and other transport

programmes, including forecast receipts from the European regional development fund, are expected to increase in real terms to &#x00A3;206 million.<br/>
The private sector-led local enterprise companies have a central role to play in promoting enterprise development, training and environmental recovery throughout Scotland. The LECs are actively encouraged to seek private investment and their strength is not accordingly to be measured solely by the level of their public funding. This year there has been understandable speculation that, to help fund other programmes, Scottish Enterprise's budget would have to be cut&#x2014;a cut of 10 per cent. has been quoted in the press. It is true that the training budget, which represents Scotland's share of the funding for programmes in Great Britain, has fallen. It is none the less right in the present economic circumstances that the Government should back the LECs' development efforts with substantial resources. I am happy therefore to announce that the budget for the enterprise and environment functions of the Scottish Enterprise network will increase by &#x00A3;27 million in 1993&#x2013;94 compared with plans for the present year. This is an increase of almost 11 per cent. in real terms.<br/>
In addition, the LECs are attracting an increasing share of the available grants from the European regional development fund which are additional to the expenditure allocations announced today. As a result the total cash resources available to the Scottish Enterprise network are expected to exceed the &#x00A3;455 million planned for the present year. Provision for Highlands and Islands Enterprise will be maintained at &#x00A3;78 million and is expected to rise to over &#x00A3;80 million once forecast ERDF receipts are taken into account.<br/>
In seeking to ensure that, within a tight overall settlement, the resources at my disposal should, so far as possible, be directed towards stimulating economic recovery, I have ensured that, across my programmes as a whole, my plans provide for gross capital expenditure totalling over &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 billion next year and an aggregate of &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;8 billion over the survey period. Together with European regional development fund grants, this enables a higher level of activity to be undertaken in real terms for 1993&#x2013;94 than previously planned.<br/>
Spending on agriculture and fisheries is vital to the rural economy. Provision will increase in 1993&#x2013;94 by some &#x00A3;141 million. That is 43 per cent. growth in real terms compared with plans for the present year. These increases reflect the outcome of agreement earlier this year on reform of the common agricultural policy, which switched the emphasis from commodity price support to direct payments to farmers.<br/>
Investment in education is the key to longer-term economic strength. The budget of the Scottish Office Education Department will be increased by 80 per cent. to nearly &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;2 billion next year, reflecting not just growth, but also my new responsibilities for the older Scottish universities and my new direct funding responsibilities for further education colleges in Scotland.<br/>
Adjusted for these transfers, provision for education will rise by 5 per cent. in real terms next year with further real terms growth thereafter. Scottish participation in higher and further education will be maintained at record levels following the substantial increases of recent years.<br/>
I am also able to invest substantially in a better environment. Expenditure on environmental programmes will amount to &#x00A3;485 million. Provision for the water and


sewerage programme over the survey period amounts to some &#x00A3;728 million. This represents a doubling in the programe over five years. Local authorities will be able to add to these resources grants obtained from the European regional development fund.<br/>
In housing, local authority expenditure on private sector improvement grants will increase by 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. in real terms while expenditure on council housing can be maintained at the level of expenditure per house provided for in this year's provisional allocations. The resources available to Scottish Homes represent an</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that, four days after his second anniversary in the post, when facing the longest recession since the 1930s, with business and consumer confidence at rock bottom, this statement does not begin to deal with the real issues facing Scotland? It will do nothing to allay fears about unemployment, to help boost the economy, or to improve the quality of public services.<br/>
increase of &#x00A3;31 million in its investment resources compared with this year's plans&#x2014;a real terms increase of almost 7 per cent.<br/>
The plans which I have announced today provide for the highest ever level of funding for Scottish Office programmes. They permit continuing real improvements in the provision of public services. They provide a framework for jobs and economic growth. I commend them to the House.<br/>
<i>Following is the table:</i><br/>
The casual listener today might have been forgiven for thinking that Christmas had come early. When we consider the sleight of hand, manipulation of the figures and the inclusion of enormous transfers from other Departments, a very different picture will be revealed, which will put a different complexion on what has been announced. Any statement on expenditure must be assessed against the fragile condition of the Scottish economy.<br/>
The Secretary of State claims that there has been a real terms increase of 4 per cent. The Treasury says that, if one excludes transfers, there has been only a 1 per cent. increase in real terms. Will the Secretary of State clear up that confusion and confirm that he set out to use a different set of figures in his press release on 12 November, which was not a presentation shared by the Treasury?<br/>
The Secretary of State has virtually said that money is flowing from the Scottish Office into every nook and cranny of Scottish life. In that case, why is there a cut of 5 per cent. in real terms for industry, a cut of 8 per cent. for roads and transport, a cut of 3 per cent. in housing, and a cut of 9 per cent. in other environmental services? The right hon. Gentleman can tell us when he responds why his figures simply do not add up. The tables are more accurate than the Secretary of State's rhetoric.<br/>
Secondly, the Secretary of State talked about a &#x00A3;340 million recovery package. Will he confirm that next year all that we will get is &#x00A3;23 million of housing investment by Scottish Homes, and that that is the extent of his &#x00A3;340 million recovery package? If that is so, it does not begin to address the key issues which Labour Members appreciate but which are constantly ignored by the Secretary of State and his complacent friends in the Scottish Office.<br/>
Thirdly, will the Secretary of State tell the House why he has surrendered on the Barnett formula? For 13 years we have been led to believe that that is quite important and that it had an impact on the quality of public services and the volume of expenditure. Now the Secretary of State would like us to believe that the Barnett formula did not mean a great deal. He should come clean and tell us what it means in terms of future funding and expenditure.<br/>
The real tragedy of the statement, stripped of its hype and hypocrisy, is that it will do nothing for jobs, nothing for unemployment and nothing to tackle homelessness and the rising crime rate throughout Scotland.<br/>
When unemployment has risen in the past two years by 23 per cent. to nearly a quarter of a million, why has no emergency employment programme been announced in the statement? Have the Government given up on the unemployed? Are they not concerned about the one in four young Scots between the ages of 16 and 24 who are out of work? Is the Secretary of State not concerned about the one in 10 of our working population who are also out of work? By their actions today, the Government have shown that they have no interest in the unemployed.<br/>
The chief executive of Scottish Enterprise is alarmed about what might happen to his budget, but today we have been treated to the simplistic notion that the Secretary of State is increasing the budget. Would the Secretary of State like to come clean and tell us about the training elements of Scottish Enterprise, which he conveniently forgot to mention in his statement and his presentation to the House?<br/>
Training is a crucial item of the budget and the statement. One quarter of training places have been lost in the past two years. Nearly 9,000 young Scots are without a youth training guarantee. Surely the Secretary of State should come clean on the extent of the cut because it is vital for young people and adults and for Scotland's economic recovery.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State also consider that, in Scotland, 12 people are chasing every vacancy?

Bankruptcies have increased by 280 per cent. in the past two years. Faced with all that, why is the industry budget being cut by 5 per cent?<br/>
We have had no better definition of insanity in public policy than this afternoon's statement. Problems are mounting by the day and the budget for investment is declining by the day. It simply makes no sense, and the Secretary of State should comment on that.<br/>
The Opposition are not convinced that Scottish Enterprise has a healthy future in the hands of the Conservative party. Budget cuts are being imposed, morale is at rock bottom, and we now see the appointment of another representative of that cosy clique of Conservative cronies, Mr. McKay, the chairman of Scottish Enterprise. When will that placement approach to politics in Scotland stop? We need people who will tackle the Scottish Enterprise budget problems properly and who do not have such close affinities with the Conservative party.<br/>
Another issue that did not surface in the statement was crime. Why has the crime rate increased from 900,000 in the past two years to more than a million, yet the statement specified no figure to show why&#x2014;</p>

<p>The law and order issue is contained in the table that accompanies the statement, so it is germane to the Scottish Office's current expenditure, Madam Speaker.<br/>
When a crime is being committed every 30 seconds in Scotland, we should have a response about what the Government intend to do about the rising crime wave. Have they simply given up once again on crime, which stalks our streets and houses in Scotland?<br/>
The final point that was not dealt with in the statement was that of homelessness, which is now at record levels with 39,500 households having registered with local authorities as homeless. Why is there no vigorous improvement in investment in house builds? It cannot be right that nearly 100,000 Scots, according to the Government's latest figures for the past year, are now without a home. Why, therefore, has 3 per cent. been cut from the housing budget in today's statement?<br/>
Local government expenditure is also crucial because, once again, tucked away in the tables accompanying the statement is a 3 per cent. cut in the cash going to local authorities. Will not that mean that the 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. pay issue will simply disappear and that we shall have a pay freeze? Will it not mean the underfunding of care in the community, and council tax being set at artificially high levels because of the meanness of Government funding? Is it not a potentially lethal cocktail to suggest that vicious capping of local authorities will accompany inadequate funding to ensure that council tax levels remain reasonable at the expense of services and jobs?<br/>
The statement is not worthy of the problems in Scotland. The Secretary of State well knows that, when the transfers from other Departments to the Scottish Office are excluded and when we consider the increasing need in housing, crime and the economy, the statement will receive


no support from the Opposition. I urge him, even at this stage, to reconsider the unemployed and to give them a priority which, until now, they simply have not had.</p>

<p>I know that figures are not the strong point of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), but he should take a closer look at the figures before making such comments.<br/>
I am glad that the Opposition have accepted my proposal that the Scottish. Grand Committee should meet to discuss the statement, because it covers many important issues that deserve debate. I assure the hon. Gentleman that my announcement, with all the real terms increases that I have listed, will lead to improved public services. There is no question of sleight of hand. For that, we look to the hon. Gentleman who, less than a month ago, suggested that the Government's spending on Scottish Enterprise was set to fall from &#x00A3;373 million to &#x00A3;340 million next year. The resources at Scottish Enterprise's disposal next year will be &#x00A3;455 million, which is rather different.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that capital allocations to local authorities would fall from &#x00A3;826 million to &#x00A3;810 million. The figure is likely to be nearer &#x00A3;900 million, so the hon. Gentleman has a bit of homework to do. He also questioned the unadjusted real terms increase&#x2014;in other words, whether allowance was being made for the transfer of programmes to Scottish Office responsibility. Unadjusted, the programme expenditure increase is 5 per cent. in real terms, plan on plan. However, after taking out provision for higher education and care in the community, the increase is not the 1 per cent. that the hon. Gentleman suggests; it is a 2&#x00B7;7 per cent. plan-on-plan increase.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about Scottish Enterprise and about a cosy clique of cronies. Perhaps he was thinking of Monklands. He mentioned morale in Scottish Enterprise. He should speak to it following my announcement because it has had its enterprise and environment functions budget increased by &#x00A3;27 million, a rise of 11 per cent. in real terms. That returns Scottish Enterprise's total spend, after the reduction in the training budget to which I referred, to broadly the same level as for the current year. That is very different from the hon. Gentleman's figures.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about roads and transport and suggested that there were cuts. The roads and transport programme will increase by 5 per cent. in cash terms and by 2 per cent. in real terms. The hon. Gentleman failed to take account of the European regional development fund share which will be allocated to those programmes in the year ahead.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the change in the Barnett formula. The updating of that formula took account of the population changes since it was introduced arising from the 1991 survey, thus bringing it back to the same broad level intended by the then Chief Secretary, Mr. Barnett. The impact on this year's total programme is about &#x00A3;12 million, which is less than one tenth of 1 per cent. of the total. Anyone who contrasts that with the &#x00A3;340 million package that I was able to secure outwith the block will begin to realise that I have secured about 10 times as much by that means.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman derided the &#x00A3;340 million package as though it had only one small component involving the Scottish Homes budget, but it comprises &#x00A3;70 million of resources in the current year for schools, hospitals, roads and a range of other areas which we have now spelt out

and published. It also includes the writing off of debt inherited from Scottish Homes' predecessors, and that will release about &#x00A3;70 million over the next three years. It also included the reduction of &#x00A3;68 million this year, carrying forward to future years, in Scottish business rates.<br/>
That is the emergency employment plan for which the hon. Gentleman called, and that and the more than &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 billion of capital spend will help to generate jobs and stimulate the economy.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about the law and order budget. We have not given up the fight against crime. That is why we are increasing the law and order budget by 11&#x00B7;6 per cent.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that the substitute striker for the Opposition Front-Bench team, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), was offside for most of the game? He failed to understand or realise that in order to score goals he must make statements that will stick. Has the hon. Gentleman failed to notice how, since 1979, the Conservative Government have increased spending on the health service over and above the rate of inflation by 47 per cent.? Has he failed to notice that we are now spending much more on the environment, which has been targeted in the way that people want? Has he not noticed that the shift in emphasis on the way that Scottish Homes is to be financed will make a substantial contribution, especially in rural areas, to funding?<br/>
All that is against the background of a world recession. My right hon. Friend is to be congratulated, not condemned.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is quite right to point to the increase in expenditure on the health service in Scotland of 47 per cent. in real terms since 1979&#x2013;80. That is dramatic evidence of our long-term commitment to improving the delivery of public services. My hon. Friend might also have said that expenditure on health in Scotland is 24 per cent. higher per head than in England. My hon. Friend is also right to draw attention to the environment budget. He may like to know that the budget for Scottish Natural Heritage is being increased to &#x00A3;36 million, a 5 per cent. real terms increase over the current year. The Scottish Homes budget is also being increased. My hon. Friend will also be pleased to know that there is provision in these figures for expenditure of &#x00A3;4 million on raspberries over the next three years.</p>

<p>Can the Secretary of State confirm that there is no increase whatever in the Scottish Enterprise budget for this year? What guarantees can he give that the increase announced for the environment and enterprise will not have to be siphoned off to allow the training guarantees to be met? Will he confirm that there is no increase in the budget for Highlands and Islands Enterprise? How can he justify that given the loss of jobs at Ardersier, Nigg and Dounreay?<br/>
The Minister implied that there would be a make up from the European regional development fund. Have those figures ever before been included in the statement, or is it just that he needs to put them in to give a gloss to the statement? Is he aware that the loss of the Barnett formula will continue year after year and the one-off that he managed to secure this year as part of an overall United Kingdom package will not make up for that?</p>

<p>I am happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman. The Scottish Enterprise budget has been increased on enterprise and environment functions by 11 per cent. in real terms, which makes up for the reduction in the Scottish Enterprise share of the Great Britain training budget. As to the budget of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, that will be over &#x00A3;80 million next year, higher than it is this year, and it may be as high as &#x00A3;83 million or &#x00A3;84 million, depending upon how much ERDF resources it receives.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that ERDF resources had not been included in the past. On the contrary, they have always been included. This year, we have responded to Commissioner Millan's request that they should be seen transparently and separately. Therefore, they are published separately in the tables. That is why they are shown in that way.</p>

Surely the Secretary of State realises that that is an inadequate figure which does not even cover general inflation, and totally ignores the facts that medical inflation runs at 2 per cent. higher than general inflation, and that 1 per cent. extra is needed just to cover developments in medical technology and the needs of an increasing elderly population.</p>

Does the Secretary of State agree that, whatever he offers by way of public expenditure in Scotland, it is never enough and will never be enough for the Opposition?

The rest of us cannot face the added financial burden and all the problems that my hon. Friends have described of yet another change in local government reform.

<p>Far from adding to the cost of local government, the evidence suggests that the reform of local government to a single-tier structure will generate substantial savings which could be as high as &#x00A3;200 million a year. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will


be pleased to know that we have managed to increase the arts budget next year, in spite of the costs that we bear in various areas, which will enable the new museum of Scotland to go ahead.

<p>The discussion has been interesting and has shown a number of things. Will the Secretary of State now concede that there will be massive cuts in the training budget of Scottish Enterprise? Will he acknowledge that his statement means cuts in the road programme, cuts in industry, cuts in housing and cuts in other environmental services? Will he accept that, despite his trying to create today an illusion of progress, he has failed? Will he now accept that there is a real programme of work to be addressed which simply is not included in the statement?</p>

<p>I said that figures were not the hon. Member's strong point. They are palpably his weak point. The roads programme, far from being cut, has been increased by 2 per cent. in real terms. The industry budget is broadly where it was with the enterprise and environment components increased by 11 per cent. in real terms. The Scottish Homes budget is being increased by 7 per cent. in real terms. On the question of other environmental services, he might like to know that Scottish Natural Heritage and Historic Scotland budgets are both being increased by 5 per cent. in real terms.<br/>
This is a programme which is carefully targeted to generate the maximum advantage and improvement of public services in Scotland and the delivery of economic growth and the creation of new jobs in Scotland. I am confident that it will deliver its objectives.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 20, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the proposed closure of Cammell Laird.</q>
It is specific because only hours ago men and women who work there were told that their ranks would be attacked by wave upon wave of unemployment until July next year when the yard will close.<br/>
It is urgent because Cammell Laird is the foothold to the future, not just for my constituents in Birkenhead, not just for those who live in Merseyside, but in the north-west region generally. Without that centre of skill that foothold to the future will be denied to us.<br/>
It is important to remind the House that already in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) some areas already have an unemployment rate of 40 per cent. If this proposed closure goes through those rates will be compounded and it is an important matter because Cammell Laird is to British industry what a barium meal is to X-ray. It can highlight those aspects of national life which are life-threatening.<br/>
Today we are not only fighting for our jobs, but we fight to prevent another hammer blow against British industry. I seek the Adjournment of the House so that I and the friends of Cammell Laird in the House may begin the debate today and make a plea that the assets of this shipyard, which were bought from us taxpayers for a single pound, be returned and, secondly, that some of the very substantial profits that Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd has made in the past five years should be given as an endowment fund for a new company at Lairds.<br/>
We want in that debate to set out how we wish to attract the entrepreneurial skills so that there is a future rather than an end for Cammell Laird. We should like the opportunity in that debate to invite the Government to say how they would support us in that endeavour.<br/>
I do not need to remind you, Madam Speaker, representing the constituency that you do, what it is like for workers to be part of an industry and a firm that is dying around them. Today Cammell Laird has been told that it should quietly die in July. We have no intention of accepting that option. We seek your leave to move the Adjournment so that we can debate what that future will be. We believe it is right that that debate should take place and our plan for action given.</p>

<p>Madam Speaker, my point of order is genuine and helpful to the Chair. You will recall the somewhat protracted exchanges that took place last week in respect of the proper use of Government and private money in the Chancellor's case to evict his tenant. Those protracted exchanges would have been brought to a much speedier conclusion which would have been helpful to our business if it had become clear early on that the Comptroller and Auditor General intended to examine the matter.<br/>
Has a Minister indicated to you that the Comptroller and Auditor General will also consider the use of important Government buildings for private purposes? In that regard, I refer to the use this morning of No. 11 Downing street for fund raising activities for the

Conservative party. Once again, that seemed to cross the line between public and private use.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide that commercial debts shall carry interest after a specified period; to require publication in annual reports of details relating to the settlement of debts; and for connected purposes.</q>
I am grateful for the opportunity to seek leave to bring before the House statutory measures to protect small businesses from the late payment of bills. In presenting the Bill I would like the House to be aware of the key facts that have convinced me of the need for legislation of this nature.<br/>
It is estimated that small businesses, that is, those employing fewer than 20 people, which constitute some 97 per cent. of all businesses, are presently owed some &#x00A3;145 billion in unpaid bills. On average, it takes 81 days from the date of invoice for the average business debt in the United Kingdom to be settled. Since we are in the middle of considering matters European, I should point out that only we and Ireland do not have legislation to protect small businesses from the late payment of bills. The United Kingdom's record of an average 51-day settlement following the normal 30-day payment period compares with 28 days in France and 18 days in Germany, Norway and Sweden. This places British business at a clear disadvantage to their main international competitors. According to a CBI/Cork Gully report in January 1991, nearly one in five small firms were on the verge of going out of business because of late payment of debts.<br/>
In a recent debate on the Adjournment of the House, I addressed the problem of banks failing to pass on interest rate reductions to their small business customers. I acknowledge, however, that business overdrafts are only a symptom. The Bill that I seek leave to present to the House today tries to address the cause which, more often than not, is the late payment of accounts for goods and services. The Midland bank conducted a survey of its small business accounts and found that, on average, businesses were owed three times as much by their customers as they themselves owed to the bank.<br/>
The House will be aware that I am not the first to attempt to present a solution to this growing problem. My hon. Friends the Members for Newark (Mr. Alexander), for Hampshire, East (Mr. Mates) and for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) have all brought these important issues before the House, and I am sufficient of a realist to acknowledge that I may not be the last. As far back as 1978 the Law Commission identified the problem. In 1982 my noble Friend Lord Stanley of Alderley moved an amendment to the Administration of Justice Act 1977, designed to ensure that the Law Commissioners' proposals of 1978 were fully implemented.<br/>
It is also true that these proposals have always been opposed by the CBI. I do not begrudge this because the CBI feels that it is protecting its interests&#x2014;the interests of large and medium-sized businesses. I would, however, put it to the CBI that its true best interests lie in having a thriving small business sector which will compete for custom on the grounds of quality and service rather than on the ability to keep their heads above water the longest.<br/>
Many people have made suggestions which fall short of what I propose this afternoon. For example, why not allow VAT on purchases to be claimed when businesses have settled the accounts or invoices in question? This suggestion

contains a lot of common sense. However, with a VAT threshold of &#x00A3;35,000 it would not help the many small businesses which are not registered for VAT.<br/>
Some suggest voluntary codes of practice, and I acknowledge the role of documents such as the Government's leaflet "Prompt Payment Please" and the CBI's "Prompt Payers&#x2014;A Code of Practice". From the fact that in 1986 privately owned business was owed &#x00A3;57 billion whereas in 1990 the figure had risen to &#x00A3;145 billion, an increase in real terms of almost 100 per cent., it is clear that this is not working. According to a survey by Dun and Bradstreet, only 5 per cent. of businesses are aware of these codes of practice.<br/>
Some say that it is up to the business itself to negotiate terms and conditions and to take businesses to court for late payment, but when a small business is desperate for work, as most are, and is offered settlement terms of 90 days only, what chance has it of levering a 30-day settlement period? It would only result in the contract going elsewhere. Moreover, what chance would the same small business stand of gaining repeat orders if it took the company to court? What chance has a small business man of taking on a multinational with its legions of commercial lawyers? None. That is why this Bill is so desperately needed by small businesses.<br/>
My Bill has four main provisions. It would establish a 30-day settlement period for contractual debts which would bring us into line with our main international competitors and ensure fair competition among suppliers on the basis of quality, service and price alone.<br/>
It would provide the right for statutory interest to be levied from the expiry of the 30-day settlement period. This would remove the financial incentive which currently exists for businesses to delay payment of bills.<br/>
It would establish a statutory rate of interest to be levied in accordance with judgment rates as laid down and amended from time to time by the Lord Chancellor. This would be fair, because the interest received on late settlement would be equivalent to that which would have been received had the matter been taken before the courts, and yet it would seek to avoid time-consuming and expensive litigation.<br/>
It would seek, through an amendment to the Companies Act 1989, to require all public limited companies to publish their settlement periods of accounts and invoices in their annual reports. This would open up the issue of prompt settlement to the scrutiny of shareholders and the public, and it would enable appropriate comparisons to be drawn.<br/>
I am grateful for the opportunity to present this Bill to the House. I believe that it is widely supported, inside and outside the House, as it is vitally needed by the businesses that it seeks to serve and whose interests it seeks to protect. I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. You have been exceptionally helpful in trying to enable us to conduct this debate in a reasonable and sensible fashion. Can you help in any way to overcome a problem which may become serious for all of us? As I understand it, you are quite circumscribed in the degree to which you can regulate the length of hon. Members' speeches. I understand that you can stop them for speaking away from the point&#x2014;for example, talking about the north pole when they are supposed to be talking about Strasbourg. You can check hon. Members for being tedious and repetitious. However, for anybody who knows anything about the European Community, it is perfectly possible to speak about the European Community for days without being repetitious&#x2014;absolutely for days without being repetitious. The only limitation is the state of the larynx and whether there is some water available.<br/>
On the actual management of the debate, I compliment you, Mr. Morris, on dividing it into subjects so that we can have a rational discussion, or a succession of rational debates. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) will not object if I relate that, as we came into the House by accident&#x2014;pas hasard, if I may use that expression&#x2014;together this morning, he remarked that, if one was called upon to speak about industrial, consumer, commercial, agricultural, and market issues, one could go on for a very long time and that, if one was not able to do that, one would be quite a duffer. We have a real problem. What do we do?<br/>
There are three ways of dealing with the problem. First, Mr. Morris, you could have a timetable motion. You might say that that has nothing directly to do with you and that it is a matter for the Government at some stage to decide&#x2014;they may at some stage so decide, although we have a problem with majorities. There are Members of Parliament such as the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) who would consider such a motion out of order, that it would not be appropriate because we are dealing with a constitutional issue and would raise that matter with you. That is a problem.<br/>
The second way of dealing with the problem is for a closure motion to be moved by the Government or by hon. Members. There is talk that there might be a closure motion some time this evening&#x2014;talk in the couloir. Let us suppose that the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) continues remorselessly, ineluctably, unrepetitiously&#x2014;</p>
</speech>

<p>"Boringly" is a word I did not use. Conservative Members might use it.

The proposal is brought to you, Mr. Morris, because you decide whether closures are appropriate. That would be very difficult for you, because only four hon. Members would have spoken, and no Labour Back-Bench Member would have spoken. That would be exceedingly difficult for you, despite the length of time for which the hon. Member for Stafford had spoken unrepetitiously, as I have said. That is a difficult matter.<br/>
Thirdly, you could have a time limitation by agreement, Mr. Morris. That is done, as we all know, by the 10-minute limit on speeches, but it has not, as far as I know, ever been used in Committee. It might even be precluded in Committee; I do not know about that. It might be considered for a Committee; I do not know about that. For example, hon. Members say, "Yesterday, I spoke, according to the record"&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. The hon. Gentleman brings 28 years' experience to the House. Hon. Members, not least those who have had fewer than 10 years in the House, will have listened to the hon. Gentleman. He is right to say that tedious repetition is out of order, as indeed is irrelevance. Water is not supplied to keep hon. Members going, and I am afraid that there is no 10-minute limit.<br/>
However, we are making progress. Almost every hon. Member who has tabled an amendment in the first group has spoken. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) has covered all his matters. I imagine that he will just about be winding up and that we can make progress and look forward to contributions from Back-Bench Members.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Morris. I have raised, as far as I can remember, only three points of order in all my time in the House of Commons. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is all very well hon. Members saying, "Hopefully." It is perfectly proper for you to hope that the hon. Member for Stafford will resume his seat in a short time. Unfortunately, it is true that, whatever his unique qualities, the hon. Gentleman is not the only hon. Member with loquacity, and others could imitate his capacity for speaking for two hours.<br/>
Therefore, will you speak to the Procedure Committee to see whether there is any way in which one could deal with that? You can check hon. Members for repetition. There is a stage at which one could speak at length without repetition, but one would be going beyond a cogent argument. Perhaps you might look into that.<br/>
Another point that you might consider, Mr. Morris, is whether you could talk to the parties or to the groups about a rational approach. Last night, I had a nightmare&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. I thought that, with the House rising at 10.30 pm, the hon. Gentleman would have had an early night. Sadly, there is no Procedure Committee at the moment, so I cannot report anything to it. The hon. Member for Stafford tabled no fewer than six amendments. He took rather longer than normal, but he has obviously now covered them. I travel in hope&#x2014;one has to travel in hope in this job.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. It is my understanding, and perhaps it is yours also, that the treaty has to be ratified by all countries according to their constitutions. Does that mean according to the constitutions pertaining at the day that the agreement was reached, or does it take into account the various amendments and variations now affecting certain other constitutions, which are beginning to look suspiciously like opt-outs?

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Morris. You are, of course, a servant of the House, as we all are, and not of the Government. I was a member of the Procedure Committee. Will you confirm that there is no question of a time limit being fixed by the Chair? Is it not usual, certainly in respect of controversial matters and not only in the House of Commons but in Committee&#x2014;and nothing could possibly be more controversial than the Bill&#x2014;that hon. Members debate and explore the Bill?<br/>
It is foolish and wrong to say that that is filibustering. No doubt you will confirm that the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) was never out of order yesterday. He was exploring the details in the amendments. He was explaining his objections and putting forward proposals. He was very much in line with the amendments.<br/>
Would it not be wrong if the feeling grew that, because the Government wish the Bill to progress as quickly as possible, hon. Members should be under any pressure whatsoever to say that we will not consider the detail of a Bill which we believe to be of the utmost constitutional significance?</p>

Obviously not every hon. Member will want to speak on every issue or every amendment, but you will be aware of the depth of feeling among hon. Members.

There is no preamble to the Bill. Preambles are in order. The preamble which I have in mind would not affect the weight of the Bill but would simply declare that it was a matter on which the public would have a right to express an opinion. I wondered, Mr. Morris, whether you would be ready to consider amendments to the preamble so that the issue of public consent may somehow be introduced into our debates.

<p>It is, Mr. Morris. Clearly it would be impossible for you to read anyone's mind, including that of the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn), on the point of a referendum. The decision must be for you when he presents the amendment in writing.<br/>
Would you note that there have been many rulings in the House that a referendum attached to a Bill such as this would not be part of the legislative proceedings, and, indeed, could cause constitutional problems? The purpose of the House is to go through a Bill such as this in


Committee. That is why we are a parliamentary democracy. Many of us feel that a referendum is not appropriate in those circumstances.</p>

<p>I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am not playing games, nor will I ask him a question which would prolong his speech. I simply repeat the point that I made yesterday. Amendment No. 108 in the names of my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition, other hon. Friends and myself is purely a probing amendment.

<p>That is typical of the cowardly way in which the hon. Gentleman treats these matters. This is an important provision in title I. I will read it out:

<p>Order. The hon. Gentleman is getting into the well-known habit of reading from the Bill or a text. Hon. Members have read the treaty. All he needs to do is refer to the point and make his comment. He does not have to keep quoting from the treaty.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="891621" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.294.7" hansard_membership_id="2179" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2515" speakername="Mr. Cash" colnum="294" time="16:48:00">
<p>Indeed, Mr. Morris. As I have said, the union shall provide itself with the means necessary to carry out its objectives and to be able to carry out its policies. That is what article F3 says. If I happen to remember it, Mr. Morris, I hope that you will forgive me for repeating the point that I have already made.<br/>
When the article refers to "the means necessary", we are dealing with questions which go to the very heart of these matters. Will the money be made available to achieve the objectives of the treaty and carry out its policies? Will it require disciplinary action? For example, we know of a proposal that the European Court of Justice should be able to fine countries which do not comply with the requirements of parts of the treaty. Disciplinary action may not be just a question of a fine.<br/>
If the title includes such a vague provision, which is introduced under prerogative powers but is at the same time an international legal obligation, who is to say that it will not include in certain circumstances the use of force? What about the power to tax? In order to carry out a policy in line with an objective, and in order to be able to comply with that objective, money will be required. That raises another question which I raised earlier on a point of order, which is why and to what extent we are not being provided with a money resolution to cover these provisions. That is a very important point.<br/>
Furthermore, a booklet entitled "Europe after Maastricht" has been published by the Foreign and


Commonwealth Office as a memorandum to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. I have made allegations that we have not been given the whole picture when, in the absence of a White Paper, there are documents like the notorious pamphlet written in Europe, which gives only half the picture.<br/>
"Europe after Maastricht" is not merely a pamphlet but a memorandum to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs which purports to describe Europe after Maastricht. What does it say? I shall not have to refer to the document, because I can remember that it states that article F provides for the implementation of the European convention on human rights and that European union shall subscribe to ensuring that national identities and democracies shall be sustained.<br/>
However, paragraph 10 of that important memorandum to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee does not mention the matter that I have just raised&#x2014;the fact that the treaty says:
<q>The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary</q>
to ensure its economic objectives and to carry out its policies.<br/>
Some people might say that that is misleading. Why should not the attention of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee be drawn to that important provision? The pamphlet is going to be published for the public&#x2014;in the absence of any White Paper&#x2014;so why are such things left out?<br/>
The same argument applies to the pamphlet "Britain in Europe", which contains no reference to article F3. I included it in one of my amendments for that reason.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is talking about giving information to the public so as not to mislead them. Perhaps he should explain why he voted in favour of Europe in the six votes before the Maastricht vote.

<p>I am grateful for that intervention, which speaks for itself, and I agree with the basis upon which it was put.<br/>
Article F is an important provision in the treaty. I saw Chancellor Kohl on the television this morning, stipulating the basis on which the Bundestag is proceeding. It does not surprise me that he gave economic and political union as its vision for Europe. That is the basis for the provisions of article F3, which talks of the "means necessary" to achieve those objectives and to carry out those policies. Those policies are part of the union which is referred to in title I&#x2014;economic and political union.<br/>
Furthermore, it does not surprise me to discover that the Bundestag has imposed another restriction on the powers of the German Government. It now insists on at least a two-thirds majority in both Houses of that Parliament to ensure that such provisions do not go through without its consent, and it will have a veto over a single currency. It is seeking to get that put back into the provisions&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Illegally."] Yes, it is seeking to do so illegally. That raises essential questions on the money-raising powers of the union.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that article F3 has the most dire political implications for this country? Is it not a paradox that the article is wholly inconsistent with the lack of a money resolution attached to the Bill? Does my hon. Friend agree that article F3 and the inclusion of a cohesion fund, which is all part of Maastricht, will have political, economic and financial consequences for every family in this country?

<p>My hon. Friend is bang on the nail, as he always is, in both his public and his private life. No money resolution is attached to the provision because title I is dealt with under prerogative. Because it is not a part of the Bill, there will be no requirement for a money resolution.<br/>
Article F3 is representative of my main objections to the Bill, as it represents political and economic defeatism. It is a withdrawal of political responsibility and a denial of parliamentary accountability. For those reasons, I object to the treaty.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) has made a useful contribution to the debate. He has opened up the subject matter of the treaties in a way that was not done by Front Bench spokesmen. Whatever may be said about the length of speeches, I believe that the hon. Gentleman has helped significantly our understanding of the treaties.<br/>
This group of amendments, more than any other that has been selected, enables us to focus on the treaty's nature, character and purpose, which has eluded discussion. We are all capable of talking about the minutiae and major provisions of the treaty, but the totality of the treaty&#x2014;what it is about and what sort of

creature European union is&#x2014;is at the heart of the debate. Ultimately, that will determine not only how hon. Members feel about and react to the treaty, but how our fellow countrymen outside the House will come to judge the treaty of Maastricht, this treaty of union.<br/>
Yesterday, several points were made about the Attorney-General's absence. I should like to reinforce those points because I believe that.we are faced, almost immediately, with the character and legal personality of the union that is being created by the treaty. It is not simply a further amendment, although it may partially take that form, of treaties with which we have become familiar, such as the European Community and various amendment Acts to that; it is a new creature&#x2014;a European union.<br/>
I submit that it is the aim of the new European union to become a new state embracing the 12 existing member states of the European Community. I also submit that I am not certain whether the treaty's existing provisions create such a state, but there should be no doubt about the purpose. That leads me to the paramount issue facing us all: whether we are content to see our future as a province of a united states of Europe or as an independent, democratic nation state.</p>

<p>Are not my right hon. Friend's arguments strengthened by article F, which contains the nearest reference to member states' national identities? Article F1 says:
<q>The Union shall respect national identities of its Member States".</q>
That is all that it says. There is no mention of respecting member states' national sovereignty or institutions. Surely that illustrates only too well what my right hon. Friend has said. The treaty takes the federal road, which will lead to one state whereby national Parliaments, including the House of Commons, will have little more power than county councils.</p>

<p>No. I would rather make some progress. I do not intend to conduct a lecture on the treaties because that would carry my speech far beyond the compass which it is fair to inflict on the House after the admirable speech that we have already heard. I am conscious of the fact that I am only the second Back Bencher to be called and it is important that many more hon. Members are heard in this significant debate. The Committee must have an opportunity thoroughly to decide what kind of treaty we are dealing with and what its implications are.<br/>
It is extraordinary that so many hon. Members&#x2014;I am thinking in particular of the interrogation of the hon. Member for Stafford yesterday&#x2014;fail to recognise that the Bill's purpose is to set up a European union and create a quasi state in the reasonably near future. We should understand that the House of Commons and the British public generally are totally out of tune with the thinking and discussions taking place on that issue in Europe today. It is only here that the assertion that a new state is being


created is being made, where the character of that state is open to discussion, and people seek to challenge it. Everywhere else in Europe it is taken for granted that we are at least talking about a federal union.<br/>
Naturally, I understand why so many people are anxious not to accept that reality. Those include the people who are most enthusiastic about that purpose. The federalists long to conceal their commitment to federalism and the unitarists long to conceal their dedication to a European union. We therefore get the pretence at every stage of the European Community's development that nothing significant is happening and that those great issues are not involved.</p>

<p>Yes. That was quoted only yesterday in the speech by the hon. Member for Stafford.<br/>
What has eluded so many people in the country and the House has been the sea change in the Community's attitude towards federalism in the past two or three years. Federalism was always in the original treaties but it was a recessive rather than a dominant element. The dominant element was the view put forward, above all, by General de Gaulle about a "Europe des patries". That was the dominant view, but there was a great change and we should recognise it. It was the abandonment, by the French in particular, of a belief in a Europe de patrie following the reunification of Germany.<br/>
5.30 pm<br/>
One of the consequences of bringing down the Berlin wall and uniting east and west Germany was the abandonment by the French of that belief. They decided that they had to enwrap and enclose a united Germany in the bonds and other restrictions that they hoped a European federal treaty would impose upon an otherwise too powerful Germany. That is the basis of the whole change and if we do not understand that we shall not understand what is really happening.<br/>
I shall illustrate the point. In December 1990 on the eve of the opening of the IGC on political union a joint letter and communique was issued by Mitterrand and Kohl. They said:
<q>We express the wish that the IGC&#x2026;should establish the basis and structures of a strong and mutually supportive Political Union, which pursues firmly, and with the people in mind, the course that corresponds to its Federal Vocation.</q>
The Commission opinion on political union which preceded that letter and communique by a couple of months refers without a blush to the course charted by the treaty of Rome leading eventually to a federal type organisation. Mr. Andreotti, at that time Prime Minister

of Italy, addressed the European Parliament on 22 November 1990. Speaking about the single currency, he said:
<q>For the first time in the history of Europe we shall confer upon the Community one of the distinctive and essential competences on which national sovereignty is historically built.</q>
That is fairly clear evidence of intent, but what about the European Parliament itself? A report of its Institutions Committee dated 21 May 1992 refers, continually of course, to the federal purpose and intent and describes how it sees the evolution to the next stage, perhaps the final stage. Dealing with the Council of Ministers, which after all is the one remaining instrument, as it were, of a non-federal character among the European institutions, the committee states:
<q>Its development into a second legislative chamber in the sense of a genuine chamber of states and alongside the European Parliament must be accelerated, with the Council of Ministers becoming a standing body of the union, its meetings on legislative matters&#x2014;being held in public"&#x2014;</q>
I agree with that,
<q>and taking majority decisions with equal co-decision with the European Parliament, the qualified majority being redefined using new criteria&#x2026;</q></p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman must remember as well as any hon. Member the immeasurable damage that was wrought in Europe by independent, competing foreign and defence and other policies. The whole of the past 50 years has been devoted to trying to find ways to achieve a different form of order in Europe that will avoid such damage. In view of his anxieties about the debate on the form of those structures, what are his alternative proposals for preventing Europe from again tearing itself to pieces?</p>

<p>Oh, really. The guarantee of peace in Europe and in the world over the past 40 years or more has been the existence of NATO of which we are a member. It would be absurd to pretend that our future security within a European union which excluded the United States and Canada would be better than it is now. Peace has been due to NATO's existence and the fact that there is no separate German high command. The hon. Gentleman should think about that. There is no possibility of France, Germany, Britain or Italy ever engaging in aggression against each other. I hope that answers the hon. Gentleman. I was not seeking to establish merits and demerits but to offer the Committee evidence of the nature and purpose of the current union treaty. The hon. Gentleman's intervention did not in any way disprove my contention.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that his definition of federal is different from that of the Italians, Spaniards and Germans? Government in Germany is greatly decentralised and the system was introduced with the support of the British and other occupation forces and the British trade union movement. That system was designed to be internally decentralised. Does he also agree that many people in other European socialist parties fail to understand Britain's peculiar obsessions with some historical feelings and words? Almost every other socialist party in Europe is in favour of the Maastricht treaty.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary that other European socialist parties are in favour of the Maastricht treaty and that they have agreed to a document which, apart from


anything else, inflicts by treaty deflation upon the whole of western Europe and undermines the central purposes for which democratic socialist parties exist. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall not be diverted because I wish to cover the subject in an orderly way.<br/>
My last piece of evidence in support of what I said about the nature and character of the treaty is to remind the Committee that the first article in the treaty, right down to Maastricht itself, speaks about the federal destiny or goal of the treaty. The Prime Minister was desperately anxious to have those words removed and at the last minute he managed to persuade Europe by saying, "If I have to take that back to Britain I shall be in desperate difficulty, not only with my own side but with the British people and the British Parliament."</p>

<p>The objective of France, Germany, Spain and Italy and other European countries was to create a federal union. However, the Maastricht treaty that emerged after the negotiations is far from being a federal treaty. It faced in both directions, but our Prime Minister managed to negotiate a treaty that is a step away from the federal objective.</p>

<speech hansard_id="891656" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.301.1" hansard_membership_id="3391" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20601" speakername="Mr. Shore" colnum="301" time="17:15:00">
<p>I do not think so, but I shall certainly deal with that matter later in my speech. The so-called pillars, which I prefer to call buttresses of the treaty, go a long way towards European union. I accept that they have not gone as far as to be totally incorporated within the machinery of the Rome treaty, but there should be no doubt about what our partners are up to or that resumed pressure will fall upon us.<br/>
It is not only the sources that I have mentioned that give credibility, I hope, to my claim about the purpose and nature of the treaty. The other leaders of European countries are admitted federalists: they do not argue about it. The Prime Minister of Holland, Mr. Lubbers, is being considered, quite naturally, as a successor to Mr. Delors in the European Commission because he is a proper person for the Commission to choose. He shares every bit of the federal purpose, he wants it and wills it. So does Felipe Gonzales, the Prime Minister of Spain. We know from my quote from Mr. Andreotti's speech that that is also the purpose of the Italians. Beyond that there is a fringe of what one might almost call client states of Brussels which receive large subsidies and hope for even larger ones and are anxious to make progress with European treaties. We are in a difficult and isolated position, backed only by those stalwart people, the Danes.</p>

<p>Is not the beauty of including, through the amendment, title I in the Bill that there will be further debates on Report and that whereas it might be helpful to the Committee that title I was in the Bill and made things clearer, on Report we could pass amendments to take certain parts of title I out of the Bill?

<p>It would then come within the normal procedures of the Rome treaty and be subject to the European Court, the Commission and so on even more strongly than would the treaty as it stands. For that reason, I am opposed to the amendment.<br/>
I have made the case to establish the nature of the treaty because I believe that the articles in title I, from A to F, clearly spell out the federal intent. There is not only what it says about the union. It goes on to say:
<q>This Treaty marks a new stage in the process of creating an ever closer union".</q>
It is a "new stage", and not just another amendment to European Community Acts. That new stage is union.<br/>
The treaty then spells out the essence of the new stage. The first factor that it cites is economic and monetary union, and economic and monetary union, with a single federal bank and a single currency, is one of the most unifying of factors. According to Prime Minister Andreotti, previously that right has belonged only to a sovereign state, but now it characterises the new union.<br/>
Secondly, the treaty speaks of establishing a Europe without frontiers. Although frontiers can be a nuisance, I am fairly relaxed about them. To abolish them and to say that we are all part of the same zone in terms of the movement of people, goods and everything else is to abandon one of the essential purposes and powers of a separate state. We would pass that power over to a new state, which would define who and what has the right to come into our country. That carries me far beyond my interest in the proper movement of trade and goods and of people looking for jobs, finding them and taking them. Our rights are to be shared with over 300 million Europeans.<br/>
5.45 pm<br/>
Whether we like it or not, whether we have been consulted or not, whatever our views may be, we are now all to become citizens of the European union. Who has the right to claim citizens other than a state? What is the concept of citizenship? It would have been good to have had the Solicitor-General or another Law Officer here to answer some of those questions. Is not the very nature of the state the ability to create citizens or to have citizens? Citizens have not only rights but obligations and duties. Although this may appear to be a rather empty pillow case at the moment, before many Christmases are past, it will be stuffed with goodies by the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.</p>

<p>On the citizenship point, what is wrong with the notion that, for example, the French people who live in my constituency and pay taxes to the local authority should have the opportunity to vote in elections for that authority, or that I, who have a cottage in France and pay taxes to the commune, should be able to vote in the elections for it?

<p>I have not mentioned those matters, nor shall I. Citizenship will confer rights on other Community nationals. It is not that these are particularly important rights but that they are to be conferred not by the British Parliament but by the European union as an authority. We must remember that, in the first instance, it will be offering only what appear to be attractive features. We have not yet reached the business of duties and obligations, which will be far less attractive.</p>

<p>On this point about citizenship, inasmuch as the right hon. Gentleman has identified a political state&#x2014;the union&#x2014;of which the United Kingdom is a subordinate constituent, does not that demonstrate that United Kingdom citizenship becomes subordinate in those areas where that union has competence and over which the European Court therefore has jurisdiction? Therefore, is it not a reflection in support of his argument that British citizenship is a lesser thing than European citizenship?</p>

<p>I am not certain of the answer. That is another reason why we should have a legal presence on the Treasury Bench. I shall want to explore that point. There is a danger that that is so. We have to acknowledge the basic point that only states bestow citizenship.<br/>
Article B says that an objective of the union shall be:
<q>To assert its identity on the international scene".</q>
Again, that raises the question of whether it is a state, particularly as the assertion of identity will be through the implementation of a joint foreign policy, a joint security policy and, going a stage further, a joint defence policy. The characteristics of a state normally include control over external, foreign and, ultimately, defence policy.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman makes the point that the assertion of identity is a property of a state. Only a moment ago he emphasised to one of my hon. Friends how successful NATO has been, and how the assertion of its identity has done so much to help us&#x2014;but NATO is not a state.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend is right to say that the treaty forms a new entity and that its common provisions distribute powers between the centre and member states. Many of my right hon.

However, perhaps he fails to understand that the Government need not bring before the House for approval the other aspect that he is now addressing, which is one of the separate pillars and will not form part of the ultimate Act.<br/>
The Government, acting through the intergovernmental conference, can continue to develop the entity or state without making any reference to Parliament or passing Acts of Parliament. In advancing his argument in terms of common defence, my right hon. Friend risks encouraging the Government to proceed even further down the intergovernmental conference road.</p>

<p>Although it might have been desirable to bring the NATO treaty before Parliament for ratification, it was no different from the 1,001 treaties that the United Kingdom signed over the years.

<p>Even if there were no move towards Community institutions controlling defence and security policy, members of the armed forces and of the Foreign Office would be citizens with duties to the union. Those duties will apply to everybody&#x2014;not just to the ordinary citizen but to those in the armed forces. The union proposal asserts that there must be a common


international identity and common security. It may be that Governments will claim that they have some rights in the matter, but soldiers and diplomats will have a duty to the union to carry through its policy. That aspect affects every citizen, and it should not be dealt with by the royal prerogative of ratification.</p>

<p>No&#x2014;I would like to make a little progress.<br/>
The question of whether or not the union should have the international personality that title I says we must promote is already being seriously discussed in the context of whether or not, in reforming the United Nations Security Council, the Community should be given a permanent place there. That debate is being conducted all over Europe, though that is not reflected here.<br/>
If one knows that one is committed to a common foreign, security and a defence policy, how can one resist giving the Community&#x2014;the superior body in the federal structure&#x2014;a place on the Security Council? Ministers will have to face that argument before long, because it will be pressed very hard.<br/>
The Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs emphasised again and again how important are the pillar arrangements for home affairs, justice affairs, and foreign and defence policy. I invite the Committee to re-examine article N.2, to which reference is made in title I, which refers to another intergovernmental conference in 1996. The IGC is already pointed at, in strengthening the provisions under articles A and B. The Euro-federalists know very well that they have not come to the end of the road but have merely taken a giant step forward, and are already preparing to launch a final assault to establish an entity that has all the powers of a state.<br/>
The characteristics of a state are a single currency, federal or union bank, authority to decide external and defence policy, rights of entry in respect of citizenship, and&#x2014;as the hon. Member for Stafford mentioned in one of his final points&#x2014;means. The treaty states clearly and unambiguously that the union shall have the means necessary to perform the tasks that it sets itself in articles A to E.<br/>
We are all familiar with the concept of means&#x2014;it is the concept of own resources, stretched still further into the wealth and income of the nation states.</p>

<p>No. We must accept that in the interests of commerce and trade, given that they will be ruled by the provisions of GATT. I have always taken a fairly liberal view of trade&#x2014;except in times of great emergency, when it makes sense for nations to protect their interests and not be too heavily damaged by unrestricted competition in-world trade. I am broadly in favour of free world trade

&#x2014;and therefore I am in favour of GATT and all that has followed from it, and of those parts of the treaty that reflect GATT.</p>

<p>Of course I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is an important point. My attention, however, was drawn to one of the articles in the treaty, article J.5, under the heading
<q>Provisions on a common foreign and security policy.</q>
Paragraph 1 states that
<q>The Presidency shall represent the Union in matters coming within the common foreign and security policy.</q>
It seems that we have already gone a very long way towards abandoning control over our own foreign policy.<br/>
To pick up the point about federalism that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes), apparently we need not worry about federalism because it means something entirely different in other European countries; therefore, we should be entirely relaxed about it. My immediate comment is, rubbish. We understand very well what federalism is. We also understand that Germany in particular has a highly-developed form of federal state. We are also familiar with the concept of federalism in our own national experience, particularly when we drew up the constitutions for Canada and Australia and, before that, for India. They were all federal states. This country is probably the greatest architect or creator of federal states in the world.</p>

<p>Yes, we are perfectly entitled to do it for ourselves, too. It must always, however, be within the context of a nation state arranging for the great devolution of power to different levels of government. To do that within one's own nation state is in no sense to abandon sovereignty and control over one's own affairs. What we are talking about now, however, is a new kind of federalism. It means abandoning the strategic power of control over one's own country and its Government to a higher level of government&#x2014;a new, supra-federalism that would take the key decisions in future. That is my answer to my hon. Friend. I hope that he is satisfied with it.</p>

<p>Very well.<br/>
I turn to the second great excuse that is made for these arrangements. The first excuse is the pillars; the second excuse is subsidiarity. It is said that subsidiarity is a crucial part of the treaty and that it moves in the opposite direction from the direction that I say the thrust of the treaty is towards. Is that really so? I have something to say to hon. Members about this which I hope will interest them.<br/>
We are familiar with the basic concept of subsidiarity. We know that, in any serious clash, what is subsidiarity and what is not will be decided by the European Court. We know very well what the European Court will decide. We know exactly what the remit of the European Court of Justice is, but I want to turn to a second point which has not been made before.<br/>
The Government claim that they have subsidiarity back to us and that. somehow, it has changed the course of the Community&#x2014;that it has made a vast difference, that they fought for it and that, at last, the Community is beginning to change its mind. I am sure that hon. Members know that that is not so.<br/>
When I looked at the Commission document, its Opinion on Political Union of 21 October 1990, which preceded the intergovernmental conference on political union and which was long before the Government were fighting desperately for subsidiarity, I found that it urged further great advances towards European union and political federalism. It says:
<q>The question of subsidiarity is closely linked to the redefinition of certain powers. The Commission considers that this common-sense principle should be written into the Treaty, as suggested by Parliament in its draft treaty on European union. It should serve as a guideline to the institutions when, under a new article 235, freed from its purely economic purpose, they have to take a unanimous decision of principle on new Community action. Compliance with the principle could be checked by retrospective control of the institution's activities to ensure that there is no abuse of power.</q>
Here is the Commission, in part of its own document, driving forward towards a new union and saying, "Why shouldn't we have a bit of subsidiarity as well? We're for it. We'll put it in the treaty."<br/>
It is not only the Commission that favours subsidiarity. To quote again from the speech that Mr. Andreotti made to the European Parliament on 20 November 1990. after referring to economic and monetary union and the single currency he went on to say that
<q>European union should be founded upon the principle of subsidiarity but should also acquire a flexible but evoluted tool"&#x2014;</q>
I do not know quite what that means&#x2014;
<q>in order to allow the acquisition of new competences.</q>
He saw no inhibition at all. He is a keen federalist. He was making a pro-federalist speech to the European Parliament and recommended that we should have subsidiarity. That was in October 1990, long before the Government in their desperate, marvellous struggle at Maastricht tried to claw back powers from the European Community and hand them to the nation states. It is a major fraud. I hope that the Committee understands just how much it is a fraud.</p>

<p>&#x2014;and also by the President of the Commission and Commission members long before subsidiarity became a tremendous gain for the British Government.

Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) nods in agreement. He is an openly-declared federalist. He acknowledges that what I say is true. It is only those who are ashamed of their federalism and of their unionism who seek to deny it.</p>

<p>That is what the Minister maintains, but he and I know that members of the Commission are not lawyers but politicians. The Commission is aware of the Government's difficulty and is trying to be as helpful as possible. None of the arrogance of Mr. Delors' private office that we witnessed before the Danish treaty has been repeated, but we know very well that he was planning another major statement on the federal advance of the European union before the Danish referendum. Since the Danish referendum, the Commission has been drawing back and trying to pretend that it has had a change of heart and that things are different. Why? Because its members are politicians, and they know that they are in danger of defeat.</p>

I conclude by asking the key question: do we want a federal culture?

<p>I should like to make a fairly brief speech&#x2014;probably the shortest in the debate so far, but that would not be difficult.<br/>
I can well understand why the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) is keen to include title I in the Bill. His general approach, which has been consistent and for which I respect him, has been that he believes in a full federal Europe. I do not, which is one of the reasons why I think that he is wrong; but Ministers are right to oppose amendment No. 93.<br/>
Conservative Members should be cautious about what the amendments propose. In principle, we should be cautious about what the Opposition's amendments propose. We should be cautious and suspicious of all proposals to change the law of the land. We should never enact unnecessary or repetitious legislation. We should be wary of proposals that increase the power of European institutions, and I say that as a supporter of the treaty.<br/>
I am surprised, therefore, by the attitude of some of my hon. Friends, because the Government rightly oppose amendment No. 93 and the other half dozen being considered with it. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State has explained that they are not necessary, that the law that we need to change will be debated under different titles and that to accept title I would go too far, would create all sorts of legal complications and confusions, would delay the progress of the Bill and would offer in Britain opportunities for litigation that do not exist in countries that have already ratified. That attitude is perfectly clear. Therefore, some of my colleagues, including my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), are in the daft position of having tabled amendments that they do not agree with.</p>

My hon. Friends appear to have got themselves into a strange position.

One must ask, therefore, why table the amendments? They did not need to table them, because amendment No. 93 would have been more than sufficient for their purpose of holding a debate on the general principles of title I.<br/>
The Labour party did not make that mistake. It tabled amendment No. 108, and no Labour Back Benchers have

tabled amendments. It is deeply disappointing to Conservative Members who support the treaty and the Bill that Labour Members&#x2014;whose party conference supported the treaty and whose party would be introducing the Bill if it had won the election&#x2014;have kept so quiet. Labour Members have been silent. The Labour party is allowing itself to be portrayed to the country, to Europe and to the Parliaments of the world as being hostile to Europe.</p>

My hon. Friends are entitled to wish to debate the general principles of title I, but they are not entitled to hog the Floor or to give the impression that all Conservatives agree with them, which is not true. The House of Commons has voted on the general principles of the treaty and the Bill a number of times, and the majority of hon. Members have been firmly in favour. The only occasion when there was a small majority was when Opposition Members sought to make it an issue of confidence in the Government, and on that basis some Opposition Members felt able to vote in the no Lobby.<br/>
We had a general election only a few months ago, at which all the main parties supported the treaty. The issue of Europe was not raised, and my hon. Friends must consider why all the main parties supported it. They did so because they regard it as being good for this country and for Europe that we should be part of this development and because they regard it as part of the development of the free world, of which we are lucky to be part.<br/>
I have listened to the debate. I must apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford for not having listened to his closing comments this afternoon, but I reckoned that they would be much the same as we heard yesterday. I believe that I detected the techniques that he was using.<br/>
Those techniques seem to have fallen into two main categories. First, my hon. Friend accuses everyone in the Committee of not having read the treaty. Well, most of us have read it. The second technique is to accuse us of not understanding the treaty. Most of us do understand it. The fact of the matter is that most of us do not agree with my hon.

<p>There was the implication that everything was transparent to the hon. Lady. If that is so, could she explain to me what the Minister failed to explain?

<p>With all due respect to the hon. Gentleman, I should never dream of suggesting that any handiwork of human beings was perfect. The treaty is not perfect either. Any one of us could cite one line, one sentence or one paragraph that we would prefer not to be there&#x2014;but what is on offer is a huge treaty negotiated by many people in the interests of all of us.<br/>
I am not a lawyer, thank God, but I am advised that putting title I on the face of the Bill is unnecessary and would be confusing, because any parts of it that may be justiciable are already included in other titles. I am happy to accept the argument that putting more legislation on the statute book would be more confusing. That is axiomatic in much of what we get up to in this place.<br/>
Several hon. Members from both sides of the Committee have produced evidence&#x2014;although it tends to be the same stuff. Often it comes from just one speech made by Mr. Bangemann. I have no writ running for Bangemann; he is not a member of my party. The Labour party should have no writ running for him either, because he is not a member of their party either. He is a sort of German Liberal, a member of one of the minority parties, although much of what he says does not sound very liberal to me.</p>

<p>I shall give way in a moment.<br/>
In a continent containing so many people, it would not be difficult to find all sorts of opinions being expressed. Much "evidence" of what other people mean by, and want from, union is being called in aid. One need look no further than Members of the House. There are plenty of people here who believe all that&#x2014;but I do not. I do not believe in a federal Europe&#x2014;and the treaty does not mean that there will be a federal Europe.<br/>
I tell the Committee, and especially my hon. Friends who oppose the Bill, that I believe that over the next few years Europe needs to develop a civil service or Commission that will take on board the best qualities of the British civil service, in that it will be totally non-political, and tend to keep quiet and to give advice rather than trying to dominate. I add one factor which I should see both in the Commission&#x2014;</p>

Another factor which I should like to be incorporated

<p>My hon. Friend is refusing to pay me a compliment. Let us move on.<br/>
Because several people are available to have their views quoted on European union, that does not mean that they are right about the way that things will go&#x2014;except for one significant fact. If this country did not play a full part in the future of Europe, the people whose voices have been quoted would play a bigger part than they do now. Indeed, that is more likely if we are not involved.<br/>
I have to tell my hon. Friends who oppose the Bill that I have been appalled to hear so much small-mindedness, bigotry, fear and ignorance expressed in the speeches that have been made so far from this side of the Committee. In fact, apart from mine, so far only one speech has been made by a Conservative Member.<br/>
The world is in transition and we are in a time of considerable difficulty&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> One has to ask what has happened&#x2014;<i>[Laughter.]</i> The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) may think that that is funny, but I do not. One has to ask what has happened to this country's pride and self-confidence, and our awareness of what goes on in the world. We have always been members of alliances, and have always drawn our strength from them. We have never had any strength on our own. That has been true throughout our history, especially recently.<br/>
The European Community already accounts for 340 million people. It is as large as the United States of America and Japan put together, and we are lucky to be part of it. We should think so. Our fellow Europeans think so. They know it, and they want us in the front rank.<br/>
The Bill seeks to incorporate into United Kingdom law only those parts of the Maastricht treaty which require changes in United Kingdom law. That is the right approach. I congratulate the Minister of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Mr. Garel-Jones), and assure him of my support.</p>

<p>This is a mean Bill, and it typifies the Government's approach to Maastricht, which was also expressed by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie). Essentially, that approach says, "We have kept close to the Single European Act. We had to go a little further, because if we had not done so the wolves would have arisen on the continent and driven us out, and we should not have had the influence that we now have."<br/>
The Bill is mean not only because of the withdrawal from the social chapter and from monetary union&#x2014;I favour monetary union&#x2014;but because of the Government's approach. Nevertheless, there is much left in the Bill which can and should be supported.<br/>
We are looking not for a oneness, or one state, but a diversity in unity. That diversity does not preclude a union. I have no qualms of conscience in saying that we are going into a union. That is clearly expressed; there is a commitment, and that is right and proper.<br/>
The problem for hon. Members is that we are used to working with an unwritten constitution. The other day, when the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) was talking about the treaty, he said, "I am a lawyer, so I know." That is the exact problem of the hon. Member for Stafford, especially when discussing amendment No. 93. At present we are discussing the spirit of Maastricht. It is extremely important. It pervades the movement forward from what was a single market&#x2014;essentially, a hypermarket&#x2014;and will put some humanity into the European Community. Above all, that is what Maastricht tries to do.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore) said that we had moved from the days when France talked about a Europe des patries. That is true; France has moved on to talk about federalism. France has moved towards a federal system within its country. A short 15 years ago, France was the most centralised country on the continent. Today, it has gone a considerable way towards devolution.<br/>
I am a citizen, first, of Yorkshire; secondly, of the United Kingdom; and, thirdly, of Europe. I find no tension among those three states. However, I have difficulty with what circumscribes our sovereignty in Yorkshire. Our sovereignty in Yorkshire is circumscribed by bodies such as the Department of the Environment.<br/>
I well remember when I chaired the West Yorkshire metropolitan county council planning and transportation committee, and difficulties that I had with my right hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney, who was in charge of such matters at that time. We were trying to do things that central Government did not want us to do. The position has become even worse since my right hon. Friend departed office. There is a centralised power in the United Kingdom which makes it difficult for us to accept, or even understand, the concept of federalism.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend. We have recently shared the same platform. I have been impressed by the relaxed way in which the Scots nation shares its sovereignty with us.

<p>May I disabuse my hon. Friend of his illusion about the Scottish Members of Parliament? The overwhelming majority of Scottish Members of Parliament want a Parliament established in Scotland.

<p>I will give way when I have made my point.<br/>
Since we moved out of the exchange rate mechanism, I have found that my hon. Friends do not blame the true culprit, which is Government policy. Government policy has ruined our economy and destroyed the pound. My hon. Friends prefer to give the Government an excuse&#x2014;the exchange rate mechanism. That is untrue. I am an unashamed socialist, as I am an unashamed unionist in the sense of Europe. As a socialist, I believe in managing the exchange rate.<br/>
It is extremely important to manage the exchange rate; otherwise, it is left to the speculators. The United Kingdom on its own cannot manage the pound or defend it. The rate at which we trade at present is the rate that is decided by a fickle market.</p>

<p>It is difficult to take seriously my hon. Friend's assertion that we have no control over our currency and less freedom than when we were in the ERM. I am sure that he is aware that our interest rates were a minimum 10 per cent. when we were forced out of the ERM. To stay in the ERM, we had to raise interest rates to 15 per cent. We would have gone beyond that figure if necessary or if possible. The interest rates of the weaker currencies in Europe are 13 to 14 per cent.<br/>
Since we left the ERM, we not only have a more competitive pound, but we have been able to reduce interest rates by 3 per cent. According to many people, such a reduction was impossible before we left the ERM, because we were totally dominated by the deutschmark. Many of my right hon. and hon. Friends said that we had 20 minutes of currency freedom before we left the ERM.</p>

<p>I am interested to hear my right hon. Friend suggest that devaluation at whatever is the market price is good. The market price is the price at which the speculators can make a profit.<br/>
It was interesting to read in <i>The Guardian</i> the account of the possibility of changing the rate. The way in which the currency could have been managed&#x2014;and, frankly, should have been managed&#x2014;meant that we could have been a reliable trading country.<br/>
I give my right hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney an example of what management of the currency means to ordinary people in the control of their lives. As a result of the state of the economy, our area must collect funds for a hospital scanner. The collections were going well as a result of the desirable lowering of the exchange rate. However, we must now find another &#x00A3;25,000. That is important in a poor area such as ours, and it is repeated time and again.<br/>
Economic policy cannot be decided with short-term ends in view. One must look to at least a five-year cycle. I agree that a five-year cycle is difficult to maintain, but it must be thought through. However, that is an argument for another day.</p>

<p>Does my hon.

<p>May I express the hope that my hon. Friend's regrets for what happened on 16 September do not mean that he believes that it was either desirable or possible for us to have adhered to the parity of DM2&#x00B7;95 to the pound which was required of us by the ERM?

<p>My hon. Friend misunderstands the ERM. It did not require us to stay at that parity. When the exchange rate was fixed, it was a reasonable exchange rate, but because of the destruction of industry and of manufacturing, and because of the failure to pursue a successful economic policy, it had to go down. That could and should have been managed.</p>

<p>I like the way in which my hon. Friend seeks to defend the impossible&#x2014;the pound's valuation under the ERM.

<p>No, because I want to make some progress.<br/>
I turn now to co-operation in foreign policy. There is a great deal of misunderstanding about that. There are areas that should be examined in which practical co-operation will and should take place. Specifically mentioned in the treaty, far more strongly than in any other treaty, is development co-operation. It is clear that nonsense is going on in Africa, in Asia and in South America in terms of development aid. It regularly happens that six or seven of the member states of the EC set up their own programmes while the European Community is setting up its own programmes, and that the programmes are contradictory.<br/>
Even worse is the insistence on selling certain goods. I give Guinea-Bissau as an example. British electrical generators were sold to Guinea-Bissau although the country already had German, French and Japanese generators. The British generators require a sophistication that is impossible in developing countries. The treaty is a practical way in which to come together to ensure that we do not destroy development in trying to assist it.<br/>

<p>I will not go over what the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) said. However, I make this appeal to him. If, as a socialist, he cares about working people, he should look at what is happening in Europe today. The evening paper says: "ERM in last stand as the franc plunges". The Danish currency is plunging. Interest rates are soaring in the countries of Europe.<br/>
Who is suffering? The speculators do not suffer. The ERM was the best thing that ever came to the speculators. They have been making millions. The people who suffer are the working people of Europe who are put out of their jobs and out of their homes because of a mad policy of pretending that currencies are worth what they are not.<br/>
I appreciate that there are always people who have held views for a long time with some sincerity. Even in the Church of England, one finds people who say, "Things have always been this way and I will stick to it." I find it sickening&#x2014;I mean that sincerely, because I do not usually attack people&#x2014;to hear a member of the Labour party&#x2014;the party that has fought for working people, for human rights and for the ordinary people of Britain&#x2014;support a policy that is destroying jobs and the communities of working people because of an absurd, irrelevant and artificial process.<br/>
The Conservatives have learnt. We have learnt that the ERM is a load of rubbish. I very much doubt whether one could find anyone apart from a few residual fanatics who would say anything good about the ERM. It is nonsense. We all know that to try to pretend that the pound is worth something it is not or that the franc is worth something it is not means that one has to distort something else.<br/>
It either means that, as we once had, we create artificial prosperity as happened with the previous Chancellor, or there is artificial inflation. Think what it means to the

people with homes and jobs&#x2014;it is a policy of madness. While I accept that probably some people have rethought this, I am the last person in the world to support this absurd nonsense that, if they are working people, they are members of the British Labour party.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way.

He needs to address that issue.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman needs to look at what really happens, not at me, and not what he reads in books. The speculators try to keep a currency at an artificial level, and are pushing and pulling.

It is not the working people: it is the speculators.<br/>
I am pleased that this party has woken up and realised that it is nonsense, but it is the socialists who are repeating this nonsense. I would say to anyone that, if they think that allowing the pound to find its market value is contrary to socialism, I just cannot see it.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has got it. How does it help the working people of Ireland, where they have 20 per cent. unemployment and interst rates of 30 per cent? What about people with homes, people who have borrowed money? How does it help them to see interest rates forced up, not to help the economy but basically to preserve an artificial exchange rate? Opposition Members have used a cloud of slogans and make people laugh, but they should rethink their position. There is plenty of room for honest political disagreement. There is nothing wrong with that, but to have someone supporting an absurd policy which only harms working people seems to me ridiculous and shameful.</p>

<p>This idea that one can somehow fix everything&#x2014;interest rates, prices and everything else&#x2014;is the basis of a communist society. What happens when one does that? I ask the hon. Gentleman in all seriousness: if he says that about sums like &#x00A3;18 a week for poor families in Billericay and in Southend, what can I or he or the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition do about it? That is the issue of Maastricht. There is nothing we can do. People will vote in the next election. Remember how the people voted last time, but there is nothing we can do.<br/>
The real tragedy is that people are being misled by MPs jumping up and down and saying, "I want an inquiry," and, "I want a rethink." I remember someone, some silly twit, saying the other day, "I want to stop the scandal of this pornography being sold." Hon. Members heard him, but I will not say who he was. He said that something had to be done. The fact is that the Minister who was in charge of standards until recently&#x2014;my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor)&#x2014;was basically saying, "There is nothing we can do." Yet the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition arid the Liberal Democrats all say, "We want to stop this pornography being sold in Britain, but we cannot do it because of the European broadcasting directives."<br/>

<p>I am sorry to intervene, but I am trying to save time by being helpful. A Labour Member has raised the question of the ERM and the speculators, so can we save time for the future and nail this business once and for all? Because we are in the ERM, our economy is moving at a different speed from those of other economies, and it is obvious that that currency at some stage or another has got to give.<br/>
If it has to give, there is a one-way bet for the speculators, so they are going to make money. If there are floating exchange rates, so that the rates are going up and down according to the economies trading with each other, there is no one-way bet, because they will not know

whether it is to go up or down, but the speculators will make money out of the ERM and not out of the other systems.</p>

<p>We are coming to that in considering future parts of the Bill. The only thing against what my hon. Friend says is Maastricht. Will we have to rejoin the ERM? The answer is that we do not know. At a packed meeting of Back Benchers, the Government said that we did not have to rejoin the ERM at all and some people went, clap, clap, clap.<br/>
The Foreign Secretary, said, in a little pamphlet, that we would have to rejoin the ERM to sign the Maastricht treaty. Then a barrister said that we had to rejoin the ERM to sign Maastricht. The trouble is that no one knows. We have to wait until the European Court tells us. That is the fact that people must face.<br/>
I must come to the amendment, because I have spoken for far too long. Basically, the amendment is saying that title I should go into the treaty. That is what it says: nothing more or less. if I were to ask, "Do I approve of title I?", the answer would be, "Absolutely not," because title I is damaging. It will damage Britain and democracy, and will do all kinds of bad things to our people and to their rights and freedoms.<br/>
But of course, we are not debating whether we support this. We are supporting a simple little structural Liberal Democrat amendment, which says that we would like to put this into the Bill.<br/>
I have listened for a day and a half to all the speeches, including one or two very unusual ones. What I would say to everyone is: "Please tell me: what difference is it going to make if we put this into the Bill?" I listened to the Minister, who spoke for an hour, which I thought was far too long, and I read his speech again this morning; then I read it a second time.<br/>
Having read the Minister's speech, I asked myself what difference the amendment would make. The Minister said that things may go to court if the amendment were accepted. However, the preamble already applies if a case goes to the European Court. Even though it is not in British law, it will be considered by the European Court. In that respect, the amendment makes no difference.<br/>
As every other country is incorporating the treaty into its domestic law, will we be in a speical position when cases go to the European Court? The answer to that is no. I do not criticise the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), who has made some interesting speeches&#x2014;we are looking for his support and co-operation on other issues in future&#x2014;but the hon. Member argued that we must cut down on unnecessary legislation. That was a splendid comment to come from a Labour party spokesman, and I hope that that will be Labour's policy in future.<br/>
7 pm<br/>
What legislation can be produced from a preamble? I have discussed that point with clever lawyers. I went to the Library and asked, "On the basis of the preamble, what law or regulations can be produced?" The answer was, "Nothing at all." What possible reason can there be for not incorporating the amendment in the Bill?<br/>
The reasons given for the amendment by the Liberal Democrats are obvious and simple. They claim that the amendment will simply add "I" to "Titles II, III". If the amendment is accepted, the Liberal Democrats will feel


happier. They will think that British law has been changed and "isn't that nice?" That will make them feel somehow more European, and for a Liberal Democrat, that is fair enough. If they want to do that kind of thing, good luck to them.<br/>
However, are there any other reasons for the amendment? Another reason might be found in article B, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) referred in his splendid speech. Article B refers to the Community providing itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives. Although I am not an expert on these matters, is it not just possible that, if the amendment is incorporated in the Bill, we might have to have that dreadful thing&#x2014;a money resolution?<br/>
If we had a money resolution, that would be terrible. We all know that the treaty will cost us a fortune. As a result of the cohesion fund and the common agricultural policy, every family in Britain will have to pay at least another &#x00A3;2 a week. We will shove lots of money into grand schemes in Portugal and Spain, and into goodness knows what. It would be much better if a European plane dropped &#x00A3;10 notes or 10 ecu notes at random.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has always been very anxious about the amount of money that the Community costs families. It is perhaps worth remembering that we are still recovering from the amount of money that we poured out in the last war. We poured out that money in an attempt to control dictatorships. When the European Community began, there were dictators in Spain, Portugal and Greece. There are no such dictators now. The European Community can take a great deal of the credit for having achieved that result.</p>

<p>I have heard that argument before. In fact, my Euro-ladies whom I meet when I go to speak in constituencies around the country use the argument to reassure themselves about the Community. We joined the Community because it was supposed to help out trade. Sadly, that has turned out to be a great disaster. We have had a deficit of &#x00A3;50,000 million over the past five years. That is a disappointment.<br/>
We were also told that joining the EC would somehow stop unemployment. It has not done that: unemployment is getting worse. We are now saying that we really joined Europe to promote peace. It is interesting to note that the only thing excluded from the treaty of Rome was defence. What has really preserved peace is NATO&#x2014;a splendid voluntary organisation.<br/>
While I appreciate the sincerity of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe), and while I know that many other equally sincere Conservative ladies are trying to reassure themselves by saying that that was the real reason for the European Community, we know, sadly, that peace had nothing to do with it at all.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) does not wish to mislead the House. He said that the one thing missing from the original treaty of Rome was defence. He then went on to say that that was because NATO was responsible for peace and defence. He knows a lot about those issues, and he knows that that is incorrect.<br/>
If the hon. Gentleman refreshes his memory about the modified Brussels treaty which established the Western European Union, he will recall that the WEU was originally established as an economic, social and defence organisation. When the European Community was originally formed, its economic and social aspects were transferred to the EC, and defence remained the prerogative of the WEU. I am sure that the hon.

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) was right to point out that defence is excluded from the European Community. However, he is being less than fair. Surely the point of the European Coal and Steel Community was so to intermingle the coal and steel industries of France and Germany that those countries could never take up arms against each other again.</p>

<p>It is odd to mention coal in this argument. We are in favour of free trade so that goods can cross frontiers easily. However, what is happening to British coal mines today? We are closing pits which are producing coal at &#x00A3;40 a tonne or less, when Germany is producing coal at more than &#x00A3;86 a tonne and other European countries are producing coal at more than &#x00A3;100 a tonne. They are doing that with artificial subsidies. After the British miners have produced cheaper coal, they have been kicked in the teeth, because we are not getting the free trade in Europe that we thought we would get.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) made a wise point about defence. Not only did the Belgians not provide the ammunition in that defence problem, but the Irish said that, because they were what they called an independent country, they were unable to implement United Nations resolutions.<br/>
The French are delightful people, but they sent an army with severe restrictions imposed on it. The poor American commander panicked so much that he had to have the French army defend a sultan's palace because he was not


quite sure what to do with it. The Germans very strangely did the right thing, and 200 of their firms provided the poison gas and extended the Scud missiles for the Iraqis.<br/>
The amendment does not make the slightest difference, unless the issue is the money resolution. The money resolution is the key. Why on earth can we not have a money resolution? We know that the Bill will cost us a fortune. Civil servants will be employed and many things will be done which will cost money. We do not have a money resolution, and we know that, by not having one, many of the things that we should be discussing in the Bill cannot be discussed. If Ministers and hon. Members knew the nightmares that other hon. Members, Labour and Conservative, have been engaged in, trying to find a form of words to enable us to have a debate on a referendum, they would realise why this is important.<br/>
I see no objection to the amendment of the Liberal Democrats. It would not make the slightest difference one way or the other. It would not mean the Government promoting more legislation, it would by no means affect court decisions, and even in Europe, where it could affect court decisions to have this, it is going to be in the treaty anyway. On the other hand, the one thing that we must not say to the Liberal Democrats is that this means that we support it.<br/>
I want to mention one particular proposal and one particular part of it&#x2014;the question of citizenship. Some people have laughed at the citizenship concept, but citizenship of the European union contains symbolism of enormous power. The practical rights to be given to citizens of the European union could instead have been conferred on a reciprocal basis on the citizens of other member states. We could have had this question of being able to vote in elections, and all the rest of it. What has been introduced, however, is something very strange.<br/>
It is, of course, argued that British citizens will remain British citizens even after they become citizens of the union. No doubt this is so, in the same way as British citizens are still citizens of London, Birmingham or wherever they happen to live. But the effect of this tiny amendment to take out this part is to remove from the treaty the commitment to what some people say as the unitary, and some people say is the federalist, nature of the European union.<br/>
The notion of citizenship was introduced not by the Government but by Mr. Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish Prime Minister, and endorsed by the Commission and others. The Commission considered that it would encourage a feeling of involvement in European integration. The Commission proposed that this should be written into the treaty&#x2014;the rights of residence and of movement, and the right to take part in local and national elections stayed exactly the same.<br/>
We must bear in mind that the establishment of a European union does not mean just that people will be able to vote in elections. Some of us think it a bit daft to say that because someone is French he should be able to vote in Derbyshire.</p>

<p>It is worth pointing out that we have lived happily for a very long time with the fact that Irish citizens can vote in all our elections and even become hon. Members. Perhaps my hon. Friend will explain to us what is so awful about the rights which are clearly set out under the citizenship articles and which are very simple: the right to vote and stand in local and European elections, the right

to diplomatic and consular protection, the right to petition the European Parliament and the creation of a new ombudsman.</p>

<p>I hope that my hon. Friend will genuinely think about this. There is nothing wrong at all, if we want it, in saying that people should be able to vote in elections if they have a house here. An American, an Australian, a Pakistani or a Frenchman who has a house in Britain and pays local taxes should be able to vote in elections, and I have no objection to that. We can pass a law saying that they can do this. But we are not doing that. We are saying that if a Frenchman has a house in Derbyshire he can vote but an Australian or an American or someone else cannot. What can possibly be the logic of this kind of discrimination?</p>

<p>My understanding is that a citizen of the United States is unable to.<br/>
The point that I am trying to make is that even if we wanted to sort this out we could do so quite easily by some little provision in British law. The key element of the citizenship Bill is not whether one can vote or petition an ombudsman but what is contained at the end of the section, i.e., the Council of Ministers having the power to strengthen and add to the rights laid down. There is to be a three-year review of one's citizenship duties. If we let this go through, every three years there will be a complete review of the position and the Council of Ministers will be able to add anything it likes to the duties of European citizens. Hon. Members have been told in the past that the common agricultural policy would mean fair prices for the consumer and the housewife, and we have seen what happened. Hon. Members were told that the exchange rate mechanism would guarantee growth and stability, and we have seen what happened. We have been led down the garden path time and time again. We are told that citizenship will mean only certain things, but it will mean more. Hon. Members must wake up to the fact that the introduction of European citizenship will mean the basis of a unitary state with European citizens and not the establishment of a federal Europe&#x2014;that would be a step forward from what we have. I can never understand why the Government keep on saying that they will fight against a federal Europe to the bitter end; a federal Europe would be a step forward.<br/>

<p>I accept that my hon. Friend is a sincere person who has considered his views carefully. I hope that he will appreciate, with all these extra rights and entitlements, that if we had equal application of laws throughout a united Europe things would be much better for these people. Sadly, we do not have that equality of treatment. To illustrate what I mean, I ask him to look at agricultural policy and the way we have not equality but wide variation.<br/>
I ask my hon. Friends to look at the citizenship issue. It is not just a small question; this is the big stuff. Listen to Bob Marley. It is all there. Perhaps hon. Members do not know that Bob Marley was a great singer, a Rastafarian, and some of his songs are the most wonderful one could have. One of them tells the whole story of what Government say to us year after year: please do not worry about anything because everything is going to be all right. That is what we have been told time and time again, and every time it has blown up in our faces. I say to those hon. Members who are not worried about citizenship that it does not just mean voting in council elections. I ask them to think about the three-year review and about the fact that the Council of Ministers will be able to act without limit.<br/>
The Government may ask if we have no faith in them and in their ability to protect us, but that is not how the European Community works. The Government have to do nasty things to get agreement on other things. Hon. Members who doubt this should look at the 40-hour week directive. How many hon. Members know that we have already agreed that French bakers will be exempt but British bakers will not? Why? Not because we think it is sensible or right but because, in EC bargaining, one thing has to be given for another.<br/>
I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will think about this matter. There is no reason why they should or should not vote for the Liberal Democrats' amendment. It will make not the slightest bit of difference to anyone. It will have no impact, except that it might just make a money resolution possible.<br/>
I sincerely hope that, as they proceed through the Bill, hon. Members will think back to the Single European Act and all the pledges that were given, will think back to the treaty of Rome, and will think back to the time when the poor former Prime Minister was a great lady who said,"If you only give a wee bit more money to the CAP, we will wipe out all the mountains, we will start again, and the problems will not arise again." They are always going to arise.<br/>
The people who suffer are not people such as myself&#x2014;they are not politicians. The people who suffer are the ordinary people of Britain who have suffered hugely, who have lost jobs, and who have found that the economy is part of a declining area of the world. Europe's share of world trade is going down and down, the economies of Europe are going down and down, and the ordinary people of Europe are suffering. We have to find some other way out. The other way out for me is to say no to

Maastricht and then, in respect of our present Prime Minister, to say, "Let us promote a treaty on real subsidiarity which would take powers back."<br/>
I am sorry that I have taken a bit longer than I expected, Mr. Lofthouse. You have seen that I was deliberately interrupted to try to keep the debate going. However, I should like to put across a simple message. Remember the threat to people, remember the injuries, and remember Bob Marley's song. If we remember that, we will remember that there is a big battle for the people of Britain, for democracy, for freedom and for liberty.</p>

<p>After listening to the past two days of debate, one thing has become clear in my mind, and that is that this issue divides every party and every country and could, in certain circumstances, realign British politics. That point needs to be made because, if anyone imagines that commitment to either side of the argument is shallow, he is quite wrong. There are some who are passionately committed to the federal Europe in its most unitary sense and always have been, and there are those&#x2014;I am one of them&#x2014;who believe that we are Members of Parliament only because our electors sent us to Parliament and that their rights must be paramount. They are very deep matters. The House of Commons is not the place to reach that decision.<br/>
After listening to the debate, with the many complex arguments&#x2014;we have heard long and important speeches&#x2014;it has become clear to me that those are matters that the public alone can determine.<br/>
I cannot see any reason for speaking in the debate other than to try as best I can to explore what the treaty means, to clarify its implications and to explain to the people who sent me here, in particular, what effect the treaty will have upon their lives and upon their future. I am here only because they have lent me powers, and I have no moral authority to give them away. I have told the Opposition Chief Whip that nothing in the world would alter my conviction, because one cannot ask an hon. Member to give away what he does not own. That is my position, and I say it in a way that I am sure the Committee will understand.<br/>
I am very glad that the Liberal Democrats have moved the amendment, because, whether people vote for or against it, it will make no difference; it will be embodied in the treaty. Therefore, the Liberal Democrats' amendment has merely provided for us the opportunity to have an extremely important debate which had to be held, and for that we must be grateful.<br/>
Before we examine the question of European union, we should look at the position of the House of Commons in deciding how to deal with the Bill. Much will be made of the subject of ratification and of a money resolution, but the House of Commons has been held in check by the Crown. I am not talking about the Queen and the royal family; I am talking about the Crown as a legal institution since the 17th century. It is important to understand that none of us can be Members of Parliament without taking an oath of allegiance to the Crown. I am a republican.</p>

<p>When I went to the Table after the April general election, I said, "As a committed republican, I solemnly declare and affirm that I will bear faithful and true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her


heirs and successors according to law," because that was what my electors told me to say when they elected me. At the same time, that was the Crown.<br/>
I now refer to the treaty itself. The matter is not as obscure as it might have appeared when I tried to develop the argument. How was the Foreign Secretary able to go to Maastricht and sign the treaty? It was because he had the authority of the Crown to sign the treaty. The Queen had given plenipotentiary powers to the Foreign Secretary, so the treaty was initialled&#x2014;it has not yet been ratified&#x2014;by the Foreign Secretary under Crown powers. We are not even allowed to discuss the Bill without the Queen's consent&#x2014;the Crown's consent&#x2014;because it touches on the prerogatives of the Crown.<br/>
I have introduced various Bills which touch on the prerogative, few of which have reached the statute book. I have had to write to the Home Secretary on each occasion and I have received letters from him saying that Her Majesty had graciously placed her prerogatives at the disposal of the House of Commons for the purpose of discussing this or that Bill. That is the next element of the Crown. Of course, if the Bill is passed, it will require the assent of the Crown&#x2014;Royal Assent. We cannot have a referendum, we have been told, because the right to promote expenditure belongs to the Crown. That is why a money resolution cannot be tabled by a Back-Bench Member. Only the Crown, through the voice of a Secretary of State, can table a money resolution.<br/>
If the Bill becomes law, it will confer upon British Ministers greater prerogative powers in Brussels than they now have. Those laws passed by treaty-making powers of the Crown will be capable of wiping out legislation passed by both Houses of Parliament and assented to in a subordinate way by the Crown.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) gave an example of legislation that had been overridden by Common Market legislation&#x2014;I think that it was the Bank of England Act 1946. I give him another example. In 1945, just after the atomic bomb was dropped, the post-war Government, with general consent, passed a resolution saying that all atomic material, including uranium, found in Britain belonged to the Government. Of course, Euratom is a federal system. When I raised the matter with Commissioner Brunner I was told, "I am sorry, but the Atomic Energy Act 1946 has now been subsumed in Euratom. Everything that we now do in Brussels is done by the Crown."<br/>
The reason why the House of Commons is frustrated is that, in terms of legislation, we are back to where we were before 1649. <i>[Laughter.] </i>Conservative Members laugh. I was on the Council of Ministers for five years&#x2014;I was once the president. Every time I assented to everything, I assented by the powers of the Crown. I am not trying to provoke anybody. I am trying to explain to people outside why the House of Commons is impotent in the matter. It is already impotent because of the treaty of Rome, but it is a fact that all laws that are made in the union&#x2014;that is what it is&#x2014;and made with the assent of British Ministers will represent a growth of prerogative power.<br/>
Before we consider what the union might do to us in terms of our system of government, let us realise what that enterprise has done to us already in a strictly domestic context. The House of Commons has passed over to the Crown the powers of law making which it won hundreds of years ago, for which there is no parallel. In the first years in which I was a Member of Parliament, as far as I could

make out, there was no capacity for the Crown to make laws except within the very narrow domestic context as with security services, or whatever.</p>

<p>When I catch the Chairman's eye, I hope to continue discussion of some of these points, but does the right hon.

<p>If we defeat the Bill, we can prevent the extension of prerogative power; but some of it has already slipped through our fingers, in 1972, without it ever being made explicit what was happening.<br/>
The last point that I make about Crown powers&#x2014;I hope nobody will understand me&#x2014;is that when Government Whips press Back-Bench Members to support a Bill, one weapon which they use is the granting or withholding of patronage under the powers of the Crown. I do not know much about the Conservative party, but I dare say that an elderly Conservative Member, planning to retire at the next election, might find it harder to have a peerage given to him if he voted against the Maastricht treaty, because knighthoods, baronetcies and peerages may be withheld according to the discipline of the Whips.<br/>
Indeed, for younger Members the prospect of getting a Crown appointment as a Minister of the Crown may be affected if there is disloyalty on the Maastricht treaty. I am told that in the Conservative party even an invitation to a royal garden party may be dangled or withdrawn if Members are not in line.<br/>
The point I am trying to make&#x2014;and I am doing little more than giving an account of how this place works&#x2014;is that when we look at a story from the beginning, through the legislation, through the ratification which is done by Crown prerogative, through to the pressure of the Whips, the Commons has never completed the work which it began in 1688. Therefore, for that reason if for no other, it is not a body capable of dealing with this act of union for which the Bill provides.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman invites me to make a speech twice as long as the one I intended to make. I was thrown out of Parliament by Crown prerogative. My father was made a peer, and when he died I was thrown out of the House because that prerogative had given me a peerage. The Speaker would not let me in. The right hon.

<p>I do not think anyone would put that in doubt. Indeed, the battle that the right hon. Gentleman


fought in those days was admired and, I think, supported by some of my hon. Friends. The question that I was asking was about the time when he was a Minister of the Crown and was exercising Crown prerogative as a Minister of the Crown. That is the question to which I was seeking an answer. Certainly I would not seek to question the right hon. Gentleman's commitment to the democratic process.

<p>I do not know what the right hon. Gentleman meant. If I responded strongly, it was because of the suggestion that I was cooking up a phoney argument to promote opposition to this Bill. If the right hon. Gentleman really wants to know, when I was made a Cabinet Minister and a Privy Councillor, and saw the Privy Councillor's oath, it was so revolting that I asked not to have to take it. It pledged me to all sorts of things about foreign prelates and potentates. The right hon. Gentleman has probably seen it. When I went to the Cabinet Office and it was read to me, I said at the end that I had never agreed to it. The clerk to the Privy Council said, "You do not have to agree." I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "I have administered the oath." I never knew that a Privy Councillor's oath was an injection. I did not want it; I did not agree; I got it administered, and all it does is occasionally, not always, give me a chance to speak in the House.<br/>
This is a point of substance. In 1968 I argued for a referendum. I may sound like Harold Wilson in remembering where it was, but it was at the Welsh conference of the Labour party in Llandudno. Some Cabinet colleagues demanded that I be dismissed from the Cabinet for mentioning a referendum. In the end I persuaded my party to go for it. My right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition voted for the referendum. The deputy Leader of the Opposition was a Whip who voted for a referendum. It all took time. We lost Roy Jenkins on the way. I do not know how to describe it, but he resigned because he did not want the public to be consulted.<br/>
I should like to come back to my line of argument, but I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that both on the renunciation of the peerage and on the referendum my commitment for many years has been that the people should decide who is to be their Member of Parliament and whether he should go.<br/>
Coming back to my argument, I can revert to my role as a lecturer for the Workers Educational Association. Let us look at what union would mean. There has been talk about citizenship and so on. Let me try to make it clear to those who might be watching the debate at home on television&#x2014;the whole debate should be televised&#x2014;that it makes a fundamental difference in the relationship between an elector and a Member of Parliament.<br/>
One reason that we do not have many riots in Britain is that people can have a say. Over many years I have said, "Do not riot; vote. You can defeat the Government. In that way you can change policy and you will achieve what you want by peaceful means." People do not realise that democracy hangs on a very slender, delicate thread. If the link is broken and people realise that, no matter for whom they vote in an election, decisions will be taken by the European union, I do not say that they will riot, but we

could not argue against action taken directly by them because there was no democratic route for the solution to their problem.</p>

<p>Does the right hon.

Gentleman agree that, because our agricultural powers have been given to Europe, I as a Member representing farmers now have great difficulty in getting anything done for the people whom I represent?

<p>The hon. Gentleman points to a problem that has already arisen deriving from the treaty of Rome, which I do not want to go into because we are discussing its extension. He is right. The work of Members in their constituencies is one of the most unreported aspects of an hon. Member's life. I do not know how many letters other hon. Members receive. I assume that we all get approximately the same number. If they were grossed up, we would find that hundreds of thousands of representations made to hon. Members are never reported because the media is not interested in democracy but only in politicians, which is a different speciality.<br/>
I have sat in Cabinets when papers have come from Ministers written by their civil servants. Other Ministers may say, "It may look good to the Department of Health but it would not deal with the problem that came up at my surgery last Friday." That relationship is important. It educates Members, and we represent our constituents' views.<br/>
Another point which has not been touched on is that, because of the way law making is done in the Community, even if it is by qualified majority, it is easy to make a law but there has to be the same majority or unanimity to repeal it.<br/>
For many years it has rightly been a principle of this House that no Parliament can bind its successors. In European union every decision binds its successors because one cannot change it. Even if a British Government were elected on the issue of repealing a piece of this legislation, prospective Members of Parliament would not be able to tell the electorate that they would repeal it because the mechanism to do so would not exist. European Community legislation is like a lobster pot&#x2014;it is easy to get in but very difficult to get out.<br/>
I do not have to dwell at great length on the second aspect of the treaty as I have dealt with it already. The Council of Ministers is a Parliament and not a Cabinet&#x2014;it makes the laws. It is the only Parliament in the world to meet in secret.<br/>
During the British presidency in 1977, I tabled a motion that the Council should meet in public. Ministers would have died rather than agree. They all went to the Council, saying that they were going to defend this or that. When they got there they did all the deals and did not want


anyone to know what happened. It is as if this Parliament met in secret. From that point of view the Council is totally undemocratic&#x2014;but decisions made there by British Ministers are made by royal prerogative in any case.<br/>
The third difference is that between the elected and appointed part of our constitution. Anyone who has been a Minister knows that civil servants work to a Minister. They may be difficult, but one can tell them, "I want this paper put to the Cabinet."<br/>
At the Council of Ministers no one is allowed to submit a paper. Ministers can only act on the initiative of the Commission. I have sat on every committee that I can think of&#x2014;from the local party to the national executive and the shadow Cabinet&#x2014;but the Council of Ministers is the only committee where, even as president for energy, I could not submit a paper to the other Members because the powers of initiation are vested in the Commission. That will be a fundamental change and it is not altered in any way by the Maastricht treaty.<br/>
At the Council, Ministers have to try to bully Commissioners who are appointed to submit a paper in the hope that their idea may come back before it.</p>

<p>Is not that argument vital? It is an illustration of why so many of us say that the European Community is intrinsically authoritarian. The authority for any initiative lies with the Commission. Furthermore, it is important for title I, as in articles A to F, and the two pillars&#x2014;home and foreign affairs&#x2014;it is written in the treaty that the Commission shall be fully associated with these matters and has the duty of co-ordinating the totality.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is opening up the question very fully. It is true that the Commission has great powers. I shall give the House two examples. Viscount Davignon, who was the Commissioner for industry, and Guido Brunner told me, when I was an elected Secretary of State, that I could not insist that North sea oil he refined in Britain, and that that oil should come under the terms of the treaty of Rome. Secondly, I tried to continue a scheme introduced by the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) when he was Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, whereby he supported Scottish industries working in North sea oil&#x2014;it got a slightly lower rate of interest. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

<p>That is subsidiarity at work&#x2014;one just goes on talking and no one takes any notice.<br/>
The Commissioners told me that if I continued the scheme introduced by the former party leader they would take me to court&#x2014;and they did. They chose polling day in 1979, when I was on my bicycle anyway.<br/>
Do not think that the power of the Commission to initiate actions to frustrate an elected Government in Britain is not real&#x2014;it is. I can imagine circumstances when a Government, elected by a huge majority&#x2014;it does not matter of which party&#x2014;to do something, did it and was

then told by civil servants, "I'm sorry, Minister, what you are doing is illegal." What would happen if the elected Government were not able to carry forward their policy? There would be a major constitutional crisis.</p>

<p>I shall give way when I have finished the analysis.<br/>
The treaty transfers power from politicians to the courts. In Europe, courts are different from those in Britain. They are political and do not pretend to be impartial, as they do here. The continental legal tradition is that law is a new way to implement constitutions and policies. Elected British Ministers could be taken to the court on citizenship, or on any other issue, and they would find that their power had been transferred&#x2014;from the electorate and Parliament&#x2014;to judges. Once one got into that situation, one would not be able to get out of it.<br/>
I am not misery-mongering, but trying to look ahead at the nature of the constitution and of the political crises that could lie ahead if we made such changes.<br/>
One only has to listen to some of the speeches on the issue to realise that the Bill is advocated by people of a managerial bent. I see myself as a representative: I am here to represent the people. I hear many of those who advocate the treaty say that they view the handling of Europe as the good management of Europe. They say that we must manage the exchange rate, trade, this or that. I have no doubt that most of them would be well qualified to be Commissioners. However, managers without consent never get very far, even in industry.<br/>
Those five changes in relationship&#x2014;between the electors and Members, between Members and the Government, between the legislature and the executive, between the Commons and the Commission, between the political and judicial and the representative and managerial&#x2014;are all inherent in the treaty. People must not merely troop in at the end of the Third Reading; they must understand what the treaty is about. Because of the nature of the changes, I believe that the public and the electors, who put us here, must decide whether they wish them to be made.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has in part dealt with my point&#x2014;which is that there is a fundamental difference in the way in which law is construed in this country. We have the common law, by practice, from the people and upward. The continental system is decided by codes and handed down from above, as the right hon. Gentleman illustrated. In our system of government we have a tradition of "by the people and for the people", whereas they have a tradition of government of the people. That is quite different from the way in which we view our citizenship.</p>

To sum up, Bagehot, in his book on the English constitution, said that the Crown was the dignified and the House of Commons the effective part of the constitution. Now the Crown is the effective and the House of Commons is the dignified. Crown powers now determine our policy, but the Commons has all the glory of television, the Speaker and all the glamour of our debates. But we are simply performing a dignified function. That is the nature of the transformation that has taken place since 1972.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend rightly criticises the fact that only the Commission currently has the right to initiate legislation in the European Community.

Does it follow from his criticism that he wants the European Parliament to initiate more legislation in the future?</p>

<p>I want the Commission abolished, because no civilised democratic country would allow any power whatever to be in the hands of unelected people who cannot be removed. I have drafted a Bill, which my hon. Friend may have seen, called the Commonwealth of Europe Bill, under which we would have a secretary-general and would harmonise the 50 countries of Europe by consent through an assembly. The assembly would agree to conventions to which member states would adhere.<br/>
The United States would never agree to be governed by commissioners. If we were to have a fully federal united states of Europe, the first casualty would be the Commission, the second would be the Council of Ministers, and the treaty of Maastricht would be burned as the British flag was burned in 1776. So please do not tell me that the treaty is a route to democracy. It is a pathway back to the feudal past.<br/>
One of our difficulties is that all the party leaders agree about the Maastricht treaty. I realise that there is a difference on the social chapter and economic and monetary union, but if party leaders were in a Cabinet of all the talents, the Bill would go through in two minutes. The Labour leader would simply add the social chapter in the event of Labour winning an election, which is why the Opposition Front Bench is almost deserted. I think that the Opposition's tactics are to have a one-line Whip so that the Bill will go through with a Government majority. Otherwise, we would have a crowded Front Bench eager to hear my speech and make their own.<br/>
I must explore the problem raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) about the Labour party's position. If we are to explore how decisions are reached, I must explore with him how the Labour party's decision was reached. I am on the national executive and have been for longer than anyone in the Labour party's history. I voted against the manifesto at the March meeting because we were told that the party was in favour of the Maastricht treaty, despite the fact that it

had not been signed at the time of the previous conference and had not even then been published in English. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) and I made no fuss, but voted against the manifesto, as the executive record shows. When I went to Chesterfield, I took the precaution of getting somebody to make a video of my speech explaining my view on Europe. I honestly do not believe that there is Labour support for the Maastricht treaty.<br/>
At the 1992 annual conference, a Bolsover delegate put forward a motion about a referendum. I argued for it at the conference and Alan Tuffin of the Union of Communication Workers argued and voted against it. I discovered later that his delegation had voted for the referendum.<br/>
If we are to discuss how Parliament works, we had better also discuss how the party works. The hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) may rub his hands, but the truth can never be harmful when we are discussing the future government of the country. I am lucky because I cannot be bullied by the Whips. If they offered me a peerage, they would be misjudging my ambitions. I do not need cash and will not get office. I am a free man. Had I known what fun it was to be 60 years old, I would have done it years ago. I intend to speak my mind. For me, the Bill is about whether we shall remain an imperfect democracy or become part of a Euro nationalism. Euro nationalism is being put around our necks under an authoritarian system.</p>

<p>I was responding to a problem put to me by the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Carttiss) about his party. I was trying to explain that it is an old problem.<br/>
I believe passionately in Europe. I lost a brother and many friends in the last world war and I share the view that Europe must get beyond nationalism. We must explore ways of co-operating.<br/>
Europe contains 50 countries, not just 12. I want harmonisation to be at the pace of those who can go along with it, for a practical reason. It is already clear that, because of the existing Community institutions, when anything goes wrong people blame the Germans. It is the fault not of the Germans but of the treaty of Rome. There has been hostility towards the Italians. The awful wartime


language spoke of the huns, the wops, and the Iti's, and, reading <i>The Sun,</i> one sees that we are not far from that now.<br/>
Democratic consent is delicate. Therefore, if we try to hurry beyond the capacity to absorb and accept the implications, I fear that the matter will end like Yugoslavia, which was an imposed federation, or the so-called "socialist camp" of communist countries, which was imposed. I know that it is not exactly the same. but the problems of unemployment are caused not by the Germans, but by the role of bankers in forcing down economic policy to the point where there is mass unemployment. We must keep our eye on the real issue and not allow it to degenerate into an attack on other nationalities.<br/>
Why have the British people allowed the treaty to go so far? I am no historian, but we were conquered by a Roman, Julius Caesar; we were then conquered by William the Conqueror in 1066; James I was then brought down from Scotland; William III then came over from Holland; and George I, who was a German, then ruled. Indeed, until the first world war, the royal family was called Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. It changed its name to Windsor and got rid of some German dukes&#x2014;the Duke of Cumberland was de-duked. I went into the matter to see whether I could get the same right. We now have a Prince of Wales whose father is a Greek.<br/>
Thus, we have as a nation been trained to accept that we shall be governed by other nationalities. Because of the defect in our democracy, Britain has a culture of subservience that makes us accept that Jacques Delors should have those powers. When Jacques Delors came to Britain, the BBC asked him whether we were good Europeans, bowing and scraping to him like the Dimblebys bow and scrape to the royal family. We are a nation trained to bow and scrape, so, naturally, when we are told that the Crown prerogative will ratify the treaty, people say, "How could we be unkind to the Queen Mother?", as if she were ratifying the treaty. It will be ratified not by the Queen Mother but by the godfather in No. 10. It is a matter of national confidence.<br/>
Hon. Members have asked how we can deny the Danes or other member states the right to the social chapter by voting against it. No rights were ever given to anybody from the top. All rights have been won. If the Danes want rights, they must elect a Government that will give them those rights and we should have to do the same. We sit at home watching "Newsnight" and Peter Snow with his ruddy computer and are told that Jacques Delors has given us social justice. That is absolute rubbish. All our rights, including the right to vote, to trade unions, to the welfare state and to full employment, were struggled for by our people using our mechanism.<br/>
8 pm<br/>
The idea that somehow the third world will benefit if we enter this arrangement is an illusion. It is not true, and it encourages the idea that we are no good. I have never believed in the conspiracy theory, but I do not believe that democracy is such a powerful force that some people have wanted to try to take it back. Not long ago the suffragettes had their problems. I put a plaque in the broom cupboard in the Crypt to the memory of Emily Wilding Davidson. There are no memorials in this place to the people who fought for democracy.<br/>
The best way to get round democracy is to pass the real power to someone who is not elected and cannot be removed. This treaty is an anti-chartist, anti-suffragette campaign. We have been told for years that this nation is not good enough to govern itself, that it has to be governed from Brussels. We have been told that we cannot defend ourselves but must have NATO, and that we cannot organise our economy and must have the IMF. We are told that this is a nation of lazy workers&#x2014;militant shop stewards, inefficient managers and football hooligans&#x2014;a nation waiting for discipline. Of course, the discipline will come from Europe.<br/>
I apologise for making such a long speech, and I hope that no hon. Member will accuse me of trying to delay the debate. I genuinely try to argue without being offensive to anyone. These are big questions. I have spoken to Mr. Morris again about a referendum being paid for by the Community because we must find a way to give people that right. We are not entitled to decide this matter ourselves. If we do and people turn against the treaty, there will be no mechanism by which they could share the responsibility for a decision that affected their lives.<br/>
I beg all hon. Members&#x2014;those who are for, as well as those who are against, the Maastricht treaty&#x2014;to agree with the principle that the matter must be determined by everybody in our land. All the arguments could be taken to the people, and they are not so foolish that they could not absorb and understand them. We are talking about their lives, not ours.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, which I assure you is a real one. Yesterday through the courtesy of the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Mr. Garel-Jones), and with the indulgence of the Chair, there was a fairly complex exchange, almost an interrogation, on the question of whether title I bit on some parts of the treaty and prevented certain parts of it being enforceable in law in this country. I genuinely seek guidance on this point because it will determine whether title I of the treaty can be debated in the terms in which many of us wish it to be debated. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State was entirely correct to say that under article L, title I is not justiciable by the European Court. That is reported in columns 183&#x2013;84 of yesterday's <i>Official Report.</i><br/>
There is contrary legal advice that it would be taken into account in interpreting all those parts of the treaty that are amendments to the treaty of Rome and subsequent associated treaties. Title I is binding in international law, and although it may not be justiciable in the terms that my right hon. Friend announced, that is not the same as saying that it is not binding. I have a document which should be tabled for our elucidation. It is the Van Gend En Loos judgment of the European Court of 5 February 1963. It follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Lofthouse. Is it not a matter for the Chair that the debate should proceed on a basis of clear understanding of the constitutional implications of title I? I have a terrible fear that even in the area of foreign policy cited by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, the clauses, if traced


through the treaty, could bind us to foreign policy by majority voting. That should be explained to the Committee because we have been given the impression that that is not the case.</p>

<p>As usual the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) delivered a fascinating and fundamental speech. He always treats us to such speeches and we are grateful. At the start of it he alluded to the amendments but did not reach them because he was carried away by other issues. Those of us who wished to refer to some of the themes presented in the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats and related amendments found, as we usually find, that the Committee descends, generally on the second day, into a general and broad Second Reading debate. Some hon. Members return to such issues as whether it is right to be a member of the Community while others, including me, say that it is a good idea.<br/>
That is both good and bad, although it involves the constant tedious repetition of points that are made in almost every European debate. I exclude late night debates under the old system of scrutiny. If people outside pay attention to our debates, they do not seem to have become alarmed over the years about the so-called surrender of national and constitutional rights that were mentioned repeatedly by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield. I do not think that people as a whole share his anxieties.<br/>
I have always paid tribute to the profundity of the right hon. Gentleman's thoughts and I recently re-read the excellent biography by Sydney Higgins about the right hon. Gentleman's political life and work. According to that writer, the right hon. Gentleman hardly ever did anything wrong. The right hon. Gentleman personifies the proud struggle for the achievement of parliamentary rights in the more modern context and more traditionally in his emotional and intellectual attachment to the old historical rights that Parliament has won.<br/>
Those who are keen to see the legislation proceed rapidly feel entitled to complain about the Government's timidity and slowness in dealing with an entirely brief, routine technical Bill. It provides for certain provisions to enter United Kingdom law and the amendments to the treaties that we have already signed. That would be followed by ratification of the treaty, although that is not the subject of this debate.<br/>
The Government could have proceeded much earlier this year after Second Reading. We know, either by speculation or from direct knowledge, the rather sad reasons why that was not done. That has given the right hon. Gentleman and others who see terrors in the gradual development of the European Community through this latest treaty the excuse or reason to say that the nightmare is developing beyond the control of the British people and constitution.<br/>
Those of us who welcome the Maastricht treaty disagree profoundly and directly, as everybody knows. Our advantage is that the huge majority of hon. Members are on our side and that none of them shares the terrors,

anxieties and apprehensions of a small minority of hon. Members. At present most of that small minority are Conservatives, but the thread of the speech by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield was that the Labour party might start to unravel some of its solidarity on these matters and show that it is not quite capable of holding what appears to be the strong position of Labour Front-Bench spokesmen.<br/>
I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) who delivered an excellent speech yesterday.</p>

Member for Chesterfield is in favour of a referendum, as are a small number of hon. Members on both sides of the House&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Sedentary interruptions are often more disconcerting than standing ones, but for the moment I shall carry on. If the opportunity provides itself, I shall give way later to the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell).<br/>
A small minority of Members of Parliament is in favour of a referendum, but I can think of nothing that more undermines the sacred constitutional sovereignty of the House of Commons&#x2014;the centre and kernel of political parliamentary power as described by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield.</p>

<p>No. My hon. Friend's intervention was lengthy and verging on the repetitious, and I must be allowed to reply. That a referendum would undermine the sovereignty of the House is a fundamental error in my hon. Friend's argument. The other mistake which is joined to that&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am now facing the Chair, Mr. Lofthouse. I am placed in a difficult position because the line between my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton) and the Chair is direct. The other


fundamental error made conjointly by those who are in favour of a referendum is that waiting for the Danes' opinion would also undermine our sacred constitutional sovereignty. I object to the idea that we must wait for the opinion of others before we decide what to do.<br/>
I wish to emphasise to the right hon. Member for Chesterfield, lest he gets the wrong impression, that the pro-Europeans are in favour of the treaty because we do not feel that we are surrendering power to anybody else by signing it and by developing the Community further, and because we feel that it strengthens our sovereign power. The right hon. Gentleman explained the old theory of the House of Commons at work. His description was like one of those old books by Taylor, "The House of Commons At Work: How it Really Works". He was not explaining the real world. However, I agreed with his second reason for the slipping away of power from Members of Parliament with their sacred trusts and rights&#x2014;the power of the whipping system. Unless one is part of the majority in the House, one does not have power and even if one is a member of the majority party, one does not have power in the complexity of modern politics in which power flows to governmental institutions.<br/>
I am reassured about the developments, about signing the Maastricht treaty and about approving this excellent but short and technical Bill&#x2014;a process that should not take so long, although I would not deny the House of Commons its rights&#x2014;because none of those dangers and perils would occur if we went ahead with them. I see the sovereign member states of the European Community working much more together but gaining in individual national strength as a result of that process. I am surprised that the right hon. Member for Chesterfield, who years ago was an enthusiast for the European Community, has not begun to accept that explanation of the real world rather than the abstruse romantic theorising about the House of Commons as it was hoping to be several hundred years ago.</p>

<p>There are many different complexities about those matters, and we are talking about a referendum on Europe in the context of what my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton said. She claimed that it was invalid just to take the views of Members of Parliament&#x2014;a surprising assertion in view of the sacred nature of Members of Parliament in the constitutional process&#x2014;if all the parties apparently agreed and the general election therefore did not provide the opportunity for the matters fully to be debated.

The hon. Member for Blyth Valley and I worry about the excessive power of the whipping system. We all know that we have little say in practical terms, but no hon. Member can assert that the treaty is the only treaty that the country has signed that has brought in relatively, fairly or reasonably profound changes. We have signed many treaties involving many changes. I reject the doom-laden assertion that there is something extra specially ominous and difficult about the Maastricht treaty. It is the logical conclusion of the preparation that this and other sovereign countries have made together, ever since the Stuttgart declaration of June 1983, to go forward to the development of European union, which had already been referred to in the treaty of Rome.</p>

<p>By that, I do not mean what is left because of Europe but what is left as a result of the practical reality of modern-day politics. The same pattern is repeated in every other country&#x2014;the Executive have gained more and more power and Parliaments have become not just dignified and ceremonial, in the words of the right hon. Member for Chesterfield, but bodies in which individual Members of Parliament have lost their powers.<br/>
Some people would say that it was ever thus because only in the last century or so have Parliaments developed from being advisory chambers of nobles, with monarchs running the country. Parliament has taken many decisions on behalf of the people, decisions of much greater profundity, moment and weight than the signing of an additional treaty, which flows from the treaty of Rome, the Stuttgart declaration and the Single European Act.

One could say that war and peace are far more profound and should always be the subject of a referendum. It is nonsense to argue that there must be a referendum simply because all parties agree on a particular policy element. In all general elections, there are many policy areas where there is unanimity or broad agreement, and no one suggests that means there should be a referendum.

<p>Many of my hon. Friends believe that the treaty is a matter for Parliament and not a suitable subject for a referendum.

<q>Amendments to a Bill proposing that the provisions of a Bill should be subject to a referendum have been ruled out of order as proposing changes in legislative procedure which would be contrary to constitutional practice.</q>
Referendums are not part of our country's constitutional practice. Ours is a parliamentary democracy, and this is the right place to debate the Bill.</p>

The European Movement, of which I am chairman and whose members include European enthusiasts of all parties and none&#x2014;including trade unionists, businessmen, and members of the young European movement&#x2014;also warned that if the Government were negative about defending the Community and the treaty, more and more second thoughts would set in, which would naturally affect the public.<br/>
It is interesting to crystallise and to explain public opinion. I do not believe that the public are intrinsically anti-European Community, but United Kingdom citizens of all backgrounds, professions, and trades have a grotesque fear, which I understand, of losing their jobs and of living and surviving in the recession. People naturally lose their enthusiasm for anything that they regard as irrelevant international exercises of one kind or another.

<p>No. I was referring to the Commission as a body. The idea that the Commission is far too powerful is untrue. It is an inherently weak body. It has the constitutional task of proposing legislation to be submitted to the Council of Ministers, but the Council of Ministers is the boss; it makes the decisions. The Commission often grumbles about that reality. It would like those decisions to be more pan-European, and it is entitled to its aspirations. It is becoming more and more lumbered not with its own initiatives but with suggestions flowing from the Council of Ministers, the European Council and particularly from the most dangerous development of all&#x2014;the grand Saturday night dinner at the European summit where such wonderful claret is consumed that they grow expansive and say, "Let's have another report from the Commission on such-and-such a subject."<br/>

<p>I repeat that we made the mistake of entering the exchange rate mechanism too high and too late. The Government are unwilling now to confront what is effectively only a very small number of real hard-core rebels, some of whose arguments are dishonest and frighten the people outside this place. Those errors and omissions mean that the Bill is being debated now in Committee instead of several months ago. Although I have already made the point, it is legitimate to repeat briefly that I regret the slowness with which this issue has been dealt with.<br/>
I regret, too, the timidity of the Government. As a keen European, I make no apologies for saying that. I want to reassure those who are terrified and trembling about what foreigners are planning for us next&#x2014;probably fluoride in the water without the House being able to vote upon it&#x2014;by saying that I believe that the activities of the House of Commons should, in the constitutional sense, be strengthened. Therefore, I very much welcome the greater participation and involvement of national Parliaments in the plurality and dispersal of power, the consideration of new policies and decision making. That is the hallmark of the European Community.<br/>
Timidity is also shown in the document that I am holding. I make no complaint about its contents. It is helpful. It explains the background lucidly. It is similar to


the traditional notes on clauses. It reiterates also some of the elements, though in more detail, of a smaller pamphlet that again was issued rather late in the day. The pamphlet could have been published earlier this year. I do not understand why the Government took so long to publish it. Their printing system is supposed to be extremely efficient.<br/>
The tone of this document is very negative, as though, once again, the Government are nervous and apprehensive about a small minority of little Englanders. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] They want to live in the past.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) is not in the Chamber. Perhaps he is rehearsing yet another blockbuster that will alienate even more opinion outside the House on European matters. My hon.

One does not like to say that about one's colleagues.<br/>
Far be it from us to wait on what other national Parliaments may do. We have our own national self-confidence. We should not worry about what those wicked foreigners think, though it is funny how we are hanging so closely on what the Danes think. Last week I was in Copenhagen. Every person to whom I spoke in the Folketing asked me, "Why are the British waiting for us? Why don't they go ahead? It's nothing to do with us." They also said, "Yes, we confidently expect a yes result this time."</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford gave the impression that the Bundestag had had massive second thoughts about Maastricht, ratification of the treaty and all the rest of it. Far from it. One should refer to the account of the debate that is already in the news media. Colleagues have told me about it while the debate proceeds. Ratification&#x2014;the final stage in the Bundestag&#x2014;was a triumphant endorsement of Maastricht. There was a huge majority for the Bill in the Bundestag. There were no second thoughts. All that they did in their debate was to clarify the particular relationship of the Bundesrat to the Bundestag and the relationship of the lander to the

federal Government and the federal constitution. There were no second thoughts. The final ministerial speech&#x2014;details of it have been faxed to me, so I do not have it word for word&#x2014;was an exhortation: now that we have ratified Maastricht, we hope that it will encourage the Danes and the British to do so as quickly as possible. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford&#x2014;I shall tell him that I have referred to his remarks&#x2014;did not say that at all. He said that the Germans had had huge second thoughts on Europe.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has been most courteous in giving way, but he was very provocative when he said that this was a routine and technical Bill. I ask my hon.

It is not a routine and technical Bill. To pretend otherwise is to do my hon. Friend's own cause, which he has honourably espoused, a disservice.

<p>The problem is that I have to try to face you in your Chair, Dame Janet, and my hon. Friend. I think that my hon. Friend has misunderstood the position. I was not being discourteous when I said that the Bill was technical and brief, which it literally is. All I am saying is that all those arguments were presumably aired during the earlier stages, including Second Reading. The conclusion must therefore be that, in the absence of any significant change, the House overwhelmingly supports the legislation, which itself refers to consequential amendments, in the legislation of the European Community, to the treaty. I say no more than that. That is why I regret that, all too often, we return in our debates to the fundamental question as to whether membership of the European Community is a good idea.</p>

<p>Crucial to the debate on this group of amendments is the question of power and whether that power will be taken away from us. The hon. Gentleman keeps on saying that that is not so, but where in the treaty is there any suggestion that power, let alone more power, will remain with this Parliament? The reason why so much criticism was levelled at the treaty both before and during the two-day debate was that power will increasingly be taken away from this Parliament and given to Europe. That is why the hon. Gentleman ought to be as honest as the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) and the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston). Although the right hon. Gentleman is a great enthusiast for the treaty, he, unlike the hon. Gentleman, admits, defends and justifies the taking away of further powers from Parliament. Why is the hon. Gentleman not willing to admit that?</p>

<p>We all have our ways of explaining these things. I do not think that it is a transfer of power from one entity, a nation state, to another, Europe. It is a development of the collective power of all the sovereign


member states working together in the new concept of European union. I am grateful for the patience of the Chair&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not intend to give way again as it would be unfair to hon. Members who are waiting to speak.<br/>

<p>This is my answer. The hon. Gentleman may not like it, but he must accept it.<br/>
The enhancement of intrinsic sovereign power for all member states comes from their collective, reciprocal sharing of that power, based increasingly on majority voting and the terrifying concept of democracy, which the anti-democrats in the anti-European camp do not accept or like.<br/>
The amendments are illogical. The hon. Member for Hamilton amply explained why they do not fit and are not apposite and would have the opposite effect of that intended by the hon. Members who tabled them. That is why the House needs to settle down and accept that the vast majority of Members want the treaty to go ahead without further undue delay.</p>

Hon. Members who have a valuable contribution to make to the debate have not had the opportunity to do so. The amendments allow Members on both sides of the Committee to debate the principle behind title I of the treaty and to articulate our fundamental opposition to what the House, under the guidance of the Government, is likely to be forced to do.

A rumour&#x2014;it may be unfounded&#x2014;is circulating that a closure motion will be moved shortly, certainly before 10 o'clock or just at 10 o'clock.

You said that the fact the Minister intends to speak again does not mean that the debate will be concluded.

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. We spent a considerable amount of time on this debate yesterday, and at 10 pm we will have devoted a whole day to it today. I would not for a minute suggest what you should do, but I merely point out that, by then, we will have had as long as we normally have on a Second Reading debate.

Members, far from observing the 10-minute rule, have occupied&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am as aware as anyone that there is no rule, but I also know, as you do, Dame Janet, that, when colleagues are anxious to let as many hon.

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. It is a convention of the House that speeches move from one side of the Chamber to the other. The last speaker was a Conservative Member, so it was confidently expected that a Labour Member would be called next. You called the Minister, which has given rise to a number of


fears. Indeed, the Minister had a brief conversation with the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) to indicate, from what I could tell, that he was going to get in immediately after the hon. Gentleman, and that he could curtail his remarks.<br/>
The debate is being keenly argued, and many hon. Members want to speak, which is another consideration that Chairmen of Committees bear in mind. I was told that the Minister was going to speak at 8.30 pm, the closure would be moved, and it had all been set up. If that happened&#x2014;I am sure that you, Dame Janet, would not be a party to it&#x2014;it would provoke great anger.<br/>
This is an important issue, and many hon. Members have a lot to say about it. Once we leave these amendments, we shall lose the opportunityy to talk about title I, which is important. This debate is vital to us all. I am not making any jokes about false points of order. If we do not have the opportunity to debate the treaty, I and many other hon. Members will be extremely angry about the Government conspiring to deny us the opportunity to speak. I hope that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench are not involved in that agreement, or consensus&#x2014;because there is no consensus tonight.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. When the Chairman of Ways and Means, unusually, convened a meeting on Monday, he emphasised that he recognised the great importance of title I, and the fact that, as it constructed the architecture of the Bill, it gave us probably our only opportunity to view the treaty and the Bill in perspective.<br/>
Some of us could not speak on Second Reading because of the demand of so many hon. Members to speak, and the Chairman of Ways and Means suggested that we would have the opportunity to come back. There is therefore a sense of alarm that the Minister is being called at such an early stage, when so few people have spoken. One has not had an opportunity&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The point is that Mr. Morris showed us that he recognised that the matters before us are terribly important. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If any hon. Member had spoken out of order, I am sure that the occupant of the Chair would have notified the individual concerned.<br/>
There is a real sense of anxiety that we may be frustrating the purpose of the Committee stage, and our examination of the important title I.

The whole House recognises that if anyone claims to move the closure the occupant of the Chair has to make a decision in the circumstances at the time, and do a balancing act. May I, through this point of order, put to you two matters which I hope that you will bear in mind if that occasion should arise at any time during the debate on the amendments?<br/>
As Mr. Morris said, and as the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) reminded us, this debate is in a sense a broad conspectus on the total

meaning of the treaty as contained in title I. The breadth and gravity of the matters concerned are considerable, and they affect this country's constitution.<br/>
The Minister found some difficulty talking about those matters yesterday&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Minister shakes his head, but I believe that there was some difficulty in the manner in which he replied to some of his hon. Friends, and to some Opposition Members. It is not appropriate for the Minister to speak again before some of us have had an opportunity to follow up those important matters&#x2014;unless there will be another opportunity for us to speak, and the debate is to continue.<br/>
I therefore hope that, if you have to make such a decision, Dame Janet, you will bear in mind that important consideration, and the fact that several of my hon. Friends and I have been in the Chamber all day yesterday and most of today, yet we have not had the opportunity even to comment on what the Minister said in his opening speech yesterday.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. The part of the Committee discussion which deals with title I is of fundamental constitutional importance. I readily concede that some over-lengthy speeches have been made in the House in the past two days, but some hon. Members who have an immense contribution to make to the debate have waited patiently to speak. There is a clash on the exact meaning and applicability of title I&#x2014;and we may never have another chance to discuss it. Six or seven major questions remain in the air, and have not been resolved.<br/>
If you were asked a question about the closure, would you think it fair to close the debate after the Minister had spoken? May I put that question to you now?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. Will you give guidance to the Committee? It seems to me that the debate on title I and on the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) has contained many of the same points as were raised in earlier debates on the Bill.<br/>
I am aware that we are in Committee, but many of the points raised in the debate have been raised at earlier stages, especially on Second Reading. That is important, because the Bill has already been discussed by the House for longer than all the stages of the Single European Act. There can be no question of there not having been a proper debate. If certain of my hon. Friends decided to make very long speeches covering all the points, naturally it will not be possible for other hon. Members to contribute if we are to make progress.<br/>
I hope that we can make progress on the Bill, Dame Janet. Many of us would like to contribute to debates on amendments on the Order Paper, which will be discussed in later groups. This debate on the opening group has already been very long.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. Unfortunately, you are embroiled in dealing with hypothetical situations, but may I offer you the information that it is my view, and that of my hon.


Friends, that the Opposition have not had an adequate opportunity to air our variety of views on the fundamental part of the debate which 'is now taking place?

<p>Yes, Dame Janet. Like many of m y hon. Friends, I have sat here for almost two days. This debate is not the debate we had on Second Reading. We are discussing some difficult legal matters, including the justiciability of title I.

If the debate is closed after his second intervention, we will have no further opportunity to debate those matters.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. We have had a two-day debate, and some of us have sat through the whole two days. You will notice that I represent one of the Scottish constituencies. Some aspects of title I must be addressed, as they affect the unitary Parliament and the Union. It is necessary for me to raise matters with the Minister and to get some sort of answer. I fail to see how I can do that if the Minister addresses the Committee now. It will give the Government no opportunity to answer the matters that I wish to put to the Minister. That would certainly send the wrong message to Scotland and to the rest of the country.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. May I express my extreme distaste for the way in which the Minister of State dealt with the Committee a moment ago? He had an opportunity to calm the Committee and to offer a reasonably conciliatory gesture. However, he tried by a clever sleight of tongue to give an ambivalent answer to you, simply to irritate the Committee.<br/>
With the exception of the Government, the Committee wishes the debate to continue. If we are to have satisfactory discussions, we must create some trust between the Minister who is dealing with the matter and the rest of the Committee. The Minister's ambivalent&#x2014;I even go so far as to say impertinent&#x2014;remark does nothing but create contempt.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. We are in some difficulty because you have called the Minister to speak, and the points of order are an attempt to make you change your mind. I appreciate that you have already made your decision. In those circumstances, would it not be helpful if the Minister announced that he did not wish to speak at this stage, but that he would be willing to speak later?

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. I am sure you recognise that several hon. Members have sat through the whole two-day debate and have not been called. Although there is debate and argument about whether title I should be included in the Bill, the fact of the matter is that title I is an integral part of the treaty. Once the treaty is ratified, it will be interpreted as though title I stood part of it. Therefore, it is extremely important for the Committee to be given a full opportunity to debate the matter almost exhaustively, because it is of such fundamental constitutional importance.</p>

I believe that I should have an opportunity to put my view.<br/>
I have not spoken at length in this Committee. In the European Parliament, I spoke many times for many hours. In this Committee, I have always respected the Chair, and I have always done right by the Chair. I should feel very angry tonight if not one speaker from Northern Ireland was allowed to put his view.<br/>
I have heard something of the plottings, and I have overheard remarks. It was disgraceful of the Minister to act as he did tonight. This is a constitutional issue. It will not affect us for 10 minutes or for an hour: it will affect our future, our families, our children and our grandchildren, and we have a right to be heard.

<p>On a point of order, Dame Janet. May I make a suggestion? There seems to have been a slight misunderstanding between the Committee and the Minister of State. I am pleased that he has had the opportunity to have a discussion, perhaps with the Patronage Secretary, but the Patronage Secretary has a rather different and more partisan role than that of the Leader of the House. If the Leader of the House were to explain how he reconciled the rights of Back-Bench Members with the Government's wish to get on with the business, he might explain what the Government's plans are for the rest of this evening. I dare say that he would do that in a more conciliatory way than the Minister of State would.</p>

<p>It is not for the Chair to ask or command any hon. Member to come to the Committee. No doubt the point will have been heard by Front-Bench Members. I call Mr. Garel-Jones.</p>

<p>I am grateful to you, Dame Janet, for recognising me.<br/>
Over the past two days, several hon. Members have made the point that the Committee owes a debt to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) for moving his amendment which has enabled us to discuss the broad structure of the treaty. The right hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore) was quite correct to say that the amendment goes to the heart of our subsequent debates in Committee.<br/>
We have spent some time discussing amendment No. 93, which proposes to include title I in the scope of the Bill. The plain fact is, however, as I stated at the start of the debate, that, for the purposes of our domestic legislation, those parts of title I which need to come within the scope of the Bill are already included. There is every value in a serious debate on the content of title I of the treaty. As I have said, we are indebted to the hon. Gentleman for moving the amendment. But, as the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) made clear, there is no need in our domestic legislation to accept the amendment as proposed.<br/>
The Committee should recall&#x2014;your predecessors in the Chair, Dame Janet, have reminded the Committee of this fact on several occasions&#x2014;that we are not discussing ratification of the treaty.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="891956" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.358.2" hansard_membership_id="8179" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29124" speakername="Sir Russell Johnston" colnum="358" time="20:45:00">
<p>Is the essence of the Minister of State's argument against our amendment that it is not necessary and that it would not make any difference? That has not been clear to me throughout our proceedings.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="891957" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.358.3" hansard_membership_id="4274" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15161" speakername="Mr. Garel-Jones" colnum="358" time="20:45:00">
<p>No. There are several arguments against the hon. Gentleman's amendment, not least of which are those that were made by the hon. Member for Hamilton. In respect of our domestic legislation, it is completely otiose and it would create legal anomalies.<br/>
Another aspect of the hon. Gentleman's amendment is worth considering, particularly by my hon. Friends. In one sense, it begins to chip away at&#x2014;to collapse&#x2014;the pillared intergovernmental structure of the union. To that extent, I can see why the hon. Gentleman tabled his amendment. He and his hon. Friends support a single structured Europe. Most of my hon. Friends and I do not support the Liberal Democrats' view of Europe. To that extent, I see what the amendment is aiming at. Even if one were a federalist, as the hon. Gentleman is, there are other legal arguments as to why his amendment should not be accepted.</p>

<p>The Minister commends me to support my amendment because it is in the logic of my


party's position. I understand that. He then says that it may make a mess of legal matters, but throughout the debate no one has explained that. If he manages to do so, I will take great note of it.</p>

<p>I shall certainly do that.<br/>
As I said, the Chair has reminded the Committee on several occasions that we are not discussing ratification of the treaty. We are engaged in detailed examination of a piece of domestic legislation required to incorporate into the framework of United Kingdom law those provisions of the treaty which need to be so incorporated. That means the provisions of titles II, III and IV and other provisions so far as they relate to those titles. That point was made effectively by the hon. Member for Hamilton in explaining to the Committee why the official Opposition would not be supporting the hon. Gentleman's amendment.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also noted that legislation in other countries covered the whole treaty and suggested that ours should do likewise. The constitutional requirements in Britain are the ones which I have addressed. Although he would wish it not to be the case, I am glad that we do not yet have harmonisation of constitutional practice throughout Europe. He might wish that but that wish is not shared by my right hon. and hon. Friends, nor, I believe, by&#x2014;</p>

<p>Not yet; I want to make a little more progress and then I will give way.<br/>
The process of ratification, as distinct from the Bill, does not always require legislation to be enacted. Some important treaties over the years did not require legislation before ratification. I sought to make that point earlier. For example, the treaties establishing NATO and the Western European Union, and the recent "two plus four" treaty on the reunification of Germany, did not require legislation. In such cases the House was given the opportunity to examine the treaty which had been signed, subject to ratification, before it was ratified, in accordance with the Ponsonby procedures.<br/>
When domestic legislation is required, as is the case here, prior to ratification, the legislative process subsumes that practice but does not replace it. That has been the practice followed for nearly 70 years. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber may not agree with that procedure and he may wish to see the day when the Community can impose different procedures upon us, but such procedures are not followed in this Parliament. Provisions which are not necessary would create confusion in our domestic legislation. The legislation already includes in its scope all that it needs to include in order that we can honour our obligations under the treaty.</p>

<p>I want to address points made by some of my hon. Friends. Then I shall sit down so that other hon. Members may take part in the debate.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-West (Mr. Butcher), who is not in his place but who has attended the debate assiduously, made the point that the common provisions of title I do not in themselves create new rights or obligations in Community law. I sought to make that point in response to interventions during my opening remarks. They are intended as an introduction to the main body of the treaty and, as such, refer in places to

activities outlined in the detail later. For example, article E refers to the Community institutions and to how they will exercise their powers. Nothing in the common provisions is inconsistent with the substantive articles later in the treaty.<br/>
Although Community laws cannot be adopted under the common provisions, they can be taken into account by the European Court of Justice by reflecting the intentions of the drafters.</p>

<speech hansard_id="891968" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.360.0" hansard_membership_id="3086" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2632" speakername="Mr. Denzil Davies" colnum="360" time="20:45:00">
<p>The Minister has explained that parts of the first title will appear in the other titles and so the Bill will give them effect in domestic law. He then said that if those parts of title I which do not need to be given effect in domestic law were included in the Bill, it would chip away at the intergovernmental nature of those parts. Could he explain that? If they do not have to be incorporated into domestic law, how on earth can they chip away at anything?</p>

<speech hansard_id="891969" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.360.1" hansard_membership_id="4274" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15161" speakername="Mr. Garel-Jones" colnum="360" time="20:45:00">
<p>Because if the Committee were to support the amendment, it would make domestic law in Britain more federal and centralising, placing it ahead of the Maastricht treaty. That is why I hope that on reflection he will think that my other arguments outweigh that. That may be why he thinks that he would be wise to support his amendment, but I would be surprised if he or any of my hon. Friends were prepared to countenance putting provisions in United Kingdom domestic legislation that would make it more federalist and centralist than the Maastricht treaty.</p>

<speech hansard_id="891970" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.360.2" hansard_membership_id="3858" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11480" speakername="Mr. Enright" colnum="360" time="20:45:00">
<p>May we put it another way? Is it not the case that, if the amendment were included in our law, the intergovernmental conference would be more responsible to this body than it will be, and that it would also be more responsible to the European Parliament?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="891971" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.360.3" hansard_membership_id="4274" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15161" speakername="Mr. Garel-Jones" colnum="360" time="20:45:00">
<p>I do not think that that would be the case. As the hon. Member for Hamilton said, there could be a danger that we were beginning a process whereby any action taken intergovernmentally by Ministers of the Crown that would provoke a change in the laws of the United Kingdom would prompt the introduction of a Bill to the House in the normal way. I am not sure what would be the effect were we to introduce that centralising measure into the body of the treaty, and I am not sure that it would produce the effects that the hon. Member mentions.<br/>
Another issue has been raised by many of my hon. and right hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) in an intervention, when he inadvertently misread the word "means" as "money". I accept that it was an inadvertence on his part, and we both laughed about it. My 'hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) also mentioned it. Article F, paragraph 3, states:
<q>The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies.</q>
My hon. Friend is exercised about that paragraph because of the word "means", and he and a number of other hon. Members argue that that means, with the funds necessary, and that a money resolution should therefore be attached to the Bill.<br/>
The union has no financial resources of its own. The commitment reflected in article F dates back to the Rome European Council and is a reference to means, in the broad sense of the word, available to the Community, through its Community and intergovernmental arms, to


carry out the purposes laid down. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills that the provision does not refer to financial means. I can well understand why hon. Members might have thought it did, because we have Mr. Morris, who is the "Chairman of Ways and Means."<br/>
Some of my hon. Friends have made considerable jest about the occasional use of foreign words or phrases in the treaty. The phrase "acquis communautaire" has provided the Committee with much amusement. One must consider the fact that the treaty must be drafted in nine different languages by a profession called jurist-linguists. The French version of the treaty uses the word "moyens", which means "means" in the broadest sense rather than the revenue-raising sense.</p>

<p>I have not yet had an opportunity to develop an argument, which is part of the frustration of this process. I must deal with points on which, so far, I have not succeeded in catching the Chairman's eye to put forward an argument on the basis of what I understood was an amendment which should be thoroughly discussed. My right hon. Friend's rising at this stage and seeking to answer questions that have not been developed or put is an unfair and short-cut way to proceed, because he will not deal with all the points that I hoped to make.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="891973" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.361.1" hansard_membership_id="4274" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15161" speakername="Mr. Garel-Jones" colnum="361" time="20:45:00">
<p>My hon. Friend did not take advantage of catching your eye, Mr. Morris, to ask me a question, so there is little that I can say in response.<br/>
I listened with care&#x2014;sometimes with interest and amusement&#x2014;to the lengthy speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), who has tabled a series of amendments that are grouped with amendment No. 93. I would describe all those amendments as wrecking amendments; their purpose is to wreck the Bill.<br/>
I was struck less by the content of my hon. Friend's speech than by two interventions in it. The first was by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) and the second was by the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone). My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay believed that the Maastricht treaty, and therefore the Bill, was a communist plot, whereas the hon. Member for Brent, East believed that it was a capitalist plot. Those two interventions seemed to sum up the comment by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn), who said in his speech that he did not believe in the conspiracy theory. I thought that he invented it.</p>

<p>No. I wish to conclude now.<br/>

<p>I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and, through you, I thank Madam Speaker for having selected for the Adjournment debate tonight the subject of Testbourne school and its application for grant-maintained status.<br/>
I shall explain the background, take the Minister through events, ask him three questions, and seek certain assurances. It may be helpful if I start by saying that grant-maintained status is no discredit to a county education committee. Rather, it is a sign of success. Many county councils are proud of the fact that they have brought schools along to the point at which they can paddle their own canoes and manage their own affairs, with grant-maintained status. Indeed, almost all the schools that have moved in that direction have proved a great success.<br/>
Testbourne is a successful school: 97 per cent. of the pupils gained five or more GCSEs, more than half of those with five or more A to C grades. That puts the school in the top 20 in Hampshire. The governors and the head are seekers after excellence, and recognise that grant-maintained status can help them, enabling them to take decisions more quickly, free of red tape. It would also give the school control over its total budget, with all the advantages of local decision making. It would give the school scope to shop around for the best value for its needs and, in doing so, to have more to spend on the pupils. The head and the governors become directly accountable to the parents and the local community.<br/>
The idea of applying for grant-maintained status was given impetus by disagreement with the local education authority over funding. The disagreement was undoubtedly important, but it was more the trigger than the whole reason for the application.<br/>
The sequence of events is interesting and worrying. On 10 August the chairman of the local education authority confirmed that the school was correctly funded within the overall limits of the authority's budget. On 1 September the governors passed the first resolution required for grant-maintained status. Shortly afterwards, the local education authority mysteriously found an additional &#x00A3;10,000 for 1993&#x2013;94 and a further &#x00A3;10,000 for 1994&#x2013;95. It is rather odd that that should happen. I should add that a condition of that money being available was that the application for grant-maintained status would not proceed.<br/>
In Hampshire,11 secondary schools have successfully balloted for grant-maintained status. Curiously, none of those schools has been in the central educational division of Hampshire with its headquarters in Winchester. Three proposals have been defeated&#x2014;all of them in the same division. I am pleased to see my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Malone) nodding his head. I know that he is also worried about the matter.<br/>
There would have been a fourth unsuccessful ballot if it had not been for the courage, dedication and determination of the governors, the headmaster and many of the staff. The ballot for grant-maintained status was won with a poll of 78 per cent.&#x2014;64 per cent. in favour and 36 per cent. against.<br/>
Tonight I want to expose some of the methods used by the council to influence the decision of the parents. I do so not for Testbourne, but to prevent inappropriate campaigning against future applications. Does the Minister consider that what has occurred is in line with the code of recommended practice on local authority publicity&#x2014;that it should be objective, balanced, informative and accurate?
At the end of October parents received a letter&#x2014;paid for by public funds&#x2014;that was signed by the county education officer and it made the following points. First, finance is the only reason for seeking grant-maintained status. I have partly dealt with that matter already. Secondly, a section set out a defence of the funding of the school and ended with the words:
<q>It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the issue is not about finance but about management.</q>
That is a direct slur on the head and the governing body with not a shred of evidence that management was at fault. The school that we are talking about is 20th in the success rate on exam results in Hampshire.<br/>
Thirdly, the letter further says that the school will be eligible to receive extra funding of at least &#x00A3;65,000 as part of a new management partnership scheme that the county is to introduce. However, that is simply not true. The scheme provides for the schools to have extra funds with which to buy services from the local education authority which were previously free.<br/>
Fourthly, the letter seeks to scare parents by suggesting that Testbourne will be unable to replace the specialist services provided by the county local education authority. I quote the letter:
<q>At present, expert local services, many of which are very specialised and difficult to obtain in the local market, are there when they are needed. In the future GM schools will experience increasing problems in obtaining the current range of support, not only from the education department, but also, for example, from the county architect, the treasurer and the secretary (for legal advice).</q>
Then there is the chilling inquiry:
<q>Where would this leave Testbourne?</q>
The fifth complaint in this letter is that there has been little time for detailed consultation with the local community. In fact, there has been more consultation in the case of this school than there has been in the case of almost any other school in Hampshire. The original resolution was on 4 September and the ballot was held on 4 November. Nobody can say that there was a shortage of time.<br/>
The letter ends by urging parents to vote against GM status.<br/>
In addition, there have been meetings and campaigns focusing on parents of children in primary schools. You might ask, Mr. Deputy Speaker, what on earth a primary school has to do with the issue. Testbourne school is fed by a series of primary schools. It is an interesting fact that 20 per cent. of the parents who voted have children at primary schools. The essence of the campaign with the primary schools was that if the proposal went through the county's funds would be robbed and the primary schools would suffer as a result. That is a pretty low form of campaign.<br/>
I have three questions for my hon. Friend the Minister. Is a letter such as I have described compatible with the proper provision of impartial advice from a senior county council official, or is it more in the nature of campaigning appropriate to elected politicians? Secondly, is my hon.


Friend aware that, far from losing out because of the alleged non-availability of LEA services in future, the school has already found that it can get most of the services currently provided by the LEA more economically elsewhere? It will get better value for money, so it will have more money to spend on the pupils. Thirdly, is it in order for officials who are not elected politicians to play on parents' fears of the unknown, to question the competence of governors, to question the competence of the senior management team, and to question financial competence?<br/>
I make a final plea. The county secretary, in a letter to the deputy chairman of governors, ends by saying:
<q>Now that the result of the ballot is known we can look forward to the Secretary of State approving grant maintained status for the school. The County Council will do all it can to assist an easy transition.</q>
We may feel like saying "Hear, hear." The House may be a little surprised to know that it has quietly been made known to the governors that the county proposes to use its statutory opportunity to object to the school's application for GMS going forward. That is in contradistinction to the county secretary saying that he looked forward to the Secretary of State approving grant-maintained status. I know what the appropriate word for that is, but I will not use it here.<br/>
The school needs time to settle down in a period of calm. I hope that the process can now go forward constructively, sensibly and helpfully with co-operation on all sides&#x2014;from the county and from the Department. My special plea to the Minister is that, when the application lands on his desk, he will turn it round quickly so that the uncertainty is ended.<br/>
I have raised the matter tonight because, although I want to see the school launched calmly and quietly on calm waters, it is imperative that the matter should have been raised so that other schools do not have to go through the wringer as the board of management, the governors and the headmaster of Testbourne school have had to do.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friends for giving me the opportunity to intervene briefly in this Adjournment debate.<br/>
I reiterate all that my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, North-West (Sir D. Mitchell) said about what has happened at the school. My reason for intervening is that a number of the parents who send their children to Testbourne are my constituents. I have had strong representations from them about the establishment of a level playing field when gaining grant-maintained status, and I will concentrate on that point.<br/>
I had always understood that officials at county level would ensure that a level playing field was established when such status was sought. Not only has this not been the case in Testbourne but in the case of a number of other schools a level playing field has not been established and

there has been partisan campaigning, and the instructions from the county education authority have not been adhered to by their officials.<br/>
I wonder whether we shall ever get to that stage unless my hon. Friend the Minister decides to take further action in the Bill which he has currently before the House. May I simply make the suggestion that the Minister will listen to what my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire North-West and I have said this evening and understand that we have a difficult time within county authorities where one would normally expect that Government initiatives would be welcome and not thwarted at every turn. This is not the case, and perhaps he will consider putting some mechanism that guarantees that a level playing field is established in all attempts to obtain grant-maintained status in schools throughout the country and not just in Hampshire. It would be very welcome to my hon. Friend and myself if Hampshire could start this and become a precedent.<br/>
I am delighted that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has seen fit to be here for this important Adjournment debate, because one thing is certain: we are determined to make this policy stick of grant-maintained schools where the parents want them. We are determined, as a party and as a Government, to make it work and to allow it to be implemented in a way that parents want. This is at present being thwarted. I hope that my hon. Friend will assure us this evening that that will no longer be the case.</p>

<speech hansard_id="892000" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1992-12-02a.372.0" hansard_membership_id="4282" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2703" speakername="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)" colnum="372" time="22:26:00">
<p>In the traditional way, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, North-West (Sir D. Mitchell) on having obtained this important debate on what is both a specific and a general matter. The fact that our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State saw fit, very unusually for an Adjournment debate, to attend this debate illustrates the importance that he attaches to the matter that my hon. Friends the Members for Hampshire, North-West and for Winchester (Mr. Malone) have raised. I can do no more than to say that to reinforce the importance that both my right hon. Friend and I attach to this matter.<br/>
My hon. Friend and the schools in Hampshire and elsewhere need look no further than those schools which have already opted for grant-maintained status up and down the country. They are found usually to have been able to employ more teachers, almost inevitably have attracted more pupils, without exception have raised standards, have been found to have bought more books, and generally have been reported on more favourably when the inspectorate has looked at them.<br/>
That is proof enough that any assertion that schools lose out in some way with grant-maintained status is completely unproven. Anyone who wants to establish the truth of this matter need do no more than to ask heads and boards of governors of schools which have become grant-maintained. They need not take the word of a local education authority or even of myself. It would be far better for them to ask a grant-maintained school. If there is any difficulty about that, I should be only too delighted to give them a long list of names of such schools which would be only too happy to give their experiences.<br/>
My hon. Friend asked whether it was in order for local education authorities to question the competence of governors and head teachers. I should have thought that it would be rather odd for a local education authority suddenly to find fault with governors whom they had had a part in appointing and heads whom they had had a role in appointing at the very time when there was a question of debate and a ballot about that new status. It would be extremely odd, I should have thought, if that same education authority had not seen fit to take action about such governors, heads, and others before and yet suddenly found fault with them and questioned their competence, if that was the case. That strikes me as being somewhat bizarre behaviour, to say the least, and I should certainly have thought that most parents would see through it.<br/>
There must be some doubt about the attitude of the county council. I understood that Hampshire local education authority had claimed from time to time that it was not opposed to grant-maintained status in general. However, I have had a local newspaper report drawn to my attention in which Councillor Tim Macnamara said that, once what he called the initial cash bribe to GM schools had been withdrawn, even fewer would choose to go their own way. He was then alleged to have said:
<q>I am disappointed when schools opt out and I think in the long term they are making a great mistake.</q>
That does not sound like someone who is neutral about the possibility of GM status for schools. If the report is true, it gives the lie to the attitude of that individual, although it is not for me to say whether he is speaking for the whole authority.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, North-West asked whether we could speed this latest application on its way. I was delighted to hear the news that, with a 64 per cent. positive ballot, Testbourne school has elected to become grant-maintained. There will now be a two-month period during which objections and comments can be sent to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. That is the normal procedure. He will then have to consider whether to approve, reject or modify the proposals.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, North-West will understand that I cannot say anything tonight that would in any way prejudge the decision of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. However, I can assure my hon. Friend that we will give the proposals very careful consideration and my right hon. Friend will reach his decision as soon as possible after the end of the statutory notice period consistent with full and proper consideration of the issues raised to any objections that may be received.<br/>
We always aim to reach decisions as soon as possible. Although some are more complex than others, I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, North-West that in the 12 months to May 1992 the average time for deciding grant-maintained proposals was four and a half months from the date of publication. Since May, the average time has been about three and three quarter months.<br/>
The fact that there are 107 GM applications awaiting decision shows an acceleration of interest in GM status by schools around the country. We are confident that there

will be about 600 GM schools operating or approved by next April and our projections suggest 1,500 in April 1994. We are well on our way.<br/>
Of the 107 applications now awaiting decision where there is not a linked LEA proposal, only two are more than three months old. When dealing with such applications, we are concerned to deal with them properly but expeditiously. Therefore, I assure my hon. Friend that the application will be dealt with as rapidly as is consistent with proper consideration and there should be no delays in the process.<br/>
With regard to any misleading information produced during the very important process of consideration of a ballot by parents at a school, I want to make it clear that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State takes a very serious view of the allegations. We will want to look carefully at what my hon. Friend said tonight and at any evidence that he may want to bring before us. As recently as 3 November. a letter was sent at the request of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to all LEAs reminding them and their officers of what, in the Secretary of State's view, are the proper responsibilities and duties of the parties involved when parents seek GM status for their children's school.<br/>
Each local authority has a particular duty to ensure that the arguments that they present for schools remaining under their control are presented in a way that does not mislead parents. My right hon. Friend and I regard it as intolerable that local education authorities or anyone else should try to scare parents by claiming falsely that by voting for GM status they will damage their children's education. It would also be totally unacceptable if authorities, as teachers' employers, sought to put pressure on staff to resist GM status by perhaps threatening job security or prospects as regrettably and shockingly has been reported from some parts of the country. We want to follow up all individual cases where we have received these reports to establish the truth of the matter and to see what further action can be taken.<br/>
I am aware of the letter of 29 October that my hon. Friend has brought to the attention of the House this evening, and I must confess that I am surprised, to put it mildly, at the tone of the letter from an authority that has apparently professed that it is not in principle against GM schools. Certainly the terms of the letter will have to be looked at very closely indeed.<br/>
In reply to what my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester asked, however, let me say that there will be provision in the Education Bill, now in Committee, to seek to ensure that in future we have the fairest and most even-handed possible treatment of GM ballots. In other words, it will seek to ensure that, at the very least, information is produced in an even-handed and impartial way, and that parents are given the maximum opportunity to consider the facts surrounding their school and the possibilities about GM status. That is our determination, and we will hope to find in that Bill the best way possible of ensuring just that.<br/>
Until the Bill receives the Royal Assent and becomes effective, however, we in the Department for Education are determined to remain vigilant and to use whatever powers are available to us to ensure that all local education authorities, and particularly their officers, act in a proper way with regard to their responsibilities, and to ensure that all information produced for parents who are making this very important decision about GM status for their school


is full, fair and proper and is not misleading in any way. I would expect all professionals involved in education in local authorities to make it their business to ensure that that sort of information is provided, and we would want to be told of any cases where that was not so.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has sought to make it absolutely clear over and over again that he is determined to ensure that GM schools will always receive funding commensurate with the additional responsibilities that they take on when they opt for GM status. Any suggestion that they will in some way suffer as a result of becoming GM is groundless and should be seen as such.<br/>
This is an important matter, and I am grateful to both my hon. Friends the Members for Hampshire, North-West and for Winchester for taking the trouble to raise it this evening. I am sure that not only will they have the gratitude of their constituents and of the parents of all their schoolchildren but that that gratitude will extend much more widely throughout Hampshire and the whole country, where the Secretary of State, the Minister of State

and I are well aware that widespread concern has surrounded many of the debates and the ballots on GM status for schools. It has often caused unnecessary bitterness and division simply because of misinformation and, regrettably, in some parts of the country, threats. That is deplorable and unacceptable conduct when we are talking about the education of our young people and children.<br/>
My earnest hope is that in future we will ensure that all involved with education, as well as my hon. Friends, can be confident that the information available is impartial, even-handed, fair, honest and truthful, and that we trust parents then to make a proper decision on the education of their children. I trust parents to do that, my hon. Friends trust parents to do that, and I hope that all local education authorities, councillors, officers and others will also trust them to do that.</p>
