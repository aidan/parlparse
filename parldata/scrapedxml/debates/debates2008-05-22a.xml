	<p pid="a.380.3/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for agreeing to meet a delegation and I hope that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1627" name="Jon Trickett">the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> will invite me along. May I remind hon. Members that 5,000 miners gave their lives and 20,000 lost their lungs during that war? My constituent Mr. Abe Moffatt, son of Alex Moffatt, along with hundreds of others tried to get into the armed forces, including the RAF, but could not get in and were dragged back to work in the pits. I believe that their contribution should be recognised in some fashion or other.</p>

	<p pid="a.386.3/1">This Government have taken unprecedented action on energy efficiency and winter fuel payments compared to other Governments&mdash;I recall pressing another Government to take action 30 years ago, but only this Government have done so. My assessment of the situation is that, after years of progress because of our action, it is now much more difficult because of rising energy costs. We are therefore redoubling our efforts to ensure that we can tackle that evil problem through better targeting&mdash;although there are data protection issues&mdash;energy efficiency programmes, enhanced social tariffs and winter fuel payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.0/1">I fully endorse my right hon. and learned Friend's comments about security considerations for Members of Parliament. We must be in a position to speak our mind in the House without threats. Otherwise, does she share my view that the High Court decision on our allowances was right and justified, and that whatever money we claim should be known to the public? Would not it also be useful if more were done to explain why we claim the money and that it is essential to carry out our duties. There is no need for apology, because that money makes it possible for Members of Parliament to do their work here and in their constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.415.4/1">I have no detailed knowledge of NACODS, but I know that it is involved in a similar scam.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/2">The situation publicly is that Durham NUM is like the Durham NUM of 20, 30 or 40 years ago&mdash;a proud, working-class organisation. But it certainly is not today. I first raised the issue in a Westminster Hall debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May 2007</phrase> and exposed what was going on. Two individuals, Mr. David Hopper and Mr. Guy, who are president and general secretary respectively of Durham NUM, were getting huge sums from the compensation scheme. The sole source of income of Durham NUM was the 7.5 per cent. that was deducted from people's compensation by Thompsons Solicitors and passed on to it. I am still asking questions about what they did for that money, but I have never got a satisfactory answer. It is clear, however, that the solicitors confused their role and were acting in the best interests not of their clients, but of Durham NUM. That is why the Law Society has been clear in saying that the money needs to be paid back. The two individuals that I just mentioned are each drawing salaries, benefits and bonus packages of nearly &pound;70,000, and for doing what? Many people would be shocked by that.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/3">If that process was not bad enough, what has happened in the past 12 months is scandalous and is slowly coming out in the public domain. Durham NUM has de-listed itself as a trade union so that it no longer has to submit accounts, which it had to do in the past, to the certification officer, and has set itself up as something called &quot;an unincorporated association&quot;. It is important to get on the record how the situation has arisen.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/4">As I said in my previous speech in an Adjournment debate, the organisation has assets of nearly &pound;5.5 million. For some strange reason, &pound;680,000 of that is in an offshore bank account, and I have never been given a plausible explanation of why that is so. I accept that the &pound;5.5 million-plus that it has may well have been reduced because it has had to pay money back to people, but the union also has assets in terms of Red Hill and other property assets that it owns.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/5">If there are to be major changes in a trade union, we would expect the members to have a say in what happens to those assets, but if I told you, Mr. Speaker, that the decision to de-list the organisation as a trade union was taken by 10 people, including Mr. Hopper and Mr. Guy and, I think, their wives, you would appreciate that there are a lot of angry people out there. Those people have been members of the trade union for years but have not had a say in what happens to the assets. One of the individuals I mentioned chaired the meeting; the other took part in it. They not only have a connection with the change, but have a direct financial interest in what happens to Durham NUM.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/6">I have secured the minutes of the meeting, which was convened on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-19">19 March 2007</phrase>. I was pilloried locally when I stood up and said that Durham NUM was no longer a trade union, but a claims handling company. Lo and behold, that is exactly what Durham NUM set itself up as on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-19">19 March 2007</phrase>. The minutes need a larger hearing. Lo and behold, who is the solicitor who gave advice to the meeting? It is Mr. I. Walker from&mdash;you guessed it, Mr. Speaker&mdash;Thompsons Solicitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/7">The minutes say that the meeting was opened and that the president of Durham NUM explained:</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/8" class="indent">&quot;He and the general secretary had been advised that it no longer met the statutory definition of a trade union as set out in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 because its principal purposes no longer include the regulation of relations between workers and employers or employers organisations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/9">I met the certification officer a few weeks ago and have to say that Durham NUM has not met that criteria for perhaps 20 years. It has never negotiated. What has suddenly changed now apart from myself and other hon. Members raising the issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/10">The minutes continue:</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/11" class="indent">&quot;Members would recognise that it could no longer do so following the closure of the last pits in the Durham Area&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/12">&mdash;that did not happen recently; it happened 20 years ago&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/13" class="indent">&quot;given that membership was restricted to workers in the mining industry and ... ancillary undertakings in the Durham coalfield.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/14">It was explained that</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/15" class="indent">&quot;the Area's status had been called into question following&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/16">&mdash;this is the funny bit&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/17" class="indent">&quot;the introduction of the Compensation Act 2006.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/18">Given Durham NUM's vehement denial that it was a claims handling company, why should the Compensation Act affect it ? Clearly the Act did affect it, because for the last God knows how many years it has in fact been a claims handling company. It obviously recognised that it would be caught by the new legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/19">The minutes state:</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/20" class="indent">&quot;Mr Walker explained the new draft rules. The first purpose of the amendments is to bring the objects of the Area into line with reality by taking out the references to collective bargaining.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/21">I do not think that Durham NUM had done any collective bargaining for 15 or 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/22" class="indent">&quot;All references to the National Union are also removed to reflect the reality that the National Union no longer recognised the Area as a constituent association... The remaining objects had been tidied up but were essentially unchanged. The result would be that the Area remained in existence, as an unincorporated association, but not a trade union.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/23" class="indent">Secondly, the structures of the Area had been brought into line with the reality that there were no longer any lodges.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/24">Since I have been a Member of Parliament I have always found Durham NUM's language strange, with its suggestion that Durham still contains the mass structure of pits that has not existed there for years. Obviously, if Durham NUM has now emerged from the parallel universe that it has been inhabiting, that is a welcome development.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/25" class="indent">&quot;Mr Walker then took the members through each of the rules.. He noted that if the new rules were adopted, the name of the Area would revert to 'the Durham Miners Association'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/26">That was clearly intended to give the impression that the organisation was comparable with an association that had been established 100-odd years ago in the days of working miners. Durham NUM has nothing to do with that proud history now; it is a claims handling company. It would have been far more honest to call it &quot;the Durham Miners Association Claims Handling Company&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/27">What concerns me, and has concerned a number of former members of the union, is who was involved in the decision. Apparently, only full members could participate. I have obtained a copy of the rule book through the certification officer, which confirms that that is the case. I understand that at least two of the people who attended the meeting were women. I am not sure whether women ever qualified for full membership of the NUM; I know that they did in some areas but not in others. Interestingly, one of those attending was a Mrs. C. Guy, no doubt a relation of Mr. S. Guy. A motion was moved by George Simpson and seconded by Alan Johnson, and it was resolved unanimously that the new rules should be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/28">A number of people who have been associated with Durham NUM for many years have asked me why they did not have a say in what happened to their trade union. I have examined the rule book closely, and it all seems to revolve around the definition of &quot;full member&quot;. It is interesting that the individuals whom I mentioned were the only full members. When I asked people who have complained to me whether they were invited to the meeting and whether any consultation took place, they replied in the negative.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/29">If there is one core thing about a trade union, it is that it ought to represent the interests of its members. That clearly did not happen in this case. A small group of individuals&mdash;some of whom had a direct vested interest in keeping this going because they were getting a blooming good living out of it&mdash;were making decisions on the assets and moneys accrued over many years by hard-working former members of the union, many of whom are rightly very unhappy.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/30">As if that were not bad enough, what happened next was mind-boggling. It involved retired union members who had been members for many years, including a number of my constituents and those of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1643" name="Fraser Kemp">the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp)</phrase>&mdash;for example, Mr. F. Smith of Newfield in Pelton and Mr. Ron Wilson of Pelaw. One of them had been a member of the NUM for 50-odd years, since he joined as an apprentice. When he went to pay his annual retired member's fee of, I think, &pound;20, he was told that he could not be a member of the new organisation. The reason was that he had asked for his money back&mdash;his 7.5 per cent. Anyone who had the audacity to ask for their 7.5 per cent., which should not have been taken by Durham NUM in the first place, was barred from membership of the new organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/31">Quite rightly, those two individuals and many other former union members across the county of Durham&mdash;not just in my constituency&mdash;are extremely annoyed. They include Joseph Orrell, who made the front page of the <i> Sunderland Echo</i> under the headline &quot;Sick miners axed by union&quot;. The newspaper used the word &quot;outrage&quot;, and it is an outrage. What annoys me is that people who set up what is basically a claims handling company are wrapping themselves up in proud traditions and left-wing rhetoric, purporting to be socialists and to be representing the poorest and most disadvantaged members of the community, which they are clearly not doing. They are not representative of those people. They did not ask them whether they wanted the new association to be set up. They have established a small club consisting of those with direct vested interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/32">Looking at the rule book, I discovered a technicality whereby retired members should at least have been consulted, which they clearly were not. Another murky aspect of the affair appears in the minutes of the special meeting, and it is something that I have suspected for a long time. The scheme does not have a proud history, given that former trade union officials have been doing deals with claims handling companies. One of those present at the meeting was a Mr.&mdash;I presume&mdash;A. Mardghum. I think that that is one Alan Mardghum, who used to be the lodge secretary of the Wearmouth branch and is now clearly involved with Durham NUM. He was also involved with an outfit called FreeClaim IDC in Ashington, which was one of the most disgraceful organisations handling claims. In one case, about which I complained to the Law Society, the company took some &pound;3,600 from the compensation awarded to a Mr. Jobe. The relationship between people who seem to flit between different claims handlers while giving the impression that they are representing the interests of the poor and downtrodden is something of a scandal.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/33">Some might ask &quot;Why does this matter?&quot; I think it matters chiefly because the money that has been taken away from retired miners and their widows should not have been taken away, but also because a number of very angry miners who have paid in for many years, such as Mr. Orrell, Mr. Smith and Mr. Wilson, feel that they have had no say in what happens to the assets. Those assets are not inconsiderable. The amount held in the disbursement fund is &pound;1.18 million, and the total value of the investments is &pound;3.7 million. The value of the unquoted investments is &pound;863,000, including&mdash;this is in the accounts, in brackets&mdash;&pound;687.62 in an offshore bank account, or offshore investments. The total cash assets, according to the last return, amount to &pound;5,563,000, which is not an insubstantial sum. There are also the fixed assets, which are not quoted, in the form of the Red Hill property and other property owned by the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/34">What should have happened to the money? If the organisation was no longer a trade union, it should have followed the example of other unions that have been wound up. The money should have been given to, for instance, the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation, which would at least have reinvested some of the money back into mining communities, and not put it into the pockets of a few individuals&mdash;who, since the mines have closed, have had a very good living out of compensation claims for many years. There needs to be an investigation into Durham NUM. I am due to meet the regulator for claims handlers in a few weeks&mdash;unfortunately I could not meet him last week&mdash;and I shall ask whether some of the issues I have raised can be examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/35">There are also broader issues to do with how the assets of such organisations are dealt with. I have spoken with the certification officer. To be fair to him, he was very helpful&mdash;and privately appalled by what happened, I think. However, he is limited by legislation in what he can do. However, by that one move, Durham NUM has made accounts that were in the public domain every year&mdash;even though it was necessary to go round the houses to find them because those involved were quite clever in hiding the salaries and moneys in the accounts&mdash;no longer public. Therefore, basically what has happened is that &pound;5 million and the assets of a former trade union have been squirreled away into an organisation that no longer has to produce any public accounts. Many former miners and their families are rightly very angry about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/36">There should be an urgent investigation into the organisation. Although some people are getting their money back&mdash;I put on record again that I welcome that, and I urge anyone who has had money taken to contact the legal complaints service because moneys are being given back&mdash;this issue will not go away. I understand that I am being pilloried in certain quarters as the villain of the piece. I am sorry, but if what I am doing is exposing people to proper scrutiny, that is my role as a Member of Parliament. I will take no criticism from people who have direct vested interests and have done very well at the expense&mdash;this is what really sticks in my throat&mdash;of some very poor individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/37">May I touch on a few other constituency issues? I was proud on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-15">15 May</phrase> when Stanley town council held its inaugural meeting. I have been campaigning for that council, along with local people, for a few years. The turnout in the local election showed that people in Stanley are interested in having a voice, and I look forward to working very closely with the town council&mdash;not only Labour members, but independents and others&mdash;to improve the town of Stanley.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/38">Turning to health care in my constituency, on Saturday this week I will have the honour of attending the opening of the new Sacriston health centre. It is a former mining village, which suffered badly throughout the 1980s and early '90s, and a brand new health centre has been built for it, which will be opened by Sir Bobby Robson. I ask people to come and look at the health centre, as it is a carbon-neutral building and a fantastic example of what can be done in a public building both to provide top quality local health services and to protect the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/39">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> and I have been involved in the campaign to have the Lindisfarne gospels returned to the north-east. That campaign has been well supported by many north-east politicians of all parties, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" name="Alan Campbell">the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>, who cannot speak because of the Whip's purdah. The campaign is creating some movement, and I pay tribute to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport who is now talking to the British Library not merely about loaning us the gospels, but about there being a permanent home for them in the north-east. I also pay tribute to Durham university and the cathedral, which are now actively looking at building a resource and visitor centre on Palace green in Durham, not only as a possible home for the gospels, but to display the university and cathedral's rich collection of early Christian manuscripts. That would be a great tourist attraction not only for the city of Durham, but for the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/40">This week's welcome announcement of the aircraft carrier order will be a tremendous boost to the north-east economy not only in terms of direct fabrication jobs, but in terms of the impact on small and medium-sized enterprises in the area. We hear a lot of doom and gloom at present about the economy, but employment levels in the north-east have never been higher. We have some tremendous organisations: Nissan, for example, is taking on 800 new workers and producing cars not only at an efficient rate in terms of this country, but of world-beating class. In the last 10 years the north-east economy has come a very long way. I look forward to working with the new unitary council in Durham&mdash;its inaugural meeting is on Friday&mdash;to ensure that County Durham is part of the renaissance, both cultural and economic, that is taking place in the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.4/41">One of the pioneers of the work to change the perception of the north-east, to attract jobs and to move the north-east forward was Lord Tom Burlison, former deputy general secretary of the GMB and regional secretary of the GMB in the north-east. Sadly, he died earlier this week. Tom was a great advocate for the north-east. If people want to see the good side of trade unionism, they should look at how he worked in partnership with Dr. John Bridge, the CBI and others to form organisations such as the Northern Development Company. That spirit of partnership was there even in the dark days when we were losing heavy industry throughout the north-east. His passing will be mourned by a lot of people in the north-east, and he will be fondly remembered for the contribution he made.</p>

	<p pid="a.421.2/1">May I begin by associating myself and my hon. Friends, many of whom will have known Lord Burlison and his work, with the comments of regret on his passing away, and pass on our condolences?</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/2">I, too, wish to make a series of constituency points, rather than a Front-Bench speech. This Adjournment debate does not really warrant Front-Bench contributions, because it is about hon. Members putting to the Government the reasons why we should not adjourn for the Whitsun recess as we think there are issues that need to be debated and dealt with. I have three such issues which I wish to put to the Government. The first is the arrangements for commissioning tier 4 mental health services for people with moderate and severe personality disorder. The second is public sector housing finance. The third is the lack of a system for protecting vulnerable adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/3">The current system for securing the provision of specialist mental health services in England is not fit for purpose, and I shall give some evidence that supports that view. I have seen this flawed system at work in my constituency, but its impact goes much wider and should be a cause of concern for all hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/4">My constituency is home to the Henderson hospital. To most people, it is a little-known, even obscure, small hospital tucked away in Belmont. Among those with any experience of the treatment of personality disorder, however&mdash;clinicians or patients&mdash;it is a nationally and even internationally renowned tier 4 residential service for the treatment of moderate to severe personality disorder. It offers a practical and challenging route to recovery through personal responsibility and social inclusion. I have met many ex-patients over the past few years, and especially in recent months during the trauma of threatened closure. For those who have received the service, it has been life-saving and transforming. It does not only offer patients a way to manage or contain their mental health problems, but provides treatment for those problems and a way for people to restart their lives. Many of them cannot understand why a service that they prize so highly and that has given them an opportunity to realise their potential could be taken away from the many others who might benefit from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/5">The service treats personality disorder, and it facilitates change in people's lives. Unlike many other mental health services, it is not simply about the management of the status quo or the containment of the threats that those with mental health problems can pose to themselves and in a few cases to others. Research on the Henderson has shown that its approach reduces acute admissions and interventions by the criminal justice system. The number of people in prison who have severe mental health problems is a blot on our criminal justice system and shows that provision does not adequately meet those people's needs. The service at the Henderson does offer a way to meet some of those needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/6">Despite the evidence that the Henderson therapeutic model works, the service has been earmarked for closure and indeed it has already been closed temporarily&mdash; as the euphemism has it&mdash;pending the outcome of consultation. The Henderson has a 60-year history. Over that time, it has taken from referrals from practically every part of the United Kingdom from Land's End to John O'Groats. However, in some circles, that history marks it out as old fashioned, out of date and ripe for closure. In truth, the model of care that it offers is a very modern one. It is run on democratic lines, with residents taking personal responsibility for much of the day-to-day running of the service. They make decisions about everything from menus to direct staff involvement in the provision of the service. That is very different from the typical model of mental health services that is still the norm in much of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/7">A few years ago, the Henderson was even asked to replicate the service in two new units, at Webb house in Crewe&mdash;events there may be the reason why the Chamber is not especially well populated with Members seeking to contribute today&mdash;and at Main house in Birmingham. Webb house has since closed because of funding cuts, and Main house is struggling to keep its doors open.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/8">So why is such a successful service under threat? Until 2005, the Henderson was funded by the Department of Health through the national specialist commissioning advisory group. After 2005, funding passed to a consortium of 128 primary care trusts across London, East Anglia and south-east and central England, so many hon. Members will have constituents who have benefited from the service in the past. It has to be said that this was not a consortium of the willing. Within a year of the change in responsibility for the funding of the service, PCT after PCT took the opportunity to pull the plug on funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/9">As a result, the mental health trust that hosts the service, the South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust, has been confronted with a growing funding crisis. The clinical need has not changed and clinicians still want to refer patients to the service, but the PCTs are refusing to fund referrals. So the closure is based not on clinical need, but on financial reasons. The NHS and the Minister responsible accept there is a need for tier 4 provision such as the Henderson. Everyone wills the ends, but no one will identify the means to deliver them. The Government's review of the commissioning of specialist mental health services, the Carter review, found that PCTs are ill equipped for the task of specialist commissioning of such complexity. In a system driven by tick boxes and targets, services such as the Henderson do not fit. So when Ministers say that this is a devolved matter for PCTs and that they cannot intervene, they miss the point. Closure is a direct result of the way in which devolution to PCTs was designed by the Department of Health. It is a consequence of policy, not of individual decisions of PCTs. There are no incentives for the complex regional collaborations necessary to commission specialist services.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/10">I hope that the Department of Health will wake up to that fatal flaw in the system before it is too late. Every day the service is closed, the risk is that the clinical expertise will be lost and, far worse, that the lives of those people who could have been helped will not be changed for the better. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will sign early-day motion 1547 and, if they represent a constituency in the south of England, challenge their own PCT to support the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/11">The second issue I want to raise involves housing. In March, I joined a determined group of council tenants from the Sutton Federation of Tenants and Residents Associations and councillors of all parties from the London borough of Sutton to present a petition to the Prime Minister. The petition sought to highlight what my constituents and I regard as a stealth tax on tenants. The tenant tax is known in official Government circles as negative housing subsidy. It means that if the Department for Communities and Local Government determines that a council's rent account will be in surplus, the Government can cream off some of the money. This is money that tenants pay as rent in the belief that it will be used to pay for the management and maintenance of the local council housing stock, and even&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;of their own homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/12">In Sutton and Cheam, this year tenants will pay nearly &pound;10 million in tenant tax or, to put it another way, tenants will be paying their rent to the Government until mid-August. Until then, not a penny piece of their rent will benefit them. The Government say that the system of housing subsidy and negative subsidy is there to support areas that need the money more, but it means that families on modest incomes living in my constituency and in many others bear the brunt of that redistribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/13">What is worse is that the current subsidy regime is headed for a national surplus. In 2001-02, the Government made a net contribution of &pound;351 million. That fell to &pound;252 million in 2002-03, and to &pound;191 million in 2003-04. It is widely believed that the system is reaching a tipping point at which the Treasury will pay out less in subsidy than it receives in negative subsidy from local authorities. At that point, any argument that the negative subsidy is anything other than a stealth tax will fall to pieces.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/14">Indeed, reports in <i> Public Finance</i> magazine suggest that this year the Treasury could be skimming as much as &pound;194 million off rent payments across the country, and that figure will perhaps rise to &pound;500 million within a decade. Tenants have every right to demand to know what the Government intend to do with that money. They have every right to call it a tenant tax and every justification in calling for it to be scrapped. At a time when the Government are reeling from the consequences of their decision to double the 10p rate of tax, it seems remarkable that they would continue to defend a stealth tax of some of the poorest in our country&mdash;that is, many of our council tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/15">In March, the Government formally launched a much-delayed review of the housing revenue accounts subsidy system. I have been talking to the chair of the Sutton Federation of Tenants and Residents Associations, Jean Crossby, about the subject. She is working very hard with tenants in the borough and with tenants organisations around the country to challenge this iniquitous tax. She has pointed out that the Government are failing to engage seriously with tenants as part of the review. For example, I understand that here in London a handful of tenants will be involved in the review process. Surely more must be done to ensure that tenants can have a real say about the future financing of public housing. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will be able to give the House some assurances about the extent to which the tenant's voice will truly be heard in this process and, at the very least, will pass on those concerns to the Minister for Housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/16">Finally, I want to raise my continuing concern about the arrangements we have in this country for the protection of vulnerable adults and older people. Over the past 10 years, I have drawn to the attention of the Government and the House the mounting evidence of the abusive and inappropriate prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs to older people with dementia in care homes. In doing so, I have often outraged some care home owners, but I think that it is right to raise these concerns because it is right to draw attention to the academic research evidence, which is becoming compelling.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/17">At any one time, about 100,000 older people in care homes are on those drugs, which are not licensed for the treatment of dementia, have adverse side effects, increase the risk of strokes and even bring on premature death. The prolonged use of those drugs on some of the most vulnerable people in our society is nothing less than restraint by chemical straitjacket.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/18">Change is long overdue. The Department of Health, medicine licensing authorities, the care regulator, the General Medical Council and care providers all have a part to play in rooting out bad practice and protecting the vulnerable. Elder abuse is a serious matter in this country. Government-funded research found that 342,000 people over the age of 66 are victims of one form of abuse or another, including fraud, theft, psychological or emotional abuse, and assault, including the use of restraint. High hurdles had to be clambered over in order to register as a victim of abuse in the study, and many people were excluded altogether, such as those in care homes or those with dementia who live in the community. They were not approached or included in any way in the result.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/19">It must be likely that the study's figures are a conservative estimate of the scale of the problem and the challenge that we still have to confront. It is a challenge that the Law Commission asked us to confront in 1995. It said that it had no confidence in the adult protection procedures that existed at that time, but although there have been a number of welcome piecemeal adaptations to the system since then, they are not sufficient to meet the concerns that the Law Commission flagged up so long ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/20">The Law Commission proposed that social services departments should be given powers to protect vulnerable adults similar to those that exist for child protection and a duty to investigate; that powers should be granted for magistrates to issue entry warrants, temporary protection orders and removal orders; and that an offence should be created of obstructing officers acting on behalf of the courts. Rather than acting on those recommendations, the Government chose to go down the guidance route. In 2000, they issued guidance called &quot;No Secrets&quot;. The evidence is that &quot;No Secrets&quot; has failed to gain the necessary traction and acceptance in local authorities and other agencies, and as a result its implementation has been piecemeal and patchy.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/21">In 2006, Action on Elder Abuse completed a two-year study funded by the Department of Health on adult protection systems. The report stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/22" class="indent">&quot;Protection of Vulnerable Adults work is currently supported by the No Secrets guidance which has Section 7 status but no ring-fenced finances. This has hampered efforts to develop Protection of Vulnerable Adults policies, procedures and systems consistently and coherently. Many of the inconsistencies in practice and procedure highlighted throughout this report can be attributed directly or indirectly to its perceived lack of status, and the lack of priority in the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/23">The report went on to recommend that the protection of vulnerable adults be placed on an statutory basis equivalent to that for child protection and domestic violence. The report and its recommendations were produced in March 2006. The fact that the Government funded the research in the first place was welcome, but it took two years for them to come back and announce, as they did in March, that they will have a review of &quot;No Secrets&quot; that will consider the case for legislation. I suppose that that should be welcomed, but it has taken 13 years&mdash;and that is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/24">When the circumstances surrounding the death of Victoria Climbi&eacute; emerged, they convulsed the child protection system and galvanised the Government to legislate and to work with others to drive change in the child protection system. Although no system in which humans are involved will ever be perfect, there has been significant improvement in this country's child protection system. It should not take a similar shock to the adult protection system to achieve long overdue reform and action. I hope that legislative time will be found to enact the Law Commission's proposals or similar ones. Thirteen years is far too long to wait.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/25">In conclusion, the future of the Henderson hospital is in limbo as a result of a dysfunctional funding system. Council tenants in my constituency are paying 37p of every pound of rent as a tenant tax to the Treasury. The frail and the vulnerable are protected by a system found to be unfit for purpose more than a decade ago. The message from my constituents to the Government is that it is time for dither and delay to end. It is time that the Government put those things right. Although I enter into the spirit of things by wishing all colleagues a good Whitsun recess, I hope that the Government will take advantage of the fact that they do not have business in the House next week to reflect on the concerns held by me and my constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-05-22a.452.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="452"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080522/debtext/80522-0012.htm#08052282001020">
	<p pid="a.452.2/1">It is always a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" name="David Evennett">the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett)</phrase>, who focused on a number of subjects that are important to him and his constituents. He mentioned alcohol-free zones. We should look more pointedly at that issue&mdash;even in respect of my own constituency, which is a fantastic area&mdash;because that sort of minor antisocial behaviour affects the quality of life of many people. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-07">7 June</phrase>, I am accompanying a local councillor, Jim Marsh, to the local police station in Coupe Green to meet local residents who have a problem with youths who drink alcohol in the local park where children often play. That affects the quality of life of people living around the area. Alcohol-free zones may well be the answer. Such tools need to be used more effectively, particularly where trouble takes place outside football grounds, for example, often even when there is no football match going on. The antics that some of these yobs got up to last night were absolutely amazing.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford mentioned the discontent of different groups of people and the effect of the abolition of the 10p tax rate on the poorest sections of society. A friend of mine phoned me up recently, asking me whether I had heard the Chancellor on the &quot;Today&quot; programme trying to justify what had gone on with the 10p rate, saying that everything would be okay as &pound;120 would be given out to the poorest people. I said that I had heard that. My friend said that the Chancellor attempted to justify why the cost would be greater than originally stated by the Prime Minister&mdash;less than &pound;1 billion, when it is now &pound;2.7 billion. The Chancellor said that it was necessary because of food and fuel inflation, which meant that people needed help straight away. My friend said, &quot;Do you realise, Nigel, that the only people who are going to miss out on the food and fuel inflation money are the poorer sections of society?&quot; That was because the &pound;120 simply takes those people back to where they were before the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/3">The people who benefited from the abolition of the 10p rate and the altering of the 22p rate down to 20p will get an additional &pound;120. They benefited from the Budget and will also get &pound;120 to help them with food and fuel. The poorest sections of society will get not a penny to help them with the inflation on food and fuel that we all see when we go to our supermarkets and petrol stations. It is yet another reason why people get extremely frustrated by the Government not listening and not learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/4">I, too, should like to pay tribute to Tom Burlison. He was a former secretary of the GMB and a former professional football player for Hartlepool United and honorary president of the club. I met Tom on several occasions. If ever someone was asked to describe Lord Burlison, they would say that he was hard-working, dedicated, committed and unassuming. That was another thing about Lord Burlison. When I first met him, I referred to him as Lord Burlison. He stopped me, grabbed me by the arm, and said, &quot;Call me Tom.&quot; That was Tom Burlison for you. I know that he will be missed every day by his family, but it will be more poignant when his son, Rob, who recently got engaged, gets married. Everyone who was associated with Tom will miss him too. We will miss him greatly.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/5">Early-day motion 1616 asks the Chancellor of the Exchequer to do away with the proposed 2p increase in the fuel price to be introduced in the autumn. We know that, as a result of the huge increase in oil prices recently, he has a windfall of more than &pound;500 million to date. It has been estimated that if the Chancellor were to postpone the 2p increase further, it would cost him roughly &pound;500 million. It is not as if the idea is uncosted. He did not expect to get that money in the first place, and surely we need some protection. Inflation is already dramatically on the rise, and with petrol at such high prices&mdash;&pound;1.20 a litre&mdash;we cannot say when it is going to stop. Surely the Chancellor should not be adding to the woes of ordinary families in this country by clobbering them with another 2p increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/6">In business questions, I mentioned the plight of public phone boxes, which are now rapidly disappearing throughout the country. I had the privilege of going to Dunsop Bridge in my constituency several years ago when BT unveiled the 100,000th public telephone box in the country. It was opened by Sir Ranulph Fiennes. BT chose Dunsop Bridge because Ordnance Survey says that that is where the centre of the United Kingdom would be if we squashed it all together. All the local school children were there, and they were excited by the opening of the phone box.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/7">I just happened to be in my constituency one Sunday morning when a man turned up asking where certain villages were. We asked him what he was doing. He said, &quot;I've come to check your telephone box because it's due to be taken away.&quot; I had a look at the list of public telephone boxes that are going to be removed from Ribble Valley, and there it was: Dunsop Bridge. The 100,000th telephone box is going to be taken away. <i> [Interruption.] </i>There is no sense of history. I said that it was sad when BT removed the red telephone boxes. I ran a bit of a campaign to get them retained. They are as important to the British character as red buses, and we look forward to the bendy ones going and the traditional ones coming back. Thank you, Boris&mdash;and Boris gets another name-check.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/8">There is an important aspect to telephone boxes. Even though a lot of people have mobile phones, they do not work in many rural areas. The life of the batteries is still relatively short, and if a battery is dead, what are we supposed to do in an emergency? It is important that we get at least a proper network of public telephone boxes even if they do not make money. BT has a good community programme and supports a lot of community projects. I would have thought that that would be a tremendous community project. I would not mind if it put in the boxes a message saying: &quot;This telephone box does not make any money. It is part of a community project, sponsored by British Telecom.&quot; I hope that BT will think again, look at the network that currently exists and not take these emergency facilities away from our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/9">We have a rather thin House today. I suspect that had we held the debate in Crewe and Nantwich, more Members would have been present. However, I want to raise one more issue. We have discussed a good many taxes recently, but I want to talk about aviation duty, with which the Government propose to replace air passenger duty. It will be calculated on the basis of a combination of an aircraft's maximum take-off weight and a distance factor determined by the geographical band to which the aircraft flies. Aircraft weighing more than 5.7 tonnes and freight-only flights will be subject to the duty. It will be the first time that freight-only flights have been taxed. The duty will be applied to the aeroplane regardless of the type or number of passengers. Aeroplanes carry out phantom flights now and again, and that clearly needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/10">Aviation duty will have unintended consequences. This brings us back to the abolition of the 10p rate. The present Prime Minister&mdash;the then Chancellor&mdash;did not quite realise the consequences of the abolition of the 10p rate and the alterations higher up the band scale. I am sure that he did not sit down with his Cabinet colleagues and ask them &quot;How can we hit the poorest hardest?&quot;, although had he done so, he would of course have ended up with the system that he introduced. What resulted from it was an unintended consequence, however; let us be generous to him in that regard at least.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/11">I believe that aviation duty, as currently planned, with unduly penalise United Kingdom aviation, and will have significant perverse consequences for regional airports in particular. While taxing freight aircraft may seem attractive from an environmental point of view, it seems likely that the economic consequences will be entirely disproportionate. We know why the Government are doing this&mdash;it is for environmental reasons&mdash;but the unintended consequences will hit the British economy. A balance needs to be struck.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/12">The Secretary of State for Transport has stated that changes to air passenger duty should</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/13" class="indent">&quot;reflect the number of flights rather than passengers, strengthening incentives for airlines to use their planes as efficiently as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/14">I am sure we would all agree with that. However, in the 2003 White Paper &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot;, the Government acknowledged that</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Britain's economy increasingly depends on air travel, for exports, tourism and inward investment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/16">That is the balance that must be considered in the introduction of any aviation tax: how to make aviation as efficient as possible without damaging the UK's national and regional economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/17">In its response to the White Paper, South West of England Regional Development Agency said:</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/18" class="indent">&quot;Airports can play an important part in regeneration, especially in areas where it is not appropriate for associated commercial development to take place immediately adjacent to the airport.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/19">It added:</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/20" class="indent">&quot;Air access to London and other European airports is central to the economic development prospects to many parts of the region&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/21">In that context, Members may be interested to know that airports in the south-west employ about 3,500 people, and generate a further 5,600 jobs in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/22">I recently met representatives from Manchester airport, which many of my constituents use to fly either directly to another country or in transit through to London. From that meeting I gained the distinct impression that aviation duty would distort the international level playing field for UK freight. It is a logical conclusion that if freight departing from the UK attracts a tax that does not apply anywhere else in the world, businesses will go elsewhere. Manchester Airports Group estimates that aviation duty would damage UK competitiveness on a third of goods traded.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/23">It is one thing for aviation duty to be paid on goods coming into and going out of the country, but many companies will be very intelligent about the countries to which they fly. For instance, if they have to fly to Charles de Gaulle airport in France or Schiphol in Amsterdam, they will do exactly that. The freight will then be taken off, and will travel by road. It has been estimated that would result in thousands more lorries on the roads, transporting goods that would otherwise have gone to a regional airport somewhere or other. At Manchester airport alone, at least 1,144 scheduled cargo flights would become commercially unviable or at risk. That equates to about 220 jobs in the north-west region. I have also been informed that for East Midlands airport, which is the UK's largest pure freight hub, that figure is likely to exceed 850 jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/24">It must be considered that aviation duty has the potential to seriously undermine long-haul development from UK airports, because both freight customers and airlines can reduce their tax liability by taking an indirect route via another hub. That is exactly what air passengers would do, too. Whereas now many people would fly directly from a regional airport to, for instance, the United States of America or the middle east, if the duty for long-haul flights becomes prohibitive they will look to go via Schiphol or Charles de Gaulle to connect with Air France or KLM to fly the long-haul sector from there as that would reduce their tax liability. For a family of four, that liability could amount to a lot of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/25">I am asking the Government to take on board the unintended consequences of this tax. Manchester airport also says that it will be turned into an enormous tax collector for the Government. Current air passenger duty costs are about 9p per &pound;100 collected. Manchester airport estimates that with the new tax it would have to collect about &pound;400 million a year on behalf of the Government and that it would cost it many thousands of pounds to start to collect that money. There could be a huge cost to the regional airports, and that could even damage the prospects of remaining in business for those that are marginally viable.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/26">I also want the Minister to take the message back to the Secretary of State for Transport and the Chancellor that another unintended consequence could be that the new tax raises less money than the current air passenger duty as customers&mdash;both passengers and freight&mdash;will more intelligently work out how to complete their journeys. I understand the environmental reasons why the Government want to introduce this tax, but it is logical if we are to go down this route not to do it alone. Neighbouring countries would benefit from that&mdash;as indeed would the rest of the world, because if we start on this course alone the problems will start shifting around the world and people across the globe will act intelligently and start making different choices in air travel. We need to get everyone sitting down to work out how to have a proper aviation fuel tax that everybody throughout the world will implement, so that we can encourage airlines to be more fuel-efficient and do away with all the phantom flights made just to keep slots open. We would also not be penalising the freight industry in this country; doing so would lead to the loss of a number of jobs, as they would simply move to Holland and France.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/27">Now is the time to do as I suggest. The consultation has just finished, and the Treasury and the Secretary of State for Transport should sit down and take a look at all the representations. Would it not be far better if they were more intelligent about this and came up with a policy that everybody could endorse and that would not have all these unintended consequences, rather than not listen, not learn, introduce this tax, lose all the jobs, lose a lot of taxation as well&mdash;they would not even get that tax revenue&mdash;and then afterwards have to change the policy simply to ensure that British industry was not damaged? Now is the time to do this. If the Government really are listening and learning, we will hear a change of policy from them forthwith.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-05-22a.461.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" speakername="Shailesh Vara" colnum="461"  time="015:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080522/debtext/80522-0014.htm#08052282001024">
	<p pid="a.461.1/1">I agree entirely: my hon. Friend is right to say that transparency is of the utmost importance&mdash;we all agree about that&mdash;but that a distinction must be made. Society has become a lot more hostile towards western countries, especially Britain and America, and the security of the people who speak about such matters in debates in this House deserves to be considered very seriously. I wish my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East well in his campaign to ensure some sense of secrecy regarding Members' addresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" name="David Evennett">the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett)</phrase> made an excellent speech, as he always does, and spoke with great diligence on behalf of his constituents. He very properly pointed out that crime and antisocial behaviour are linked with the horrendous figures on drugs and alcohol, and presented some startling facts about that cocktail of drugs, alcohol, crime and antisocial behaviour. I agree with him that, with our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1629" name="Boris Johnson">the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)</phrase> at the helm of London now, it is to be hoped that&mdash;and I am pretty confident that&mdash;we will see an improvement in those figures. He is certainly making a start by banning alcohol on public transport in London. That is eminently sensible, and it seems absurd that it was not done many years before. My hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford also discussed the rising cost of living&mdash;an issue that affects not only his constituents but people throughout the country. I urge the Deputy Leader of the House to pass on that message to her fellow Front Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase> made a very forceful speech and echoed the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford when he spoke about the rising cost of living. He gave some very helpful advice to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whom I hope will take it on board. He seems not to have taken on board much from many people so far, but I hope that he will accept that advice, given that he has the recess to think it through. I also agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley that there is a very strong argument for the retention of public telephone boxes. I wish him well in his campaign in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.1/4">We concluded with a very measured speech from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1738" name="Richard Bacon">the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon)</phrase>, who gave us some disturbing details on the mismanagement of a particular college. The manipulation of figures, the falsifying of attendances and the 300 or so discrepancies picked up by PricewaterhouseCoopers lead to the conclusion that a detailed inquiry is required. I wish my hon. Friend well in trying to get a thorough and detailed inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.1/5">On that note, Madam Deputy Speaker, all that remains is for me to wish you a very happy recess, along with all Members and their staff and all the staff who serve us so well in the House. I suspect that, given the enormous footwork that some Members will have undertaken in the previous weeks in Crewe and Nantwich, the recess is very well deserved.</p>
