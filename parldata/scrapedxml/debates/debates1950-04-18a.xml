<p>asked the Minister of Town and Country Planning how many Forms L.39 have been sent to owners of property by the Central Land Board; how many have been withdrawn; why they were sent; and why withdrawn.</p>
</speech>

<p>One hundred thousand and eighty-three, of which less than 300, sent in error, were withdrawn. The forms were sent to owners of single dwelling houses to ascertain whether their claims to compensation were admissible.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that it required a new form &#x2014;R6/82&#x2014;to withdraw these forms, will he agree that the issue of these forms caused a number of claimants to answer questions which were optional under Form S.1, and in the circumstances will he give an assurance that the information which they gave will not be used to their disadvantage?</p>

<p>No information is ever used to anybody's disadvantage in this held. The percentage affected is remarkably small&#x2014;less than 300 out of 100,083 &#x2014;and will surprise the hon. Member by its smallness. It is less than one-third of 1 per cent.</p>

<p>This work is the scheduling of buildings of special architectural and historical merit and, I am told, is going forward very well.

<p>asked the Minister of Town and Country Planning why, when the development charges to be paid on houses built on one of Stafford's municipal housing estates are &#x00A3;18 per house, the development charges on houses of almost similar size and construction built by private enterprise run sometimes as high as &#x00A3;210.</p>

<p>May I confine myself to the second part of that supplementary question, and assure the hon. Member that we are in very close touch with the parties? We have had contact with them all the time and are still in contact with them, and we hope to be able to avert any trouble.<br/>
<i>Following is the answer</i>:<br/>
Neither of the parties has reported this dispute to me but I have felt obliged, as a matter of public interest, to draw the attention of the executive of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Trade Unions to certain issues raised by the terms of the ballot. The alternatives presented to the voting members imply that there is a choice between strike action and reporting a dispute to the National Arbitration Tribunal, whereas in fact under the Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Orders strikes and lockouts are in general prohibited unless and until a dispute has been reported to me in writing and I have failed to take action prescribed under the Orders. Moreover, the reference of any dispute to the National Arbitration Tribunal is a matter for me and is not left


to the choice of either party; in certain circumstances there may be other steps that I could take if they seemed expedient and desirable. The Executive of the Confederation have explained that the terms of the ballot were decided under the Confederation rules but each union is at liberty to send an explanatory note to its membership participating in the ballot. In illy view, in a matter of this importance, affecting as it does a very large group of our workpeople, it is essential that there should be no room for misunderstanding as to the law and I have pointed out to the trade unions their responsibility to their membership in this regard.<br/>
I also took advantage of these discussions to ascertain both from the Engineering Employers' Federation and the Confederation the position that had been reached in the negotiations for a new wages structure for the engineering industry. The House will recall that a Court of Inquiry, whose Report dated 25th August, 1948, was laid before this House, recommended that the parties should re-open negotiations on this subject. It seemed to me desirable in the light of this recommendation to see whether even at this stage any steps could usefully be taken to assist the parties to reach some mutually satisfactory agreement on this subject. I found that although the discussions have not so far yielded any satisfactory result, the matter is still open for negotiation. The employers, however, state that they are not in a position to resume discussions while the claim for a &#x00A3;1 a week increase is a live issue.<br/>
I regret that the harmony that usually characterises these great and important industries should he disturbed, particularly at the present critical time in our economic situation. I am keeping a close watch on developments and I need hardly say that I shall he ready at any time to do what I can to assist the parties in arriving at a proper solution to their problems.</p>

<p>The number of complaints regarding the accommodation and conditions on these vessels is very small compared with the number of passengers carried and in most cases they concern matters which can be rectified during the voyage. The average number of berths per cabin is, in the "Empire Test" 4.4, in the "Eastern Prince" (now renamed "Empire Medway ") 5.5, and in the "Empress of Australia" 7. The shipping


position since the war has necessitated the continued employment of these vessels and other troopships which were part of the war-time fleet. They have been considerably improved, but they are scheduled to be withdrawn from service as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We have now settled into the custom of dealing with the Economic Survey and the Budget together, and I propose therefore to follow the same pattern as I have followed before, by dealing first with the Economic Survey and the general economic situation before coming to the details of our finances and of my Budget proposals.<br/>
We have, I think, achieved in recent years a very large measure of agreement in this country that the Government-whatever its complexion-must accept responsibility for the general economic health of the whole community. That is a revolution in economic thinking and in Government responsibility, a revolution so complete that it is often entirely overlooked. As to the objective of economic health and the responsibility of Parliament, I imagine that there will be no difference in this Committee.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.38.6" colnum="38" time="">
<p>There has been a very marked tendency in the Press, in its review of the economic situation following upon the publication of the Economic Survey, to comment to the effect that the Survey for 1950 marks the abandonment of all attempts to plan our economy. That is, perhaps, a somewhat peculiar complaint by those who profess to be opposed to planning. It has always been difficult to explain, especially to those who did not wish to understand, the real object and the limitations of democratic planning. In two earlier documents this has been explained at some length, in the 1947 Survey and the long-term programme, and on numerous occasions in speeches. I must, however, in view of the obvious continued misunderstanding, try to explain the position once again.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.39.0" colnum="39" time="">
<p>Democratic planning has for its objective to combine a free democracy with a planned economy. That synthesis is not an easy one, though I believe it is absolutely vital to the continuance of democratic freedom in the world. We are out after something a great deal more important than a good piece of planning machinery or even than a particular way of organising our industries and services. Our aim is to create a Happy Country in which there is equality of opportunity, and not too great a disparity of personal incomes, and in which every man and woman can feel that they are welcomed and have a full part to play and are invited to take their share in the democratic control of their country's economy.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.39.1" colnum="39" time="">
<p>It is basic to that kind of life that there should be full employment and full participation by the workers in the industrial life of the community. How particular planning operations are carried out or how particular industries are organised is only important in so far as such matters are essential steps in attaining the goal at which we aim. It is not possible any more than it is desirable in such a democratically planned economy, to use the violent compulsions that are appropriate to totalitarian planning. Nor would it be sensible to attempt to decide from the centre all the details of production and distribution. Such day-to-day decisions must obviously be made by individual undertakings within the broad framework of national policy laid down by the Government.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.39.2" colnum="39" time="">
<p>It follows, therefore, from these two reasons&#x2014;the democratic nature of our planning and the necessity for avoiding over-centralisation&#x2014;that while we dan and must use some financial and physical controls, yet a great part of the direction and control of the economy must be accomplished by agreement, persuasion, consultation and other free democratic methods. While therefore we can forecast what is likely to happen or map the possibilities offered for achievement, it is not possible to lay down a rigid target and say that it will be achieved, since in many cases there can be no democratic method of making sure of that achievement. That is not a failure of planning, but a recognition of the fact that there must be limitations to the capacity of a democracy to force the

implementation of any economic plan which it lays down.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.40.0" colnum="40" time="">
<p>Some controls are acceptable to a democracy&#x2014;rationng is a good example &#x2014;and we have in fact been able, by controls, to prevent many undesirable economic results which would in these post-war years have militated against the achievement of our aims. Some positive controls, too, have been and can be used, especially in the area of public expenditure, such for instance as the building of factories in the development areas.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.40.1" colnum="40" time="">
<p>Indeed, the Budget itself can be described as the most important control and as the most powerful instrument for influencing economic policy which is available to the Government. During the last Parliament its influence was brought strongly to bear against inflation, by reducing the excess purchasing power in our economy. We have thus been able, while maintaining full employment, to stimulate rapidly the development of our export trade and thereby tc help towards a solution of our balance of payments problem. Our very considerable success proves indeed the value and efficacy of our budgetary planning.</p>

<p>What has been so remarkable over the last three or four years is that so many people of every section of the population and of all shades of political opinion have played their part in the organised voluntary effort to achieve the economic goals set out in the Surveys. Because of this combination of moderate controls democratically accepted by the nation and the people's willingness to follow voluntarily the directions set out, we have in fact succeeded in a large measure&#x2014;I would say a very large measure&#x2014;in keeping to the difficult path of economic progress that we have planned in this postwar period. The Economic Survey for 1950 shows the degree of our success in 1949 in following that road and indicates how we can proceed a further stage in the same right direction.</p>

<p>The year 1949 was certainly not a dull year from the economic point of view. It was marked, indeed, by that summer crisis, which generally seems to occur somewhere in the world over something, but which this time was in a form that particularly affected the relation between the sterling and the dollar areas and


which led to the drastic decision to devalue sterling. The first quarter of 1949 showed the general recovery in our external finances as continuing. Let me here warn the Committee that there is a seasonal tendency for the first quarter)l the year to appear somewhat overpromising. We achieved a small surplus in our overseas payments, and our reserves of gold and dollars actually showed a small increase.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.41.0" colnum="41" time="">
<p>What happened after that first quarter up till devaluation is well known to the Committee, and was fully debated in the House at the time of devaluation. A decline in the dollar receipts of the sterling area and an increase in its outgoings led to a heavy draft upon our depleted reserves, and this, in turn, intensified the development of those speculative movements which had already been engendered by the most damaging gossip that had been rife as to the possible devaluation of sterling.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.41.1" colnum="41" time="">
<p>We had, of course, before we decided to devalue weighed very carefully the likely effects upon our economy of that devaluation, and now, after six months' experience, we can say that, so far as we can at present judge, events have moved rather more favourably for us than we then anticipated. This is due to a complex of causes including, I believe, the inherent soundness of our own economy and the fact that the world is convinced that we are prepared to take the most drastic steps to guard the strength of sterling and its use as a basis for a wide area of multilateral trade throughout the world.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.41.2" colnum="41" time="">
<p>Since September last our exports have recovered sharply, and preliminary information indicates that the volume in the first quarter of this year was nearly 10 per cent. above that of the first quarter of last year. We are at the moment in overall balance-indeed, almost certainly in overall surplus-with the rest of the world, and, as was clear from the figures I gave the House a few days ago, we have made a satisfactory beginning to the recovery of our gold and dollar reserves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.41.3" colnum="41" time="">
<p>When we look forward to the rest of 1950 it is difficult and hazardous to make any forecast. We do not yet know what will happen as regards Marshall Aid for 1950&#x2013;51, and we have not yet seen the end of the changes brought about by devaluation. The evidence of the first quarter of

the year, however, tends to show that our exports are expanding in a satisfactory way and that our export prices are still fully competitive over a wide range of goods. But we must remember that both Germany and Japan are coming back into the international markets and that, even apart from that fact, competition is likely to intensify in the coming months. This should bring home to us the very great importance of doing all we can nationally and internationally to maintain the expansion of world markets, for any general contraction is bound to have a particularly adverse effect upon our world-wide trade.</p>

<p>We have estimated that our receipts from visible exports may reach &#x00A3;2.000 million for the year 1950, some &#x00A3;200 million more than in 1949. On the invisible items of the balance of payments we expect a distinct improvement, in particular with respect to oil, shipping and tourist earnings.</p>

<p>So far as imports are concerned, we have, of course, suffered a serious worsening of the terms of trade since devaluation; if we denote those terms of trade in 1947 by the index number 100, then between September, 1949, and the present time they have moved against us from 98 to 108. We hope that we have now seen the full extent of the rise in import prices, but prediction is most difficult in this field as it depends on so many factors over which we can have no control at all. The most important is, of course, the level of business activity in the United States, but we are also affected by the level at which farm prices are there maintained. We expect, however, despite the difficulties to be in a position to obtain the necessary raw materials for our expanded production.</p>

<p>So far as food supplies are concerned, 1949 showed a marked improvement over earlier years and, on the whole, we were able to keep down import prices. There are far fewer shortages in the shops today, and the volume of the ration has now risen in a number of commodities. The outlook is not unfavourable, despite our difficult negotiations with the Argentine.</p>

<p>Taking the picture of our external economic position as a whole, we hope during 1950 to convert an overall deficit of about &#x00A3;70 million into an overall surplus of about &#x00A3;50 million. I would here stress to the Committee the importance


of our being in a position to earn an overall surplus. Marshall Aid, which has been and is such an immense help to us, is declining and will disappear at latest in 1952; our Canadian credits will also be exhausted in the near future. Not only so, but from 1951 the question of the service of the American and Canadian debts will confront us. We must also have available some surplus to assist in Commonwealth and in colonial development. Over and above all this it is essential for us&#x2014;as I shall show in a moment&#x2014;to increase our gold reserves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.43.1" colnum="43" time="">
<p>So far I have for the most part been dealing with the United Kingdom overseas balance of payments, but I must now turn to what is the concern of the whole sterling area; that is, the balance of gold and dollar payments arising out of the transactions of the whole sterling area with the rest of the world. This matter is dealt with rather more fully in the Economic Survey this year, as there has been a tendency, I think, to misunderstand and confuse the relation between our own overseas balance of trade and the dollar balance of the sterling area as a whole.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.43.2" colnum="43" time="">
<p>The main purpose of our overseas economic policy is, of course, to eliminate the dollar deficit in the sterling area's accounts. I gave the House the figures for the dollar transactions a day or two ago. These showed a small surplus for the quarter which is the result of, I think, a most creditable performance by both this country and the other countries of the sterling area.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.43.3" colnum="43" time="">
<p>There is one item amongst those transactions to which I should like to refer. At the request of the Newfoundland Government we repaid the balance of nine million dollars outstanding from the interest-free loan of 12,300.000 dollars which they made to us during the war. I cannot let this occasion pass without expressing once again, I am sure on behalf of everyone in this Committee and in this country, our most grateful thanks for that very present help in our time of trouble.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.43.4" colnum="43" time="">
<p>The small dollar surplus which we earned in the first quarter of this year is the result of a number of temporary factors, including the after-effects of

devaluation, as well as of some more permanent factors. One of the very important influences is the strong buying by the United States of primary products from the sterling area. I must, therefore, warn the Committee and the country against relying too much upon the continuance of this favourable trend, but let me also bring to their notice that, if and when less favourable results appear, it will not mean that all our affairs have gone radically wrong. We must expect some variations, but if external circumstances continue' as they are today there is no reason why we should anticipate any dangerous change for the worse in our situation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.44.0" colnum="44" time="">
<p>There is no doubt that a major element in our improved position is the reduction of the expenditure of dollars which we have brought about both upon visible and invisible imports. Since 1948 we have secured economies in dollar expenditure by the United Kingdom alone at the rate of 900 million dollars a year, reducing the annual rate of dollar expenditure to 2,000 million from 2,900 million in 1948. The Colonies and the sterling countries of the Commonwealth have also made very large economies and we hope that these will be continued. They have to some extent been made possible by the United Kingdom's ability to supply at fully competitive prices a greater quantity and larger range of their needs in imports. All this is a real and a continuing gain to our balance of payments. It means that the inescapable commitments upon our gold and dollar reserves for primary necessities have been and are still being steadily reduced.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.44.1" colnum="44" time="">
<p>There is another aspect of this matter no less important, and that is the saving that we have been able to make, since devaluation, in marginal gold payments. As the Committee knows there are a number of countries, such as Belgium and Switzerland, to whom we have had to make balancing gold or dollar payments from time to time over the past few years, mainly in respect of purchases from them by ourselves or other countries of the sterling area. Since devaluation, owing to our better competitive position, we have been able to replace these payments to a very large extent by exports to those countries of sterling area goods, thus saving the drain upon our gold reserves.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.44.2" colnum="44" time="">
<p>On the side of dollar-earning, the progress of United Kingdom exports has not


been quite so marked. We are gradually expanding our sales to the United States and Canada, and to the other American account countries, the importance of whose trade must not be overlooked. In this task I would like to commend very highly the contribution of the Dollar Exports Board, under the most effective leadership of Sir Cecil Weir. We have, I am glad to say, now reached the point where the increased volume of United Kingdom dollar sales is earning us dollars in excess of the rate of dollar-earning immediately before devaluation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.45.0" colnum="45" time="">
<p>But, of course, the biggest element of dollar-earning by the sterling area is in respect of the income from the sales to the dollar area of such primary commodities as rubber, wool, jute, tin, cocoa and so on. Experience shows&#x2014;as indeed one would expect&#x2014;,that very large fluctuations indeed take place in these sales from month to month, apart altogether from their seasonal character. In recent months, these sales have been at a high level, but they might at any time fall off temporarily, if there were a weakening of internal demand in the dollar area. That is one reason why a decrease in our dollar spending is so essential to bettering our payments position because that is a regular and controllable saving, whereas the dollar-earning of the sterling area is much more uncertain and is not, of course, within our power to determine.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.45.1" colnum="45" time="">
<p>This brings me to a consideration of our reserves. At 1,984 million dollars they are a little bigger than a year ago, but they are still considerably below what they were at the beginning of the Marshall. Plan in March, 1948&#x2014;which was itself a wholly inadequate level compared with <i>our</i> needs or our pre-war position when, making adjustments for the relative values of money, they were, in effect, four to five times as great as at present. Indeed, the changes in our reserves which took place last summer and led to such a drastic step as devaluation would have probably been very little noticed by world opinion if we had then had our pre-war volume of reserve. There was, in fact, as many will remember, between March, 1938, and March, 1939, a fall of &#x00A3;241 million sterling or over 1,000 million dollars in our gold reserve which we were able to handle quite comfortably and without any effect upon the external value of the &#x00A3;.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.45.2" colnum="45" time="">
<p>It is the smallness of our reserves much more than the unavoidable degree of

fluctuation in our earnings that is now our real trouble. That is why we must build up those reserves in every way we can so as to have more in hand to meet the quite normal and inevitable fluctuations in the dollar income of the sterling area that we shall encounter when Marshall Aid comes to the end in 1952.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.46.0" colnum="46" time="">
<p>One very encouraging feature in this situation is the almost universal recognition now given to the fact that this problem of the dollar gap is not one for the debtor countries only. Recent speeches by Mr. St. Laurent and Mr. Howe in Canada and by Mr. Acheson and Mr. Hoffman and others in the United States have emphasised strongly the need for open markets in the dollar countries if there is to be a real chance of bringing the overseas payments between the dollar area and the rest of the world into balance. I am sure, too, that we must all be greatly encouraged by the appointment by the President of the United States of Mr. Gordon Gray as a special adviser for the very purpose of examining and advising upon this situation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.46.1" colnum="46" time="">
<p>We shall continue to concert measures with the Commonwealth, with our European neighbours in O.E.E.C., and with our Canadian and American friends to bring about a solution to this problem of the dollar gap.

<p>The Organisation for European Economic Co-operation has, I think, made quite remarkable progress over the last year, and in that we have played our full part. It is no simple task to lay the foundation in statistical and economic services and organisation for a close and friendly co-operation between 17 countries, with the most widely varying political and economic outlook, many of whom have been at political or economic enmity over long periods in the past. It requires a great fund of goodwill and understanding as well as the appropriate machinery,</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.46.4" colnum="46" time="">
<p>Yet I can say with complete conviction that the very distinguished and devoted body of international and national


civil servants who have been working at Paris for the last two years, and amongst whom this country is very well represented, have succeeded in bringing about a degree of co-operation and understanding which I regard as little short of miraculous. It is only necessary to study the Second Report of O.E.E.C. to appreciate that fact.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.47.0" colnum="47" time="">
<p>But there are other very real accomplishments besides this. The Second Report of the Organisation points out that the growth of production last year has been higher than was ever expected at 25 per cent. above that of 1947, and indeed it is now above pre-war level. This is a great step forward towards that viability by 1952 which is the goal of all European countries. It is, too, a great tribute to the efficacy of Marshall Aid, for which all the democratic world must be grateful. As the Report says:
<q> Four to five billion dollars a year of aid has permitted an expansion of annual output of about 30 billion dollars.</q>
That is a pretty successful pump-priming operation. We were very glad to be able to record our gratitude and admiration of those responsible for the initiation and carrying out of that great scheme at the time of the celebration of the second anniversary of its coming into operation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.47.1" colnum="47" time="">
<p>We have gone a long way during the past year to remove restrictions upon imports into this country in accordance with the suggestion we made at O.E.E.C. and which was there adopted. We believe that for a great trading community like our own, with markets in every country of the world, the fullest possible removal of trade restrictions is beneficial, provided we can maintain the controls necessary to safeguard our balance of payments and our reserves, and to carry out that degree of planning which is essential for the maintenance of full employment in our own country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.47.2" colnum="47" time="">
<p>Within the framework of O.E.E.C. we have been able to agree with certain other countries, notably the Scandinavian countries whose economies are somewhat similar to our own, to go further and get rid of certain controls on invisible payments.

<p>We are now, as the Committee knows, engaged in an attempt to extend still further the transferability of sterling and

other European currencies under a European payments scheme which will be better adapted for continuance after Marshall Aid is completed than the schemes which have hitherto operated. I cannot now go into the details of this matter, which is under discussion between O.E.E.C. countries, but I should like to make clear that we are determined, if it is by any means possible, to play our full part in such a scheme, though we must, of course, see to it that the position of sterling, as an international currency which facilitates a great deal of multilateral trade today, is not jeopardised.</p>

<p>Whatever comes out of our discussions &#x2014;and we hope it will be a successful scheme&#x2014;we must ourselves, as responsible for sterling in the world, move steadily forward towards the goal of the maximum multilateral use of our currency. We have over the past two years been gradually extending the transferability of sterling, until today probably half of the world's international trade and commerce is carried by sterling. This is a fine achievement in the face of all the post-war difficulties, and it has been of great service to the world; but it has only been accomplished at considerable cost to ourselves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.48.1" colnum="48" time="">
<p>There is one other aspect of this problem to which I must refer. A balance of payments between the sterling and dollar areas depends not only upon dollars being more plentiful but also upon sterling itself not being too plentiful. I have dealt with the means by which we hope to make dollars more plentiful in relation to demand, but we must not neglect the other aspect of the problem&#x2014;the possible over-supply of sterling. Some such over-supply has been almost unavoidable since the war in view of our desire to maintain the full multilateral nature of sterling and our obligations to our fellow members of the sterling area. Political considerations, too, have played a considerable part in our attempt to encourage a more stable situation in various parts of the world which were behind-hand with their economic development and where, in consequence. the pressure of the cold war was very heavy. As I have already stated in the House, we are now being more careful its regard to the supply of sterling, especially in view of the rapid decrease and ultimate elimination of dollar aid.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.49.1" colnum="49" time="">
<p>I can now relate this review of ow external economic policy, and what we have achieved, to our internal economy. The greatest internal danger to the success of our external policies has been, and still is, inflation. If internal inflationary forces were to get the upper hand in our economy our balance of payments position, both overall and in dollars, would deteriorate disastrously, and the reaction of the rest of the world to any such inflation would become a most potent factor in weakening the position of sterling. We must therefore avoid any development of inflationary tendencies which would prevent us from obtaining by importation the raw materials without which our programme of increasing production and full employment would collapse in ruins.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.49.2" colnum="49" time="">
<p>The continued growth of production, so much of which is based upon imported raw materials, is the outstanding feature of our internal economic situation. During 1949, industrial production, as strictly defined, rose by 6&#x2013;1 per cent. in real terms. Over the wider field of business enterprise as a whole, in which transport, distribution, services and agriculture are included with industrial production, output seems to have risen by rather more than 5 per cent. in real terms.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.49.3" colnum="49" time="">
<p>Allowing for the increase in numbers employed, this suggests an increase of nearly 4 per cent. in output per man per year in business enterprises compared with the forecast of 21 per cent. in the Economic Survey of 1949. It was not thought that we could rely upon quite such a high increase as 4 per cent. for next year, for reasons I will mention in a moment, and the figure of 21 per cent. has therefore been repeated for 1950. In the light of the tentative figures for the first two months of this year I am inclined to think that the assumption of 21 per cent. may again prove to be on the low side. Anyway, it is very much to be hoped that it will prove to be on the low side.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.49.4" colnum="49" time="">
<p>The increase in production is. I think, evidence that the heavy capital investment since the war, as well as the efforts of the more enlightened sections of management and labour, are beginning to have their effect. I should like here particularly to commend the very good work of the Anglo-American productivity teams, a number of whose most remarkable and

helpful reports have already been published. I am quite certain&#x2014;and in this I hope all the Committee will agree with me&#x2014;that the results in production which we have achieved over the last few years prove the accuracy of the thesis that good relations and full consultation between the two sides of industry at all levels are far more effective levers to increased productivity than the so-called "disciplinary forces" of bankruptcy and unemployment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.50.0" colnum="50" time="">
<p>In some cases where shortages have been overcome and mass production on most modern lines has been possible very striking increases in production have resulted. The total output of all vehicles, for instance, went up by nearly 24 per cent. last year. That industry has made a quite spectacular contribution to our exports, and everyone concerned is to be greatly congratulated. We cannot, however, hope to repeat such very large increases in production in individual industries, and this may tend to bring down the overall average. That is the reason why it is doubted whether last year's 4 per cent. increase in productivity can be sustained.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.50.1" colnum="50" time="">
<p>On the other hand, there are signs of a real movement forward in some industries which have so far been somewhat behind-hand. We still have a serious bottleneck in electric power generation, and unfortunately we are not yet through with those difficulties. Agriculture, which is such a vitally important factor in our home production and in our balance of payments, and which has benefited so much since this Government came into power, was somewhat affected by the drought last summer&#x2014;even more, I think, than by the previous Tory administration&#x2014;but nevertheless, good progress was made with the restocking of our farms. I am sure we are all grateful to the farmers and farm workers who have given their energies to this vital agricultural expansion programme for what they have already achieved on the basis of the fair price policy that we are operating.</p>

<p>Expenditure on gross capital formation was again at a very high level in 1949, and in fact totalled some &#x00A3;2,465 million. Excluding the self-financing expenditure necessary to carry a given volume of stocks when prices rise, which is shown separately in the Economic Survey, real investment was substantially greater, both in fixed capital assets and in additions to

<p>For 1950, the total investment for the year will be about the same as in 1949. Had the high level reached at the end of 1949 been carried forward into 1950 without the cuts announced last autumn, the total for the year would have been considerably greater. A major part of this investment will continue to be for industrial expansion of one kind or another; in 1950 about two-thirds of the new investment in the principal sectors will be for productive purposes, and only about one-third will be devoted to the social services.</p>

<p>The Committee will remember that one of the adjustments which we made after devaluation was to reduce the housing programme. We are now in the course of considering the investment programme for 1951 including housing amongst other items. The Committee will appreciate that hitherto there have been two reasons for varying the annual capital expenditure on housing: first, the fluctuating supply of materials, including particularly imported timber; and second, the total availability of building resources for our capital investment as a whole, including I may say a very large amount of factory building, especially in the development areas. This latter programme is now tailing off somewhat, and we hope that the materials position is also becoming less critically difficult.</p>

<p>During the past year we have kept to the narrow and difficult path between inflation with an unbalanced external position on the one hand and deflation with its consequent unemployment on the other. We have been able to avoid the pitfalls on either side of this narrow path. In this we have been assisted greatly by the external aid we have received from the United States and Canada, but, nevertheless, we could not have achieved the results which we have unless we had been prepared ourselves to carry out the not always very popular policies that we have pursued.</p>

<p>In considering the position in which we find ourselves at the beginning of 1950. I would point out that there has been little change in the unemployment figures, except the usual seasonal variations. The course of retail prices has been comparatively steady, the increase in the index from 109 to 113 being mainly due to the limitation of subsidies at the time of the last Budget and to the increase of the price of bread upon devaluation. Neither of these can, of course, be regarded as any evidence of inflationary pressure.</p>

<p>The wage rate index has remained remarkably steady, increasing only one point between January and December, whereas the index of earnings has just about kept pace with the cost of living index. Between 1948 and 1949, the amounts paid to wage and salary earners went up by over &#x00A3;300 million, which is a measure of their share of increased production. I should like to emphasise in this respect the great difference there is between increases in wage levels whereby more is paid for the same service, and increases in earnings arising from more being paid for more produced. This latter form of increase in personal incomes we have always encouraged because it is the by-product of greater productivity. [HON.

labour, although it is, of course, held down to some extent by the shortage of housing. This does not support those who say that much less full employment is necessary in order to enable industry to adapt itself to the changing requirements of the markets. [HoN. MEMBERS: "Who says so? "]</p>

<p>Throughout the year, there was a continual improvement in the quantity and variety of goods available in the shops, and the figures of personal expenditure, which show substantial increases in the amount spent on food and clothing, accompanied by reductions in expenditure on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and entertainments, prove that the pattern of consumption is approaching more closely to that of the pre-war period.</p>

<p>So far as our monetary situation and the National Debt are concerned, owing to the revaluation in terms of sterling of our dollar debts after devaluation, which involved an increase of &#x00A3;636 million, and to the revaluation of the sterling balances of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which cost a further &#x00A3;173 million, our National Debt has been increased over the year by &#x00A3;809 million, but we have during the same period reduced the debt by &#x00A3;173 million, so that our net increase of debt is &#x00A3;636 million. This is, of course, very different from last year's result, when we paid off &#x00A3;453 million of short-term debt, but I then made it clear that we should not repeat that record as we were not budgeting for any substantial overall surplus.</p>

<p>The main declared policy of the Budget last year was to maintain the degree of disinflation we had then attained. Although in the middle of the year there was a slight tendency towards more inflation, which was liable to be accentuated by devaluation, yet with the adequate correctives which we then applied we can now I think say that we are in a less inflationary condition than at this time last year; so that if we want

to "ride comfortably" and maintain our primary objective of full employment, our job now is to guard against any kind of increase in inflationary pressure.</p>

<p>Having now completed my review of our economic condition, I come to the Budget itself, and I will start by giving the Committee the outturn for 1949&#x2013;50. The main figures I am about to quote will be found upon pages 4 and 5 of the Blue Paper.</p>

<p>The Committee will notice that we have continued this year the alternative classification of receipts and payments which is designed to show the true revenue surplus. A good deal of technical work has been done with regard to this alternative classification, but it has not yet, I think, reached a stage when we can with any certainty select the best permanent form for our Budget accounts. It is for that reason that we have this year continued the two alternative forms.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.54.3" colnum="54" time="">
<p>The surpluses actually realised last year were, above the line, &#x00A3;549 million, true revenue surplus &#x00A3;518 million and overall surplus &#x00A3;62 million. Those all mark, as the Committee can see, an improvement upon the estimated figures, of &#x00A3;470 million, &#x00A3;492 million and &#x00A3;14 million, respectively. But though the out-turn is better than we expected, this does not mean that the original expenditure estimated was not exceeded. In fact the total expenditure exceeded the total estimates by &#x00A3;67 million, but this was, fortunately, more than offset by increases in revenue.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.54.4" colnum="54" time="">
<p>Total revenue exceeded the estimates by &#x00A3;146 million at &#x00A3;3,924 million. Customs and Excise Duties exceeded by &#x00A3;27 million in a total of &#x00A3;1,520 million. There was a shortfall in tobacco of &#x00A3;25 million, due to our cutting back the dollar purchases of tobacco last year, a very small excess of &#x00A3;6 million on alcoholic liquors and a surplus of &#x00A3;42 million on Purchase Tax. This latter reflects the increased sales of consumer goods to which I have already referred. The Betting Duties provided &#x00A3;2 million less than the estimate mainly due to the reduction in the average amount of stakes in the football pools. On the Inland Revenue side the receipts at &#x00A3;2,111 million show a small excess of &#x00A3;26 million.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.55.0" colnum="55" time="">
<p>Income Tax receipts were &#x00A3;52 million below estimate, due to an over estimate of profits for 1948. The continual rise in profits which had taken place since 1939 was halted during 1948, but this fact did not become apparent until after the estimates had been made last year. In view of this, it is at first sight surprising to.find that the yield of Profits Tax and Excess Profits Tax actually showed the largest excess of all&#x2014;&#x00A3;57 million over the estimate of &#x00A3;240 million. The explanation of this apparent contradiction is threefold: First, quicker progress in clearing arrears of Excess Profits Tax; second, accelerated collection of Profits Tax; and finally the fact that the investment income of companies generally has proved much greater than was expected.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.55.1" colnum="55" time="">
<p>Surtax produced &#x00A3;10 million over the estimate, and Death Duties &#x00A3;14 million more. The yield of other taxes was reasonably near to the estimates. Non-tax revenue yielded &#x00A3;237 million, against the estimate of &#x00A3;145 million. This is, of course, a notoriously difficult field for estimating. The major increases of receipts over estimates were: &#x00A3;35 million from the sale of surplus stores, &#x00A3;30 million from trading services and &#x00A3;27 million miscellaneous revenue. Perhaps the most significant single individual item was a payment out of the surplus arising from the wool disposals scheme.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.55.2" colnum="55" time="">
<p>Coming now to the expenditure side, the outturn exceeded the Budget estimates, as I have said, by &#x00A3;67 million. The Consolidated Fund services were &#x00A3;11 million more than the estimate, but the major increase was on supply expenditure which, at &#x00A3;2,837 million, was &#x00A3;56 million more than the estimate. The House had an opportunity of examining and discussing the various Supplementary Estimates which contributed to this excess a few weeks ago, and I then stated that I could not give the figure of saving to set against the &#x00A3;170 million supplementaries until after the end of the year. That figure of saving was &#x00A3;114 million&#x2014;so the net increase was &#x00A3;56 million.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.55.3" colnum="55" time="">
<p>There is one item below the line on the expenditure side to which I must refer, as it shows so marked a discrepancy from the estimate. This is loans to local authorities. The estimate of &#x00A3;220 million was exceeded by &#x00A3;52 million. We decided, as the Committee knows, to continue the favourable rate of interest on these loans,

at 3 per cent., to assist local authorities particularly to keep down their rents of new houses. This favourable rate of interest seems to have led some local authorities to draw more freely on the Local Loans Fund than was warranted by their actual needs, thus taking undue advantage of the special facility which we were providing for them. This could not, of course, be allowed to continue, so that steps were taken to ensure that local authority drawings on the Fund would match more closely their real needs.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.56.0" colnum="56" time="">
<p>It must be recognised that some of the internal reserves upon which the local authorities have hitherto been able to draw are now exhausted, so that we must expect their demand for loans to be somewhat higher than it has been. We believe, however, that with the continued co-operation of the local authorities the sum we intend to provide for the coming year of &#x00A3;279 million should suffice to meet all their needs.</p>

<p>I next come to examine the prospects for 1950&#x2013;51 on the basis of the existing taxation.

<p>The total supply expenditure for the year, as provided by the Estimates submitted to Parliament, amounts to &#x00A3;2,918 million, an increase of &#x00A3;137 million over the original Estimates for 1949&#x2013;50, and of &#x00A3;81 million over the actual outturn of last year. The result is, therefore, a total estimate of expenditure above the line of &#x00A3;3,455 million.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.56.4" colnum="56" time="">
<p>Revenue on the existing basis of taxation is estimated for Customs and Excise at &#x00A3;1,510 million. The more important items in this total are as follows: beer and alcoholic drinks, &#x00A3;387 million; tobacco, &#x00A3;590 million; Purchase Tax, &#x00A3;295 million; Entertainments Duty, &#x00A3;46 million; oil, &#x00A3;68 million; betting, &#x00A3;25 million; Import Duties Act, &#x00A3;48 million and other duties, &#x00A3;51 million. There is no very marked variation in these from the actual receipts of last year. The total, as I have said, is &#x00A3;10 million less. Inland Revenue receipts are expected again to be much about the same as last year's

<p>As I stated earlier, the progressive increase in profits which had gone on for nine years came to an end in 1948, and we cannot therefore look to any increase in revenue from that source. It must also he noted, and this like all benefits is soon forgotten, that this year we have to meet the first instalment of the increase in the initial allowance for new machinery which was granted in last year's Budget, and which will this year amount to a sum of &#x00A3;40 million. On the other hand, individual incomes are likely to increase with increased productivity and production, so that taking all the factors into account we hope to raise &#x00A3;1,460 million by Income Tax, which marks a small increase over last year's outturn of &#x00A3;1,438 million.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.57.1" colnum="57" time="">
<p>Surtax should yield &#x00A3;120 million and Death Duties, which have not yet been fully affected by last year's increases, should yield &#x00A3;195 million. Profits Tax and Excess Profits Tax are expected to yield &#x00A3;270 million, a fall of &#x00A3;27 million compared to last year's outturn, which is mainly attributable to a further decline in Excess Profits Tax which came to an end three years ago. Stamps should give &#x00A3;50 million, and arrears of special contribution and miscellaneous duties &#x00A3;5 million.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.57.2" colnum="57" time="">
<p>It is pretty clear, I think, that we can no longer look for those large annual increases in Inland Revenue duties which have helped us so much with our finances over the last few years. Any further yield from these taxes can only come from increases in the total of national production. We must not overlook the fact, in this connection, that the effective rate of taxation upon money distributed as salaries and wages is much less than that upon profits. The shift which is now taking place away from the earning of large profits towards the payment of more money in the form of salaries and wages must therefore tend to curtail the amount of Revenue we can raise by the Inland Revenue taxes. This is a material factor in assessing our future capacity to raise the money required to meet a rising expenditure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.57.3" colnum="57" time="">
<p>As regards other Revenue, I put Motor Duties at &#x00A3;56 million the same as received last year; surplus Stores, which are naturally decreasing rapidly in volume,

at &#x00A3;35 million compared to &#x00A3;79 million received last year; trading services at &#x00A3;85 million compared with &#x00A3;48 million last year. The reason for this is that we can look for further substantial receipts especially from the disposal of war-time purchases of wool, and on stocks of raw materials held by various controls on the cessation of Government trading. Miscellaneous receipts I put at &#x00A3;70 million compared to &#x00A3;78 million last year, which, together with &#x00A3;40 million for other smaller items, gives &#x00A3;286 million for other Revenue, and a grand total of estimated Revenue on the existing basis of taxation of &#x00A3;3,896 million.</p>

The two largest items are &#x00A3;279 million for loans to local authorities, which I have already mentioned, and &#x00A3;100 million for war damage, which it will be noted still makes large demands on our resources.</p>

<p>Many members of the Committee will remember that last year I dealt in some detail with the expenditure side of the Budget, and this year I must again emphasise the need for the most careful scrutiny of any and every suggestion of new expenditure. There is, as I have pointed out, an increase in the estimated expenditure of &#x00A3;147 million over the estimates of last year. This increase makes no allowance for any Supplementaries, such as that for increased National Assistance grants already foreshadowed, but also, of course, takes no credit for economies or under-expenditure.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.58.4" colnum="58" time="">
<p>In considering these figures we must remember that but for special economies of some &#x00A3;90 million introduced after devaluation, the estimates would have been that much higher, and also that the


net increase of &#x00A3;147 million is arrived at after taking into account an anticipated decrease of &#x00A3;50 million in terminal services arising out of the war. In the nature of things we cannot rely much longer upon any such decreases to help us. This increase results mainly from the items covered by the recent Supplementary Estimates. The services concerned are being carried forward into the coming year.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.59.0" colnum="59" time="">
<p>The largest individual increase shown in the Estimates is for the National Health Services, &#x00A3;123 million for England and Wales and &#x00A3;10 million for Scotland. I will revert to those Estimates in a moment. The next largest is Defence at &#x00A3;21 million. There is not much hope of any immediate reduction here in view of the condition of the world and the obligations of North Atlantic Defence which we are undertaking. Colonial development and welfare accounts for another &#x00A3;17 million and there is an increase of &#x00A3;17 million in grants and loans arising out of the post-war conditions in Burma and Malaya. We cannot avoid such items if we are to discharge our responsibilities in the stabilisation and development of the colonies and of South East Asia. These increases add up to &#x00A3;188 million which is more than the net increase. The other pluses and minuses are not of major importance, and, bearing in mind the reduction in terminal expenses that I have already mentioned, they nearly balance out.</p>

<p>So by far the largest item is the increased cost of the National Health Service. As to that the Committee will recollect that my right hon.

by economies or, if necessary, by contraction in others. In exercising this essential control over total expenditure, regard will of course be had to priorities. My right hon. Friends have I believe the necessary powers, but should these prove to be insufficient, an Amending Act will be introduced. It is not proposed to impose any charge immediately in connection with prescriptions, since it is hoped that a more easily administered method of economising in this branch of expenditure can be introduced shortly.

<p>There is one other item of expenditure upon which I must say a word and that is the food subsidies. As the Committee know, the Ministry of Food Estimate is simply for the net cash which the Ministry require for their administration and their trading operations, and its amount will vary from year to year with any change in stocks, up or down, over the year and with the amount fixed for the food subsidies.</p>

This year, I propose to continue that same ceiling, as modified by the economies introduced in the autumn. As the Committee will remember, these were the elimination of the Exchequer subsidy on animal feeding stuffs, the increases in the prices of dried and frozen eggs and raisins, the removal of the fish subsidy and certain administrative savings, which decreased the subsidies without having any adverse effect on prices to the consumer.</p>

<p>Taking into account all these items which had previously been included in the &#x00A3;465 million, we arrive at a ceiling for 1950&#x2013;51 of &#x00A3;410 million, and on that figure the Ministry of Food estimate has been based. The &#x00A3;465 million has not been reduced at all except by the deductions I have just stated, which were all included in last autumn's measures of economy. In the light of the prospects of prices and quantities over the year some small price increases were necessary to


keep within that ceiling and these have already been announced by the Minister of Food.</p>

If, as we hope they may, the prices at which we buy our supplies should be less than we have assumed, I should propose to pass the benefit on to the consumer so far as necessary to cancel out any rise in the cost-of-living index whether from the increased prices recently announced, or from any other source. Thus, the figure of &#x00A3;410 million can be regarded as a floor as well as a ceiling, in this sense. that subsidies will not be reduced below the floor in such a way as to raise prices.</p>

It will, I hope, be perfectly clear both to this Committee and to the country that the very greatest care and restraint must be exercised as to any new charges which it is suggested might be imposed upon the Exchequer. We have in the last four years taken on by way of social services and benefits all that we can possibly afford until such time as there is a large increase in our national production, and even then I have no doubt that the individual will want to retain a very considerable portion of that increase for his own spending.</p>

<p>It is our unquestionable duty to avoid the twin evils of inflation and deflation. This we can only do by maintaining a balance between the amount of goods and services which the nation seeks to buy and the amount which can be produced when the labour force is, as at present, fully employed. Excessive demand produces inflation and inadequate demand results in deflation. The fiscal policy of the Government is the most important single instrument for maintaining that balance. On the one hand, Government spending swells the total of national expenditure, both directly through current purchases of goods and services and indirectly through social security payments and the like, by adding to the incomes and spending power of private individuals. On the other hand, taxation, by drawing off part of the incomes of persons and business firms, reduces their spending power, and therefore the total of private expenditure.</p>

<p>The difference between Government revenue and expenditure, that is to say whether the Budget is in surplus or deficit, gives an indication of the direction in which fiscal policy is influencing the level of total demand. The problem may alternatively be looked at from a more technical standpoint, that of investment and savings. If total demand is not to be excessive then not only must Government expenditure be covered by revenue but also the nation must be willing to hold back from spending on consumption an amount equal to that which it proposes to spend on investment.</p>

<p>In other words, for the nation as a whole, spending on capital account must be balanced by savings on income account. If the voluntary savings of individuals and firms are insufficient, then the Government must itself make up the deficiency in the nation's savings by accumulating a Budget surplus, which in effect helps to pay for capital development, such, for instance, as that provided by loans to local authorities.</p>

<p>Clearly, since saving is the opposite of spending, to say that a Budget surplus is necessary to remedy a deficiency in saving is simply to re-state the earlier proposition that a surplus is necessary to curb excessive spending. We must all be agreed that the present danger continues to be one of excessive spending or deficient saving&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "By the Government."]&#x2014;that is, of inflation. In these circumstances the maintenance of a Budget surplus is absolutely vital. Should anyone be tempted to argue against the need for us to have such a surplus, I would ask him to consider whether, if we remitted taxation so as to do away with the above-the-line surplus, we should get an equivalent rise in personal savings to make good the loss. Quite obviously that is not what would happen. The great bulk of the remissions would be spent on current consumption.</p>

<p>There is one fallacy which seems to crop up almost every year when there is a Budget surplus. There is a belief amongst some people that a Budget surplus is like the declared profits of a company, and represents a fund available for distribution by way of remission of taxation. It is of course nothing of the kind. Any moneys that are not required during the year to discharge current liabilities on revenue account are used to meet capital liabilities or to pay off debt, and the allocation of these so-called surpluses to such purposes is an essential part of the financial policy laid down in the Budget.</p>

<p>Under the budgetary system which we follow we settle upon the remissions of taxation that we can afford at the beginning of the year, in the light of the needs not of the past but of the coming financial year. I hope, therefore, that no one will cast their covetous eyes upon last year's surplus, which has, in fact, been finally

spent and fully disposed of. We must look to the future and see what we can afford to do, in the light of the expenditure for which we must make provision in the coming 12 months.</p>

<p>I must repeat what I have often said before, that it is not our financial policy to run a perpetual budgetary surplus. We have said that such a surplus is essential in the present circumstances where there is a constant and imminent danger of inflation. But if and when those circumstances change we may well find ourselves in quite different conditions in which our fear is not of inflation but of deflation. Then in order to pursue our same policy we shall have to reduce the budgetary surplus or eliminate it altogether, or we may even want to budget for a deficit. When that time comes, some considerable remissions in taxation might be possible and, indeed, advisable. But we have certainly not yet reached that state of affairs.</p>

<p>Many of the critics of our present financial and economic situation, who would like to embark upon a tax remission spree, base their arguments upon an assumption that our present conditions are so hard that we cannot possibly continue without some large measure of relaxation. Our very favourable industrial results over the past year show conclusively that we are not, in fact, being crushed down by the weight of taxation. When production, productivity, exports, profits and all the rest of the indices of industrial activity are at the highest levels ever known in the country it is not good sense to argue that our industry is weighed down and rendered incapable of full performance.</p>

<p>Intimately bound up with this whole question of inflation is the policy of restraint in the matter of personal in-

It is very understandable that that policy should have become difficult to carry through, and the longer the time that passes the more difficult it must become to apply it fully.

<p>The expression "a wage-freeze" has come into common use, but, of course, no law, regulation, or rule has ever been made which imposed a wage-freeze on industry.

<p>The facts are, of course, that the total of wages and salaries&#x2014;and that is the important figure; not nominal wage rates has gone up substantially. Earnings increased between 1947 and 1948 by &#x00A3;670 million and between 1948 and 1949 by another &#x00A3;340 million. That certainly cannot be regarded as a standstill, although there was some increase of numbers employed at the same time, and to it must be added the &#x00A3;300 million of increased social services and benefits that have been accruing over the last two years. As these increases in the main were balanced by increased production, their inflationary influence has been slight. But unless there is a comparable increase in production, wage increases cannot take place without serious financial consequences.</p>

<p>Some 55 per cent. of all company profits are required for taxation; probably not less than half of what is left is used for new capital expenditure in one way or another; so that some three-quarters of the gross profits is already being utilised for essential economic purposes which otherwise we should have to finance in some other way: only a quarter goes to personal consumption, and even some of that may be subject to surtax, so there is not here any great fund from which increases in wages can be paid. There is, furthermore, no fund, as

some people seem to think, out of which we can increase our power of consumption beyond what our total production allows.</p>

<p>The real difficulty is that there are still some cases of low earnings which are very difficult to correct without upsetting the relative wage levels that have been established within each industry for the different grades and classes of workpeople employed in it.

<p>There is one thing obvious, however, that if we try, by catch-as-catch-can methods, to advance anywhere and everywhere along the wage front, we shall undoubtedly succeed in destroying full employment in the way I have described earlier, through inflation.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.66.4" colnum="66" time="">
<p>Let me now turn to the precise amount of the surplus for which we should budget this year. We must have regard to our past experiences in this field and also to the present condition of our economy. As a result of our policies and efforts in 1948 and 1949, as I have said, our internal situation is on the whole less inflationary than at any time since the war. But having reached that condition does not mean that the problem of a proper balance between national output and ex-


penditure has been permanently solved. We must continue to take the necessary measures to maintain that balance which is in constant danger of being upset and so of destroying our policy of full employment. This means quite simply that we must ensure that the extra demands which will be made on our national production this year will not exceed the increase in production which we expect.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.67.0" colnum="67" time="">
<p>As I stated earlier, we are planning for the deficit we ran on international account in 1949 to change to a small but essential surplus. This favourable change in our foreign balance creates a fresh difficulty in maintaining our internal balance, since some &#x00A3;120 million of the extra production in 1950 will be required to replace the supplies we have received as gifts or loans in 1949, measured by that net deficit of &#x00A3;70 million, and to provide for the net gifts or loans or repayment of debt that we in our turn shall make, which will be measured by our net surplus of &#x00A3;50 million. This &#x00A3;120 million must be a first charge on our extra production in 1950.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.67.1" colnum="67" time="">
<p>Earnings we expect to increase with the growth of production and productivity, just as they did last year. On the basis of the present rates of direct taxation we must reckon, therefore, on an increase in personal expenditure on consumption of at least &#x00A3;200 million. Current expenditure on goods and services by all public authorities will go up by some &#x00A3;180 million. This makes a total for all these three items of at least &#x00A3;500 million, to meet which an equivalent amount of extra production will be required. This is on the basis of our not increasing our capital expenditure substantially above its present level.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.67.2" colnum="67" time="">
<p>To meet these extra demands the Economic Survey estimates that our extra production in 1950 will amount to about &#x00A3;500 million at market prices. We have, therefore, a balance between increased output and the increased demands upon it, but with no margin whatever to spare for creating still further increases in personal consumption by tax remissions.</p>

<p>As explained just now, the prospect can be looked at in another way, from the standpoint of capital expenditure and savings. Capital expenditure is likely to be roughly the same in 1950 as in 1949. But the change from a deficit to a surplus

on international account means that our domestic savings will have to be increased by &#x00A3;120 million to compensate for that change.</p>

<p>If the voluntary limitation of dividend distribution continues, and it is of the first importance to the country that it should, we ought to see some further growth of company savings through profits put to reserve. There will also be an automatic increase in the sums set aside for depreciation, because the increase in initial allowances granted last year will become effective this year. Personal savings, in the form of small savings, have been somewhat disappointing. Withdrawals last year exceeded new small savings by nearly &#x00A3;68 million, but that is not altogether unnatural during a year- when more goods have been available for consumption, seeing that a great many people saved in the past so that they could spend the money when the goods came into the shops. New gross savings totalled &#x00A3;778 million apart from the increase in the savings put into insurance policies and building societies.</p>

And much though I appreciate the arguments for a more generous distribution of post-war credits, I am afraid that any of the extensions that have been suggested would be far too costly for us to afford.<br/>
In fact the extra wealth we hope to create by improved and increased pro-


duction this year will be used up, in the ways I have shown by improvement in our foreign balance, by increased personal consumption through increased earnings, and by increased social services and benefits.

<p>Two years ago I referred in my Budget speech to the growing avoidance of tax by means of arrangements known as restrictive covenants, amongst others. The form taken by these is that a high executive&#x2014;it is almost always a high executive &#x2014;undertakes not to set up in competition with the concern he serves or to serve its competitors. In return, the concern gives him a large sum of money or block of shares which, as the law stands, is not liable to tax. I gave a warning in 1948 that I should not hesitate to introduce retrospective legislation to tax such payments if it became necessary.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.69.3" colnum="69" time="">
<p>Since then certain glaring instances of such payments have been widely advertised, and I am certain that the public, and particularly those employed in the businesses concerned, do not think it right that a particular individual should by such a device be able to evade paying his proper share of taxation. The payment of such sums is, too, entirely contrary to the spirit of the policy of the White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices, and can only help to break down the otherwise good record of voluntary restraint that has so far been shown in these matters.</p>

<p>Surtax only. In the case of the larger sums this means that over 95 per cent. of them will be payable as tax. The warning I gave in 1948 applied to other devices besides the one I am now proposing to deal with, and that warning still stands in its full force; I hope that my present proposal will make that clear.<br/>
I have recently had under consideration the Income Tax treatment of superannuation and pension schemes for the benefit of employees on retirement. This is a highly technical subject and I believe that those who are familiar with it will all agree that in a number of respects the present law is unsatisfactory and anomalous. There is a clear need for inquiry into this problem; but there is an allied problem which should, I think, be examined at the same time: that is, the position of those who do not, or cannot, enjoy the same Income Tax advantages as those within such schemes.<br/>
A number of professional bodies have, for instance, made representations to me as to the position of their members. And much the same questions arise as to the individual trader or self-employed persons in general and, indeed, the individual employee who does not belong to a superannuation fund. There is certainly a case for inquiry here, and it would be necessary to bring within such review the present relief for payment of life insurance premiums.<br/>
I have, therefore, decided that this survey should be undertaken by a committee of standing similar to that now sitting under the chairmanship of Mr. Millard Tucker. The committee will be asked to review the more technical matters to which I have referred as well as to consider the wider question of the proper scope of Income Tax relief in relation to saving for old age or retirement or to provide for widows and other dependants after death. I am glad to say that Mr. Millard Tucker has accepted my request that he should act as chairman of this new committee as well.<br/>
There are a number of other minor matters which will be dealt with in the Finance Bill on the Inland Revenue side. As already announced, legislation will be introduced dealing with the treatment for taxation purposes of recoveries of enemy debts. There will be provisions dealing with certain methods of avoiding Death Duties, and with some technical points


arising on the taxation of the income of married couples. The taxation treatment of certain wayleaves will be clarified and provision will be made for the superannuation contributions of Northern Ireland civil servants to be treated in the same way as in Great Britain. There will also be two matters which will be of assistance to industry: first, a measure of relief from tax for industrial research associations; and second, a provision extending for a further and final five years the period, expiring in 1950&#x2013;51, for which, as a transitional measure, the Income Tax Act, 1945, permits the mills, factories, etc., allowances to be continued.</p>

But let me hasten to assure the Committee that I have no intention of repeating the unpopular action of last year when a reduction of the price was made.

In the case of whisky exported to the United States where, I am glad to say, a lot of it goes, this allowance is offset by an additional import duty of equivalent amount, so that the exporter has to refund in dollars what he receives in sterling.

This has had no significant effect on the Revenue so far, but in fairness to the great majority of the pools who have refrained from such a practice, it is proposed to close this loophole.

As those who have studied the capital investment programmes will realise, we have over the last two years been seriously troubled by the excess investment in commercial vehicles in the home market.

<p>There is another small proposal in this category, that is to reduce the rate for higher priced private cars from 663 to 33&#x002B; per cent.

A special form has been adopted so as to enable the Committee to have general discussions upon the different rates a Purchase Tax without embarking upon what the right hon.

<p>I now come to a major matter which has a bearing upon our dollar balances as well as upon our domestic revenues. We are one of the few countries that have not yet tried to persuade users to economise in petrol&#x2014;a commodity still very expensive in dollars&#x2014;by means of price increases. In almost every other country which relies so largely upon imports of petrol, the retail price is a good deal higher than it is here. Thus in France, for example, petrol is about 4s. 4d. a gallon, in Belgium 3s. 3d. and in Italy 6s., compared with the present price in this country of 2s. 3d. a gallon. Our taxation of light hydrocarbon oils&#x2014;to give the full title&#x2014;has not been increased since before the war.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.74.5" colnum="74" time="">
<p>The time has come when some of the other automatic methods of restricting the consumption of petrol, such for instance,


as the shortage of vehicles, are disappearing, so that fiscal inducements to economy have become necessary. Indeed it is difficult to think out a better case for fresh taxation. We here have a commodity costing us a great many dollars; where demand at present prices exceeds supply; where the rate of tax has not been increased since before the war; where rationing in a large part of the field&#x2014;that covered by commercial vehicles&#x2014;cannot effectively restrict consumption and where some of the factors which have hitherto tended to restrict consumption are now disappearing. Furthermore, an increase in the tax on petrol, which is at present only 9d. a gallon, will, we hope, lead to savings in consumption by commercial vehicles, so that it will be possible without any great increase in imports, to do a little better for the ordinary car user.</p>

<p>We propose, therefore, to add 9d. a gallon to the Customs Duty on petrol and other light oils and on heavy oils used as road fuel. This increase will apply from 6 o'clock today. <i>[Laughter.]</i> I am afraid there is hardly time for hon. Members to get to a pump. As a result of this the price of petrol will be increased to 3s. a gallon and, as I have said, this should lead to some resultant economies in consumption.</p>

<p>We propose, therefore, to continue throughout the next 12 months the extra ration of 90 miles a month already promised to ordinary car users for the three summer months. This will mean that as from 1st June, the beginning of the next standard rationing period, the standard ration will be increased from the rate of 90 miles to 180 miles a month. The increased ration for the six months June&#x2014;November will be made available to motorists from 8th May. So far as passenger transport is concerned, the overall cost will go up as a result of this increase of the tax by 4 per cent. in the country and by 5 per cent. in London. This small increase in costs should not lead to many additional applications for increases in fares.</p>

<p>There is one class of user of hydrocarbon oils where the circumstances are such that I feel justified in proposing a measure which will go far to offset the effect of the increase of duty. Certain

agricultural operations are performed in some cases by vehicles or machines using fuel which is taxed and in other cases by vehicles or machines using an untaxed fuel. The additional duty now to be paid in respect of the former would involve a considerable extra cost to the farmer and an undue discrimination between the two types unless suitable measures were taken to offset the extra cost of running such vehicles or machines.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.76.0" colnum="76" time="">
<p>I propose therefore that an annual grant should be paid in respect of each such vehicle or machine based on a reasonable assumption as to the average amount of taxed fuel which each type consumes. Legislation will be necessary to authorise these grants, but it cannot be included in the Finance Bill. Before the necessary Resolution is tabled, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture will consult the representatives of the farmers and manufacturers on the details. I provisionally put the cost of this concession at between &#x00A3;21 million and &#x00A3;3 million a year. The expenditure on these new grants will of course form the subject of a Supplementary Estimate in due course.</p>

<p>The producers of indigenous oils which are at present free of duty, thereby receive a preference of 9d. a gallon. After consultation with my right hon.

Customs duty. The existing duty on power alcohol will be raised by the same amount.</p>

<p>The provision in the Finance Act, 1938, under which the present margin has, in part at least, been guaranteed for the past 12 years, expires next July. I do not think that it would be right to ask the House to undertake, by legislation, that this margin should remain unchanged for a further period of years. But there would, of course, be no question of modifying it, without very careful consideration of the circumstances prevailing at the time and then only after giving the interests concerned an opportunity to put forward their case. The extra yield of the increased petrol tax is estimated at f68i million for this year and &#x00A3;73 million for a full year.</p>

<p>Let me now summarise these various changes that I have proposed so that we can see where we are so far as our necessary surplus is concerned. We start, of course, with the out-turn that we should expect to get if taxation were continued as at present. Those figures which I gave earlier were: above the line surplus &#x00A3;441 million, overall deficit &#x00A3;9 million. Since then we have added receipts for petrol tax &#x00A3;68i million, and for Purchase Tax on commercial vehicles &#x00A3;9 million, that is a total of &#x00A3;77&#x00B7;1 million. We have deducted for strengthening beer &#x00A3;2 million, for Purchase Tax on higher-priced cars &#x00A3;1 million, making a net increase of &#x00A3;74 million, which would yield a surplus above the line of &#x00A3;515 million and overall a surplus of &#x00A3;65 million.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.77.1" colnum="77" time="">
<p>In the circumstances which I have already explained to the Committee I believe that that is a rather larger surplus than we need budget for this year, and so I have looked round to see what modest adjustment in taxation could best be used to take up the slack. Whatever remissions we can manage must, and I hope we shall all agree on this, give proportionately more relief to those at the lower end of the income scale.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.77.3" colnum="77" time="">
<p>After giving the whole matter the best consideration Oat I can and examining all the different possible alternatives, of which, of course, there are many, I have come to the conclusion that with reasonable optimism we could just manage to reduce the lower rates of Income Tax now at 3s. and 6s. to 2s. 6d. and 5s. This will give the largest possible proportionate relief to people who pay only at these rates, that is people from the minimum up to about &#x00A3;600 a year. This reduction will also be concentrated upon the block of income which includes practically all overtime, and so will still further reduce the tax on overtime.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.77.4" colnum="77" time="">
<p>The Committee will remember that in 1948 we extended the band of income chargeable at 6s. in the &#x00A3; to &#x00A3;200, so that, taking the one-fifth earned income relief into account this means that at present many workers pay tax at a maximum rate of 4s. 10d. in the &#x00A3; on overtime and extra earnings while in other cases the rate is 2s. 5d. or even nothing at all. The proposals I have now made will reduce these

rates to 4s. and 2s. in the &#x00A3; respectively over the same range.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.78.0" colnum="78" time="">
<p>I will now give the Committee one or two instances of how this change in rate in the tax works out. I remind the Committee that the present starting point for the payment of tax for earned incomes is &#x00A3;145 for the single man; &#x00A3;233 for the married man with no children and whose wife does not get a separate allowance of her own; &#x00A3;308 for the married man with one child; and &#x00A3;383 for the married man with two children. Thereafter the next &#x00A3;50 of taxable income, that is, after deducting earned income relief, is charged at 3s.&#x2014;in future it will be 2s. 6d.&#x2014;and the next &#x00A3;200 at 6s.&#x2014;in future it will be 5s. The single man earning &#x00A3;6 a week will get a reduction of 2s. in his tax weekly from 12s. 4d. to 10s. 4d. If he earns &#x00A3;8 a week the tax comes down from 22s. to 18s. 4d. a reduction of 3s. 8d. a week. The married man with two children pays no Income Tax below &#x00A3;7 7s. a week income. At &#x00A3;10 a week his tax will come down from 9s. 8d. to 8s. and so on.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.78.1" colnum="78" time="">
<p>This will cost us &#x00A3;72 million this year and &#x00A3;82 million in a full year. The change will necessitate new P.A.Y.E. tables, which will be in the hands of employers for use on the first pay day after 8th June. As a result of these changes a minor adjustment will be necessary in the marginal provisions relating to the exemption limit.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.78.2" colnum="78" time="">
<p>Though these reductions give no direct relief to industry as such, I would remind the Committee that in my last Budget I doubled the initial allowances upon machinery and plant, which will cost the Exchequer &#x00A3;40 million this year and &#x00A3;75 million next year. This means that that amount less of tax will be collected from industry this year and next year, so they cannot expect to have any further remission this year.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.78.3" colnum="78" time="">
<p>The Committee will therefore see that what we propose&#x2014;apart from a few minor adjustments&#x2014;is the increase of an indirect tax which is very broadly spread in order to give proportionately more relief in direct taxation to the lower income groups, although all Income Tax payers will get some benefit. This is a move in the right direction, always bearing in mind that the growing volume of our social service expenditure, the size of our investment programme, and the need for keeping down inflation makes it


absolutely impossible for us to envisage any appreciable overall deficit on the Budget.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.79.0" colnum="79" time="">
<p>The nett result of the whole of the changes should be to give us an above the line surplus of &#x00A3;443 million, on the alternative classification a surplus of &#x00A3;413 million, and overall a deficit of &#x00A3;7 million. We can, I think, regard that in a Budget of nearly &#x00A3;4,000 million as substantially an overall balance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.79.2" colnum="79" time="">
<p>I hope that the considerations that I have put before the Committee will convince them that we cannot, out of our present volume of production, have both full employment and a general standard of personal incomes much above those which we now enjoy. We could, perhaps, have higher personal incomes, often referred to optimistically as "inducement incomes," for some people if we were prepared to see others living in unemployment at a very low standard. Our general standards are well above those that we experienced before the war, because we have been able to keep all our people employed and so have the benefit of their production. That is a result of full employment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.79.3" colnum="79" time="">
<p>Do not let us risk losing the advantages we have built up with such difficulty over these post-war years, just because we are unwilling to acknowledge the need to continue for a while longer stern measures to guard our achievement of full employment. If we were now to relax our restraint and to seek to distribute our hardly earned and essential surplus by way of tax remissions we should be like those bees, which seeing the honey stored in their hive for the winter, gave up their work and indulged themselves upon their apparent but much needed surplus, with fatal results in the ensuing cold weather. We have, by our increased production, earned and obtained not only a higher level of real earnings, but also greatly extended social services and benefits. It is indeed conspicuously in that form that we have, so far, received the major dividend of our successful labours.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1950-04-18a.79.4" colnum="79" time="">
<p>So long as we can maintain full employment by whatever measures are from time to time necessary, including the attainment this year of a large Budget surplus above the line we shall at least

know that our National production is at its highest possible, and that we are all sharing in such standards of living as we are able to afford by reason of that National production. We shall also have the satisfaction of knowing that we have succeeded, by our planning, in practically eliminating that most undeserved suffering of our people, long-term unemployment which we tolerated so often and for such long periods in the years before the war.</p>

<p>Such changes as we can make this year through the Budget without endangering our fundamental objectives will be in the right direction, and these together with the increase in expenditure on social service and social benefits, and in earnings by way of wages and salaries which accompany increased production, will mark another small but well defined step forward in the direction of more equal and higher general standards of living and towards that greater happiness and contentment of our people that is our aim.</p>

<p>As the Chancellor remarked at the opening of his survey, for the last three years we have pursued this practice of discussing in one and the same Debate, both the Economic Survey and the opening of the Budget for the year. I am inclined to think that that has certain quite definite advantages from the point of view both of the Government and of the Opposition; but it also has certain physical disadvantages. The Chancellor speaks&#x2014;and I make no complaint in view of all the ground he had to cover&#x2014;for something like 2i hours, after which the Committee's&#x2014;I will not say capacity or intelligence, because I am sure that is unlimited in time or strength, but at any rate the Committee's desire to listen to prolonged arguments is somewhat exhausted. After consultation with my colleagues, I think it will be our wiser course this afternoon to consider what the Chancellor has had to say and to make our considered comments upon it in the next day or two.<br/>
I want to make only two observations now. The first is that we would give a general welcome to the reduction of taxation on overtime, a welcome none the less sincere because we have advocated it ourselves. We also agree that that can be regarded not only as assistance to the individuals themselves but as assistance to industry. Therefore, it is to be welcomed. The other preliminary observation I want to make is that we are glad that the Chancellor has not repeated last year's complete exclusion of the Purchase Tax from our discussions. As I understand it, there is not even a partial exclusion&#x2014;U-10N. MEMBERS "There is."1 If there is it is a partial exclusion which we hope will not unduly handicap us in our discussions. That matter can be further probed in due course.<br/>
I conclude by saying to the Chancellor what he knows, that his performance was of a lucidity which we always associate with him. If what he had to tell us was less to our taste, it certainly lacked nothing in the manner in which he presented it.</p>

Eight hundred years ago, when the hamlet of Kersal in the township of Broughton, which now forms part of the City of Salford, was handed over as a gift to the Cluniac monastary of Lenton, near Nottingham, the most important part of the gift was the fishing rights in the river Irwell. Even in the 18th century the salmon rights in the rivers of Lancashire were let every year for many hundreds of pounds. Today I am afraid that fish in most of those rivers are virtually extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange Station and looks down at the noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the "Manchester Guardian" has so rightly called that "melancholy stream."<br/>
Yet, Sir, from many points of view we should all be proud of the River Irwell. It is the hardest working river in the whole of the United Kingdom. On the 50-mile stretch of the River Irwell and its main tributary, the Roach, stand more than 100 cotton mills, in addition to a large number of other industrial undertakings&#x2014;slipper factories, bleach works, coal mines, tanneries, paper mills and gas works. I think it is true to say that no other inland river has made a greater contribution to the industrial greatness of this country.<br/>
Unfortunately, however, the amenity value of the River Irwell is practically negligible, although there are parts of the Irwell Valley which from the point of view of beauty, could compare with almost anything in North Wales. But, so far as I know, the only amenity value of

the Irwell at present is the fact that the Agecroft Rowing Club in the City of Salford still use the Irwell for rowing and, I believe, continue to hold an annual regatta. I know of no other amenity value of this river. It is of no use to agriculture because the water is too full of impurities for livestock to benefit from it. There is no fishing in the Irwell for reasons that I shall come to in a moment. Swimming is completely out of the question, and even walking along its wooded banks is spoiled by the condition of the water. In a letter to me a constituent said:
<q> The only real pleasure that the River Irwell can give in this part of the world is the music of water running over the stones, but such is the odour at times that you cannot get near enough even to enjoy this.</q>
Hon. Members who were in the last Parliament will remember that I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society by Mr. H. D. Turing. When the first of these reports appeared, I wrote to the Society and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says:
<q>The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal.</q>
The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is:
<q> There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold.</q>
The full importance of that statement will be realised when I remind hon. Members of the frequency with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell.<br/>
From the report of the British Field Sports Society, it emerges that there are


three main sources of pollution&#x2014;the paper mills, the dyers and the tanneries. I appreciate that all these undertakings have been labouring under very great difficulties. For example, the paper mills, during and since the war, have had to make do with straw for pulping when they would sooner have been using esparto grass or the wood which they used to use before the war. I am afraid that there may be very little hope of reverting to the use of esparto grass and wood in any quantities during the next few months or even years. The difficulty is that straw requires a much greater degree of caustic soda for pulping purposes than either of the other raw materials. The result is that the caustic flows in great quantities into the river, causing, in Mr. Turing's words:
<q>a gruesome-looking foam to cover the surface, killing off any life which may by chance be trying to establish itself, and stultifying the effects of attempts to purify other effluents.</q>
Perhaps I can give an example along these lines. It is, I believe, the practice of manufacturers who have works along the Irwell&#x2014;if they take water direct from the river for feeding their boilers&#x2014;to introduce water softeners in order to counteract the effects of the natural hardness of the water. I know of one undertaking where it is frequently unnecessary to introduce water softeners because the water is so heavily impregnated with caustic soda from paper mills nearly two miles up stream.<br/>
The dyers, too, are faced with serious problems. I think hon. Members will appreciate that if a dyer succeeds in getting a really fast dye which will not wash out of cloth, it is extremely difficult to remove it from the spent dye which goes out of the works in the form of an effluent. The consequence is that every day literally millions of gallons of grotesquely coloured fluid, often with a transparency of less than one inch, are discharged into the Irwell or its tributaries. I know of one dye works&#x2014;not by any means one of the biggest&#x2014;which uses 1,250,000 gallons every day, all of which is discharged into the river in the form of an effluent. The result is that at different times of the day the Irwell may be all the colours of the rainbow. On 2nd November, for example, the chairman of the general purpose committee of the Bacup Corporation, reporting to his council on what he called the "increasing pollution of the

river," said that at 8 o'clock that morning the river was a vivid orange colour, with suds rising 18 inches high on the water, and that by noon it had changed to an intense black.<br/>
I do not want to give the impression that this is a new problem, or that nothing is being done about it. In fact, it is an extremely long-standing problem and, in spite of what I have said, substantial progress has been made. Even within living memory, the scum on the Irwell was so thick at times that birds could be seen walking on it. The work done since then, however, has produced some results. I should like, particularly, to pay tribute to the work of Dr. Southgate, the Director of Water Pollution Research at the Water Pollution Research Laboratories at Watford and also to the Lancashire Rivers Board, who have tackled this problem with great keenness and zeal. 1 think that the hon. Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. W. Fletcher) will agree that the Lancashire Rivers Board have been doing extremely good work. I am glad to see the hon. Gentleman in his place, because I discovered the other day that it was one of his predecessors, Mr. John Kenyon, Member for Bury, who in 1899 moved the rejection of the Rivers Pollution Prevention Bill and succeeded in getting it talked out. I am hoping that the hon. Gentleman will do something tonight to make up for the error of his predecessor.<br/>
We have, in fact, in Lancashire enjoyed various powers in this matter denied to other parts of the country. The Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee Act of 1892 was in many ways a model of its kind, and that Act, together with the Lancashire County Council (Rivers Board and General Purposes) Act of 1938 gave the Lancashire Rivers Board powers not possessed in any other industrial area outside the West Riding of Yorkshire. I believe that the Board have been making as full use of those powers as is practicable under present conditions. I certainly believe that the local authorities and the industrialists in the area are unanimous in praising the Lancashire Rivers Board for the efficient and speedy way in which they have tackled their herculean task. Nor do I complain of the manufacturers in the area. I believe that the needs of the nation have made it necessary for them to do various things which it might


have been possible to avoid under easier circumstances. Far be it from me to propose placing upon them heavier burdens than those which they bear at present.<br/>
I am not suggesting that this is an easy problem, and I am not claiming that I have any solution for it tonight. If all the trade effluents in the area were discharged straight into the sewers, there would be precious little river left over long stretches. If, on the other hand, we adopted the "closed circuit" system, by which each undertaking purifies its own water and uses it over and over again, that would be very desirable if it could be done. Unfortunately it is impracticable in many cases, and would, I am afraid, place a heavy financial burden on industry which it would be difficult to justify in the economic circumstances of today.<br/>
Indeed, I do not believe that we can hope for any very radical measures under present conditions, but I raise the problem tonight because I want to focus attention upon it, and I hope that, as a result of this Debate, some manufacturers will be encouraged to make that little extra effort in dealing with effluent which may make all the difference between the River Irwell being a dirty river and being the disgracefully dirty river which it is at present. The advantages to the manufacturers themselves would be not inconsiderable if that could be done.<br/>
At present, we are in a period of transition. The excellent Lancashire Rivers Board are to give way shortly to a new board, the Mersey River Board, which is being set up under the River Boards Act of 1948. I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary tonight when that Board will be set up, when it will be in operation, and what more effective contribution it will be able to make towards coping with this problem than its predecessor has made. Are we at last to have a standard of water purity laid down as suggested in the Hobday Report? I hope he will tell us whether his Ministry, in co-operation with industry and with the River Boards, has any concrete plan, practicable under present circumstances, for restoring to our rivers some of their original beauty.<br/>
I will conclude by quoting from a leading article in the "Bury Times" of a year ago:

<q>It is time the public conscience was roused and a check put to the practice of turning our rivers into open sewers. It is time, too, that a more determined and scientific approach to the problem of industrial effluents was made. Dirty and filthy rivers in which all natural life has been killed should no longer be tolerated. Given the will, a much more successful effort could be made to clean our streams and rivers, and industry, the River Boards and the Government must get together to devise a plan.</q></p>

<p>I think that a great public service has been done by the hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) in raising this point. He has put forward the facts with fairness and accuracy, and though, in the same way as myself, he is not able to suggest an immediate practical solution, nevertheless, it is a very good thing to bring the matter forward, even if the moment is one when we have not a crowded House to listen to us.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman pointed out that I represent the constituency&#x2014;although he only mentioned Bury&#x2014;which has a direct interest in this matter. I would remind him that the constituency is Bury and Radcliffe, he having kindly handed over half his previous constituency which, from his point of view, I now misrepresent. I should like to add that while it is perfectly right to try to bring this matter forward with the idea that action should be taken in every possible way, we must not let ourselves slide into an attitude of wishful thinking with the idea that we can do very much to restore the Irwell and its tributaries to what they were before.<br/>
The hon. Member for Rossendale has referred in rather surprising terms to the British Field Sports Society and the benefit he received from the advice given by somebody there. But if his mind is in a state of change about blood sports he might remember that when the Irwell was a pleasant stream for fishing and boating and bathing there were also foxhounds and beagles who practised their wickedness there along its banks. Today the only real trouble the local hounds have is to learn the difference between red and green lights.<br/>
The river Irwell has been described to me as "no longer a river but a drain."</p>

<p>A drain&#x2014;I select my own word. With the greater care now taken by industry&#x2014;and on which a very watchful eye must be kept&#x2014;in an area where streams running into the Irwell cause great pollution before they come near the boroughs of Bury and Radcliffe and where single industries on streams running into the Irwell, some in the hon. Member for Rossendale's own constituency, cause much pollution, no easy remedy exists. In an area where industry is urged to greater production and efficiency the chances of making the Irwell anything but part of the industrial machine are practically nil.<br/>
It may well be that action that can be taken here will be a useful warning for other parts of the country where rivers have not got into the advanced and awful state that the Irwell is in now. I do not think it is wise to be very optimistic and to think that very much can be done to restore the Irwell and to make it a pleasant stream in any way at all. If something can be done, industry undoubtedly will lend a hand and the local industrialists and Chamber of Commerce are extremely keen to help. If industry will co-operate with the successor to the Lancashire River Board there is possibly a chance, not that we shall notably improve the waters of the Irwell or the Roach, but that we shall show to authorities concerned with rivers not yet in that advanced state of pollution, the best way of preserving in something like decency a stream which must essentially serve industrial purposes. There are many of these streams in the country.<br/>
I hope the Minister will realise that all those responsible for these areas are at one in wishing to arrest or even to mitigate the terrible pollution that has taken place. I hope an effort will be made to improve the position and above all to set an example of what can be done in other streams. I have not found in my division a voice raised against such an effort. I have found great willingness to co-operate in every possible way, bearing in mind that industrial efficiency and maximum output unfortunately must take precedence over the amenity value of the Irwell.</p>

<p>I speak as one who, with the exception of perhaps

one hon. Member, lives as near to the Irwell as anybody in this House. We have listened to a carefully designed Budget Speech which stated that we must increase production, and I am one of those simple fellows who believe that to secure that production one must have a sane and satisfied atmosphere in the workshops. I speak on behalf of those disciples of angling who get enormous pleasure from a few hours of fishing. I know of nothing more relaxing or more calculated to take one away from the turmoil of this House than fishing. This Debate will have been of value if it does nothing more than to draw the attention of the Minister to this question of ensuring that the rivers of Lancashire where fishing is followed, are not allowed to get into the same condition as the Irwell.<br/>
With the growth of industry there has been a great increase in the disposal of effluent. Leather, paper and other industries have had to find an outlet for their effluent and the River Irwell has become an industrial sewer. As a result we do not see on the River Irwell what is to be found on the River Weaver where, the Minister if he goes there at the opening of the angling season, will find thousands of good honest British workmen enjoying a little repose not 30 miles from the Irwell.<br/>
I hope that everything possible will be done in the future to safeguard the amenities of rivers of this kind, where working men can have the form of sport they enjoy most, just as some hon. Members opposite can rent at high prices reaches of salmon rivers in the North of Scotland. I hope that as a result of this Debate no rivers will be allowed to get into worse condition, and that the Irwell will receive more attention. I should like to compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) for raising this matter on behalf of working men who derive enormous enjoyment from fishing, to the benefit of their industrial production.</p>

<p>Like the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Jack Jones) I join in the Debate because I am a fisherman, and I want to see the sport of fishing distributed as widely as possible. I know that the pollution of many of these rivers in industrial areas is preventing a great number of people


who might enjoy that sport from doing so. I am glad indeed that the hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) has brought up this matter with regard to the River Irwell. As an officer of the British Field Sports Society I should like also to thank him for the complimentary remarks he made regarding the work of the society in trying to prevent this pollution.<br/>
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. W. Fletcher) has left the House, because I should like to emphasise exactly what the society have done in this matter. My hon. Friend said he thought the hon. Member for Rossendale had obtained the benefit of advice from the British Field Sports Society. Actually, of course, the society has spent a great deal of money in recent years in having surveys made of these rivers and letting people know what a tremendous amount of harm was done in this way during the industrial revolution and what a tremendous amount of pleasure is now being denied to fishermen in industrial areas.<br/>
I feel that my hon. Friend was rather defeatist in this matter. I see no reason why we should submit to the managers of these factories doing what they like. In many cases that is the position. In my constituency I heard only this morning of a case where the County Medical Officer of Health had been trying for some time to persuade a man with a small factory to do something about the effluent. He had just stuck his toes in and said that he did not see any reason why he should do anything, since there was no legislation to make him do it. I know that we cannot discuss legislation now, but I think I should be in Order in saying that I recollect that in the last Parliament we passed an Act which consolidated existing legislation relating to pollution. Many of us have been looking forward to some other Act which will further widen the powers of local authorities and others in this respect.<br/>
This question of pollution does not affect just one river. There are many rivers all over the country which are affected, and the survey of the British Field Sports Society has made this known to the public. I believe the public conscience is now being roused. I am glad that this matter has been raised, and I

give my full support to anything that can be done to try and put it right. I am certain that a great many people in the industrial areas have been denied a great deal of pleasure, and as a fisherman, I also very much regret the state of this river.</p>

<p>I apologise for intervening in this Debate when Members may desire to bring business to an earlier conclusion than usual, but I have a better qualification for speaking about this matter than most other Members because for many years I lived on the banks of the Irwell. I have had a closer experience of the Irwell than even my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) has had. I fell into it. Indeed, I fell into it in days when the water was infinitely worse than it is now, when it was absolutely black and when the stink of it was different from all other stinks which have ever been experienced by man.</p>

<p>Yes, I have been there lately. That is one of the points I want to make, that things are now much better than they were in days gone by. I remember, too, that when I fell in I was a prominent worker in the local Band of Hope. The amount of water that I was able to partake of on that occasion&#x2014;it was not the pure water which we sang about in the Band of Hope&#x2014;still leaves a reminder of the dreadful things that the mill owners in my hon. Friend's constituency and the constituency of the hon. Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. W. Fletcher) did to the Irwell in those days. Some of them are still prepared to do so.<br/>
I am a little disappointed by my hon. Friend's speech. He spoke too excusingly of the difficulties of the local manufacturers in this connection. The Irwell joins the Mersey near where my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Jack Jones) now lives, and it used to pollute the Manchester Ship Canal. In the Manchester Ship Canal just after the Irwell had entered into it, was the effluent of the Manchester Corporation's sewage works. For many years the local council of the area where I live complained that when night came the Manchester


Corporation turned their crude sewage into the Manchester Ship Canal. I understand that that has now ceased. The Manchester Corporation has had to make very expensive arrangements for dealing properly with the sewage so that it does not cause a nuisance as the constituents of my hon. Friend do.<br/>
I was appalled at the intervention of the hon. Member for Bury and Radcliffe. He ought to be as keen on improving the Irwell as those of us who live on its banks lower down. I was appalled at the readiness with which he suggested that this stream was bound to continue to be the defective thing that it has been. The River Weaver is another tributary of the Mersey, and it might be just as bad as the Irwell but for the care that has been taken, at any rate in the middle reaches of that stream, by industrialists who have their works on its banks.<br/>
I do not know what steps can be taken but I hope that greater attention will be paid to this matter. I hope steps can be taken by regulation, and better still by education and appeal, to get the industrialists in the upper parts of the Irwell, round Rochdale, Oldham and up to Irwell Springs, to save the waters of this stream from the pollution that has for so long been practised there. Irwell Springs is a lovely name; it is the only part of the Irwell where there is a little pure water still running. The river is not allowed to run more than about a mile before the pollution begins.<br/>
I admit that a matter like this cannot be put right in a day or two, but action should now be taken. I am a fisherman, although I never hope to see fish in the Irwell. I should think the fishes' memory of what the Irwell has been like during all the time that I have known it, will for ever discourage any poor fish from swimming into the Irwell again. If, however, the fish can go back there it will be something to be thankful for. The people who have lived on the banks of the Irwell will also be grateful because they are so sick of the pollution and stink of that poor stream.</p>

<p>I make no apology for intervening in this Debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) on raising this question. I do not agree

that there has been the improvement which it has been suggested has taken place in recent years. I am sure that a great deal more could have been done. I am not an angler, although I have every respect for anglers; but I think this House should be more concerned with the health of the people. Three years ago, when there was a serious flood which ruined hundreds of houses and furniture, the damage was done not by clean water but by filth from the river and its bed.<br/>
If hon. Members were compelled to live next to the River Irwell, something would have been done many years ago; but because these are only working-class people, little or no attempt has been made by the Government to tackle the question at all. In fact, when the flood took place and damage to the extent of &#x00A3;500,000 was done, the Government were approached, but all we got was sympathy Of coarse, sympathy is like gravy without the meat. We had to appeal to the Lord Mayor of London's Fund to enable us to compensate or rehabilitate some of those people &#x2014;to restore them to their houses with the utility furniture available at that time.<br/>
If steps were now taken by the Government, I feel sure that they would eliminate the fear which exists in the minds of the people who are compelled to live in that area. The River Irwell has been a music-hall joke for many years&#x2014;as black as ink and filthy. The filth has been responsible for creating a lot of disease. Negotiations have been going on for a considerable time between the catchment board and the local authorities in the area, but the improvement scheme has been abandoned because the Government are not prepared to say what grant they will make towards it.<br/>
I hope the Minister will give us some definite information tonight about the steps which the Government propose to take in order to try to prevent the recurrence of the flooding which took place three years ago. The people who are compelled to live in this industrial area are very seriously disturbed. We can imagine the position after a day like yesterday in Manchester, Salford and other districts around there. I do not want to make it appear that Manchester gets all the rain and that Salford gets none. There was incessant rain from five o'clock in the morning yesterday until late in the evening, and one can imagine


the fear and dread which exist in the minds of people compelled to live in that area when they see a day like that. If the river were as clean as it ought to be or as it may have been many years ago, that fear and dread would not exist.<br/>
As a representative of this area, and one who has lived in it all his life, I believe the inhabitants will expect me to congratulate the hon. Member for Rossendale who raised the subject. We have been hoping for some considerable time that something definite would be done by the Government. I sincerely trust that they will make up their minds to make these people feel happier&#x2014;or, if they cannot make them feel happy&#x2014;make them more comfortable in the knowledge that the Government will deal with this serious question of the River Irwell.</p>

<p>I think we are all very grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) for raising this subject this evening and also for the wide variety of experiences which have been related by other hon. Members&#x2014;experiences which went as far as that of the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. J. Hudson) and his trial by immersion. It has been suggested to me that some of his well-known views might have suffered a change as a result of his experience of water on that occasion but, as he rightly says, the water was not the sort of water in which he and others are interested.<br/>
This is, indeed, a serious subject, and it is of the greatest importance that we should give every possible consideration to ways in which we can alleviate the difficulties which arise from the particularly hideous condition of the Irwell. I believe that all those who are in any way concerned with this problem realise that it must inevitably need a long-term policy to achieve any striking improvements to this river. There is no doubt that we can do more in connection with rivers which have not yet reached the state of the Irwell, but that does not mean that we ought not to do what we can for the Irwell itself.<br/>
I want to say a word or two about the action which has already been taken and which will, I hope, continue to be taken

in the future. I should dike to pay a compliment to the old committee, the Mersey and Irwell Joint Pollution Committee, who did some very valuable work before the war&#x2014;so much so that it could fairly be said that at the outbreak of the war the river was in a much better condition than had been the case for some considerable time previously. It may be that that is not saying very much, but at any rate the committee did make real progress and showed that it was possible to make improvements.<br/>
Unhappily, during the war and since, the conditions have deteriorated, partly because of the new factories which have been established on the side of the river and partly because of shortages of material, some of which were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale. The main problem is, of course, that of the use of straw pulp for paper manufacture. That is, perhaps, the most important single item of all the many contributory factors&#x2014;and there are many contributory factors. I believe there are some 210 trade premises which have discharged their effluents into the River Irwell by the time it reaches the Manchester Ship Canal, and there is also the effluent from some 54 sewage disposal works, although it may be true that the effluent from the sewage disposal works is pure by comparison with some of the trade effluents.<br/>
The problem is, what can be done, in particular, about the effluent from paper mills what can be done to try to remove the excess soda in the effluent from these mills? Some mills have already installed recovery plants, and both my own Ministry and the Board of Trade are interested that this should be done. The recovery of caustic soda can be of value and we shall certainly encourage in every way possible the use of these plants. We have to face the fact, however, that their installation is expensive, and naturally the mill owners themselves have wanted to know how long they are likely to go on using the straw pulp, which is a substitute for the wood pulp they used previously. As far as we can see, they are likely to go on using it for some time, and the advice we have been given from those who made a very careful survey of the position suggests that, on economy grounds, there may indeed be a need for a further use of straw pulp. We have, therefore, discussed this matter with the Board of Trade and


we shall see that, before any fresh straw pulp apparatus is installed in any of the factories or in new factories, full consideration is given to methods of recovery of caustic soda.<br/>
The question of other trade premises which discharge their effluent into the river has also been raised this evening, although none is quite so serious as that of straw pulp. Further, the local authorities in the area are considering in what way their sewage disposal works can be improved and whether or not a regional scheme for sewage disposal could be developed. Again, this is inevitably a long-term problem; the solution will take some time to develop, as well as being expensive, but I have no doubt that if it were possible it would be of great advantage to the area. Reference has also been made to the Water Pollution Research Board who have done, and are doing, some valuable research work. They are trying to see whether there is any less expensive way of recovering soda which might help us in tackling that side of the problem.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member tor Rossendale said, we are in process of setting up a new river board, as we are in the process of setting up new boards throughout the country, under the new Act. I believe that today the Order has been made defining the area of this new river board. The area of the board will include the Mersey and its tributaries&#x2014;the Irwell and other tributaries of the Mersey. One of the first problems it will have to tackle will be this very serious problem of pollution here and in the other streams. It will take some time to establish this new board, because the full statutory procedure has to be gone through and a further draft Order has to be made for the constitution of the board itself. It will not directly affect the powers because, as my hon. Friend said, there are wider powers already in existence in that area than in most other

areas of the country; but it should be possible for the new board to give perhaps rather closer attention to the problem than was possible in the past.<br/>
I should mention the fact that the new river boards will take over the functions of fishery boards. I do not think we can be optimistic enough to hope we can provide for the two hon. Gentlemen who spoke about fishing and the point of view of anglers any catches&#x2014;or any that they would value&#x2014;in the river Irwell in either the near or long-distant future. However, we do, of course, take account of those interests in setting up the new river boards, and in considering what action can be taken to preserve other rivers from the sort of difficulties that have arisen here.<br/>
I can say, therefore, that we are giving continual consideration to ways in which we can lay down reasonable standards for rivers. Obviously this is not a matter I can go into fully tonight because it would undoubtedly require legislation, but we are considering the report which has been submitted by the sub-committee of the Central Advisory Water Committee which has made a series of very interesting and helpful suggestions for the future, some of which would not necessarily require legislation to carry through. My hon. Friends and all others who have shown interest in the subject can be assured that we are very anxious on our part to do everything we can to assist in dealing with this problem, remembering all the time the essential economic conditions in which we are working. It is for that reason that I cannot offer an early hope to my hon. Friend, but with the co-operation of the new board and the authorities I am sure some improvement can be made eventually and that deterioration in our rivers can be prevented.</p>
