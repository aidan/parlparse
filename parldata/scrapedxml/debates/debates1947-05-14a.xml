<p>On the first part of this Question I am unable to add to the reply which I gave to the hon. Member's Question on 5th February. The future organisation and functions of the R.N.R. are still under active consideration.<br/>
As regards the second part of the Question, the number of National Service entrants required for the Navy is limited. The automatic acceptance of all fishermen for the Navy might therefore result in the exclusion of some men from other walks of life who have higher qualifications for training in the Navy's technical work. I regret, therefore, that I am unable to give the assurance asked for by the hon. Member.

<p>asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty whether his attention has been drawn to the speech of Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth Command, on 8th May, 1947, in which he stated that the Royal Navy does not like conscription, but it is the Government of the day that ordered it; and, as this speech was not in conformity with Subsection (2) of paragraph 17 of King's Regulations for the Naval Forces, what action he proposes to take.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1475.5" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Dugdale" colnum="1475" time="">
<p>The speech to which the hon. and gallant Member refers was made to the ship's company and to the cadets of H.M.S. "Frobisher." The published version was not a verbatim report, but Admiral Layton does not dispute its general accuracy. He has informed my noble Friend that the main point he desired to make was that a national service system involved the entry into the Royal Navy of a certain number of men who, because of the shortness of their service, have not the same interest in Naval life as the long service men to which the Royal Navy has been accustomed in the past and who do not settle down so well; for that reason special efforts are required on the part of officers and men to fit them into the general scheme. Admiral Layton did not intend to criticise Admiralty and Government policy in the continuance of national service as being essential under present conditions and made it clear that it was

incumbent on all concerned to carry out that policy.<br/>
My noble Friend has accepted the Admiral's explanation, though he has considered it correct to explain to him that his statement was unfortunate and it would have been better had it not been made. He does not regard the occasion, however, as one calling for disciplinary action under Article 17 (ii) of King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions.</p>

<p>I cannot accept that altogether. I think a statement which said that a certain section of national service men or conscripts regarded the Navy as their enemy, looked on it as a nuisance, made themselves a nuisance to the officers and chief petty officers, and spent much of their time in detention quarters, is not a statement that ought to have been made. The fact that, following on that, he then said that the orders of the Government would be obeyed


implicitly, does not alter the first part of his statement, and it is that to which exception has been taken.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Air whether he will publish in


the OFFICIAL REPORT a statement of the total number of enemy aircraft shot down during the Battle of Britain, according to contemporary R.A.F. estimates and German official records, respectively; and whether he will give the figures for the biggest days of the battle.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, I will circulate in the OFFICIAL REPORT the statement for which the hon. Member has asked showing the number of enemy aircraft which the R.A.F. claimed at the time to have been destroyed during the Battle of Britain, and the actual losses recorded by the German High Command. Between 10th July, when the action began, and 31st October, when the Germans broke it off, the R.A.F. estimated that 2,692 enemy aircraft had been destroyed. The German records show that, in fact, 2,376 of their aircraft had been put out of action; of these, 1,733 were destroyed and 643 were damaged. The figures I am circulating show that during the opening and concluding phases of the battle, while the numbers engaged were relatively small, and the fighting less continuous and intense, the losses actually inflicted on the enemy were higher than the numbers claimed by the R.A.F. When very large forces were in action, and when the battle raged without respite for many days, the estimates were well above the losses which the Luftwaffe sustained.<br/>
I am sure the House will agree that this retrospective correction of claims which were honestly put forward, does nothing to diminish the achievements or to dim the glory of the men who fought so bravely against great odds. As the Chief of the German General Staff in the West said in a confidential lecture in November, 1943, the German Army could not invade England until the British Air Arm had been completely beaten; and this, he said, "we were not able to do." There is abundant confirmation of this spontaneous statement in the German records; they show that Hitler's High Command fully recognised that the R.A.F. had inflicted a decisive defeat on their forces, and that, in consequence, their plan for the invasion of Britain could not even be launched, although a great army had been assembled and had been waiting for many days. Looking back to 1940, it is impossible to

doubt that one of the decisive battles of history had been won.</p>

<p>Corporal Nicholson is due for release from the R.A.F., and it seemed unlikely, therefore, that he could complete his studies before the time arrived for his repatriation. It is true


that he applied a few months ago to remain in the Service under the Bounty Scheme, but he could not then be accepted because he had not served for the minimum period of two years that the scheme required. He has now finished his two years' service, and has applied again. If, as I hope, his application is approved, he can then complete his studies and take his examination. I am glad to assure the hon.

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Air, why H.Q. Flying Training Command's order FTC/67462/4/P of 12th February, 1947, has been rescinded; and whether he is aware of the inequity of debasing the release status of U/T and now redundant aircrews to that of A.C.2s.</p>

<p>The order issued on 12th February by Flying Training Command was unfortunately wrong. By an unhappy confusion, it applied the principles laid down for the release of redundant qualified aircrew to redundant unqualified aircrew cadets. The order was cancelled on 6th March, but I am afraid it had already caused misunderstanding and disappointment, which I much regret. The hon. Member will no doubt

recall that shortly after V.E. Day, unqualified aircrew were released from further liability for aircrew training, and were remustered in ground trades. Cadets who were in this category are released from their new trade not according to rank, but on the age and service principle. I hope the hon. Member may agree that this is the fairest plan.</p>

<p>Before the war, there were no breaks for tea at R.A.F. maintenance units. During the war, when long hours were being worked, informal breaks were, in practice, allowed, although no official recognition was ever given. On 3rd April last, an Air Ministry order provided that there should be two ten-minute breaks, one in the morning, and the other in the afternoon. This applied in Air Ministry establishments an arrangement which had previously been made for Ministry of Supply establishments by the Ministry of Supply Joint Industrial Council. All Air Ministry industrial workers are invited to make suggestions for improving the efficiency of their work, through their local Whitley Works Committees or Production Committees, in which both the staff side and the trade unions play a part.</p>

<p>There is no secrecy at all in regard to the system. Priorities are necessary because of the demand and the

small capacity with which to meet it. Where there is a person of higher priority, it is virtually a necessity of the priority system that another person shall stand down. Priority I relates to the diplomatic standard&#x2014;Ministers or foreign Ministers&#x2014;and there are very few; priority 2 refers to persons travelling for the export trade and other work of high national importance; and priority 3 is of lesser importance. Those priorities are determined by the sponsoring Departments.</p>

<p>The present position is that Regular engagements in the Army are confined, as they were before the war, to British subjects of pure European descent.

<p>This Amendment was moved by the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General at a late hour last night, and, in consequence, the report of what he said in moving it is not available for consideration by Members of the House. Therefore, in dealing with his arguments, I have to rely upon my recollection of what he said, without any opportunity of verifying it. As the Parliamentary Secretary said, in one of his rare utterances, in the Standing Committee when this matter was discussed:
<q>This matter is invested with some importance."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, Standing Committee D, 1st April, 1947; c. 976.]</q>
I think that, in fact, the hon. Gentleman understated the importance of the subject. The object of the Amendment, as I understand it, is to alter the existing law with regard to the holding of local inquiries.</p>

<p>I see the right hon. and learned Gentleman shakes his head, but not very long ago he sought to summarise the existing law on this subject&#x2014;a law which, in my opinion, has not been altered materially by recent decisions. He said in the Standing Committee&#x2014;and I think he is right:
<q>Under the law as it stands &#x2026; there may be discussions before any objections have been lodged with any local authority or, indeed, with any other body or person whom the Minister may think it convenient to consult.</q>
That is not challenged; that is not in issue. He went on to say:
<q>Then comes the stage when there is an objection. At that stage there must be no consultation by the Minister with one side in the absence of the other side; nor must there be any consultation between the Minister, after the inquiry and before a decision has been reached, with one side in the absence of the other side."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL. REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D;</i> 1st April, 1947, c. 990.]</q>
That was the statement of the right hon. and learned Gentleman in the Standing Committee when this question was considered. Now we have to consider an Amendment which provides that, after the holding of a local inquiry, and after the hearing of objections in public, the Minister shall have the right of consulting whom he likes, in secret, without being under any obligation to inform anyone affected of the nature of these decisions. I can well imagine what an uproar there would be in this House if the Government introduced a proposal that a judge, after hearing the evidence in a case, should have the right, by Statute, of consulting whom he liked upon the matter. I, of course, concede that the position of the Minister under this Bill is not exactly the same as the position of a judge, but the Minister has to exercise quasi-judicial functions, and he has to act impartially and fairly. I do not regard it as acting fairly or impartially if, with regard to a particular objection, after that objection is heard, the Minister is at liberty to consult whoever he pleases without any notice to the person making the objection.<br/>
Let me illustrate what might happen it this Amendment were carried. Suppose that the local planning authority wants to include within an area designated as subject to compulsory purchase, a farm on the fringe of the area, or a market garden on the edge of a town. Suppose that the


owner of the market garden or farm objects to designation, as he may well do, in the interests of food production or for a variety of reasons. The next stage may be a local public inquiry where the objector can put forward his arguments and objections, and where those objections can be tested. The right hon. Gentleman is then seeking power to go behind the back of that farmer or market gardener. after an inquiry, and consult whom he likes before making his decision on the particular issue, in this hypothetical case as to whether this particular farm should be or should not be included in the designated area. In my view, that is entirely wrong.<br/>
I recognise that when a big area is the subject of a development plan it is too much to ask, where any inquiry takes place and where any consultation takes place after the inquiry, that all those who objected and all those interested in the plan as a whole should be informed about it. That may be asking too much, but at least it is reasonable and sensible that the person particularly' affected, the particular individual&#x2014;the farmer in the case I have mentioned&#x2014;should be informed of two things if the Minister wants to have further information about that particular objection after the inquiry is closed, and without reopening the inquiry, which it is always within his power to do. One thing is, that individual ought to be told who is being consulted, and he ought to be told the point on which that consultation is taking place, for this reason: it will then be open to that particular objector to submit to the Minister further observations dealing with that particular point. It that is not provided, it may well be that the decision of the Minister will be influenced one way by information obtained by him as a result of a consultation with an external body&#x2014;information which may be inaccurate, to which the objector may have a complete answer, and without the Minister being informed at ail of what that answer is.<br/>
I suggest that this really is an astonishing proposal. We had a full discussion upon it in Standing Committee, and I rather anticipated from the course of that discussion that, although the right hon. Gentleman might seek to preserve for himself the right of consultation after holding a local inquiry, it would be subject to the

express proviso that in the case where that consultation affected a particular interest, a particular objector, that objector should be informed of the nature of the persons being consulted, and the matter upon which they were being consulted. I hope this matter will be further considered. Unless we can receive a satisfactory assurance upon that point, I am afraid that the limited time of this Report stage will have to be further occupied by a Division upon this extremely important matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1512.0" hansard_membership_id="10122" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21830" speakername="Mr. Derek Walker-Smith" colnum="1512" time="">
<p>As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham Buller) said said, this matter did receive a good deal of discussion in Standing Committee. Of course, that was discussion on a different form of words, and this is the first time that the particular form of words of the Amendment which the learned Attorney-General moved late last night has been under discussion. When this matter was discussed in Standing Committee we on this side of the House made our position clear; and I think I can say with confidence that we are all inexpressibly disappointed that the cogitations of the Minister and of his consultation with the Attorney-General upon these matters has led to so disappointing an Amendment as that which is now under discussion.<br/>
It is, I think, not without significance that the hon. Member for the Drake Division of Plymouth (Mr. Medland)&#x2014;whom I am glad to see in his place today&#x2014;said to the Attorney-General:
<q>Until I can be assured that the final word rests with the Minister, who is responsible to the House of Commons, I do not propose to accept the agreement, or whatever it may be, which has been come to this morning."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D,</i> 1st April, 1947: c. 998.]</q>
&#x2014;talking, to the Minister if I may say so, very much in the way in which the hon. Member for East Coventry (Mr. Crossman) talks to the Minister of Defence. Indeed, the result runs true to form, because what the Attorney-General has now done is to import into the words of his Amendment precisely those words which will make clear that there is power to do the very thing that was doubtful before, and against which we expressed such strong objection.<br/>
What this Amendment will do is, expressly to enable consultation to take


place with local authorities or persons behind closed doors, without publicity, after the holding of a local inquiry. That is the position with which we are faced on this Amendment if it is accepted. In Standing Committee the Attorney-General said that he did not like references to natural justice, and I will indulge him so far as to avoid reference to natural justice; however, I cannot but say that consultation with certain parties to an inquiry and not with others, after the inquiry is concluded, and in secret, is a gross violation of all the elementary decencies of judicial procedure. We made it clear in Committee that we did not object to the Minister having consultation before the inquiry, because we could see that there might be occasions on which that might be necessary; and we made it clear that we did not object so much to consultation during the inquiry, although we consider that that would normally be unnecessary and undesirable. But we made it clear that we do object, very strongly indeed, to consultation after inquiry, in the way that is now suggested.<br/>
The Attorney-General gave an undertaking that the whole matter would be considered in the light, amongst other things, of the representations that had been put forward by hon. Members in the course of the discussion in Committee. His method of taking our representations into account is, to say the least, an unhappy one, because his method is to introduce provisions expressly legislating for the very things to which we principally took objection. I think the right hon. and learned Gentleman must found his technique of conciliation on that practised by Rehoboam in the Book of Kings, who said to the unfortunate Israelites, when they asked for a slackening of the rigours of government:
<q>&#x2026; my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</q>
Whatever was the fate of the Israelites, the right hon. Gentleman cannot expect us in this democratic Assembly lightly to acquiesce in this stiffening of the burden. If fresh considerations do arise after the inquiry is closed&#x2014;and I want to be quite fair about this; I can readily conceive that there may be occasions on which fresh considerations do arise&#x2014;what is the right procedure to adopt? Quite patently, the right procedure must be to reopen the inquiry, so that if fresh considerations are

advanced by some parties they are advanced in public, and other parties are given the elementary right of comment and rebuttal. That is the correct procedure which, I think, should follow from such a case&#x2014;at any rate, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Daventry has said, in any case in which the interest of any other party is or may be affected by the further considerations which arise.<br/>
There is one last point I want to make on this, because I think it is of substantial importance, and that is in regard to the way in which the Minister must deal with these matters. We have had considerable discussion as to whether or not the Minister is acting judicially in these matters. I find that the position now is one of increasing confusion, and it is right that the country should know whether the Minister acts in a judicial capacity or not. Had this Bill, through its various stages, received a fairer measure of time for consideration, this is one of the things which would have been made clear. What is the position now? The Master of the Rolls, in giving a judicial interpretation in the Plymouth case, said this:
<q>The Minister is entitled to act on any information which may come to him in his administrative capacity, and he cannot be compelled to disclose the source of his information. It is erroneous to say that the Minister must act in a quasi-judicial capacity.</q>
That is the interpretation of the Master of the Rolls of the law as it at present stands under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1944. The Minister, on the other hand, speaking in this House on Monday on the recommittal of this Bill said this:
<q>The last word does not rest with the local authority but with the Minister, who is bound to act judicially and in the light of the evidence that he gets at the local public inquiry."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 12th May. 1947: Vol. 437, c. 1121.]</q>
The Minister's interpretation of his functions does not seem to square with the interpretation made by the Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the right hon. and learned Gentleman; because that, I think, actually reinforces the importance of this point. The Minister thought on Monday that he must act judicially; now that he has got the Plymouth judgment he knows he need not act judicially. Lawyers interpret the law; but our function here is to make the law. The first question we have to decide is, whether or not we want the Minister to act judicially, or whether we want him to be exempt from taking a judicial view in these matters. In my view, there is no doubt about this, that the people of this country do not understand the technicalities of the Town and Country Planning Act, but they have an instinctive and inexorable aversion from any procedure which seems to them to violate the decencies of judicial procedure. The fact that the Minister is not obliged to act in a judicial capacity reinforces our view that this Amendment should not go through as it stands, because it increases the possibility of a failure to do justice to people who have been heard in the local inquiry, but whose case may afterwards be disposed of behind closed doors, and without their even knowing about it. I add my most urgent representations to those made by my hon. and learned Friend that the Attorney-General should think again about this. He should ask himself whether it is really in the public interest that this Amendment should go through as it stands, and open the way to a sort of procedure which accords ill with the elementary decencies of judicial proceedings; and which is, in my view, a clear break with the traditions of this free country in these matters.</p>

<p>I think the Minister is aware that I am not unfriendly to his Department. As a member of a local planning committee I recognise that this Bill contains a great deal to help us. At the same time, I am opposed to this Amendment, because I believe it aggravates an already very unsatisfactory state of affairs regarding representations and local inquiries generally. From time to time the meanings of words change. It appears to me that, since this Government came into office, the meanings of two words, "consultation" and "agreement," have changed. One used to think that "consultation" meant mutual discussion, and willingness to carry out agreed policy.

Now it means telling people what one means to do, and with no intention of changing one's decision, whatever they may say. I feel that the result of this Amendment will be to accentuate that difference in the meaning of the word. As regards "agreement," unless people show their disapproval by resigning, or taking some such drastic action, it is now assumed that they agree with what one says. That applies at all levels, and not only to the Ministry of Town and Country Planning. It applies also to Cabinet decisions which affect the Dominions, and in a great number of other directions. That is a deplorable negation of democracy.<br/>
The Minister should remember that, in dealing with local bodies, he is in a position of immense strength, and he should try to avoid doing anything that is an abuse of that strength. The local representatives have a contribution to make, but they cannot make it, if they are in the position of not being allowed to say anything. I heard of an inquiry the other day which went on for over an hour and at which many representations were made; but nothing was said in answer by the Minister's representative, except that those present might smoke<br/>
I think that in these local inquiries, whether they are behind closed doors or open, more information should be given, and a real effort made to get real consultation and real agreement. I feel that this Amendment is retrogressive, particularly the latter part of it. It certainly is not helpful. It will increase the impression that exists very widely now that there is nothing in these inquiries, that there is nothing to be got out of them, that they are a waste of time, and that everything is decided beforehand. If these decisions are to be made behind closed doors, that fact will accentuate such opinions and make the position worse. Therefore, I am against this Amendment.</p>

<p>I also hope that the right hon. Gentleman and the Attorney-General will consider this matter very carefully again. I think that this Amendment, in the form in which they have put it on the Order Paper, is not only not in the public interest, but is not really in the interest of the right hon. Gentleman and his Department. Let me see how far I can carry all quarters of the House with me


in the submission I am making. There are those who think that there should be a public local inquiry in every case. There are others who think there is no such need and that there are cases which can be determined without a public local inquiry. Both those views are perfectly arguable, and I can well understand the right non. Gentleman contending that he should not be bound to have a public local inquiry in every case. I am not going to dispute the justice of that view. The point on which, I suggest, every quarter of the House will agree with me is this&#x2014;that in the cases where there is a public local inquiry, it should not be a sham, and that those taking part in it should not believe it to be a sham.<br/>
That proposition will command general assent. But what will be the position if, at a public local inquiry, proposals are brought forward which are believed to represent, let us say, proposals that the Minister is to be asked to approve, and those who wish to question those proposals cross-examine those who give evidence in their favour, and believe that their cross-examination has been so damaging that the proposals cannot survive? It is perfectly possible that subsequently facts are brought to the Minister's attention which may make him think that, notwithstanding that cross-examination, the proposals submitted to so much adverse criticism, nevertheless, ought to proceed on the new grounds which have been brought to his attention. The new proposal, or the new reason operating in the mind of the Minister, ought also to be subject to some public inquiry, and the persons who, before, had the opportunity of cross-examination should have that opportunity again.<br/>
I expect the right hon. Gentleman wants to avoid&#x2014;and I sympathise with him in this&#x2014;a great deal of delay that might be injurious to the public interest in some of these cases, which are of varying degrees of urgency. In this connection there is one matter not alluded to in the discussion so far, and that is the possibility of an adjournment of the inquiry. If, as a result of the inquiry so far as it had proceeded, the Minister thought that he would like to consult someone, it would not be impossible, and it might be for the convenience of all, that there should be an adjournment in order that the new factors which had

come to the Minister's attention might be the subject of full public inquiry, with cross-examination and so on. I can imagine that occasionally the Minister might receive information, even after the closing of a public inquiry. If it dealt with a matter which had been the sub-pect of dispute, examination and cross-examination and the giving of evidence, surely it would be worth while reopening the inquiry, or having a fresh inquiry? If the Minister refuses this, how can he hope that the public and all the parties concerned will continue to place much confidence in these inquiries? They will be told by their legal advisers, "Oh, yes, we may have complete and absolute success at the public local inquiry, but the Minister may later hear of something from the local planning authority, which, in his view, gives an entirely different complexion to the whole case, and there will be no opportunity for you to test it, or make representations about it."<br/>
The Attorney-General intervened, very rightly, just now to explain the difference that had occurred in the position since the right hon. Gentleman spoke on Monday, on account of a subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal. Whatever the position of the right hon. Gentleman, whether he is now under no obligation to act judicially or not, I am perfectly certain that he, or whoever may occupy his office in future, will always wish to act fairly. I do not suggest that if this Amendment were on the Statute Book, the Minister would not attempt to act fairly. The trouble is that the parties who had gone to great trouble to put their case at a local inquiry would not feel that they had been fairly treated, if, notwithstanding anything that had taken place at the public inquiry, the whole result could be altered in view of subsequent representations about which they had no knowledge. Certain matters in town and country planning must obviously be decided by the Minister and not by any court, but then the check on the Minister, as he has said, and we all agree, must be a political check, that is to say, the check of the House of Commons; but the House of Commons would not have knowledge of what had operated in the Minister's mind in those cases where he had apparently completely disregarded the facts proved at a local inquiry. I do not think the proposed machinery is satis-


factory to any of the main parties concerned. It is not satisfactory to those who are interested in the subject matter of the inquiry, and it is not satisfactory to the right hon. Gentleman, because he will find himself frequently suspected of acting unfairly; it will not be a satisfactory answer to say, "I have the statutory power to do what I am doing" if, in fact, he has asked for the powers in this Bill. It is unsatisfactory also to the House of Commons. For these reasons, I beg the Government to reconsider their Amendment.</p>

<p>In view of the speeches made by hon. Members opposite, I hope the House will not think it inappropriate if I make two or three observations. It would be unfortunate if it were thought that any of us on these benches are less concerned with the interests of justice, and the ordinary decencies of justice, than hon. Members opposite represent themselves to be, and are. Apart from the merits of this Amendment, all will agree that it tends to clarify the law. It renders something clear which at present is obscure, namely, whether or not after there has been a local public inquiry, the Minister may consult with certain people without giving notice to other people of those consultations. Everyone will agree that clarification is a step in the right direction, whatever views we may have as to whether this Amendment is sound or not. It is certainly the responsibility of this House to see that the law is clarified, and that it is not left in that state of obscurity, which has resulted from the decisions in the cases now going through the courts. It is the duty of this House to decide what the law should be in future, so that the public shall know where responsibility lies.<br/>
The hon. Member for Hertford (Mr. Walker-Smith) went wrong, if I may say so, in trying to draw an unreal analogy between justice as administered in the courts. in disputes between two parties in a civil action, and that administrative justice&#x2014;for want of a better word&#x2014;which it is the function of the Minister to exercise in making decisions about matters of the kind we are now considering. We on these benches are no less concerned than hon. Members opposite with justice being done, and we all support what has been said

by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for the Combined English Universities (Mr. H, Strauss), that it is important the public should know that these public inquiries are not a sham but a serious part of the proceedings leading to the Minister's decision. The public should also know that the final responsibility is that of the Minister, having heard the inquiry, and having weighed any other information coming from other sources, whether before the inquiry was held, or after. It is the responsibility of the Minister who in turn is responsible to this House to act fairly, properly and reasonably, in the interests of all parties, and of the locality, in the decisions that he has to take. For these reasons I support the Amendment.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member for East Islington (Mr. E. Fletcher) has made so clear, the fundamental error into which hon. Members opposite have fallen in this matter is in assuming that the Minister is here discharging a judicial function, and that these inquiries are in the nature of judicial proceedings. It has always been my contention, as I know it has been the contention of those who have preceded me, that that is not the law. It has now been held in the Court of Appeal that that is not the law, and the purpose of this Clause is to put it beyond all possible doubt that it is not the law. The hon. and learned Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) asked what the House would say if a judge, after trying a case, were entitled to consult whom he pleased behind the backs of the parties concerned. That is the whole point. That is the position in regard to a judge. A judge has to close his mind to any knowledge he may already have, to any information which he may have gathered from previous cases, or any policy which he may have formed in the light of previous experience. He has to decide the matter before him on the evidence, and on the evidence alone. That is the position of a judge. The duty of a judge is not to ascertain absolute truth, but to decide what is established by the evidence which the parties choose to put before him in a particular case. The Minister is not a judge, nor does he occupy a quasi-judicial position, as Members opposite have suggested. In Standing Committee I indicated a certain view about this matter&#x2014;and I am coming


back to it, because nothing I said then is inconsistent with what I am saying now. I was accepting, loyally, the recent decision given by Mr. Justice Henn Collins on these matters. The law has since been clarified, and in the sense which I and my predecessors have always contended. The learned Master of the Rolls said:
<q>To say that on the evidence given at the public inquiry it was impossible that the Minister should be satisfied, would be to make the Court, and not the Minister, the authority to decide what was requisite. The Minister was entitled to act on any information which might come to him in his administrative capacity, and he could not be compelled to disclose the source of his information. It was erroneous to say that the Minister must act in a quasi-judicial capacity. His power to make the order could not be controlled by the Court. If it had been shown that he had acted beyond the limits of his statutory powers or had acted in bad faith, the position would have been different. As it was the appeal would be allowed with costs.</q>
Ministers, in dealing with matters of this kind, are acting as administrators. The Minister, in this case, is already under a statutory obligation, enacted by this House, in 1943, to secure consistency and continuity in planning as a matter of national policy. In our view&#x2014;and this, I believe, to be the true legal position; it will not be altered by the Bill, but will be put beyond all doubt&#x2014;the duty of a Minister is to consider, in good faith, any representation or any objection which may be put before him. In that matter he is, of course, subject to the control of the courts.<br/>
If he acts in bad faith, and does not consider objections as an honest Minister ought to do, then the person who is aggrieved by that can go to the court and question the conduct of the Minister. But, subject to his acting in good faith, he acts as a Minister responsible to Parliament. He is not a judicial officer, acting within some narrow lines of judicial procedure. He must be free&#x2014;after holding an inquiry, if he decides so to do, before acting on what is an administrative, and not judicial basis&#x2014;to consult with outside bodies and, not least, with those bodies which are expressly charged by Statute with responsibility for planning matters. These are questions which the Minister has to decide on broad grounds of public policy. That is his Ministerial function. A Minister does not suddenly adopt the cloak of a judge because he voluntarily decides, in order to inform himself the more fully of

the matters in issue, and to investigate the strength of the objections which may have been raised, to hold a public inquiry. He is the Minister who is availing himself of the machinery of a public inquiry in order that he may be better informed in carrying out his duties. In the exercise and discharge of those duties, he is responsible to Parliament, and it is to Parliament, and not the courts, and still less to individual objectors, that he must answer if, in good faith he consults outside persons or bodies, or avails himself of sources of information.<br/>
I ask Members opposite to bear in mind that we have just as great a regard for judicial functions, and the administration of law and justice in this country, as they have. To attempt to assimilate judicial and administrative functions not only exposes the administrator to forms and procedures which are incompatible with efficient and expeditious administration&#x2014;I point to the Stevenage case, in which no final result will be achieved for nine or ten months after the making of the Order, and to the Plymouth case&#x2014;but also exposes him to embarrassments and ideas which are quite foreign to the practice of justice in this country. For instance, a Minister may act as a judge in what is, in effect, his own cause. It is completely artificial to talk of Ministers who are under a statutory obligation to make or confirm these orders as acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. To confuse the two functions, judicial and administrative, does not enhance the prestige of the judicial ideal, or promote the success of administration.<br/>
It has been suggested that there has been some inconsistency in the attitude we are taking up as compared with the attitude I took up in Standing Committee. I should like to make it clear that that is not so. I said, in Standing Committee:
<q>The Government will reconsider the Clause.&#x2026; but I add this, that we shall adhere to the final principle that, at the end, the Minister must be left free to arrive at his decision after having regard not only to the evidence which may have been adduced at the inquiry, but to overriding considerations of public policy, for the administration of which he will be responsible, not to the courts, but to Parliament. We take the view that it is quite impossible to put the Minister, who is administering an Act of Parliament of this kind, into a position of a judge who must decide on the evidence before him, completely closing his mind to considerations of public policy and matters of that kind, and deciding simply on the evidence before him.</q>


Then I made a reference to natural justice, not that I objected to the use of that expression, but because Lord Shaw entertained the strongest objection to it being used in connection with administrative matters of this kind. I said:
<q>I hope &#x2026; that all these matters will be considered, having regard to the decisions which will be ultimately arrived at by the Court of Appeal.</q>
We intelligently anticipated what the decision there would be likely to be. In my view, supported by the decision of the Court of Appeal, this Clause does nothing except put beyond doubt the existing law. It is for the House to decide whether it wants to alter the existing law.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman also said in the Standing Committee:
<q>I made it quite clear that if we did accept the Amendment we would not commit ourselves in any way to the provisions which we should put down on Report stage for consultation, &#x2026; or as to the necessity of communicating such consultation to the objector."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, Standing Committee D; c. 993&#x2013;995.]</q>
I particularly stressed the desirability of informing the objector affected, of any consultation, and of the substance of the consultation that had taken place with the local authority. The right hon. and learned Gentleman, in the course of his interesting speech, did not say one word about informing any particular objector.</p>

<p>I do not want to leave the matter in any doubt at all. In the Committee I made it clear, after the hon. and learned Gentleman had made the point about informing objectors of subsequent consultations, that we could not accept any commitment as to the need of communicating such consultation to the objectors. I said that we would consider the whole situation, in the light of whatever decision was eventually given by the Court of Appeal in regard to it. Having considered the decision of the Court of Appeal, we were confirmed and fortified in the view which we originally took that it is not consistent with good administration to reopen these matters.<br/>
These inquiries are for the purpose of enabling Ministers to inform themselves of the facts&#x2014;to enable Ministers to ascer-

tain and canvass the weight of any particular objection or criticism. Having held the inquiry and informed themselves as fully as Ministers think necessary by that means, they must be entitled to go to other sources of information. If it appears then to a Minister, from fresh information subsequent to the public inquiries, that it would be desirable in the public interest to hold a further inquiry in order to get still more information, he is, of course, at perfect liberty to do so. We cannot agree to the Minister being put under an obligation to go on re-opening inquiries&#x2014;going back to the objectors perhaps time after time, because subsequent to considering some particular&#x2014;point, he receives some information from some outside body that has some bearing upon it. There must be some finality about these matters, and the Minister must be left free to obtain such information as he thinks expedient in the public interest, whether by another inquiry or not, but without being under any obligation to disclose to anyone, except to this House, what that information is or from whom he has obtained it.</p>

<p>We are Obliged to the learned Attorney-General for the exposition which he has given of the existing law. I do not dispute what he has said on this strictly legal point. What he has told us is that this Amendment, which is now being moved by the Government, is not really an Amendment to the existing body of the law, but is merely declaratory of the legal position as the right hon. and learned Gentleman and the Government see it. I do not pretend to deal with this matter from the strictly legal point of view, but I think that the Government have acted very unwisely and maladroitly to introduce something which the ordinary man may regard as different from the statute law as it stands. The procedure of public inquiries has been embodied in Statutes for a long time, and has been "run in" during many years of operation, and there is in the mind of the ordinary citizen a certain conception of how it works. The ordinary man regards a public inquiry as something in the nature of an arbitration. The niceties of what is judicial and what is not are not for him, but although he may be ignorant about the law, he has an acute sense of what is fair and what is unfair. Whatever the law may be, it is thoroughly


bad politics to introduce an Amendment at this stage into a respected form of procedure, which gives the ordinary man the opinion that there will be some work behind the scenes to which he is not permitted to be a party.<br/>
I think that it is unwise to do that. Nothing can prevent a Minister in the exercise of his administrative task from obtaining all the information that he requires, nor would we seek to do so. He has many channels of communication. If his Department is only half efficient, there is nothing about a particular matter of this sort that he cannot ascertain. To suggest, as this Amendment does, that he shall have power not only to obtain information, but to consult one of the parties to the case after the case is over is, I think, extremely unwise. We use the word "consultation" in Statutes when we want to make sure that one Minister is brought in on a question that concerns him. I remember in another Bill my agricultural friends saying that the Minister of Agriculture should be consulted. That does not mean that the Minister who is asked to consult with a person has to obtain information from that person. It means that the person is to be taken into consultation. That is a very different thing from merely obtaining additional information after an inquiry.<br/>
As I see it, public local inquiries, as hitherto understood in this country, serve two useful functions. If there is a dispute between two parties, one may be a local authority and the other a citizen, the Minister orders a public local inquiry. What are the functions of that public local inquiry? As I understand it they are twofold. One is that the Minister shall have an opportunity of ascertaining the truth of the matter complained about, in the only way that truth can be ascertained, or its approximation ascertained, and that is by the two parties who are contending in the matter being confronted with each other, so that a statement of one can be challenged by the other. The evidence given is not merely <i>ex parte</i> but is subject to the cross-testimony and cross-examination of the party who disagrees with it. It is by that process that the issues between the parties are narrowed down, and finally, when the inquiry has gone the requisite amount of time, the issues are presented to the Minister, who has to make a decision in

a narrowed form, supported by the evidence on each side of the question, and with this body of evidence, checked and tested by cross-examination from the hostile party, he is in a superior position to arrive at a wise and just decision.<br/>
That is one but only one object of a public inquiry. The other object is in my judgment equally important. Our people, as a rule, have a great respect for the law and the observance of ceremonial proceedings. They are frequently aggrieved by actions of a Government Department, but if they have the sense that they can appear in the open against their adversaries, before an impartial person, and be given a full chance of stating their case before their friends and neighbours, and of cross-examining what is said against their case by the other side, then, although the ultimate decision may be adverse to their desires, they have at least the feeling that all has been done in the open, and that they have had a fair deal. That is the second most important object of a public inquiry. It not only enables the truth to be ascertained, but it spreads through the ramifications of administration an atmosphere of impartiality and equality. I think myself that it would have been worth a great deal to have maintained that.<br/>
I think that these new proceedings, stating that the Minister may, after an inquiry is over, consult with one of the parties but is to be under no obligation to test what the other party says by referring to the party against him, whose testimony is uttered in secret, not only will muddy the wells of truth, but will certainly give the person adversely affected by the ultimate decision, a suspicion as to the equity with which he has been treated in the matter. Whatever the strict law may be, speaking not as a lawyer but as a politician, I say that the Amendment which the Government are now asking the House to adopt is extremely maladroit.</p>

<p>I am not going to take part in this quasi-judicial dispute but I think it important to point out what the Amendment seeks to do, because there is some misunderstanding about it, and I believe some innocent misrepresentation of the extent of what it proposes. It does not deal primarily with the relationship


between the local authority and an individual. In all the ordinary forms of inquiry, the machinery which the right hon. Gentleman says has been "run in" will remain, for this Amendment does not seek to deal with that. It seeks to deal with an entirely new situation, the making of a development plan or the modification of that plan, and with nothing else. The Amendment says that the object of the public inquiry is to enable the Minister to approve of the best possible plan. He is not adjudicating on individuals nor on the relations of individuals to the local authorities, but is concerning himself with the development plan or any modification of it.<br/>
I agree instantly that the plan may affect individuals but that is not his concern at the public inquiry. He is concerned to see what is the best plan and how it will possibly affect the community as a whole. As a result of an Amendment, which was discussed yesterday, the Minister has to be informed of the estimated cost of carrying out a development plan or any modification, but he is not, at this inquiry, concerned with the relations with individuals. That comes on at some other stage of the public acquisition and the contention is&#x2014;and I think it is right&#x2014;that in considering what kind of development plan the Minister has to approve, every source of information should be available to him. It is conceded that the Minister can get information from any party before the inquiry. I do not know what any hon. or right hon. Gentleman opposite would think if a judge on the eve of a hearing had dinner with one of the parties to a dispute, but apparently it is considered that a Minister may do it, and do it quite properly as long as it is before the inquiry. I see no difference in getting the information from any of the parties either before or after the inquiry.</p>

<p>Yes, consulting to get information. In the carrying out of the machinery of this Amendment any Minister will act fairly. Of course, if he feels, as the result of any information which he gets, that he ought to communicate with the other side and with one of the objectors, I take it that the Minister, whether he comes from this side of the

House or from the other, will have a sufficiently high sense of his public duties not to act improperly or unfairly. The mere fact of getting the further information, would not necessarily involve reopening the inquiry as was suggested, or even communicating with the other side.</p>

<p>The actual example given by the hon. and learned Member is impossible under this Amendment. It could not possibly arise in determining the nature of a development plan. Why would the hon. and learned Gentleman allow the Minister to go to one of the parties and get all the information before the inquiry but not after?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman asks why, and the answer is that if the right hon. Gentleman went before the inquiry then somebody would put forward at the inquiry what was told to the right hon. Gentleman and there would be an opportunity for cross-examination.</p>

<p>Not at all. The person conducting the inquiry is not under an obligation to put forward views. He is there to hear objections. He is not a party to the dispute. This development plan is put forward by a local authority, but it would be quite right for the Minister to go and make all sorts of investigations and inquiries about the proposed development plan immediately before the inquiry but not after it. That seems to me to make nonsense of it. The parties behind the making of a development plan should be in a position to offer information and the Minister should be able to get it where he can, but he is bound to act fairly. I am satisfied that any Minister would act fairly and would not merely arrive at a biased point of view or one set view without


taking the precaution to find out what any other view is if it had not already emerged at the inquiry. The real point which I want to make is that. this Amendment is restricted to the making of the development plans or the modifications of them, and does not relate to the much wider field of local inquiries arising out of the relationship between the local authority and the individual.</p>

<p>This Bill, of course, appears to the ordinary man in the street as an appalling Measure with all its technical and legal implications. I listened with great respect to the statement made by the Attorney-General, and, although it was <i>prima facie</i> a learned exposition of the state of the law, it does not remove the feeling in the minds of many of us, that if a local inquiry took place in relation to a development plan, some further conversations and negotiations would take place with the Minister before he decided. An essential quality of the people of this country has always been respect for the law, but if people feel that something takes place between the Minister who is finally responsible for the determination of a plan, and the people who produce it,</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1530.0" colnum="1530" time="">
<p>that removes respect for the law and the people also lose respect for the administration for what that Minister is responsible. If the inquiry takes place in open court and cross-examination is possible, that makes a difference, but by the system suggested in this Amendment disturbance would be created in the minds of the people. In a Measure of this kind there ought to be no feeling of anything unfair taking place, after a public inquiry had examined all the points and the various aspects. I felt, when this point was raised upstairs, that the Minister would make a concession to meet the representations which had been put to him there. I find, however, that he is as adamant on the subject as ever. He knows my personal regard for him, and for a Minister, whose duty it is to confiscate the property of the people of this country, I think he is an amiable person. In these particular circumstances, however, he is not acting, in his Ministerial capacity, in such a manner as to maintain confidence in the law of this country.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 9, line 14, at the end, to insert:
<q>(4) In the application of the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act, 1945. to any Order made in pursuance of paragraph (c) of the proviso to Subsection (3) of Section five of this Act, any requirements imposed by regulations under this Section with respect to the publication of notices and the consideration of objections in relation to the development plan shall be deemed for the purposes of Section two of that Act to be requirements with respect to proceedings preliminary to the making of the Order.</q>
This is really a drafting matter. Under Section 2 and the First Schedule of the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act of 1945, where it is proposed to make an Order which is subject to special Parliamentary procedure, certain preliminary steps have to be gone through first unless the Statute under which the Order is made prescribes preliminary proceedings of a similar kind. Under Clause 9 of the present Bill, certain preliminary proceedings will be prescribed before the approval of a development plan, and it will not he until all these have been complied with that any question of making a special procedure Order&#x2014;for instance, an Order in the case of the land of a local authority, or land belonging to the National Trust under Clause 5 (3) (<i>c</i>)&#x2014;will arise. Unless the provisions which are the subject of the present Amendment are included, it might consequently be necessary to go through the preliminary procedure all over again. The Amendment is intended to make it clear that where the necessity for a special procedure Order arises under Clause 5 (3) (<i>c</i>), the preliminary requirements under Clause 5 generally shall be deemed to be preliminary requirements for the purpose of the 1945 Act.</p>

After the Crown Proceedings Bill which is at present before Parliament has been passed into law, as we expect with some confidence it will be, there will exist no special rights or preferences in regard to Crown debts, and this reference will consequently serve no useful purpose. Such

expenses as are recoverable will be recoverable by the ordinary methods open to all persons for the recovery of debts in the courts.</p>

Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Keeling)&#x2014;which I have just moved&#x2014;it would exclude from the definition of "development," the maintenance or repair of any pipes or works on the roads by any local authority or statutory undertaker, but it would not exclude the laying down of pipes by such a local authority or statutory undertaker. This is an omission on the part of the right hon. Gentleman. When this matter was discussed in Standing Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham moved an Amendment of this nature, and on that occasion the right hon. Gentleman said that he was willing to accept the principle. The matter with which my hon. Friend was then concerned covered a statutory undertaker who not


only wanted to inspect, repair or maintain pipes in a road, but wanted to lay them down. The right hon. Gentleman knows that there are cases where undertakers are under an obligation to lay down pipes. For instance, I understand that gas companies are under an obligation to lay down connecting pipes from the main to consumers' premises, and it would seem quite wrong, and would put them in an impossible position, if work of that kind was classed as a development for which permission had to be obtained. It would involve delays which would be very unfortunate for the community. The whole House knows the desirability of securing piped water supplies all over the countryside, and it would appear that if the proposed Amendment were accepted as it stands, any statutory undertaker who desires to put down a pipe will have to seek permission under Clause 10. It is because I think there is an omission that I hope the right hon. Gentleman will accept this Amendment to the Amendment.</p>

<p>The omission of the words "laying down" was deliberate. The intention is that until the whole question of the breaking open of streets has been dealt with&#x2014;and it is the intention of the Ministry of Transport to deal with it&#x2014;there should be a measure of control. I do not think it will involve any hardship or difficulty. Complete freedom to go into any street and break it open to carry out works without any question at all ought not to be tolerated, or at any rate it ought to be dealt with comprehensively, and it is because there is an intention to deal with the breaking open of streets separately that those words were omitted.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman says it is the intention of the Ministry of Transport to deal with this matter, but not, I take it, under this Bill. That raises a very awkward position, because here is an example of

piecemeal legislation. Anyone who has travelled about the country must know that there is hopeless confusion between Government Departments in these matters. Here we are postponing this very important question to be dealt with on some other occasion. This way of approaching the position seems unsatisfactory. After what my hon. Friend has said in moving his Amendment to the proposed Amendment I should have thought that at some time during the passage of the Bill this point could be made clear so that the processes referred to will not be held up. If the Ministry of Transport say there is some difficulty about it, it is a pity the Minister of Transport is not here to give us information on the matter.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 10, line 15, at the end, to insert:
<q>The temporary use of land and the erection of moveable structures thereon by a person who is the proprietor of a travelling circus, roundabout, amusement fair, stall or store (not being a pedlar, hawker or costermonger) for the purpose of his business.</q>
I move this Amendment on behalf of a large and important body of people, who are of great value to the community, and who are anxious about their position under the Bill. They are the showmen with temporary and movable structures which they take round and, from time to time, put on land where fairs have not previously been held. When they go to a regular ground they are already protected. Under the Bill they will have to obtain permission, and the owner of the land will be liable to pay development charges under Part V. That will mean that the owner will be unlikely to allow


the use of his land. This is a serious matter for a very large number of these tradespeople. Under the law, showmen do not have to obtain permission from the local authority for a stay of less than 20 days, but it appears that under the Bill that principle will go. Although the planning authority will not take action under Clause 21 in respect of a period up to 21 days, the owner will still be liable for development charges, and will therefore be unwilling to allow the use of his land.<br/>
Without an Amendment of this nature showmen will be in a very serious position under the Bill. Many of them are subject to sudden changes of plan, by reason of bad weather, local epidemics, diseases, and things of that sort. I need not stress the great value of their work to the community. They give a great deal of innocent and necessary fun and recreation. Just now, when young men are returning from the Forces and entering the business, it is desirable that they should have as much encouragement and as little impediment as possible. I have the honour to be honorary chaplain to the Showmen's Guild, and I know that they do splendid work. I might be permitted to say that in some respects their business is not altogether divorced from that of this ancient Court of Parliament. Exhibitions of tightrope-walking and even of acrobatics are familiar in this business as in that. I hope that my Amendment will receive sympathy from the Minister.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I shall not use any additional argument. except to say that if the Minister can see his way to accept the Amendment, or can find some other way of covering the point therein suggested, it will be a great tribute to a group of people who have rendered signal service to the cause of town and country planning. I say that deliberately. The showmen's organisation and their newspaper "World's Fair" have time and again, in the past 50 years, fought the battle for the preservation of our commons and ancient rights of way. It would be a fully merited tribute to them if the Minister accepted the Amendment.</p>

<p>The mover and seconder of the Amendment have asked me to regard it with sympathy. I do regard it sympathetically, but they are asking too

much. They are asking that there should be no control whatever over the temporary use of any land in the future, in respect of travelling circuses, roundabouts and so on. In spite of the great services to the cause of planning given in the past by the showmen, to accept the Amendment would not be rendering a service to future planning. The use of land for this purpose is a very definite use. I would be the last to say that it is unnecessarily, in all cases, an undesirable use, but even the honorary chaplain to the guild must admit that there might be cases of undesirable use of certain sites. The purpose of the Bill is to control such use. The Bill provides protection for sites which have been in use in the past. It will he possible to safeguard future sites by means of a development scheme. I believe that the organisations for which the hon. Members have spoken, will be satisfied with the assurance that those sites will be covered as far as possible by the development schemes&#x2014;that is to say, development schemes made by local authorities and approved by the Minister to give exemption to the particular sites, in respect of which it will not be necessary for approval to be sought. As regards other sites it will be necessary. I should not be discharging my duty if I gave <i>carte blanche</i> to showmen to go anywhere they liked in the future, without any control whatever. I hope that my hon. Friends will be satisfied with this assurance.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure that the Minister made out his case. I do not think he was justified in saying that the Amendment asked for <i>carte blanche.</i> I do not think it does. It is obvious that such matters can be controlled, and ought to be controlled by regulations made for the purpose, just as markets can be controlled by by-laws and other regulations. I seriously question whether it is appropriate to control this use of sites by machinery under Part III. Those provisions are to control the development of land. That is their title and their purpose. I seriously question whether it is appropriate to describe the temporary use of land for an amusement park and for erecting roundabouts, for periods of less than 28 days, as a development of the land. It seems to me that it is rather going outside the ordinary use of language, and that whilst good administration would obviously demand


that these matters should not be without regulation, it might equally demand that such administrative arrangements as were desirable, should be made under some other Section of some other Act. I cannot help feeling that there is substance in the complaint that this type of machinery is not appropriate to temporary erections for periods of for much less than 28 days. I feel that the right hon. Gentleman might reconsider his attitude towards this Amendment, which has not been put forward in unreasonable terms, and was not, I believe, replied to by him in any hostile spirit. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider whether other machinery might not be more appropriate.</p>

<p>I support this Amendment. I think that it is a human and natural Amendment and that these words ought to be inserted somewhere in this Bill. Both the mover and the seconder of the Amendment put forward their case, not from a high Ministerial point of view, but from the natural, human point of view which appeals to hon. Members such as myself. After all, these fairs have gone on in this country for a long time and are amusements which are looked forward to by children and a lot of innocent people. Nobody could possibly accuse either of the two Ministers concerned with this Bill of being entirely innocent, and they are not the kind of persons whom one would see at a fun fair. They certainly want something grimmer than that. The Minister intimated that, at some time in the future, this matter might possibly be dealt with, but anybody watching the right hon. Gentleman and listening to him would realise that there was a complete and utter lack of sympathy on his part with this kind of amusement. Although he did not say so, he obviously regards fun fairs as nasty, noisy, ugly and crude, and as things which are dotted about the country appearing here today and there tomorrow, and without any of that order and planning which so delight his heart. It is quite obvious that the idea of fun fairs was a thousand miles away from his pedantic heart. As hon. Members of all parties may be in favour of such an Amendment, why not take this matter to a Division, and thus show that, on this point, at any rate a very strong case has been made out? On the other hand, there is, I think, one slight defect in the

Amendment. I am not sure whether the words "stall or store" are not rather too wide. Why should pedlars, hawkers or costermongers be ruled out? After all, those people perform a very useful service and, to my mind, the costermonger should certainly not have been excluded. I hope that we shall have a chance of dividing on this Amendment, and of showing that there is a great deal of humanity in this House.</p>

<p>I always thought from the appearance and manner of the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams) that he had never known what it was to be young. I am certain that very few people will agree with him that the travelling fair is a general nuisance. [HON. MEMBERS: "He did not say so."] In the days of my boyhood there was nothing so welcome as a travelling fair. I think right hon. Gentlemen on the Government Front Bench should try to remember their boyhood days, and should' give this Amendment sympathetic. consideration. I suggest, however, that travelling fairs should not and would not come under these development charges. I would like to see this Amendment inserted elsewhere in the Bill. Subsection (2) says:
<q>In this Act, except where the context otherwise requires, the expression 'development' means the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, Over or under land, and the making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other land.</q>
The question of material change always comes into the matter, and I am certain that no one would suggest that a material change would be made in the land if a travelling fair or a roundabout or two were on it for a w eek at, say, Whitsun, and then went somewhere else. Nobody could suggest that that would be a material change, so far as the development of the land was concerned. In normal circumstances, these travelling fairs would not come under the terms of this Bill, but, as hon. Members know, when one gets official persons knocking around, one never knows what they are going to do. The trouble is that some of our Ministers, forgetful of their responsibilities, do not always choose Labour men and women as official persons. They sometimes choose from the ranks of the Tories, and when a hard-faced Tory becomes an official person,


one never knows who will suffer in consequence. In order to avoid any suffering which might be caused by the wrong choice on the part of the Minister, it would be very good&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman who moved this Amendment was satisfied with the answer he received from the Minister. It seemed to me that the Minister did not really deal with the main point put forward. The hon. Gentleman did not suggest&#x2014;nor do I&#x2014;that fun fairs and circuses should be allowed to set up all over the place. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford (Mr. Hogg) pointed out that under other Acts, in fact, they could be controlled. The hon. Gentleman said there seemed to be a danger that fairs and circuses would be prevented from going on to land which they did not normally occupy, if owing to floods or some other occurrences they had to make a change because owners of land, who would normally raise no objection to them, might now have some hesitation in allowing them for fear of attracting a development charge. That seemed to be the relevant point put forward by the hon. Gentleman, but it was not answered by the Minister. I hope that the Government are not going to be unsympathetic to this Amendment, and I sugest that, even if we have not enough bread, we should have sufficient circuses.</p>

<p>I hesitate to intervene on a Bill which deals only with England and Wales as I am a Scottish Member, but as the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) has made several speeches on the recommittal stage and on the Report stage, I feel that my intervention may not be unappreciated by my hon. Friends on this side. I should like to associate myself, for once in a while,

with nearly every word the hon. Member for West Fife said, but I totally dissent from his interpretation of the speech of the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams), because if the hon. Gentleman had listened to or been able to hear the speech&#x2014;I do not say that offensively&#x2014;he would have realised that the hon. Member for Torquay was not exhibiting himself to the House as a killjoy. Far from it. He was urging the Minister to soften his hard heart and to realise that by refusing to accept this Amendment he was merely carrying on the worst spirit of the Cromwellian period in this country. By refusing to accept this Amendment, he is refusing to grant travelling showmen or circus men and others the certainty of knowing where they stand under this great Town and Country Planning Bill, this Socialistic regimentation by His Majesty's present Ministers.<br/>
I sincerely hope that, on reflection, the right hon. Gentleman will realise that this Amendment is in his own best interests. He has been urged by two hon. Gentlemen sitting behind him to allow this to circus proprietors and travelling showmen&#x2014;I do not use the phrase in any invidious sense&#x2014;and he is refusing, by his obduracy, to give them the certainty of knowing where they stand. I agree with the hon. Member for Torquay that the Amendment is perhaps too widely phrased. It might be somewhat out of place to include pedlars, hawkers and costermongers, but it is desirable to include circus proprietors and travelling showmen, who provide a very great deal of innocent amusement for members of the public generally whether they belong to any political party or none. I very much hope that the Minister will reconsider his decision, and, if he does not, it will give me very great pleasure to go into the Lobby in support of the Amendment. I hope that the mover and seconder of the Amendment will act as Tellers. The only reason why I have risen is to safeguard the interests of Scottish people, for whom I hope similar provision will be made.</p>

doubt largely because he did not hear, or if he heard, did not understand, the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams), speaking in the same vein as the hon. Member for Torquay and agreeing with everything that the hon. Member for Torquay said. What does it mean if we do not have these words inserted? It means that when one of these fun fairs passes from one county to another, application will have to be made to the county council planning committee before it can use land which has not been used before, in the same way as I imagine anyone who wants to have a fete or horse show on land which has not previously been used for that purpose, will have to apply for permission.</p>

There is nothing in this Bill which will prevent the travelling circus from going from county to county and town to town and returning to its old accustomed sites just as it has done year after year in the past.

<p>I had not appreciated what the hon. and learned Gentleman had stressed. If it is a question of going to a new site, I agree that, in some circumstances, if their user of the new site amounted to a development of that site, that is a question of fact which would have to be considered on the merits of each case, and they would have to obtain permission. Hon. Gentlemen opposite will appreciate that the new site might be next to a hospital, or in some other position where it was manifestly undesirable that a fair should be established. Hon Gentlemen opposite have not suggested any adequate existing means by which the use of land for this kind of purpose can be controlled. We think it right that while existing sites which in the past have been consecrated to this most important and desirable use, should continue to be used there should exist some power which can be exercised in the case of necessity, to control the development of new sites for this purpose.</p>

<p>If the people of Cornwall could have heard the speech of the Attorney-General, they would have been rather disturbed. Cornwall is full of joy and colour, but it has a serious purpose. Travelling circuses and fairs play a very prominent part in the life of various towns and villages in Cornwall on what are called feast days. I am rather disturbed to hear that if such a circus or fair is established on a new site it may be in trouble. The learned Attorney-General asked what was to be done if such a fair sought to establish itself next to a hospital but, under the existing law, that could be restrained as a nuisance and it would be quite impossible for a fair to be established on such a site. Therefore, on behalf of the children of Cornwall&#x2014;and I hope I may be accounted one&#x2014;who so enjoy these fairs and circuses, I rise to protest, and I hope that the matter will yet be reconsidered,</p>

<p>On behalf of the children of Devonshire I would like to say a word. In these grim and very grey days, these circuses and fairs are amongst the few things that cheer us up. I suggest that any new powers are utterly unnecessary. Next week in Dawlish, which is my home town, a fair is arriving. The owners applied to use the green on the sea front. The council discussed the application at last week's meeting; they decided that this fair might cut up the green too much, and that it should go to the playing fields a mile away. So the present powers are ample to deal with everything of that kind. This is just another bit of completely unnecessary legislation.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 10, line 20, to leave out "a," and to insert "no."<br/>
With your permission, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, I should like the next Amendment&#x2014;in line 21, to leave out "and of each," and to insert "or of any"&#x2014;to be considered with this Amendment. Clause 10 describes what is and what is not development and in Subsection (3) there is the curious phrase<br/>
<q>For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared</q>
that any man who converts one house into two or more separate dwellings is undertaking development. The phrase "for the avoidance of doubt" reminds me of Macaulay's phrase "every schoolboy knows." Of course every schoolboy did not know, and this phrase raises more doubts than it allays. One doubt is what really is the intention of the Government in regard to the levying of development charges. Do they intend to levy development charges upon buildings, or upon sites? Listening to the Second Reading speeches one heard hon. Member after hon. Member opposite rejoicing in the fact that values which had been created by the community were now to be taxed for the benefit of the community. The whole argument seemed based on the fact that development charges were to be levied on sites, yet, "for the avoidance of doubt," it is here stated that development charges are to be levied on buildings. I ask the Government to allay that doubt, and to make clear their intention in regard to the levying of development charges. Is it on sites, or also on buildings on those sites?<br/>
The second doubt which this raises in my mind is whether the Government are really in earnest about the housing of the people of this country. Here we have the clearly laid down intention of the Government that where a man performs the beneficial act of turning a house into two, three, or more, separate dwellings, he renders himself liable to all the rigmarole of applying to the Central Land Board to be told what the development charge is, and to waiting until the property has been inspected and the amount assessed, before he can get planning permission or licences. One can imagine the owner of a building which already houses two, three, or more, families, and which has not been

modernised, looking at all the things which have to be done under the terms of this Bill, and saying in despair, "Dash it all, I would rather leave the property as it is. I am not going to all the trouble of finding out what the development charge is to be, and then converting the building." Every hon. Member must know from his daily correspondence, as well as from his own observation, that there are not sufficient houses provided for the people, and that people are living in single rooms, or sometimes in two rooms and sharing a kitchen or bathroom. It should be the intention of the Government that as quickly as possible plans should be made for the conversion of those buildings, and their modernisation, so that they can be made into decent separate dwellings.<br/>
The first thing the Clause will do, if carried into effect, will be to delay modernisation, and to hold up conversion of such buildings. Already people are living in these conditions; this does not mean that they will be prevented from living in them in the future. We want to see that these conditions shall be alleviated to the greatest possible extent as quickly as possible. Many of these houses were once very fine houses, but they are now outmoded. Often they have pleasing Georgian or Regency exteriors, which should be retained. It would be a great shame if many of them were swept away, or torn down and replaced by modern streamlined buildings quite out of keeping with the character of the neighbourhood. Can it be said that because a man is laying out money by turning the interiors of such buildings into decent modern separate dwellings, he is doing something which ought to incur penalties, and make him liable to pay development charge? It used to be considered a virtue to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before. Here the Government are seeking to place a penalty upon a man who seeks to turn one dwelling into two or more. That may be good planning, but it is bad policy.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
This Amendment, which was proposed in such forceful and felicitous terms by my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeen (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley), relates to a Clause which proposes to do away with certain doubts. I feel that my hon.


Friend rather flattered the Government when he asked them what the effect of this Clause was on the levying of development charges in respect of the process of conversion. It seems to me, from a study of the Clause, that the answer must be that with the Clause as at present drafted, a development charge must clearly be levied on those processes of conversion. Under Clause 10 of the Bill, which we are at present discussing, planning permission is required in respect of development to he carried out, and development includes
<q>the making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other land.</q>
The process of conversion is, by this part of the Clause, defined as being "a material change" of use. That being so, it seems to me that, as the Clause stands, it must follow that the process of conversion is liable, under Clause 62, to the levy of a development charge.<br/>
I note that the right hon. Gentleman expresses agreement that that is, in fact, the position arising under this Clause as it stands. It is because that is the position, and because we think that is a wrong position, that we wish to have this Clause amended in the sense expressed in the words on the Order Paper. My hon. Friend rightly stressed the importance of this particular matter in relation to the great question of housing the people of this country. The business of town planning is not solely concerned with amenity; it is not solely concerned with trying to restrict bad or inaesthetic development. At least an equally important part of any right concept of town planning is an insistence on its positive aspect of promoting good development. If that is true in normal times, how much more is it true today, when we have this enormous shortage of housing accommodation, and when we can see, from the lamentable failure of the housing policy, and from the retreat of the Minister of Health even from the modest target for 1947, that we shall have a very small contribution towards the solution of this problem by way of erection of new houses.<br/>
Because that is so, it makes it doubly important that we should try to stimulate the provision of additional housing accommodation by getting appropriate conversion, and that we should not try to fetter and restrict it, as would be done

by the Clause as it stands, which imposes an obligation of a development charge on people who try to expand housing accommodation by the processes of conversion. What is the argument against it? The right hon. Gentleman insisted, in Committee upstairs, that it was necessary that we should retain the obligation to get town planning permission for these processes of conversion. He put that forward primarily on aesthetic grounds. I said then, and I repeat, that no one attaches more importance than I do to these aesthetic questions. I wholly associate myself with what my hon. Friend has said. We naturally desire as much as anybody to retain, for example, the pleasing Georgian elevations to which he has referred. Many of these processes of conversion are, in fact, internal processes; the structural alterations are internal and the pleasing facades remain undestroyed and unimpaired. Those are the processes of conversion which we have in mind; to the outer view the appearance is the same, but inside, instead of housing one person uncomfortably, the houses are housing several people in a way which is reasonably appropriate to the social and economic realities of our day. That is the sort of conversion we have in mind.<br/>
Is it necessary to subject that sort of conversion to the necessity of obtaining town planning permission in order to prevent the possibilities of deterioration of amenity? It is not, because, of course, these internal processes of structural alteration are governed by the necessity of obtaining by-law permission. Town planning permission under this Bill will have to be sought from the more remote planning authority, that is to say, the county council, but by-law permission is the concern of the local authority, the borough council or the county district council. Therefore, it imposes a closer supervision upon these processes than anything that can be exercised by a town planning body. The case is clear that the processes of conversion are valuable as an addition to housing accommodation. It is also clear that they can be carried out, even if exempted from the necessity of obtaining permission, and therefore incurring a liability for development charge, without undue fear of deterioration of amenity or standard.<br/>
As my hon. Friend so persuasively pointed out, the alternatives, if we do


not take this course, are two. One is that large houses will continue unconverted, housing one or two people, uncomfortably and unsuitably, in a way in which I am sure the hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. McAllister) and the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher), both from different points of view, would agree in condemning as undesirable. The second possibility is that these large houses will become the homes of a great many families without the necessary structural alterations being carried out. They will be large houses housing many families without the necessary alterations and amenities which are desirable. That is the quickest way in which the right hon. Gentleman can promote the growth of slums in this country. We do him the credit of believing that that is not his intention. Therefore, I most strongly urge that we should assist in the solution of the problem of housing the people of this country by trying to stimulate this process of house conversion, and that we do so by incorporating this Amendment in the Clause.</p>

<p>More and more am I amazed at the language which is used on the other side of the House, when hon. Members want to serve some particular purpose. I listened to the hon. Member for Hertford (Mr. Walker-Smith) telling us that there are houses in this country in which one family lives uncomfortably because the houses are too big.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is making a very jejune point. Surely it is within his knowledge, and the knowledge of the House, that in bygone spacious days there were large houses which could only be lived in with certain social amenities and ancillaries, in particular a large domestic staff. Those conditions have passed away, and I do not regret it, but it makes any attempt to perpetuate them quite unsuitable.</p>

<p>I would advise the hon. Member, when he is talking to me, that if he is not prepared to use English he might try Scottish. I am not sure that I am sufficiently well acquainted with languages to get the full meaning of the word "jejune." Perhaps he will explain it to me later. In spite of what he says about the changed conditions of today, there are in this country many houses

which I should like to see converted. I Think the Minister also would like to see them converted. The hon. Member for Hertford and his friends would not like to see them converted. The occupants of these houses may live uncomfortably, but they would live much more uncomfortably if the accommodation were taken away and given to other people.<br/>
I have in mind houses that have been vacated, not because they were too big for the occupants, but because the area in which the houses were built gradually began to be used by the local authorities for housing, and the proletariat began to encroach The owners of the houses wanted to get far far away from such associations, so the houses were vacated. Some of the houses which I have in mind which were formerly occupied by one family are now occupied by six families. There are a common kitchen, a common bathroom and lavatory accommodation on the ground floor and the same facilities upstairs. That does not alter the fact that there are six separate dwellings. Some hon. Members appear to think that if everyone has not got a bathroom, lavatory accommodation, and a kitchen of their own, they are not living in separate dwellings, but I assure them that they are separate dwellings. If hon. Members had lived as I have lived in a tenement, they would know that there may be three separate dwellings on each landing. We had no bathrooms at all in most of those houses. There was a common lavatory at. the stair head, but they were separate dwellings. In the same way in the converted houses which I have in mind there are six separate dwellings, three below and three above.<br/>
No one can say that no notice should be taken of that and that no development charge should be made. Naturally, this must be taken into account in connection with planning. The planning authority must take account of all the large houses that can be converted, and when they see that conversion is taking place, development charges should be made. Of course, the system must be controlled and regulated in a way which will avoid the horrible system existing in many parts of Glasgow, where there are places which are not separate dwellings. There are places where three families live together in one big room. They may hang a sheet across the room to get a


measure of privacy. We must get rid of that sort of thing. Surely, we should ensure that these large houses are converted.<br/>
6.15 p.m.<br/>
The suggestion has been made that if there is a development charge, the person who owns the property will allow the house to stand empty. Anyone who can get hold of one of these large houses will be ready to convert it into a dwelling for two, three or more families. The mere fact that there is to be a development charge will not he any handicap. If I were interested in property&#x2014;I am not&#x2014; I could get hold of quite a number of houses which, at present, are only partially in use. I would do my best to get the tenants taken out and put into more comfortable conditions, and would make use of these houses for reconversion purposes. I would turn them into two, three or four separate dwellings and I would gladly face any development charge. It would make a very useful contribution to the development plans of local authorities, and it would also be a profitable business for the individual who had control of the property. I do not think that the Minister should give any consideration to the Amendment. He should keep the Clause as it stands.</p>

<p>Hon. Members on this side of the House believe that it is far better to have six separate kitchens, and that is why we put forward this Amendment. We believe, for reasons which have been made absolutely clear, that there will be a great deterrent to people who would wish to convert houses into flats. In a constituency such as mine, which is largely rural, there are in the countryside and in

the larger towns a number of houses which are large by modern standards and which might well be converted into two or more flats. That work has been in progress, but unless this Amendment is carried, there is a grave danger that it will not continue. It is in the interests of the housing drive that more accommodation should be made available. We should also remember the amenity aspect of the matter. Many of these houses have considerable architectural merits, and it would be a misfortune if they were allowed to deteriorate and perhaps eventually fall down.<br/>
I think perhaps the Minister does not appreciate, in regard to the development charge, what a very indefinite position exists from the point of view of an owner who wishes to convert. He knows very little indeed, about the nature of the development charge, and he can do nothing but make the wildest guess at what it will be. In other words, he is entering into a complete gamble. In most cases, the conversion of a house into three or six flats, whatever it may be, is not likely to bring in much more rent. It is a pity that the Minister should go out of his way to discourage owners from doing this. I hope he will consider the Amendment most seriously.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman who moved this Amendment said that we were confronted here with a conflict between politics and policy. I think we are confronted with a conflict between one policy and another, both legitimate in their own way, but requiring to be balanced one against the other. The policy with which the Minister is very properly concerned is the policy, first, of preserving the amenities of our countryside and towns, and, secondly, of acquiring for the State the development benefit which comes from the aggregation of people together in a given area. These are the two main purposes in this Bill, and they are legitimate and worthy purposes. As against that, we have to consider the point which has been made here that there is an overriding, catastrophic and calamitous shortage of housing accommodation in Britain, and that anything we can do to stimulate a solution, even an unorthodox solution, of that problem, is something that we ought to do.<br/>
I had my daughter to lunch today, and I rejoice to say that, after two years of effort, with considerable priority&#x2014;because


she is a war widow with a child&#x2014;she has, at last, achieved an ambition of several years' standing to have a home of her own. She is now accommodated in a Nissen hut, and there are 5.000 people on the list of the local authority in whose area she lives, who have not even got a Nissen hut. When housing conditions are in that catastrophic state, I argue that the very proper ambitions which the Minister has in this Bill may require to be qualified by reference to the practical urgencies of the situation. In the light of that, I invite the House to look at the effect of the Clause.<br/>
First of all, there is no doubt that the Clause implies that the owner who wants to convert a house into a series of smaller messuages&#x2014;I think that is what they are called&#x2014;has to get permission, not the ordinary approval under the by-laws of the local authority, but a special development permission. This country is rapidly becoming strangled by the necessity to get permission. We have not quite got to the stage when we require permission to sneeze, but we are not far off it, and the cumulative effect of all these permissions, in slowing down the mechanism of life in Britain and the rate of production is, in my view, incalculable, and we ought not to do anything to make any obligation to get an additional permission unless it is overridingly important that we should do so.<br/>
I submit that, in what the Minister is concerned about, that is, amenity exteriors, he can get all he wants under the present by-law permission from the local authority, and that he does not need this special development permission in order to secure the perfectly legitimate object, which is one of the legitimate objects with which he is concerned. With regard to the second object with which the Minister is concerned, there is no doubt that, under Clause 10, the change in the character of a building by converting it from one dwelling-place into a number, would attract to the owner the necessity of paying development rights. Here, again, we have to balance theoretical desirability with practical needs. In every other sphere of life, when we want to get extra effort, we offer an inducement for it. If we want overtime, we offer a higher rate of pay. If we want larger families, we offer higher rebates of Income Tax, with children's allowances. The one field in which we offer no induce-

ment, but every deterrent and penalty, is in housing the people. The whole of our rating system in this country is a positive and active deterrent to the improvement of property. If a man has a house and wants to make an improvement to it, and he puts plans before the local authority, the first thing that happens is that the rates assessment is increased.</p>

<p>I now gather that the hon. Member does not want it to happen, and if so, he is at one with me, and ought not to describe me as a mountebank. I submit that is not what we want in England or in Scotland. If we do not want it, instead of leaving large houses gradually to deteriorate into that situation&#x2014;which will certainly happen unless the property owner has some incentive to get on with the job on his own account&#x2014;instead of allowing those large houses to deteriorate into a series of tenements, we ought to do everything we can to facilitate their con-version into proper, separate, self-contained apartments for people to live in. That is why one element of policy has to balance against another. Granted that the Minister's objectives in the Bill

are right, granted that we have to preserve the amenities of the town and countryside, granted that society is entitled to share in the development rights which it creates itself&#x2014;granted all that&#x2014;one has still to balance that situation against a housing situation in Britain which, in my view, constitutes the gravest single social problem that this country has to face. The Amendment is an attempt to provide some incentive in that direction, and I hope we shall get something more in response to it than a mere negative from the Minister.</p>

<p>I wish to reinforce some of the arguments that have been used and to add a plea about the rural side of the matter. It is very difficult to begin to visualise, as the Bill is at present, the sort of odds that might be weighted against converting larger houses in the country. I know of many cases where the owners are only too anxious to hand over their big houses and to live in very much smaller ones&#x2014;in many cases they are already living in cottages&#x2014;and to convert the larger houses into accommodation that could be used by those who are actively engaged on work on the land. That would be a very sensible arrangement. As the Bill is at present, however, what can an owner do? What does he know about his position? How does he know what he will be charged or surcharged, or what permissions he will have to get? It is asking a great deal to expect owners of such property, which could be made of very great use to the local community as a whole, to indulge in that sort of undertaking when they feel that they might be penalised for doing so.<br/>
There is another aspect of the matter. We have heard from my hon. Friends and from hon. Members opposite about the single houses. This matter goes a great deal further than that. In London and the great cities&#x2014;in most of them, although not in all of them&#x2014;there are long terraces of larger houses; there are whole streets, circuses, and squares of them. What the position. if this Amendment is not inserted in the Bill? Let hon. Members take the case of the two cities nearest to my constituency, Bath and Bristol, and imagine what could be done if owners were encouraged to do it instead of being debarred and discouraged from doing it. Let hon. Members imagine what could be done in converting those houses, which are rapidly becoming more and more unsuit-


able for those who occupy them, under sound conditions and, obviously, always under the authority of the local authority as regard details. The local authority seems to have been forgotten by all those who oppose the Amendment. It would be of tremendous value to the community if those terraces could be retained, and it would be of value not only from the housing point of view, but because they would add to the aesthetic standard of any other buildings that would be erected in their immediate neighbourhood. In the older towns and cities, where intelligent local authorities have been guided by intelligent architects, the whole feeling of some of the better buildings in a town&#x2014; it may be only a half dozen of them&#x2014;has been carried through into the more modern structures of the town. If we deliberately discourage the conversion of those houses, we shall encourage their destruction, and we shall encourage the omission of all that is finest in our architectural history.</p>

<p>I am a Scotsman like the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher), and I thought that, as I was talking in words of one syllable, he could not hold against me the objection that he held against my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford (Mr. Walker-Smith). I do not think there is anything in this Amendment that would cause these houses to be converted into rabbit warrens. It would do exactly the opposite. Under the Bill there is every encouragement, if there is a low fellow who wants to develop rabbit warrens, for these houses to be turned into rabbit warrens rather than for the owners to go through all the rigmarole, with the risk that is held against them, under the Bill. Those of us who support the Amendment are trying to eradicate that provision from the Bill in order that proper conversion shall be carried out in a proper way and people be decently housed.<br/>
I know some of the housing conditions in Glasgow which the hon. Member for Wes; Fife has in mind. Does he want to see those conditions perpetuated and encouraged? There are terraces in Glasgow now which might very easily become rabbit warrens, unless this Amendment is

accepted. I agree with the hon. Member for Rugby (Mr. W. J. Brown) that the deterrents against those who want to try to help the country and local communities in housing matters are very strong. Things are very difficult, partly because people do not know where they are, and partly because the present Government have removed from the statute book, certainly as regards local areas, the one Act which might have been of assistance. I ask the Minister to consider the Amendment seriously, because I am certain that, unless some Amendment of this sort is accepted, people will not act as quickly and as well as they might act in the interests of the people as a whole.</p>

<p>I want to put a rather different point to the Minister before he replies. Those hon. Members who have spoken hitherto have spoken in terms of the effect which this Amendment may have on the policy of converting houses, and I do not wish to controvert that in any way because I take a somewhat different line, but I am concerned about whether, if this Amendment or an equivalent Amendment is not inserted, the Mininster will not, in fact, confuse the purpose of the Bill and insert certain provisions in it which will prove in practice to be wholly unworkable. The first consideration which obviously applies to this Amendment is the general purpose of the Clause to which it refers. The purpose of the Clause is to define the meaning of the word "development" for the purpose of setting out the circumstances in which the development permission is required and the purposes for which it is desired to institute a development charge. The first part of the Clause contains a definition of development which seems to me to be eminently reasonable and satisfactory. It provides that development consists of a material change in the use to which the land or buildings are put. That seems to be thoroughly satisfactory and absolutely proper. It lays down what each one of us using common sense, would say development was.<br/>
In the Subsection which is under consideration and which it is proposed to amend, I submit that that eminently wise definition is receiving a gloss or interpretation which will lead to infinite confusion. I can well understand that there may be cases&#x2014;we can all imagine them&#x2014;in which the conversion of a dwelling house into


one or more separate dwellings within it might constitute development within the general definition, and I am sure that if we studied the cases in detail there would not be a great deal of difference between the two sides of the House in concrete instances.<br/>
But I can equally imagine cases where the change from one dwelling house to one or more dwellings within it would not constitute development within the meaning of the general definition. propose to give one or two instances. Suppose I am right in thinking that there will be such cases. I am equally right, surely, in suggesting that it is totally inappropriate in such cases to impose either the necessity for a permission, or the institution of a development charge. If it so happens that there are cases in which the change of structure does not, in fact, constitute a material change in the use of the building or the land, it must be totally inappropriate to demand either an additional permission or a development charge. I only refer in passing, because it was so well stated by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford (Mr. Walker-Smith), to the argument which he put forward, namely, that, at any rate, in such cases the existing by-law permissions which are necessary in order to effect structural changes are amply adequate to safeguard the needs of the community.<br/>
This leads me to the second stage of the argument in which I hope to show the learned Attorney-General, who is not in agreement with the point which I have just made, that, in point of fact, he has not fully appreciated the meaning of this Subsection which it is proposed to amend. If he will look at paragraph (<i>a</i>) of Subsection (3), he will see that the criterion of what constitutes development that is not structural change; it is user. Let me pose this question to the learned Attorney-General which, I think, he will recognise as illustrating a reasonable difficulty I suppose that in his earlier days he, like me, practised in the county courts, and he must have been familiar with the constant difficulties which occur in the use of dwelling houses which are subject to the Rent Restriction Acts. One of the most frequent difficulties which occurs is when a tenant of a small artisan dwelling house sub-

lets part of that house without any structural alteration whatever, to somebody who occupies two or three of the rooms and shares the kitchen and sanitary accommodation. That is one of the commonest practices in this country, and, although in many cases the lease demands that the landlord's permission should be obtained before such use is made, it is relatively rare for that formality to be observed, and if there is a permission it is an implied permission arising out of the acceptance of rent.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
What is the position under this Subsection? A tenant of a small dwelling house, of which there are hundreds of thousands in the Kingdom, may take in a lodger who rents as sub-tenant. There may be some argument as to whether he is a lodger or a sub-tenant. He, in fact, rents a room or two rooms for his exclusive use, together with the share of the sanitary accommodation and the kitchen. Under this Subsection, that will be the use of two separate dwellings in a building previously used as a dwelling house. I defy the right hon. and learned Gentleman to dispute that. That would be the use of a conversion of a single small artisan's dwelling house into two or more separate dwellings.</p>

<p>I entirely agree. That has been the law since the Conservatives so enacted in 1932. Since the Interim Development Order was passed, any such change in user would have required a development permission. We are not altering the law in that respect. We are adopting the law as passed by a Conservative Parliament.</p>

<p>I am delighted to find that the learned Attorney-General should think that a law passed by a Conservative Parliament is one which he would wish to perpetuate. I suggest for his consideration that although, admittedly, Conservative laws are all good, they are not all perfect. We are not discussing a Measure which will perpetuate a state of law which, I submit in all seriousness, is in practice unworkable and has not, in fact, worked. It is fantastic to suggest that when a tenant of a small dwelling house sublets one or more of the rooms in that house to a sub-tenant or lodger and thereby, as the Attorney-General agrees, converts it into two or more dwelling houses, the whole appara-


tus of the Town and Country Planning Act should come into existence, as the learned Attorney-General agrees to be the case. A permission has to be sought from the town planning authority; a development charge will, I suppose, become applicable, and elaborate sums will have to be worked out because a single room in a working class dwelling house has been altered. I see the force of some part of what the Minister may have in mind. I concede at once that a change of structure might, within the meaning of the general definition, constitute a material change in the user of the land or building. But I submit that the kind of criterion that he here proposes, puts a gloss or interpretation on the general definition which is not satisfactory at all, and will only tend to lead the law into confusion and even contempt.</p>

<p>The House will probably agree that we have spent far too long on this and the previous Amendment in relation to the available time. We have spent nearly two hours on them, and if hereafter hon.

<p>Yes, I do. I say there has been a great deal of unnecessary repetition in the discussions on the last two Amendments. I do not say every speech was unnecessary. For instance, the speech of the hon. Member for Oxford (Mr. Hogg) was a perfectly proper intervention; but there has been a great deal of unnecessary repetition. Moreover, this Amendment was dealt with at considerable length in Committee. What is the case that has been put up? I understand the case of the hon. Member for Oxford. He adopted a very familiar device in Debate. He took the extreme case and proved that the extreme case, if pressed to its logical conclusion, may be rather hard or difficult, or even absurd, and then he attempted to establish that, therefore, the whole case that is put up is equally absurd. I agree with him, it is absurd. I say straight away, it would be absurd so to operate this provision as to require

everybody who lets a couple of rooms in an ordinary small tenement to apply for planning consent.<br/>
The Bill has foreseen that by enabling the Minister to make development orders under which special classes of cases could be exempted from the provisions of the Bill. No doubt, any sensible Minister would consider which were trivial or unimportant cases which would inflict hardship, and which should be exempted from the operation of the requirement to get permission.<br/>
Equally, we recognise that there will be a large number of borderline or marginal cases where, perhaps, theoretically a development charge might be appropriate, but which no sensible person would bother to attempt to collect, possibly even because it would cost more to collect these small charges than would be got out of them. Then again, I have given an undertaking, which will be carried out, that the <i>de minimis</i> cases of development charges will be taken care of, so that there is no attempt to chase after these tiny development charges.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member will allow me to make my own speech, I propose to deal with the points that have been raised. I say to the hon. Member for Oxford, that it is unfair to argue the merits of this Amendment on the basis of these marginal cases. They will be taken care of.<br/>
Let us discuss it on the basis of the normal case. Ought there or ought there not to be an application for consent in the case of a house becoming converted into a number of separate dwellings? The actual provision we are discussing says that it is
<q>For the avoidance of doubt &#x2026;</q>
I think possibly that has been put in out of an abundance of caution, because in my view there really is not any doubt at all. Today, planning permission has to be obtained for the conversion of houses into separate tenements. I speak with some practical experience of this. I was chairman of a town planning committee for many years, and I personally had to


deal with a great many applications of this kind. It was the normal thing for persons wishing to convert to apply for consent. I submit to the House that that was a very wholesome thing, because in that way one was able to secure that the conversion was carried out in the best possible manner, so as to provide the best possible kind of accommodation for the people who were to live in it.<br/>
I would remind hon. Members that local authorities are not always the bogeys they are made out to be in discussions in this House. They have a great deal of experience, and certainly the authority of which I was a member was able to give prospective converters of houses a good deal of valuable advice as to the best way to carry out the development, and developers were very grateful for it. Therefore, I say there is considerable advantage, both to the prospective developers and to the community, in applying for this consent, and in getting the benefit of the experience of the authority in ensuring that the best possible type of conversion is obtained.<br/>
There is another aspect to it. One can well conceive that if in certain areas which are possibly zoned for single family residences&#x2014;and that is a zoning which the 1932 Act and subsequent town planning Measures have always recognised; it has always been recognised as quite a proper thing that certain parts of a town should be reserved for single family residences&#x2014;it were open to owners of houses in such areas freely to convert these single family residences, without having to get consent, it might very well involve a serious change in the character of a neighbourhood. I am not arguing whether that change would be for the better or for the worse, but it would be a very serious change, which could be brought about without any control whatever. If town planning is to be a reality, changes of that kind ought not to be fortuitous; they ought not to be capable of being carried out at the whim of a particular owner. There ought to be some kind of control over changes in the character of a neighbourhood of that kind.</p>

<p>Surely, the Minister would agree that in the case which he has just cited the change would be covered by the general definition at the beginning of the

Clause? For that purpose the Subsection we are now discussing would not be necessary.</p>

<p>I do not agree, because it might be that in each particular case of conversion we could put up the same sort of case as the hon. Member put up himself. It would be the cumulative effect on the neighbourhood with which I am concerned.</p>

<p>It might not be a material change. The kind of conversion which could be made in respect of each separate house might not necessarily be a material change. If these words were not here it would be possible to create a drastic change in the character of a neighbourhood which would not only be a change in itself, but would have considerable repercussions. For instance, it might create a demand for additional schools, and other public facilities of that sort. Surely, the local authority ought to have some voice and some control over the possibility of changes of that kind? At the Ministry we are constantly having representations made to us against the conversion of houses into flats because of the effect it would have on the character of the neighbourhood. I have no particular sympathy with that kind of representation. I recognise the need for additional dwellings, but I do say that an individual has a right to make representations of that kind, and to have them considered. It would be quite wrong if people could, quite freely and without getting any consent whatever, be able to change the character of a neighbourhood. That is what this Amendment is intended to do. We have seen what has happened in a great many parts of London and other large areas. Through this freedom to make changes in the character of houses we have seen the creation of slums from areas which, in the past, have been areas occupied by people of comfortable means; gradually the houses have deteriorated through being occupied by a number of families, without control.<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
That is exactly what this Amendment seeks to perpetuate, and what hon. Members opposite are trying to do. It will have slums created. This is really an Amendment creating the possibility of


making new slums. Hon. Members who have spoken in support of it have suggested that the paragraph to which they object in Clause 10 would have the effect of discouraging an owner from carrying out conversion. I really fail to understand that argument. All that an owner is asked to do is to apply for consent, in the same way as he is required to apply today. There is no deterrent&#x2014;no new deterrent&#x2014;imposed by this Bill. [HON. MEMBERS: "Clause 62."] I am going to deal with that. As to the possibility that he may have to pay a development charge, as I understand some of the argument, it was not even the amount of the development charge that was the deterrent, but the possibility of having to pay an uncertain amount. It will be quite easy, at the time when the application for town planning consent is made, to ascertain what will be the amount of the development charge, if any. There is no additional trouble involved in ascertaining the amount of the development charge; and that, therefore, need not be a deterrent. I cannot understand the mentality of people&#x2014;obviously, hon. Gentlemen opposite speak for them and do understand them&#x2014;who would rather keep their places empty than ascertain what is the amount of a development charge.</p>

<p>I think I am in the re collection of most hon. Members in the House at the time when I say that I never suggested they would rather keep their places empty.

<p>Surely, the alternative is this; Either he will take people into his house, living there in insanitary and bad conditions, without any conversion carried out; or he will carry out the conversion. If he does not carry out the conversion, because of the development charge, he will not keep the house empty. he will fill it in a way that creates slums That is the point.</p>

<p>I really cannot have my speech completely distorted. I used exactly those words&#x2014;that unless he did convert, the place would be turned into a rabbit warren and a slum; and that unless this Amendment- is put in, that is exactly what will happen.

<p>That is the last thing I wish to do. I still fail to understand the meaning the hon. Gentleman put on "deter." However, I shall not press that point.<br/>
To summarise, I say that these provisions are necessary in order to prevent the creation of slums and to exercise better control over the development of a neighbourhood; I say further, that the marginal, the small, trivial case, that the hon. Member for Oxford referred to, can be dealt with under Clause II and that it would be the sensible thing to exempt cases of that kind. For what it is worth, I am prepared even to give an assurance that such classes of cases will be dealt with in a development order. In other cases, I submit to the House, it is important to keep this control. As regards the small development charge, on that again, I have given the assurance that it will not be levied. I submit, further, there need be no feeling whatever on the part of an owner that he is being deterred from carrying out this kind of conversion.</p>

<p>I really do not think it lies in the mouth of the right hon. Gentleman to complain that too much time has been taken over the discussion of this Amendment. I say that for two reasons. In the first place, the Amendment is an extremely important one


There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who are affected by the terms of this Clause. In the second place, if the right hon. Gentleman seeks to divert the criticism which has been made from this side of the House by saying that in 90 per cent. of the cases the Clause will not be used, then I should have thought it was not beyond the wit of man to devise a suitable Amendment to his own Clause to make that clear on the face of the Bill, or, at least, to intimate to the House what the main lines of his exemptions are to be. We really cannot allow a Clause to go forward on the footing that the Minister will, in some way or another not clear to him, I think, and certainly not to us, exempt 90 per cent. of those whom it affects. That is the acme of bad legislation.<br/>
What is the gist of the case? I do not wish to repeat what has been so well argued, if I may say so, from the benches behind me. But the whole question is, that this Clause seeks to prevent the creation of separate dwellings within an existing large house. I very much doubt whether it does effectively cover the case where there are no separate dwellings in the structural sense created. Perhaps the right hon. and learned Attorney-General, who made an interjection which I did not quite follow a little time ago, will tell me if I am wrong about this. Are there not numerous cases where we have two families living within the same structure, but not living in separate dwellings within the meaning of the Rent Restriction Acts? I think he will agree that that is so. There has been a good deal of litigation on that. We often find that we have two or more families living in the same house, and the court says they are not living in separate dwellings because they are sharing a great deal of accommodation. That is the kind of thing that leads to the rabbit warren. I am afraid that the rabbit warren will escape control as the Clause stands, and I hope that the Minister will look at that again. I raised this question, with much more particularity than I can now, in Committee on the Scottish Town and Country Planning Bill, and could not get an adequate answer.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman seeking greater control, so as to cover those cases as well?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1572.0" hansard_membership_id="11310" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30031" speakername="Mr. Reid" colnum="1572" time="">
<p>What I am saying is that I think this Clause has got it completely wrong. This Clause is controlling the desirable form of development, the splitting of a big house into several structurally complete flats. That is a desirable form of development which ought to be encouraged, but I gravely doubt whether this Clause will control people going into a big house in large numbers and sharing accommodation, because they will not then be in separate dwellings within the meaning of the law. My criticism is that it is preventing the creation of separate dwellings, which are desirable, and permitting the association of large numbers of people in one structure, without having separate dwellings, which is highly undesirable. I see no objection to control being taken to prevent people associating in one house where there are no separate dwellings, but the creation of separate dwellings ought to be exempt from control. I do not want to repeat the arguments put forward on that point, which are particularly well founded at this time when accommodation is so short.<br/>
Is this being introduced to scrape together development charges which will never be very much, but will nevertheless be hampering or is the basis of this something different? If it is fiscal, the right hon. Gentleman would be well advised to give up any small gain he might derive so as to encourage good development. The right hon. Gentleman says that this sort of thing will not hamper conversion, but surely it is common knowledge that the balance between converting, on the one hand, and continuing to use a house for a single family, on the other, is often very small. Very often people convert partly because they see their way to make a small profit, or partly because they think it is in the public interest to make accommodation available for more families. In a case in balance like that, an owner is not going to the trouble, or chance the insecurity, involved in making this additional application for permits. The right hon. Gentleman spoke as if only one application were necessary but there are two: the person has first to go to the planning control for permission to make an alteration, and worse than that, he then has to go to the Central Land Board to assess the development charge. It may be all right to go to the planning


control, although in many cases they may be some distance away, but to go to the Central Land Board and lay yourself open to pay a development charge which may be far more than it ought to be, is not what a great many people will do. I have no hesitation in saying that the effect will be to prevent a large number of desirable conversions. On the other hand, it will encourage a large number of undesirable conversions, because if property</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 10, line 22, to leave out paragraph (<i>b</i>).<br/>
I think it may be convenient to the House, Sir, if I take, with this Amendment, the Amendment in line 25, as they run together. The House will see that paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Subsection (3) is quite as curious as the Subsection which has recently been the subject of such hot debate. For the avoidance of doubt we are told by Subsection (3, <i>b</i>) that

<q>the deposit of refuse or waste materials on land may involve a material change in the use thereof, notwithstanding that the land is comprised in a site already used for that purpose, if the superficial area of the deposit is thereby extended.</q>
That means that if a man takes a cartload of ash, and tips it where ashes have been tipped for years, he will not have to apply for permission from the county council, provided that the ash falls where ashes have fallen before. But if, by any chance, some of the ash falls where ash has not fallen before, then, by this Sub-


section, that may involve a material change in use. I understand that the Minister will suggest that it must involve a change in use, in view of an Amendment he has on the Order Paper. Is it not carrying control beyond all reasonable limits to say that the use of existing areas shall be subject to planning permission merely on account of extending an area, which is now used for tipping, by a matter of a yard, or a few yards?<br/>
I suggest that it is carrying legislation to farcical limits, and that it may have a serious effect on various industries. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, in my part of the world one of the problems. is iron ore extraction, and what happens afterwards. Part of that process involves depositing large quantities of waste on the land from which the iron ore has been extracted. The right hon. Gentleman has seen the great ridges which have been caused by that extraction, and he knows that we on this side of the House have been pressing for some time for action to be taken in that matter. We do not want to see that industry hampered, or extraction prevented in proper cases. But if we apply this Subsection to that industry, every new cut of iron ore will mean that waste which has to be tipped into a fresh part of the same area will involve obtaining planning permission. I agree that if iron ore extraction is taking place in one field planning permission is not needed for every bit of the superficial area covered by the waste, but that if an extension of extraction is required in another field planning permission has to be obtained. But this Subsection goes to farcical limits, and I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman should put something more reasonable into the Bill. I hope he will give an assurance on this point, although assurances are not so satisfactory as words in an Act.<br/>
Apparently, a person can build up an ash-heap as high as it will go until it becomes a complete eyesore, without any control over it, provided he does not extend the superficial area by a foot. One of the best ways of using this waste is to fill up disused quarries, and places of that sort. That could be an extension of the superficial area without impinging on the skyline, or disfiguring the countryside. An extension of that sort would be subject to planning permission.

This point was discussed in Standing Committee, and I had hoped that the right hon. Gentleman would have put down an Amendment to limit the extensive operation of this Subsection.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I thought that, in spite of what my hon. and learned Friend has said, this Amendment was not discussed in Standing Committee upstairs, although some discussion arose on the Question that the Clause stand part. It may well be that we could have disposed of this matter satisfactorily up there, and then it would not have been necessary to take up the time of the House. This appears to be a small Amendment, but in fact it will affect a large number of people. There is a corner of my garden where the refuse and rubbish is dumped which comes out of my house. The dump when created was a small one, but day by day it encroaches upon the area of the land. In strict accordance with this Clause, it would be necessary for me to get development permission to continue to do this, and I might be subject to a development charge. That is the extent of the power which the Government are seeking to take.<br/>
I know that when the right hon. Gentleman comes to reply he will say that it is not his intention to use powers in that way, and that he is proposing to make exemptions by regulation. It is a curious way of avoiding doubt to say exactly the opposite of what one intends to do, and then to take away from oneself the powers by regulation. The fact remains that this Clause gives power to prevent me, and, indeed, a large number of people from dumping house refuse on wasteland in the garden. The right hon. Gentleman may say that he is not proposing to require development permission to be granted in the case of the creation of minor private dumps. It is true that the rubbish from my house only covers an inch or two more of ground in the course of each week, but all dumps grow in that way. Whether he can find words which are adequate to describe the nature of the rubbish dump which he intends to bring within the provision of this Clause is exceedingly doubtful. I think that he will have to take account of the dump which he seeks to avoid, and his regulation will


still be extremely confusing if he seeks to define the kind of dumping arrangement which is to be exempt, while leaving some arrangements to be included within the provisions of this Clause. It seems, therefore, that the words in the Clause are not apt for the purpose which I think we all desire to see carried out. In other words, there should be some control of the creation of vast unsightly heaps of ash, rubbish and tin cans which have disfigured the countryside.<br/>
All that this paragraph does is to bring within the category of development an extension of the superficial area to be covered by the deposit of refuse. Many deposits of rubbish already cover a large superficial area, and, as I read this paragraph, it would be open to those who deposit refuse on such dumps to continue to do so, provided that instead of spreading it outwards, they spread it upwards. The Clause would enable a huge mountain of tin cans and ash to be reared up so as to dominate the countryside, without any fear of town planning control, whilst preventing what might be a useful expansion of the same heap over a low-lying piece of country, and enabling derelict marsh land to be built up and used for some proper purpose.<br/>
I do not believe that that is the right hon. Gentleman's intention, but the words which are used clearly exempt a growing mountain from the provisions of the Clause. If we avoid doubt by stating clearly that the deposit of refuse is a development if the superficial area of the deposit is extended the implication is that it is not a development if we do not extend the superficial area. So long as we merely make a mountain grow upwards, we can keep on dumping and be outside the purview of the Bill. For those reasons, I think that this paragraph is wholly objectionable.</p>

<p>I do not think that hon. Members have directed their minds to the merits of the particular paragraph which they want to delete. The mover of the Amendment did not say a word about being in favour or not of controlling land used for the deposit of refuse.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1579.1" hansard_membership_id="8885" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30783" speakername="Mr. Manningham-Buller" colnum="1579" time="">
<p>This is the second time in a short period in which the right hon. Gentleman has misquoted me. I said that the right thing was to give

planning permission, if it meant permission for the opening up of a fresh area. If one went into another field to make a fresh deposit or one wanted to raise the height of it, my argument was that that should require permission.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1580.0" hansard_membership_id="12144" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20639" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1580" time="">
<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman did not say whether or not he was in favour of this particular method of controlling refuse deposit. All he did was to rather ridicule the idea by saying that an extension of an inch or so of the area of development would involve an application. Surely, the purpose of this paragraph is clear, and it seems to me unobjectionable. We cannot attempt by planning legislation to deal with existing refuse dumps, although that may be possible by other means. It may be possible under another Clause for them to be removed by Order, but this Clause deals with their extension. We say that existing refuse dumps cannot be dealt with at all, or can be dealt with under some other Clause. We can prevent their extension without consent.</p>

<p>Yes, outwards but not upwards. We are going to control the use of additional land for these purposes. I know one can always argue about another inch. Supposing we concede that a person can use 10 per cent., what happens if, when that 10 per cent. has been used, more is wanted? We have to draw a line somewhere and we must draw that line firmly and say&#x2014;"If you want to go beyond that, you have to apply for further consent." It does not follow that that consent will be refused. The rule in these cases is the amount of land that is at present used for these purposes, and it seems to me that, if we are to plan at all, we must regard the use of land for this possibly obnoxious purpose, as something which is subject to control. I have still to learn whether the mover and seconder of this proposal are in favour of that control or not. They really rested their case on the <i>de minimis</i> consideration and a good deal of the speech of the seconder was taken up with his particular garden. As far as his garden is concerned, we have taken great care to cover him. We had in mind his garden when we drafted Clause 10(1, <i>c</i>), and if he will examine that he will see that he can


do what he likes with his garden and no one will interfere with him. It is when land is used other than that within the compass of a dwelling house and its confines that this Bill regards it as appropriate that there should be control.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1581.0" hansard_membership_id="8885" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30783" speakername="Mr. Manningham-Buller" colnum="1581" time="">
<p>The right Gentleman dealt with the point of the garden, I hope to the satisfaction of my hon. Friend the Member for South Hendon (Sir H. Lucas-Tooth), but he has not dealt with industries like the iron and ore industry where land is used for tipping. Under this Clause every time there is a tip, a fresh application has to be made for permission. The right. hon. Gentle- man has excluded areas where dumping has taken place already, but in his reply he said that for any addition to that area there must be planning permission, so that, if there is a new extract of iron ore, to tip the waste will mean a new application.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1581.1" hansard_membership_id="12144" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20639" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1581" time="">
<p>Only a person devoid of sense would imagine that he had to apply for permission every time he covered an additional inch of ground. Presumably, the owners of the industry will acquire land for the express purpose of tipping, and they will presumably apply for consent for that land to be used for that purpose, but they will not have to go to the county council for permission every time there is an extra cover of earth on to the land.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has apparently thought of the private garden, but I do not think that he has thought at all of the ordinary industrial tipping operation. Surely he knows very well what will happen. A light railway will be constructed along the top of the dump, and the waste will be put into trucks, which would be run to the edge and tipped over. Every time a truck is tipped, the land occupied is extended. The right hon. Gentleman says that an undertaking will acquire authority to use a certain area of land, and it will not be only that land for which they will apply, but what is to happen on the appointed day, when no one has any authority and no one has received any permission? They have not made an application because the Bill did not exist. To comply with the law, every one of these trucks

will have to be stopped at a certain point, until a new application is made. I think the right hon. Gentleman is well meaning, as always. I think he is probably trying to do something good, but the Clause, as it stands, is a perfectly lunatic way of trying to do it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 11, line 1, after "that," to insert:

This part of the Clause deals with resumption of a normal use where land is being used on the appointed day for a use which is not its normal use. The effect of this Amendment is to secure that the paragraph does not permit resumption without planning permission if that use was originally instituted in contravention of the planning control.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 11, line 9, at the end, to insert:
<q>(<i>b</i>) In any county or part of a county in respect of which a development plan has for the time being not been made and approved under the foregoing provisions of this Act the authority which if this Act had not been passed would have been the Interim Development Authority.</q>


This Amendment goes with the following one&#x2014;on page line 14, at end, to insert:
<q>(2) Before determining any application for permission to develop land, the authority referred to in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the foregoing subsection shall consult with the local planning authority.</q>
With permission I will deal with both together as they involve the same point, which is shortly this: This Bill makes a change in the local planning authorities. Up to now they have been identical with the housing authorities that is to say, in the counties they have been county districts, but now the local planning authority is to be the county council. It will be some time before these new authorities have found their feet, and before they have carried out what the Bill enjoins on them&#x2014;the preparation of a survey, and the subsequent development plan. Therefore, it is certain that a considerable period of time must elapse before these new local authorities are in a position to deal with applications which will come before them. The purpose of the Amendments which we are now considering is to ensure that in that interim period before the new authorities are under way, the old planning authorities who have hitherto dealt with applications for consent should continue to function, but that in doing so they should consult the new planning authority, namely, the county council, so as to ensure that in giving or refusing consent they are, to the best of their ability, acting in conformity with the desire of the new planning authority.<br/>
It is really a machinery provision designed to ease over this difficult transition period from the old system to the new. It is, of course, of great public importance because we are all very anxious to see the work of development proceeding unchecked. Housing is a great necessity and in passing this legislation and agreeing, as we are, to the change of authorities, we wish to ensure that the change shall not be allowed to hamper the provision of necessary development. There is a further advantage in this proposal. Anyone wishing to build a house today has to go to the housing authority and obtain by-law consents. While they are scarce he has also to obtain from the local authorities permits for the necessary building materials. Although planning is taken

out of the hands of the county district housing authorities by this Bill, the other functions to which I have alluded still remain with them. The county districts will still be the authorities for by-law purposes and will continue to handle the permits for materials. The developer who proposes to proceed will have to obtain one set of consents from the district council and, under this Bill, another from the county council for the planning consents.<br/>
I earnestly impress upon the Government and upon the House that at this time it would be very unwise to change horses too suddenly in the middle of the stream. These existing housing authorities are well accustomed to handling planning consents, and there will he a great advantage if the man who wishes to develop can go to one authority and obtain all his consents from the same person for the project he has in hand. I think the provision in the second Amendment to ensure consultation with the planning authority will obviate any risk of a clash or conflict between the consents given and the ultimate design of the plan. In general, as a matter of administration, the way the proposal would work would be that the interim development authorities, on whom we are proposing to confer the power of giving development consent in the interim period, would have a consultation with the new authority, the county council, and determine the lines on which they should proceed. They would have a general sailing direction from the new authority as to how far they should go in giving these consents. If that were done I apprehend that the time of everybody would be saved, and I am sure that it would obviate the risk of undue delay in granting these permissions.<br/>
There is another consideration which applies particularly to our rural districts. I will refer, by way of example, to the county of which I have the honour to represent part&#x2014;namely, Gloucestershire. It is a very long and straggling county with, on the whole, difficult communications. It is split up into a number of rural districts such as, for example, the North Cotswold rural district and the Northleach rural district. These remote villages are a long way from Gloucester, and there is no habitual travelling between them and Gloucester. Apart from its geo-


graphical connections Gloucester might be in another county as far as the inhabitants of these remote areas are concerned. This Bill makes it necessary for the developer to obtain a planning consent before any development can proceed. I think it is asking too much of people in these isolated parts to require them to journey all the way to a county town which is very difficult and expensive to get at unless one has a motor-car. Time will be lost by the mere physical difficulty of travelling to and fro. I do not deny that when the new county authority get into their stride it will be possible to arrange for them to delegate some of their authority outwards, or to arrange some postal system of application for these permits. But at the present time, until they have got into their stride, it will be quite impossible for them, having taken on these new functions, suddenly to have the necessary knowledge at their disposal to say whether the permission should or should not be given.<br/>
What will happen if this Amendment is not accepted is this. When the county authority receive a request for permission to develop they will, in fact, consult the rural district council and be guided by them as the only source of knowledge that is possessed. A man will be put to all the difficulty and possible delay of having to apply to the county council. and I think it is very important that these local authorities who have in the past discharged these planning functions with great success on the whole, should continue to do so until the new authorities are well established. For these reasons, we have put down these Amendments which are in no sense hostile to the Bill but are designed to produce a workable device for the interim period and provide a greater facility to the builder in that he could obtain all his consents in one place instead of dealing with widely dispersed rural authorities. I earnestly commend this suggestion to the House and to the Government.</p>

<p>As one who has for a considerable number of years served on one of these planning authorities comprising representatives of a number of rural district councils, I am rather alarmed that there is any question about there being a gap between the old procedure and the new. Many of the applications which come

before an authority of that kind&#x2014;although some may seem somewhat trivial and deal with such things as tool sheds and alterations to cow stalls concern alterations which are in some degree urgent, and which it would not be possible to hold up even for a short time without the greatest inconvenience. If there is any break at all, any period during which it is difficult for these applications to be submitted, I am quite sure from my experience that there will be a tendency to evade the regulations, a tendency which up to now has fortunately not been very widespread. It would be a great pity if any encouragement were given to it the present time.<br/>
These applications will have to be considered from two points of view, first with regard to siting and second with regard to what is called, in Clause II (3) (<i>a</i>), "design or external appearance." With regard to siting, I agree that there is some difficulty as the plan, if there is one already in existence, is being revised under this Bill. Nevertheless, I believe it will be quite possible to meet this difficulty because, although I do not know what the practice is in other counties, in Dorset where we have always been well ahead with our planning provisions, the consultant to the joint committee is the same as the consultant who is in touch with the county council. In fact, therefore, there will be perfect co-ordination, and any change in view with regard to the plan will be fully provided for. With regard to the question of design and external appearance, it seems important that these matters should be seen to. We have been at great pains in our area, which includes many villages built of stone, to maintain design and I can see no reason at all why the interim authorities should not go on laying down their ideas on this matter. Finally. I would like to say again how important it is that there should be no break between the old system and the new. As far as the area which I represent is concerned, I can see no difficulty at all in going on without any break</p>

<p>May I briefly support my right hon. Friend's Amendment? I have here the figures of the average monthly applications made to my own planning authority, and in the whole district there are 15o applications, large and small, a month. Forty, as a matter of fact, come from the town of Harrogate itself. That is only one district out of a


considerable number in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and during this interim period, when the officials of the new authority are not well aware of the general layout of the whole district, there is bound to be a good deal of time-wasting research, made by other officials if the interim development authority is not allowed to continue with these applications. There is a further point which I should like to put before the Parliamentary Secretary. The county district councils are to be consulted about the development plan. That is all to the good, but it seems to be quite unnecessary for them to transfer to the county councils the work of considering these development applications during the transitional period in order to transfer them back again at a later date. It is an extravagant waste of time and manpower, and I think that is a very strong argument for the acceptance by the Minister of my right hon. Friend's Amendment.</p>

<p>I associate myself with this Amendment. As the Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate, it has not been moved in any controversial or polemical spirit; it is indeed an Amendment which has the backing of what one might, perhaps, call the local government world, that is to say, local government people who, without distinction of party, are interested in good administration and government. This Amendment was tabled for discussion in the Standing Committee, but like so many other good things it fell under the guillotine, and is therefore brought within the ambit of Parliamentary discussion this afternoon for the first time. The case for it has been made fully and strongly by my right hon. Friend. He stressed the rural side, but of course this matter has its importance also from the urban aspect. What is vital, as has been so well pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Digby), what we must have in these matters, is continuity.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ripon (Mr. York) gave some statistics to show the size of this problem of applications for development from his own experience in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Perhaps I may be allowed to reinforce that illustration on a more general basis. The number of applications for development in 1946, which, for many causes&#x2014;not least the personality and policy of the present Minister of Health&#x2014;was not what one might call

a good year, was extremely large, as can be seen from the following figures. In the administrative county of Leicestershire it was 2,450, in that of Durham 2,10o, in Somerset no fewer than 3,500, and in the administrative county of West Sussex &#x2014;administratively a county, but geographically only part of a county-&#x2014;it was the same large figure of 3,500. Unless this delegation is permitted, unless the terms of this Amendment t are accepted, I can see that we are likely to have a very considerable hold-up indeed in considering and dealing with these applications. We want to see the 'principle of continuity established, and we want to see to it that good and reasonable development is not frozen for reasons of administrative bottlenecks. If we are to avoid that I think this Amendment should be incorporated in the Bill. We on this side of the House, though as I have explained we are not putting it forward in any party spirit&#x2014;it is a matter which carries the good will of local government circles generally&#x2014;urge that the Minister should agree to this Amendment.</p>

<p>I appreciate that this Amendment has not been put forward in any hostile or party spirit. We are dealing with a matter about which there can be honest differences of opinion. We are dealing with the period which will elapse between the passing of the Bill, or the appointed day, and the time the development plan is out, which will be three years forward. Those three years will undoubtedly be a difficult period for the planning authorities and for any one who has to do with planning generally, until the new planning authorities get thoroughly into their stride. What we have done, with the unanimous consent of those who have given the matter thought, has been to place planning functions squarely upon the shoulders of the county councils. It will be their responsibility, after consultation with the district councils, to prepare a development plan. We have to remember that that development plan is going to cover areas considerably wider than those covered by the ordinary planning schemes. Therefore, the only people who will know what is likely to be in that plan, will be the planning authority, that is, the county council. If we now allow the district councils to retain the interim develop-


ment decisions, we may find that they will give decisions arid permissions which will be altogether contrary to what is likely to be in the big plan.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman knows that one of the effects of planning up to now, has been that local planning authorities have been covering too small an area. There has not necessarily been any coordination between them and their next-door neighbours. That is the reason why we are basing these planning units on much wider areas. I think it likely that district councils, if they are to retain the power to grant interim development permissions, will act in accordance with the manner in which they have always acted. They will give those interim development permissions&#x2014;unless, of course, they consult with the county councils, as is proposed by the right hon. Gentleman in the next Amendment&#x2014;in accordance with their conception of planning up to the introduction of this Bill.<br/>
As I say, there can be two opinions about this. My own belief, and it is the belief of my right hon. Friend, is that, on balance, this responsibility for granting interim development permissions should be placed squarely upon the shoulders of the county councils, that is, the new planning authorities. It is inconceivable that, being responsible for carrying out that function, they will not consult with the district councils. Obviously, they will get to know what is in the minds of the district councils, and give the permissions in accordance with that knowledge. The right hon. Gentleman puts it the other way. He would have the district councils operating those interim development per' missions, and would place upon them the obligation to consult the county councils before they grant those permissions. As I have already said, my own feeling and that of my right hon. Friend is that it is far better to place the responsibility for granting such permissions on the shoulders of the new planning authority, because they will naturally be the people who, after the co-ordination of all the plans, will know what is likely to be in the new development plan.<br/>
There is one further point. If the district councils were to retain the power to give these interim development permissions, it would mean that they would have to retain their present planning staffs. We all know, of course, that there is a grave

shortage of planning staffs in the country. It would mean that for three years, at any rate, the district councils would have to continue to employ those staffs. I believe that, with good will and co-operation on all sides, we shall get over this rather difficult period. I am sure that the county councils, in shouldering this new and heavy responsibility, will not fail to consult with the district councils, in order to make the right decisions during the interim period. For these reasons, I sincerely hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not press the Amendment.</p>

<p>The county councils will, of course, have the opportunity of sending people into the districts, and no doubt they will take advantage of that. The hon. Member knows that, after the three years have elapsed, the county councils will have to delegate many of their functions to the district councils. I have no doubt, however, that, in the meantime, the county councils will get over that difficulty by nominating someone to an area to whom would-be developers can apply. I am sure that, with goodwill on all sides, they will get over these difficulties.</p>

<p>I am very disappointed with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said because, as has been pointed out, no party issue is involved in this matter. The real issue is, which is the more practical way of dealing with this interim period? I must say that it is not very satisfactory to be told that the county councils will be able, somehow or other, to get over the impossible burden placed upon them. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, who has had a very great experience in local government, does not really think that a very satisfactory solution for a difficulty of this kind. As a matter of fact, what will happen if the Government resist this Amendment is that there will be an administrative breakdown, so far as the county councils are concerned, and I think the hon. Gentleman had better face that fact. After all, he has reminded


us that a great responsibility is being placed upon the county councils. Does he now propose to add to that responsibility, at a time when their attention should be given to their major responsibilities, the difficult task of dealing with countless development permissions, about which they will know nothing and for which, in point of fact, he knows that they will have insufficient staff? He has suggested that he is going to filch the staffs of the county districts to carry out this work, and, at the same time, has reminded the House that the county districts will have a great deal of work to do because of the powers delegated to them. The Parliamentary Secretary ought to look at this matter again with a view to reversing his decision. It is a matter of what is practical. What the Amendment proposes is the practical way of dealing with the matter, which is the reverse of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.</p>

<p>; Speaking as a representative of a non-county borough in Essex, I must say that I have a good deal of sympathy with this Amendment. It is my opinion, and the opinion of my people, that there will be an administrative breakdown and inevitable chaos if every individual application for permission to alter a house or a shed has to be sent to the county council at Chelmsford. The thing is fantastic, and they have not the staff to deal with it Everyone who has had anything to do with housing for the last few years will know that one of our greatest obstacles has been the shortage of experienced, trained, technical staffs. In our local borough councils, the town clerk and his assistants have a personal knowledge of the applications; they do not need to look up a file on every occasion. My own borough has to deal with over 1,000 applications a year. What will happen when all applications from every borough and urban district of Essex have to go to Chelmsford, I do not know. I sincerely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will provide some better solution to the problem than the one he has just suggested.</p>

<p>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the view which he has put forward. A county that goes forward with

a development plan will not be affected; the Amendment deals only with the case where the county does not go forward with a development plan. There will be a hiatus and an administrative breakdown, and a lack of a development plan by the county while power will not have been given to the county districts to go forward. The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered the question of what is to happen in the interim period. I would illustrate the situation by supposing that one had three brigades to do a job of work, and decided to put the divisional headquarters on top of them. One would hardly say that the brigades were not to do anything until the head quarters had been established. From the point of view of actual planning, I ask that the Parliamentary Secretary should look into this matter again, in a much more favourable light.</p>

<p>I would reinforce the point that there will be administrative chaos, if some arrangement is not made for the interval between the county taking over and the districts giving up their job. We in our districts have had hundreds of applications for development for housing. We think they will be greatly increased in the near future. All this cannot possibly be turned over to the county council. I have been a member of a county planning committee, and of a borough planning committee. A number of hon. Members have directed the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the absolute certainty of an administrative breakdown if some very simple machinery is not set up to get over the break in the planning arrangements. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will think over the matter again.</p>

<p>I also ask the Parliamentary Secretary to remember that Members on this side of the House will be in difficulties if this matter is forced to a Division. Nothing in the Amendment raises any question of development principle at all. If it is accepted, it will not interfere with the working of the Bill, and there is nothing to make the Parliamentary Secretary dig his heels in and resist it. Members who have had a great deal of experience in local authority work are uneasy about the effect that will follow if the Amendment, or something like it, is not accepted. I add my appeal that the Parliamentary


Secretary should consult his right hon. Friend. If the form of words proposed is not acceptable, another form of words should be evolved and introduced at a later stage to cover the essential points. All that is involved is a matter of practical expediency and there is a necessity for some provision of the kind.</p>

<p>After the appeals that have been made to him from all sides of the House the Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider this matter. In the case of the planning authority with which I am acquainted, the machinery indicated by the Government will mean that case after case, already fully considered and fully understood by that committee, will have to go miles away to a new committee which cannot be properly equipped to deal with those matters. People will have to travel after their cases, and thus great delay will be involved in cases which are on the verge of going forward.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary is being pressed on all sides to give way on the Amendment. I should like to say a word or two in his support and to express the hope that he will remain firm in resisting the Amendment. I completely disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich (Mr. Paton) that there is no question of principle. The question of principle is: Who, during the interim period of three years, is the responsible authority for making the survey and preparing the plan? Where is that responsibility to lie?

<p>tical planning, and to me there is no question that the body responsible for making the development plan, and carrying out the survey, should also be the body completely responsible for giving the decision during the interim period. It is fantastic to suggest that the body could not make organisational arrangements in order to meet all the objections that have been raised about the numbers of applications coming in to the county. I am amazed at the suggestions that have been made by hon. Members. Hon. Members have spoken of their own local authorities. My own experience is that a competent local authority or county council can have consultations with the district councils and make adequate organisational arrangements for dealing with the situation.</p>

I am sure there will be good will and co-operation in plenty, but no amount of these can overcome the results of this most unsatisfactory provision.

<p>I beg to move, in page 11, line 27, after "buildings." to insert:
<q>other than agricultural buildings, defined in Section two of the Rating and Valuation (Apportionment) Act, 1928.</q>
Subsection (3, <i>a</i>) of this Clause provides that where permission is granted for the extension, alteration or erection of a building, the approval of the local planning authority may be required with respect to the design or external appearance. The purpose of the Amendment is to ensure that the approval of the local authority to the design and external appearance of buildings shall not be extended to agricultural buildings other than farm dwelling houses. We grant that the design of a farmhouse which is being erected might reasonably be subjected to the aesthetic control of the planning authority, but we say that the planning authority ought not to have power to regard the aesthetic appearance of farm buildings and to say, for instance, that a Dutch barn on a farm or a silo ought not to be allowed because its appearance is utilitarian and not in accordance with the aesthetic standards of the local planning authority concerned. The words in the Amendment are taken from the Rating and Valuation Apportionment Act, 1928, and they are imported because they specifically exclude farm dwelling houses.</p>

<p>I am sorry this Amendment has been moved. I think we all agree that farm buildings can be a very beautiful feature of the rural landscape. I, and many other hon. Members, no doubt, have enjoyed their beautiful lines and colour, and the way in which they fall into the general tone of the landscape. That effect may have been achieved not

by conscious effort but by development. It certainly exists, and it is one of the grandest features of the English countryside. What the Amendment seeks to do is to remove from all control the design of farm buildings. It means that any farmer can erect any kind of an old shack, corrugated iron and wooden places, and all sorts of things, irrespective of their effect on the landscape. I should have thought that anyone interested in farming would have been rather eager to preserve a fine old tradition in farm buildings, and would have wished the design of those farm buildings to be submitted to control. We believe that control of design should be exerted. The designs of course, will be submitted to the agricultural committees concerned, and not to the local authorities. That should satisfy the hon. Member for West Aberdeen (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley), and induce him to withdraw the Amendment. We believe that in the intersts of the rural landscape, the design of farm buildings should be controlled in order to preserve and increase the beauty of future buildings, and, for that reason, we cannot agree to the Amendment.</p>

<p>I very much hope that my hon. Friend will not withdraw this Amendment. Speaking as an owner-occupier in a small way, I am not averse to control, as control, but I am very keen on keeping planners' noses out of the farmyard as much as possible. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I daresay hon. Members opposite are laughing at the thought of instances of crass ignorance on the part of inspectors and officials who are sent out to deal with questions that arise on farms. At the present time a neighbour of mine is trying to build a new bull house. First, he was sent a questionnaire containing 52 questions, one of which asked how many


w.c.'s he proposed to provide. In addition to that, a young inspector came down and asked him what the arrangements for milking would be. I anticipate, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, that you are about to rule me out of Order, so I will not continue with that. I feel, however, that my point that inspectors who just do not know their jobs so often come down to afflict farmers is an important one. For that reason, it would be a very good thing for agriculture if the Minister, in his courteous way, would accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>I quite realise the difficulty in which the Minister finds himself. The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the difficulty in passing, namely, that he wishes to prevent the erection of the unsuitable and non-utilitarian hovels into which animals are sometimes put. I think my hon. Friends are thoroughly in agreement with him there. Our fear&#x2014;and it is a fear which is shared by practically everybody who has anything to do with the erection of farm buildings&#x2014;is that the planning authority will be influenced against what I might describe as a new idea in farm buildings. Today there are lines of thought on the subject of farm buildings which diverge completely from the old-fashioned idea of how farm buildings should be built. For example, there is a completely new trend of thought, that so far as possible the entire farm should be put under one roof. That means a vast expansion and a large span, and it may well be that certain members of the planning authority would consider it to be unsightly, and would consider that too small a span would be very much more beautiful. There we have the aesthetic man and the practical man at variance. We want to avoid the amenity man winning the day over the man who holds the new ideas which are coming into the agricultural industry. If the Bill remains without this Amendment there is every possibility of the town planner winning the day. Although I have admitted that there are difficulties in our Amendment, I cannot feel that there are any safeguards in the Bill to stop the town planner preventing experiment and development along the best lines in providing new farm buildings, and in experimenting along the lines which we desire.</p>

<p>I, too, realise that the Minister has to face certain difficulties in accepting this Amendment.

The House should appreciate, however that the arguments which the Parliament ary Secretary used are contradictory. At the outset of his speech he claimed, I think rightly, that a considerable measure of beauty is the general rule for the farm buildings of this country. In the vase majority of cases those farm building have been designed and constructed without any measure of control. His argument went to show that it could be left to the common sense of farmers to ensure that their buildings are not unsightly. I hope, in view of what has been said, and particularly in view of the remarks just made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ripon (Mr. York)&#x2014;who quite rightly pointed out the trend of thought which is being concentrated on the design of farm buildings&#x2014;that we shall have another word from the Minister before we leave this Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1600.0" hansard_membership_id="12144" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20639" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1600" time="">
<p>I much appreciate the spirit in which this particular Amendment is being discussed. As several hon. Gentlemen have said, there is a conflict of view here. On the one hand, we are anxious to safeguard the beauty of the countryside. That is one of our most precious possessions, and it is something which every hon. Member of this House is anxious to see preserved to the fullest possible extent. That can only be done by a measure of control. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] If we allow people to build freely, without any control at all, we know what we may expect in certain quarters. We may expect shacks, and tin roofs, and all kinds of monstrosities perpetrated in some of the most beautiful parts of the country.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1600.1" hansard_membership_id="6726" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22375" speakername="Mr. York" colnum="1600" time="">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman has just made a most dangerous statement. He has just said we may expect tin roofs. That is the very point we were making. We are frightened that the planners will put up tin roofs, and that half of the new buildings will have them.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1600.2" hansard_membership_id="12144" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20639" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1600" time="">
<p>I think that my broad statement is true, and that everyone who has given consideration to the matter would agree that, without some form of control, there is a danger that the beauty of the countryside will be spoiled. It has to be controlled. I think that most speakers have recognised that. Even the hon. and gallant Member for Totnes (Brigadier Rayner) has recognised that there has to


be some control, only he does not want inspectors in his farmyard. Is it possible to draw a line as between certain farm buildings and others? It seems to me that there is a possible line of demarcation that can be made by regulation or by development order&#x2014;a purely temporary structure, for instance. Obviously, if it were only a temporary structure one would not want to impose planning control on it; although I recognise that it could have a very serious effect on the amenities. But if it should be a temporary building, and is licensed as such there would be no need to exercise planning control. Possibly there are other types of buildings which may be exempted from control similarly. But, as I say, that can be done by regulation.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for Ripon (Mr. York) that there should not be any arbitrary censorship of taste. I wholly agree with him that, if a building serves its purpose, it should not be rejected merely because it does not conform to the aesthetic views of the planning authority. One has safeguards against that. One safeguard is the appeal to the Ministry. There is an appeal, and at the Ministry one has a uniform code and, I hope, a reasonable code. The Minister is answerable to Parliament, and if he adopted the policy of refusing permission to put up a building because that happened to be of a particular design which he did not like, he would soon hear about it in this House&#x2014;quite rightly. That is one form of restriction on the activities of the members of the planning authorities.<br/>
Another suggestion is that we might ask that the planning authorities should be required to consult the agricultural executive committees, which are composed of practical people who realise the needs of the farming industry. I should be prepared to consider safeguards of that kind. I suggest that there must be some form of general control to prevent the worst abuses of building in rural areas. The House will agree that almost more harm can be done by bad building in a rural area than in an urban area. For those reasons, I hope that the Amendment will not be pressed. I give the House the assurance that the safeguards put forward will be seriously considered and provided for in the regulations, and that the farming community need have no fear of any im-

proper interference with their legitimate activities on the score of planning.</p>

<p>I am sure that every Member in the House is anxious to preserve the amenities and attractions of the countryside&#x2014;this green and pleasant land of England. I hope that after the depredations of the Minister it will still remain a green and pleasant land. I have much sympathy with the statement made by the right hon. Gentleman in regard to the local agricultural committees and the National Farmers' Union, and I hope that by these means we can get rid of the difficulty of spoiling agricultural buildings. Anyone who is familiar with the Cotswolds will know how important it is to preserve those beautiful buildings, which go back in the ages and have survived the difficulties of the times. Those buildings and the traditions they represent ought to be preserved in the days in which we live. I hope that the Minister will accept the Amendment, and that he will do everything he possibly can in his capacity as Minister responsible for the Act when this horrible, atrocious and detestable Bill is passed, to preserve all the amenities of the countryside. He will have the sympathy of the House in giving effect to the principles he has just enunciated in his speech.</p>

<p>I was not very convinced by the Minister's speech, because it largely amounted to a contradiction. In the first place, he praised the traditional building in the countryside, and then went on to say that in order to preserve that tradition it was necessary to have some control, without showing any reason why it was likely to fall by the wayside without control. He made no complaint at all that the standard of building was falling. What his control will mean is simply further obstacles being put in the way of getting permission from the many authorities before one can build. It means further obstacles and further delay. I was not very convinced when he said he was going to call in aid the agricultural executive committees. We all hope that they are composed of practical farmers, but farming is a very different thing from reading plans. As every architect knows, a client can easily be taken in by putting the right colour on a plan. It is not easy for amateur architects to read plans. I do not think this is at all a suitable task to give to members of the agricultural


executive committees. The Minister says that he wants this control, but he has already got the control under the by-laws, and the local surveyors and staff are, surely the best people to assess whether agricultural buildings are suitable or not for their purpose. It is surely unnecessary to put on a further control above what is already there and necessary.</p>

<p>I believe there is considerable agreement in the House that we want to preserve the amenities of the countryside. As a general rule, the countryman has a much better aesthetic taste than a townsman. A great handicap today to one wishing to put up a building is not only getting the required materials, but the number of plans which have to be passed. That is holding up the production of food as never before. If officials are required to look at the buildings further development of the countryside will be held up, and although I welcome the Minister's statement I think we had better leave the countrymen to look after these matters, and allow them to get on. Whether we divide or not on this Amendment, I hope that we shall be able to prevent this further imposition on the farmers.</p>

I suppose as time goes on one's capacity for surprise at what the Socialist Government and the Socialist Party might do becomes reduced. But I confess that I find it surprising, in a matter of this sort; that the right hon. Gentleman should be seeking to introduce nothing more and nothing less than degrees of class distinction. I suppose it is really in conformity with recent utterances of the Minister of Fuel and Power. If hon. Members look at this Clause they will see that, by it, provision may be made by a development order for prescribing the classes of persons by whom" application may be made to the local planning authority for permission to develop land. Who is to be excluded from this? Are the Communist Party to be excluded?</p>

<p>The hon. Member has used the right words in referring to a ditch and he might find himself in it. It is right that we should have an answer on the question of why we are to have class distinctions in a Bill of this sort. What classes are to be excluded? Why is this power sought to differentiate between different categories of persons? It is right that, in different areas, permission should be granted on different principles. In one area you may grant permission more readily for the building of factories, than for the building of houses. But why should the classes of persons who apply for permission be prescribed? I do not know why the right hon. Gentleman inserted these words. But I do pray


in aid in support of this Amendment, to leave out the words "classes of persons by whom," the attitude adopted by the Joint Under-Secretary for Scotland who, when the same Amendment was moved before a Committee, accepted it. I hope the right hon. Gentleman, adhering to the principle of collective responsibility, will follow the precedent set by his Scottish colleagues, and even at this late hour, in spite of the imminent operation of the Guillotine, will announce that he intends to accept the Amendment and follow the example so well set to him across the Border. If he does so, I am sure he will receive the approval of the Scottish Members even though some belong to the Communist Party.</p>

<p>These words were put in for a purpose, but not for the purpose which the hon. and learned Member, suggests. There is no suggestion here of class differentiation. It is necessary to ensure that people who make applications for development should have some interest in the proposed land, or should have the possibility of carrying out development. It is reasonable that the time of local planning authorities should not be taken up in dealing with applications for development, in respect of land which the person who is making the application has no interest in, or is not likely to have any interest in.</p>

<p>Does the right hon.

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman would be surprised at the number of people who seem to enjoy doing so, and who have possibly a remote hope or flimsy expectation that somehow they will assume an interest in the property or that they may he able to dispose of a consent. It may well be that a person having a valid consent may think that he has something which is negotiable, and may then proceed to carry on business on the basis that he has consent to carry out development in respect of land in which he has no interest. These words are inserted in

order to enable the Minister to lay down that in order that an application may be made a person should have some kind of interest. If the hon. and learned Gentleman says that the persons who have no interest will never apply, then these words do no harm, but in fact experience has shown that there is a certain kind of speculative interest in what a local authority may be prepared to do, and I think the words are worth having in the Bill.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has not, I think, really given an answer to my hon. and learned Friend. While I do not suspect the Minister of any sinister intention I think he has inserted words which would enable a Minister in his place who had a sinister intention to work great mischief. Although all the right hon. Gentleman wishes to do is to ensure that an applicant has a sufficient interest in the land, the words he has put in the Bill would enable him to exclude classes of persons even if they had a sufficient interest in the land. Although I fully accept that that is not in the least the Minister's intention, it is a possibility tinder the words of the Bill as they stand, and in that respect they are very much too wide. I think also that the Minister slightly misled the House&#x2014;I am quite sure inadvertently&#x2014;in suggesting that somebody with no sufficient interest might obtain a consent in which he could then trade. The ability to apply for something is not equivalent to the ability to obtain it, and it would be a perfectly proper question to ask any applicant to state what his interest in the land was. If a person had no interest, then, even though he could make an application, there would be no chance of his application succeeding.<br/>
My main point is that although the right hon. Gentleman's intention is the perfectly innocent one he says it is&#x2014;which, of course, I accept&#x2014;he will nevertheless see that the actual words of the Bill as they stand are hopelessly too wide because they would enable him, or anybody in his position, to exclude people who had an interest in the land and who could very properly claim to make an application. Therefore, though he has no intention himself of making a wrong use of this provision, I hope he will reconsider the words and introduce more appropriate ones.</p>

<p>I think hon. Members on the other side are entirely exaggerating the character of this proposal.

<p>There would have been exactly the same trouble, because there is no reason why the Minister should be able to exclude any one from making an application except for a good reason. If he wants to exclude people who have no interest in the land, that would be a good reason, but under the words in the Clause he would be able to exclude anybody.</p>

<p>If the hon. and learned Gentleman stretches a point in that manner, he could stretch it until the whole thing became ridiculous. No Bill passes through the House into which legal men cannot introduce arguments of that kind. The obvious thing is that, at a particular moment, it may be necessary to exclude certain persons who have no direct interest in the particular development, but the reason why the hon. and learned Gentleman has raised this matter, is because at the mention of the word "class" the Tory Party get themselves into difficulties. I say that they are exaggerating the whole thing. I hope that only persons of value to a development plan will be allowed to participate. May I in conclusion express the hope that hon. Members on the other side will have a plan for tonight, and that we will not have the awful debacle which we had a couple of weeks ago?</p>

<p>This is a point to which we drew attention in Standing Committee, and I confess that when I moved the Amendment at the time, I was not sufficiently class conscious to understand what was meant by the various classes described in this Bill. I understand that, in my absence, the Minister has defended the proposals in the Bill and has given his reason for desiring a retention of these words. If is a very remarkable thing&#x2014; and perhaps this will interest the hon.

Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher)&#x2014;that in a similar Bill going through the Scottish Grand Committee the Government have accepted this Amendment which we are now moving. Whether it is that Scotland is infinitely less class-conscious than England or whether the logic which has grown up and endured in that fertile and lovely country compels people to see the justice of this argument, I do not know, but I cannot conceive if it is proper in Scotland to adopt this it would not be equally proper for England to follow such an example.<br/>
I do not like the Bill describing classes and saying that according to the class to which a person belongs, he shall be allowed this or that opportunity of making an application or exercising his democratic rights. As an example I wholly dissent from the view, which is apparently held by His Majesty's Government, that we on this side of the House, because we belong to a certain class politically, are not to be allowed adequate opportunity to express ourselves on this Bill. When 9.30 comes we will be denied by the action of those who sit opposite us, any further participation in the discussion of this matter at this stage.</p>

<p>That shows quite clearly the dangers of the legislation we are now considering, because if the Government can impose this Guillotine procedure on an institution as old and as famous as Parliament, there is no saying what the Minister might do when he has the power to distinguish between classes who make an application. We have clearly been rushed into the totalitarian age, and it is with the greatest suspicion that we view this step by the Minister to get the population divided into two sections, those who are allowed freedom to make application for planning consent and those who must have the Guillotine procedure applied to them. There may be two opinions about this matter. Although the right hon.

<p>I may perhaps be going a little wide of the subject matter, but I am dealing with the attempt to differentiate among sections of the population called classes, in their right to freedom of speech and to make application for planning. I was using that as an illustration of the action of His Majesty's Government at the present time in truncating our discussions to this deplorable extent. As I have levelled that criticism against the Government I humbly suggest that my remarks were not perhaps so much out of Order. It might be of interest to the House to know that many of the succeeding Government Amendments will be concessions to our point of view.<br/>
The point we have to decide is whether to permit the Bill to go forward with the invidious segregation of people who apply for development into different classes. I am all against that. If the Minister has further opportunity to consider the matter I hope he will come to the conclusion that in the planning world, if not in Parliament, all people are equal and that planning ought to achieve the greatest good of the greatest number irrespective of the class of the community to which they belong. One of the objects of good planning should be to ensure that someone in a favoured position of ownership or possession of land should not use his</p>

I hope that the House will come to the conclusion that it is dealing with a matter which lies very close to the roots of our planning responsibilities. Hon. Members opposite exult for the moment because their numbers are temporarily large. It may not always be so. They ought to use their last endeavours on this procedure to support us in moving this Amendment, and in securing for the future that all classes of people will have an equal chance to make applications for planning permissions, and that, equally, all persons who are elected to this Parliament will have a proper chance of expressing their opinion on all matters of public importance.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Raw Cocoa (Control and Maximum Prices) (Amendment) Order, 1947 (S.R. &amp;amp; O., 1947. No. 552), dated 28th March, 1947, a copy of which was presented on 1st April, be annulled.</q>
When I originally put down this Motion on the Order Paper I little thought that we should have to sit through an exhibition of Parliamentary democracy such as we have had tonight. The purpose of this


Order is to increase the price of cocoa from an unspecified amount to 119s. per cwt., and allows the Minister of Food to raise the price still further. It is not surprising that this Order should have attracted the attention of the Select Committee appointed to examine Statutory Rules and Orders, and it is interesting to note that in referring the matter to our attention the Committee said:
<q>the special attention of the House should be drawn to the Order on the ground that it appears to make unexpected use of the powers conferred by the Statute.</q>
The evidence, as published, shows that we in Britain are having to pay a needlessly high price for our cocoa while the West African native grower is getting an extremely low price. It also shows that the Ministry of Food buy cocoa from the West African Control Board, and sell it to manufacturers in this country on a no-profit-no-loss basis. The Ministry trades on the average of the prices they pay and so, in the past, due to relief of stock bought at low prices, the United Kingdom prices have been below world prices. I understand that present prices are still below world prices, due to the lower price paid for some cocoa at the beginning of the current season.<br/>
The first problem we have to decide is of course, what is the present world price. Apparently, accordingly to the evidence, the West African Control Board regards the New York price as the free world price, since the United States take only one-third of the world crop. The amount which America can take from West Africa is limited to the quantity allocated by the International Economic Food Council, which decides exactly how much each consuming nation shall have and, incidentally, how much we in Britain should have of the crop grown in our own Colony. America takes one-third of the total West African crop. The price rise in New York does not, in present circumstances, attract more cocoa to America.<br/>
The New York speculators are quite aware, of course, of this, and they are buying up cocoa in New York in the sure knowledge that there will be a further rise in price. In the words of the Minutes of Evidence of the Report, the price rocketed when the price control

was removed. New York may be a very long way from here, but this is extremely relevant to the subject matter with which we are concerned to-night. This may seem to be an argument in favour of price control, but, although the price movements were free and unfettered, the actual supply of cocoa was limited to a definite quantity.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Member is aware that the whole of the prices in America have risen, even where a free market was established.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1636.1" hansard_membership_id="3843" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2055" speakername="Mr. Erroll" colnum="1636" time="">
<p>Not in proportion. The fact remains that there has been a tremendous dollar pressure, and that has caused the American price to rise on a limited supply of cocoa. What the Americans do in their own country is their own concern, and there is no difference of opinion on that point. But we in this country are having to pay to West Africa the artificially stimulated New York price, and we are being forced to do so by the West African Price Control Board which is, strangely enough, controlled by the Colonial Office. We are on a merry-go-round which may become a spiral at any moment. I understand that the Ministry of Food has brought the strongest pressure to bear on the Secretary for the Colonies, and in this connection I would say that the Minutes make extremely interesting reading. The Minutes of Evidence say that the Ministry of Food spokesman said the Ministry have brought the strongest possible pressure to bear on the Colonial Office, and there have been meetings between the Ministry of Food and the Colonial Office, and so forth, in order to get a more favourable position for ourselves.<br/>
But for whom? Not for the British housewife. The Colonial Office has resisted that very strongly. We can only surmise how fierce was this unedifying squabble between two Ministers behind the scenes. The Minister of Food, in his position, lost, and the Secretary for the Colonies won, and the British housewife has suffered. What is the position? Only the Control Board gains. The native is getting nothing like the market price. These are not my own words but the words of the Minutes of Evidence. The Control Board has won and there is a difference, we are told, of something like &#x00A3;20 million sterling. It is said that this will be used ultimately for the benefit of the African natives. That is a fine


hope. It is difficult to say why the Colonial Secretary won because for other West African agricultural products we in England pay prices well below the prevailing world prices. There is no central surplus being held in respect of any other West African agricultural produce. I would quote just two instances to illustrate this point. In respect of palm oil we pay a price of about &#x00A3;38 a ton whereas palm oil from the Dutch East Indies, of comparable quality, is costing in the free market &#x00A3;147 a ton. There is no question there of our having to pay &#x00A3;147 a ton for West African palm oil. As regards palm kernels the picture is much the same. We are paying &#x00A3;21 13s. whereas in the open market the price is of the order of &#x00A3;55 a ton. I should like to ask whether the Minister really did press the matter as far as he might have done. After all, these are telling figures. Was the greatest possible pressure really brought to bear upon the Colonial Office to be at least consistent in the matter of our food supplies derived from the Colonies?<br/>
I am very well aware that the surplus' of &#x00A3;20 million accumulated by the Produce Control Board is for the ultimate benefit of the native. I understand that some of this surplus will in fact be devoted to subsidising the price paid to him when world prices fall, but does so large a sum of money really have to be held&#x2014;a sum which is extracted from British housewives at the present time? Can we justify asking the British taxpayer to give &#x00A3;3,250,000 to the Gold Coast through the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. when that territory already lays claim to a very large proportion of the surplus extracted from us by the price charging policy of the Control Board? The ultimate good of the native is at the present time not enough. The native needs a high price now to stimulate production, and for a very interesting technical reason which was referred to in the report. The report makes it quite clear that production has been declining over the past two years, and on page five it says that an expert witness stated:
<q>Yes, the world supply was substantially below 'prewar. There is serious cocoa disease.</q>
This disease is called "swollen shoot," and I only bring this technicality into the House this evening because it is extraordinarily relevant to the whole question

of price policy for cocoa. When a tree gets this disease it infects other trees and must be cut down. When the disease is visible the tree that is infected will bear one more crop and then die. Great pressure is brought to bear on the natives in the Gold Coast at present to cut down their trees as soon as the disease becomes visible, but with the low price paid for the crops from their farms the growers have a very great temptation to keep their trees going for one more year in order to get the final crop. That is fatal because it is during that last year of the life of the tree that the disease is spread to neighbouring trees, thus causing further mortality in otherwise healthy trees. By paying a high price now the native will have enough spare money to buy the imported goods he requires which are available to him&#x2014;as they were not in wartime&#x2014;at the relatively high world prices, and he would still be able to afford to cut down his trees as soon as they were visibly affected. At present however, he is unable to do so and does not do so save when the strongest pressure is brought to bear upon him.</p>

<p>In order to enable some of us to follow this argument, will the hon. Gentleman answer two questions? First, is it seriously suggested that the higher the profit per tree the more likely trees are to be cut down when they are diseased? Secondly, is the hon. Member really arguing in favour of the Order or against? He now says that the price of 6os. is too low. If he is in favour of a higher price he is in favour of the Order, and in that case the Prayer is out of Order because he has really put it down only as a means of discussing matters which are not relevant to it.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that if one has a fixed number of trees one can afford to cut down several if one is receiving a high price for the remainder.

<p>I do not wish to detain the House and in any case hon. Members opposite will have an opportunity of contributing later. The fact remains that the


present policy followed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Ministry of Food does not encourage the elimination of the disease and will reduce productivity in British West Africa at the very moment when the world is crying out for more and cheaper cocoa.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Motion.<br/>
I should like to point out to the House that this particular product, cocoa, differs in the view of His Majesty's Government from almost any other produce in that in their plans for bulk purchase, which is part of their programme, they are able to exercise to the full their powers, because the native cocoa producer of West Africa is situate in a country which is entirely under their dominion. There is no possibility of action being taken against them as happened in Ceylon in the case of tea, or as happened with regard to oil seed. There is no possibility of their being challenged in any way by the producer, and it, therefore, makes it extremely important that one should examine the effect of this Order from the point of view of the producer. Fifty per cent. of the world's produce of cocoa comes from this area on which the Government can work their will without challenge in any way at all.<br/>
The remarkable thing to which we have to devote our attention is the enormous gulf which is fixed in the price to the producer and what the consumer pays. The consumer of cocoa is not only the British housewife. It goes much wider than that, for cocoa and chocolate are considered one of the most concentrated forms of nourishment which is known. Therefore, in the rehabilitation of starving countries like those in Europe it takes a very high priority. I think we have a moral onus on us to see that we do not offer reasons, which are not crystal clear and which the Minister will have to make later on, in regard to the price which is paid by the rest of the world including, of course, the consumers in this country. That has been done in the case of other products with very dangerous results. One has to consider examples where there has been an artificial reduction in the price of produce throughout the world. Before the war a case in point was when

America created an artificially high price by taking 11,000,000 bales of cotton off the market and so fixed a price that created some sort of a hothouse in which a surplus of cotton beyond the world's needs was produced. That produced an extremely bad effect as will this Order in the long run on the cocoa producer.<br/>
This Order goes against one paragraph of the Atlantic Charter. That Charter makes it absolutely clear that the peoples of the world shall have free access to raw materials. There is no free access to cocoa in West Africa. No nation at all can have a free access to that cocoa and go to the native producer and buy it, which was what I believe lay behind that Clause in the Charter. Now between the outside buyer and that native producer there stands this body, the West African Produce Control Board. It is admitted that this body interposes itself to a tune of &#x00A3;20 million between the producer and the consumer. How is it possible for the Atlantic Charter to be reconciled with that when it talks of the free access to raw materials? This body has made a temporary profit of some &#x00A3;20 million&#x2014;I say "temporary," in all fairness, This fact provides a very strong argument against the Order.<br/>
The Order arrogates power to the Colonial Office and its officials. For them to say, "We propose later on to use this &#x00A3;20 million for the benefit of the natives of West Africa," is exactly the same argument that was used about the Road Fund a good many years ago. That fund was to be used for the benefit of the users of the road. That was not its eventual destination. [HON. MEMBERS: "Who robbed the fund? "] I have always held that it was a very wrong action, and I do not mind saying so.<br/>
The original sin may have been in one place, but the continuation is in another. The argument used on this matter is the one about the free market, but there is some lack of realism shown by the Government in that argument. It came out in evidence that they proposed to use the New York price as a basis of then price. That is not a free market or a true market at all. No market is free in which more than 50 per cent. of the main produce does not come on to the market at all and is in one set of monopolistic hands. The Government are very much against


cartels and monopolies, but it is clear by the Order that they have 5o per cent. of the monopoly, and they arrogate to themselves the right to say that they can use that monopoly because they have it.<br/>
The hon. Member who interrupted about the general rise in prices in New York was not entirely accurate. There is the case of another large native produce, rubber, in which there has been a very large drop in price in the last 10 days or a fortnight.</p>

<p>The observation was made with reference to the price level ruling in New York and the variation in price levels. From figures that have been supplied to us from the White Paper there is 30 or 40 per cent. increase in prices in America, and a loss of something like &#x00A3;200 million.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1641.1" hansard_membership_id="4498" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31311" speakername="Mr. Fletcher" colnum="1641" time="">
<p>I am delighted to have been able to bring the knowledge of the hon. Member more up-to-date by telling him what has happened since the White Paper was published. It has a direct bearing on this question of cocoa but we should observe what happens when there is a true free market, as in the case of rubber. The native can market his rubber on any day. He gets 70 per cent. of the value advanced on the day he brings it in, without interest charges. The cocoa producer gets a price, against which he has already kicked in many cases, and between that price and the price which is paid by the consumer there is an enormous gap of 60s. The price is 119s. c.i.f. or 112s. f.o.b. That is the price which is being paid, and the gap cannot be justified.<br/>
The old story which will be used and which has been used in other cases is that the gap will be evened out later on. That argument does not meet the case at all. I can see a very good case upon an anti-inflationary basis for paying absolutely the full amount. His Majesty's Government, departmentalised into a profit-making concern, sees fit to fix the native prices, but the differential which exists today is infinitely too great. It may be very interesting to hear from the Minister, in view of the knowledge which he has and I have on the subject, how he will justify such an enormous gap, which will have a fatally bad effect upon the native producer. The services which the producer wishes to buy have risen not

exactly parallel but to some extent <i>pari passu</i> with everything else. If he feels that he is being penalised at the same time by this rigorous control exercised over him by His Majesty's Government and against which he has no hope of appealing or aid from outside markets, as we have seen in other produce, he will turn away from those products. If, on the other hand, he were given sudden, and too great, maximum rises, then, I think, it might have a slightly inflationary tendency. One of the main vices of this Order is undoubtedly that when we get arbitrary changes in price, which are not based on the market's fluctuations, but on some form of calculations which it is almost impossible to follow&#x2014;three jumps from about 55s to 119s in a fairly short space of time&#x2014;then the result on the native producer must be deleterious and bad. The Government are trying to run control and bulk buying based on control, and, at the same time, to argue that they are basing it on a free and open market. That is a contradiction in terms. Whatever control methods against produce are used, nature, in the final analysis, will have the last say.</p>

<p>It is usual for hon. Members addressing this House to declare whether or not they have an interest in the subject-matter on which they intervene. I used to be in the cocoa trade, but I left it 17 years ago, since when my only interests in it have been memories and a little knowledge. If anything were a-wanting to prove that we live in a world of commercial insanity, it would be this Order and its predecessors. I want the House to bear with me for a moment while I trace the recent course of the price fluctuations. From the outbreak of war until October, 1946, the price was fixed at 8.9 cents per lb., that is, approximately, &#x00A3;45 12s. 6d. per ton c.i.f. United Kingdom ports. That was a substantial, but by no means a very high price for cocoa before the war. I can recollect it being as low as &#x00A3;18 a ton, and as high as &#x00A3;60. The price fluctuation used to be 1&#x00BD;d a cwt., up or down. That was the unit of movement,&#x2014;1&#x00BD;d. Why 8.9 cents per lb. was fixed as the first price is not clear. It may have been because the consumers' markets in Europe were narrowed as a result of the European blockade; but it is clear that


that price was too low to enable the native cocoa grower to keep his groves in an efficient state, which is why the cocoa disease broke out.<br/>
It is interesting to note that while the price was, approximately, &#x00A3;45 12s. 6d. a ton c.i.f. United Kingdom ports, the native cocoa grower was only getting something in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;15 per ton. In October, 1946, the price was raised to 14.5 cents per lb., or, approximately, &#x00A3;76 1s. 3d. per ton c.i.f. United Kingdom ports. Again very much less than that price went to the producer. The price was raised again under this Order to 119s. per cwt., or 20 cents per lb. In a sane world the prices of stable commodities do not double in amount overnight. It may be a convenience to the manufacturers who avoid the irritation of adjusting their prices to a gradually rising market, and, incidentally, it enables them to make gigantic unearned profits on the stocks which they possess and which are unsold. But I do maintain that it is monstrously unfair to the consumer.<br/>
The Ministry of Food buys its cocoa through the West African Produce Control Board, which is under the Colonial Office. That is why, no doubt, we see the two Under-Secretaries sitting blissfully together. The Ministry buys it on a "no profit, no loss" basis, and I understand that the view of the West African Produce Control Board is that it must do the best it can for its native producers. We shall see how it is doing this in a moment or two. The ceiling price is taken off in America, and the market rockets. The West African Control Board see to it that the Ministry of Food has to pay the market price. I do not know that I object to that. Some of my hon. Friends have done, but I think it might have been better if a real market price had been paid all along. We might have had a lower price than 8.9 cents per pound at the beginning of the war, but I maintain that, very quickly, that would have righted itself and the grower would have received higher returns on balance than, in fact, he has done through these arbitrary measures; certainly until October, 1946, when the price was revised.<br/>
Let us examine what the grower is now receiving. Now that the price has reached the equivalent of 119s. per cwt.

c.i.f. United Kingdom ports, according to the Ministry of Food, the grower is receiving 60s. per cwt., which is just half the market price. Where is the difference going? It is going to the West African Produce Control Board, who have accumulated a fund&#x2014;it would be fair to call it a profit&#x2014;in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;22,000,000. I want to know what they are going to do with it. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies will address himself to that particular point. They must do their best, they say, for the growers. That is an admirable and, indeed, a pious expression which I cannot sufficiently praise, but does doing one's best for the grower include the retention of a fabulous sum of money which by right belongs to him? Is this &#x00A3;22,000,000 to be got through to the growers? If so, how is it to be got through to the growers and when? I have an uncomfortable feeling that the Colonial Office, through the West African Produce Control Board, will retain this huge sum and employ it in some way other than by directly paying the people who grow the cocoa and to whom it clearly belongs. They were the primary producers.<br/>
If that is so, I consider it would be a scandal of the first magnitude, into which there ought to be some sort of inquiry, because the grower was starved of a fair price from 1939 to October, 1946, and since then has received less than half the price which his goods have fetched in the world's markets. I want to know if this has been done because the producers are, in the main, natives, and might be assumed for that reason&#x2014;probably most unjustly&#x2014;to be incapable of using the money wisely and well. I say that the Colonial Office ought not to treat the native producer as if the Colonial Office were a Victorian parent docking his son's pocket money. Benevolent parentalism can be carried to something in the nature of a vice. I confess that I always suspect anything which is done by great and powerful Mr. "X" for what he calls "the good" of small and weak little Mr. "Y." I always suspect that his benevolence conceals a subtle form of exploitation. [HON. MEMBERS; "Hear, hear."] I am glad to receive approbation from all quarters of the House, and especially from hon. Members opposite. I hope that the House will annul this Order on its merits,


unless we are about to get some very much more satisfactory reply than we have had hitherto received not merely from the Minister of Food, but from the Colonial Office, which is the real nigger in the woodpile.</p>

<p>I hope the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies will answer the question put by the hon. Member opposite as to what is to be done with the &#x00A3;22 million. It was stated that this was to be used for the ultimate good of the natives, but anyone who knows what actually happens in connection with the sale of cocoa in West Africa knows there is a chain of something like a dozen middlemen between +he Board, the United Africa Company or the Cooperative Wholesale Society, and the actual grower of the cocoa. What does the man who actually grows the cocoa get for his labour? While I was in Africa in 1939, I asked that question of well-informed people, but they did not know. I suspect that the price of 27s. 6d. a load, which is said to be the price received by the native, is actually the price received by the last man who sells the cocoa to the man who buys it on behalf of the United Africa Company or the C.W.S. I think that is actually what happens, but it would be interesting to know. This &#x00A3;22 millions is an interesting, and, it may be, a very important sum. I should like to ask the Under-Secretary whether there is any suggestion of the moneys being used to improve the method of cocoa marketing from the standpoint of the primary cocoa producer, and for his benefit, so that he gets more money and the intermediary less.</p>

<p>To put the matter right, may I say that I heard the remark made, and that it was very ironical indeed. The hon. Member for Finsbury (Mr. Platts-

Mills) was referring to the old Blimp idea that we should not do it, otherwise the blighter would not work. But that is not the line which would be taken by the hon. Member for Finsbury himself. This is a matter into which party politics of the ordinary type should not enter at all. This is a matter in which a particular Committee, charged with a duty, has made a report within its terms of reference. That having been done, and the matter having been brought before the House, we have an opportunity of going into the merits of this question. It is of the utmost importance that we should know what is happening. With reference to the &#x00A3;20 million, there is a great difference between the price in this country and the price paid to the native producer&#x2014;I prefer to call him the African producer&#x2014;and the price paid by different Governments. The matter needs clearing up. The organisation might be much improved, to the benefit of the African producer, to the benefit of the distributing organisation, to the benefit of the Ministry of Food, and to the benefit, also, of the housewives of Britain. The only persons who would be at a disadvantage, I think, if improvements in organisation were made, would be the various chains of middlemen. I hope that we shall get a satisfactory answer from the Colonial Secretary.</p>

<p>First, I must declare my interest. I do not drink cocoa and I do not eat chocolate, but I think the Minister of Food should consider the interests of the consumer of chocolate in this country, and the Colonial Office should be solely concerned with the interests of the grower. We are informed that the maximum price of cocoa has increased to 119 shillings per cwt. but there is no explanatory note to show what the figure has increased from. There should be a comparison with the previous price. I notice in the evidence given before the Select Committee that the hon. Member


for Nuneaton (Mr. Bowles) asked if we could not guarantee to take the whole crop, and the reply given by the Ministry of Food spokesman was that, we could take the lot, if the International Food Council would allow us to do so. Surely it is the business of the Government to do what they can for the benefit of the consumers in this country. Let them buy the cocoa and chocolate at the cheapest price which they think is a fair price and see that that money is passed straight on to actual workers and growers in West Africa. Instead, we seem to be working through various buyers, and ignoring what the actual grower gets in West Africa. I suggest that the Ministry of Food should do what they can to obtain the best treatment both for the consumers in this country and for the actual producers in West Africa, leaving out other considerations. If this were done, it would be fair to all, and the housewife here would be satisfied.</p>

<p>A rather curious situation has arisen here. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale (Mr. Erroll) has prayed against an Order made by my Department, but all the attack has been levelled against the Colonial Office. I do not know what may have been said before this Order was made, and the representative of the Colonial Office will be able to answer questions put to him as to the policy pursued, so far as the activities of his West African Produce Control Board is concerned. The purpose of this Order is simply to prevent the re-sale of raw cocoa, after it has been allocated to manufacturers, except with the consent of the Ministry of Food, and at a price which does not exceed the price originally paid.<br/>
I agree with hon. Members opposite that an examination of increases in the price of cocoa must lead any person interested in the matter to make careful inquiries. But, may I remind the House that the background to this rapid increase in prices is simply that there is a world shortage of cocoa. Estimated production for 1946&#x2013;47 is about 612 thousand tons, against the estimated total requirements of 780 thousand tons to 800 thousand tons. Before the war, the position was exactly the reverse. For instance, in 1936&#x2013;37,

there was a peak production of 752 thousand tons as against a total consumption of 680 thousand tons. During the early part of the war, the sudden disappearance of the European markets limited the demands from the United Kingdom, and it was very difficult for the producing countries to market their crops. and prices tended to decrease. The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. E. P. Smith) reminds the House of what was the position in 1944. But then production was falling owing to the ravages of the diseases mentioned by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale. But the rise in price which might then have taken place was kept in check by the maintenance of the American ceiling, which, as has rightly been said, stood at 8.9 cents per lb. From 1944 until the middle of 1946 the pressure of increased demand on supplies continued, and it was evident that the ceiling price would have to be raised. As a result of long negotiations with America, prices were fixed. The hon. Member for Ashford asked how this price came about. I would inform the House that no price is arrived at without long and protracted discussion&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>]&#x2014;Hon. Members opposite may accuse us of having arrived at these figures in an arbitrary manner, but I assure them that such is not the case. Most careful calculation is made before prices are fixed.</p>

<p>Certainly. As a result of these discussions the price was raised to 14 cents, at which it was believed most interested parties, including the African natives, would be satisfied. Unfortunately, after 2nd October, 1946, when this new price came into operation, there was a change of heart and before the new price could be properly operated the Americans decided to remove all controls. That was on 23rd October, 1946. Although members may object to the removal of controls we have no power to dictate to a sovereign State.</p>

<p>Certainly. I have already told the hon. Gentleman that we had long discussions with the Americans.<br/>
It is the policy of the West African Control Board to sell to all purchasers at the same price, but in practice this means selling at the price obtainable on the New York market. At the beginning of the present buying season, that is, in October of last year, we endeavoured to obtain a contract for the whole of our requirements, roughly 100,000 tons, at the then American ceiling price. The Board was unwilling to contract forward, and sold us only about one-quarter of our requirements and at the same time sold a similar proportion to the United States. A further quarter was released by the Board to us and other countries in December, and the balance in January, and each time the price showed a steep increase.</p>

<p>Yes, from October, two quarters of the supply, and then a half. We have always followed, as the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale said, a policy of "no profit, no loss," and the 119 shillings per cwt. at which we are now selling cocoa to manufacturers, will cover, but only just cover, the average price we have had to pay of 105s. per cwt. and, on top of that, the freight and distribution costs. Some of my hon. Friends asked when evidence was given before the Select Committee why we have stepped up this price from 51s. to 119s.; why we did not run it up more gradually, following the trend of world prices. Our reason for doing so is very simple. It is not practicable for the trade or 'convenient to the public to be constantly changing the retail prices of the finished article. Very elaborate calculations have to be made. Furthermore it is uneconomic. Wrappers and labels have to be printed, and price changes have to be given adequate publicity. And the trade made strong representations to us to step up the price from 51s. to 119s. in one stage.</p>

<p>No. I think the hon. Member knows&#x2014;he is interested in the cocoa trade&#x2014;I have answered questions about stocks. They are not very large. I may be able to give the Hon. Member some figures later on, but I have been informed that the stocks were not very large. I can assure hon. Members that, as far as manufacturers' profit is concerned, the public has been safeguarded. All manufacturers want to increase their margins, whatever commodity they may be selling, and the distributors of cocoa and cocoa products, during the next year, will be receiving a profit of &#x00A3;5 million in excess of that which they received last year, and, in our opinion, that is adequate. I think that, as far as the Ministry of Food is concerned, the House will agree that we had no alternative but to make this Order, and that no blame can be attached to the Department.

<p>The hon. Lady seems somewhat disappointed that the attack has been on the Under-Secretary for the Colonies rather than on her Department. I do not presume to attack the hon.

<p>I would like to ask what the Board which was set up has done to implement the purpose for which it was set up. The object was to secure among other things, fair prices for the producer and to stabilise prices year after year. In the Order issued in July last, the


price was put at 51s. per cwt. In the Order issued in January, it was put at 119s. per cwt. If that is stabilisation of prices, I do not know what the term means.<br/>
It was also understood that the Board's operations would protect the producer, and a consumers' committee was set up in London to see that the consumer was protected. I would ask the hon. Lady whether, in fact, that committee did review the price of cocoa at 119s. per cwt. It would be interesting to know what was their comment on a rise of over 100 per. cent. The international body seems to make a mess of all the products which it handles. On 22nd January last, the hon. Lady said that it had no effective power to make recommendations to the member Governments. If they have not executive power, why should they interfere in the free play of the market? Their actions have been disastrous all along the line as far as the consumers are concerned. They have operated in allocating supplies of maize, and so forth, and bulk buyers have gone forth to buy in the Argentine, with the result that the Argentine have taken over the selling, and have been making 100 per cent. profit on everything they have sold. The International Emergency Committee was mentioned in the Committee's report, and that is the only excuse I have for raising that matter now. I want to make a practical suggestion to the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies with regard to the huge sum of money which has been accumulated by the Produce Board. I am well aware that that huge sum of money should not be paid over direct in cash to West Africa. My suggestion is that it should be&#x2014;</p>

<p>I bow to your Ruling, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. All I wish to say is that if the price that is being paid by the consumers of this country for cocoa were allowed to get through to the producers of cocoa, the result would be that they would be encouraged to produce, and the one thing that fetches down world prices is to pay a high price for the article so that the producers are encouraged to produce, and the price soon comes down to an economic level. If you do not allow free play of the market, you will have controls for ever.</p>

<p>The fact that hon. Gentlemen are very ready to interrupt me seems to indicate that I might be saying something to which they take exception in their propaganda in the country. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale (Mr. Erroll) is quite right. The price in West Africa is not being increased to the Africans by the same extent as it is being increased on the American market. Of course, it is not. The speculator in the


American market wants to pocket it himself. He is not giving it back to the Africans. Everyone knows&#x2014;as indeed the evidence says clearly&#x2014;</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, your benign countenance shedding its rays upon us could never be exposed to that criticism. I was referring to hon. Members opposite who are keeping up an undercurrent of grumbling because they are, at last, being exposed on this issue. If there was any more cocoa to be produced as a result of the increased price being paid, there might be something to be said for it. If the African was going to get the benefit of an increase in price, even though there was no more cocoa to be obtained, there might still be something to be said for it. But in a situation in which the profits go to the speculator, and the costs go to the man who is going to buy his bar of chocolate, and the housewife who is going to buy her tin of cocoa, there is little to be said for an increase in price of this nature.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food argued that we had to follow American practice in this matter. I do not see why the British taxpayer should be mulcted of this sum merely because the Americans are being foolish. The situation is that they take off controls and their prices soar to undreamed of heights in the cocoa market. Why does the British taxpayer then have to pay the same price as the Americans are paying? The defence case says; "You cannot differentiate, because then you will

be securing for yourself a preferential position in your Colonies." That argument might be valid, if we were talking in normal times about a normal market where the supply and demand for cocoa were approximately equal. But I see no reason why we should be quixotic in this matter, and it seems to me that with the vast accumulated fund&#x2014;into whose details you have ruled, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, we may not go&#x2014;it is bad policy to suggest that we should concede an increase in the price of cocoa which would practically double the price of a 3d. bar of chocolate at a time when we ought to be engaged in keeping down prices.<br/>
I wonder whether part of the real reason for this increase is that the Ministry of Food are anxious to recoup some of their losses incurred by subsidising other food stuffs, from chocolate. I think it is highly possible. It might be a good stroke of business, and I would not exactly disagree with it, but if it is the case, let us know what is the policy in this matter and let us be able to adjudicate on it. The fact remains 'that this increase in price will not get us another ounce of a singularly inelastic commodity like cocoa. It takes five years for a cocoa tree to come into bearing, so that any increase in price today cannot possibly be reflected in the increase in the amount of cocoa we are going to get until about 1952. My personal opinion, is that the rewards that the African farmer is getting today, by comparison with the return he got before the war, are so great that he needs no further encouragement to grow more cocoa. That part of West Africa where the cocoa is grown, in the Ashanti territories&#x2014;as we who went there at Christmas saw&#x2014;is one of the most fertile and prosperous parts of Africa. The market at Kumasi would have brought tears to the eyes of any British housewife, and we were delighted to see it, because there is no reason at all why we should make a profit out of the African, as we have been doing. By all means let us pay him a fair price for his produce. There would be agreement from both sides of the House on that. There are occasions when paying a fair price can descend to a quixotry, and I believe that is what is happening today. Other countries have discriminated against us in this matter of international trade. When the record comes to be written, the history of the Argentine will make very interesting reading indeed.<br/>
I do not think for a moment that there is any reason why this country should be compelled to pay a ridiculous price for its cocoa because we want, automatically, to follow the American market, especially when I recall that the chairman of the board which sells us the cocoa is sitting on the Front Bench. The Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies is, of course, the man who is responsible, and he is assisted by his Permanent Secretary, the head of the West African Department. If he suggests he cannot control the activities of the West African Produce Board, I think he will expect us to take that suggestion with a grain of salt. I think there are good grounds for annulling this Order, and for putting before this House another Order containing a price which will be a reasonable increase over the existing price, which will not have the effect of nearly doubling the 3d. bar of chocolate that we buy, but which will have the repercussive effect of keeping down prices at a time when we want to keep them down.</p>

<p>; I am a little reassured by the speech of the hon. Member for South Cardiff (Mr.Callaghan), who has just returned from West Africa. But I think that there is a feeling in the House of anxiety to be reassured by the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies&#x2014;as I hope we shall be reassured&#x2014;that the primary producer in this case is getting a square deal. I intervene for a few minutes to remind the House of what happened before the war. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food surprised me by saying that the peak year of production was 1936&#x2013;37. I must admit, I have not the 1937 report of the Cocoa Commission with me tonight. However, I should like to remind the House, and particularly the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. of what happened when the cocoa producers in West Africa decided that there was a cocoa ring against them. They refused to produce cocoa, and they also refused to import goods from Lancashire; and on that occasion, Lancashire lost trade to the tune of &#x00A3;2 million.<br/>
It may be that all is well now, but that report&#x2014;which I am sure the Under-Secretary has read&#x2014;brought out very clearly that, quite rightly, the West

Africans are very highly organised, and that they can introduce trade pressure. It may well be that there is a world shortage of goods for West African importation at this moment, and that, therefore, they are taking our exports. But the Under-Secretary may be assured, on the evidence in that report, that if there has been an unfairness in this matter, our export trade will undoubtedly suffer in future. I think it only right to draw attention to that piece of previous history, which was a most devastating episode for Lancashire, and I hope the Under-Secretary will reassure us that it will not happen again.</p>

<p>I am sure the House is grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale (Mr. Erroll) and the other hon. Members who have drawn attention to this Order. It is useful to remind the House that, in the Report of the Select Committee, the opinion is expressed that the special attention of the House should be drawn to this on the ground that an unexpected use is made of the power conferred by the respective Statutes. That is what have given rise to this interesting discussion, which has been over a fairly wide field. I want to make clear to the House and to the Government the reason why we object to this Order. We are not necessarily complaining, as the hon. Member for South Cardiff (Mr. Callaghan) was complaining, that the price is too high. What we are saying is, that if the consumer is having to pay this high price, he should not be denied the advantages which are gained from a high price, namely, the encouragement of the production by the producer. What the Government are doing here is to pay a greatly increased price&#x2014;it is an enormous rise, from &#x00A3;45 to &#x00A3;119 a ton&#x2014;but that enormous rise is not bringing about the increased production, which, in its turn, would lead to a fall in the price level, because the producer in West Africa is not getting the advantage of it. All this money is going into the hands of this Board. One day, we are told, some use is to be made of the money by this Board for the benefit of the West African producer. It seems to us on this side of the House that we are getting the worst of the bargain all round. The consumer at home is going to pay a heavy price;


the Colonial producer is not going to get a price sufficiently high to tempt him to increase his production. We do not see the advantage of all this to us, though we see the advantage there may be to certain interests in other countries. We can understand that.<br/>
I should like to challenge what the hon. Member for South Cardiff said when he was referring to the New York brokers. In studying the minutes of evidence in the Fifth Report of the Select Committee on Statutory Rules and Orders we see that very point was put to the expert witness by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. E. P. Smith. I quote from the evidence:
<q>It is not really going to the American market?&#x2014;No it is not going to the Americans.</q>
<q>Not to Wall Street speculators, or anybody of that sort?&#x2014;No. It is going to the West African Control Board; and I hope they use if wisely.</q>
The Control Board are getting this increased price, and not giving it to the producer.</p>

<p>What I intended to say, and I think did say, was that, whereas the Ministry of Food is selling this cocoa at approximately &#x00A3;115 per ton, which is 119s. per cwt., American speculators have been selling it at 30 cents a pound&#x2014;approximately &#x00A3;167 a ton. It is that margin of &#x00A3;52&#x2014;approximately 50 per cent. more than the price at which the Ministry of Food is selling&#x2014;which is going to the pockets of the speculators.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. Gentleman agrees. The hon. Lady said there was no alternative to making this Order. The hon. Member for South Cardiff agrees there is an alternative to making this Order. The alternative, to my mind, is to get rid of the control exercised by the International Emergency Food Council. That body is the nigger in the woodpile here. It does the allocating, but does not fix the price. It allocates a certain amount to the United States. There is no free market in the United States, because if the price rises,

no other supplies can come forward from West Africa, because of the allocation made by the International Emergency Food Council; and, therefore, the free market that we, on this side of the House, would like to see does not even exist in New York.</p>

<p>If we could have our way, we should let the producer get an increased price, and he would then be tempted to produce more. I agree with some of the observations of the hon. Member for North Islington (Dr. H. Guest). He knows about these things in West Africa&#x2014;the difficulty the producer had in getting a fair price, owing to the very large number of the middlemen who came between him and the price paid by the consumer. If the Colonial Office were going to make some good use of these funds by establishing, perhaps, an agricultural mortgage bank to get these producers out of debt, then we should begin to make some progress. It is the fact that they are now in debt that has been the trouble. That is the difficulty with which the Colonial Office has been trying to cope, but they have not yet been able to do it. I look forward to the Under-Secretary saying they have found a way of getting round this difficulty. I want to make it clear that we on this side of the House do not like the principle of bulk purchase. We think it will get us into trouble, and we do not like the way it has been done. We object to this Order under which the consumer is paying a high price, and the grower is not getting a price which will encourage him to produce more.</p>

<p>Would the right hon.

They could not buy any more commodities, and it would not benefit them and, presumably, they would not grow more.</p>

<p>I have heard that argument, and I should imagine that whoever used it was hard put to find an argument. I do not agree with it. It has been consistently said that people will not work any harder, because they will riot have anything to buy, but if that is told to an ordinary working-man, he will say it is not so. It is just the same with the West African. West Africa wants a lot more of our cotton goods from Lancashire. I do not think we shall have anything more to say until the Colonial Secretary has spoken, but we may then have some further comments to make. The House will expect to hear some very good reasons why the Order should not be annulled, otherwise hon. Members on this side of the House will have to go into the Lobby against the Government.</p>

<p>When I saw this Prayer on the Order Paper I had a feeling it was directed less against my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Food than against myself. Hon. Members opposite may say with the poet:
<q>Euphelia serves to grace my measure,</q> <q>But Chloe is my real flame.</q>
I think I also detected a slight note of envy amongst the hon. Gentlemen opposite who have a responsibility for directing businesses. I felt that if they had been chairmen of companies which had built up reserves of &#x00A3;20 million, of which &#x00A3;7 million were built up in the past six months, they would feel rather pleased With themselves. I am in that position, though only by virtue of my office and not by virtue of my own abilities, and I feel that I can fully justify the actions of the West African Produce Control Board. Possibly hon. Members might like to know of whom the Board consists. I will not spend time this evening in giving all the details, but the Board consists of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary as Chairman, three members of the Colonial Office by virtue of their posts, one representative of the Nigerian Government, one representative of the Gold Coast Government, three members appointed by the Secretary of State for their knowledge of the oil seed trade, and one member appointed by the Secretary of State for his knowledge of the cocoa industry, with a Director of Cocoa Marketing and an

Acting Director of Oil Seeds Marketing who do the day-to-day work.<br/>
The question has been asked: why has the price risen to the present height? I think it has been sufficiently explained that the world price of cocoa is determined by the price that the Now York buyers are prepared to pay. The cocoa production of West Africa is about 300,000 tons, which is about 45 per cent. of the world output. Of that, about 40 per cent. is taken by the American market&#x2014;a very substantial proportion. In the early years of the war there was a surplus of cocoa. In fact, large quantities of cocoa had to be destroyed. That is the reason why, in those days, the United States was able to fix a relatively low ceiling price. There was an abundant supply of cocoa in the world, and they could get it fairly cheaply. More recently, cocoa has gone into short supply, as they say in the jargon of the trade. One reason is that there was little planting of new trees during the war. I do not think that anyone would dispute that this was inevitable in the stress of war. Then again, a large number of old markets have been reopened, and have taken the supplies which had gone to other countries during the war. Then there is the question of disease. The trees have been particularly affected by swollen shoot. I ought to point out that this is a physical factor, and has nothing to do with any financial question as has been suggested. It might, I suppose, be compared with phylloxera in vines, if I may venture to make such a comparison. I do not know whether cocoa drinkers have yet begun to talk about the virtues of the pre-swollen-shoot vintages.<br/>
These are the reasons why cocoa has gone into short supply, and it was inevitable, when the control was lifted in the United States, that buyers should be prepared to pay a great deal more than had hitherto been the case. The United States price determined the world price. That price rose to &#x00A3;150 a ton at the highest, and has subsequently dropped to about &#x00A3;120 a ton. If hon. Members have followed me to that point, they will next ask why is it that we could not charge a lower price in this country than the world price. Indeed, that question has been put by several hon. Members on both sides of the House. The reason is that, in the first


place, we could not discriminate against the United States in such a matter. It would be morally wrong to do so, to try to reap such an advantage for ourselves. We are also committed by the proposals which we have accepted as a basis for discussion in the negotiations for the International Trade Organisation. It would, therefore, not have been possible, on the ground of discrimination against the United States, to have charged a differential price in this country. There is an even deeper reason&#x2014;which I am sure will he appreciated by hon. Members opposite as well as by those behind me&#x2014;and that is that we are trustees in this matter for the Colonies, and it would be wrong for us to try to get a lower price for ourselves than could be obtained in the world market, especially when, under international arrangement, the quotas of cocoa which go to the various markets are determined by the International Emergency Food Council<br/>
I have, I think, carried hon. Members with me to this point&#x2014;that we could not have charged a lower price in this country than the world price.</p>

<p>Surely it is a dangerous principle first to limit the supply to a particular market, then to let the market inflate because of the limited supply, and to say these inflated prices shall be the yardstick to measure the world price.</p>

<p>That argument, if I apprehend it correctly, is really based on a misunderstanding. It is not possible by any means of this character to increase the world supply of cocoa. We are exceedingly anxious to sell all the cocoa we can to the U.S. Cocoa sold to the U.S. brings in dollars, a point which I am surprised has not been mentioned tonight. Anyone who can obtain dollars is a very popular man at No.11, Downing Street, these days. I am not at all ashamed that in the current cocoa season we have obtained in hard currency the equivalent of fifty million dollars from the sale of cocoa. The next stage in my argument is this, and I think that all hon. Members will agree with it: the surplus realised from the sale of cocoa must be used for the benefit of the inhabitants of Africa.</p>

<p>When the hon. Gentleman says "inhabitants," does he mean the inhabitants at large, or the producers of the cocoa?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1662.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Thomas" colnum="1662" time="">
<p>I mean the producers primarily, but any benefit to the producers will be reflected, of course, in the economy of the Colonies at large. The surplus realised from the sale of cocoa must be held in trust for the people of Africa who produce it. Whether that surplus should be passed on at the present time is one of the points to which I must particularly address myself in replying to this debate. Here I think we come up against what struck me as a fundamental fallacy in the constructive speech which I was glad to hear from the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the City of London (Mr. Assheton). If we passed on to the Gold Coast and Nigerian producers the high sums now being received for cocoa, that would not lead to an increase in the quantity of cocoa produced. It would result in inflation. The right hon. Gentleman particularly mentioned textiles. I was very glad that he did mention them, for one of our problems is that the African Colonies have a great need of textiles, but we are not able to supply them with the quantities they want. If we made available this large surplus at the present time to the West African colonies they would not have the consumer goods to buy, and the result would be inflation. There is no National Savings Movement in the African Colonies and no ingrained habit of saving as there is in this country, and, inevitably, the result of releasing this large quantity of money in the Colonies would be very serious inflation. I hope that I have carried hon. Gentlemen to this point, that the large surplus which has been realised must be held in trust for the people of the producing colonies. What are we going to do eventually with this surplus? That is a question which has been raised several times in the debate. The answer has, in fact, been given, in Command Paper 695o, "Statement on the Future Marketing of West African Cocoa," and I will read, if I may, paragraph 15:
<q>It is apparent that the accumulated surplus will provide the organisations with the initial financial resources to maintain a steady purchase policy. The primary purpose for which it is proposed that these funds should be used is to serve as a cushion against short and intermediate term price fluctuations in the world market price of cocoa; but it will be within the discretion of the Boards to allocate funds at their disposal for other purposes of general benefit to the cocoa producers and the industry, such as research, disease eradication and rehabilitation, the amelioration of indebtedness, the encouragement of co-operation


and the provision of other amenities and facilities to producers.</q>
This document was laid before Parliament in November, 1946. The right hon. and learned Member for the City of London mentioned in particular the question of agricultural indebtedness, and I was very glad he did so because it is a major problem in many Colonies. That is laid down in this White Paper as one of the things for which this surplus can be used.</p>

<p>In view of your Ruling, Sir, I cannot discuss the matter further, but I have been asked how the surplus would be used. In any case, hon. Members will have the reference now, and can pursue the subject for themselves. I think that I need only add a word about future organisation. In a very short time, both in the Gold Coast and in Nigeria, Cocoa. Boards will be set up to take over the marketing arrangements for this commodity. The reasons for this step are constitutional, as we do not think that we should keep indefinitely the arrangements by which these prices are settled in London. These prices are to be settled in the Colonies concerned by boards which will be mainly representative of the producers, but with an element of consumer

representation. The boards will set up in London a joint selling organisation to help in the disposal of their products, and the Secretary of State will set up a Consumers' Consultative Committee here. I hope that I have satisfied hon. Members that there is a good reason for the increase in the price, and that the surplus realised will be used in the best possible way in all the circumstances. Therefore, I think we should not divide on this matter, but rather go home and drink a cup of steaming cocoa.</p>

<p>I do not want to transgress your Ruling, Mr. Speaker, but I am bound to say that I find it very difficult to reconcile what the Under-Secretary said with the evidence given by the Director of Cocoa. I think it raises a very important point of international relations. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the Minutes of Evidence he will see that the reason given by our people in New York on 2nd October, 1946, for suggesting an increase in the ceiling price of about 8.9 cents, was that at that time there was a strong feeling that the African native was not getting sufficient for his cocoa. That was the official reason given by the representatives of His Majesty's Government to the United States Government for increasing the price of cocoa. Now I submit that any reasonable person reading that would imagine that the United States representatives who were given that reason naturally assumed, if they agreed&#x2014;as they did judging by the contents of the Minutes&#x2014;to an increase in price, that that price would in fact go to the native African producer. We are suddenly told tonight that that is not going to be the case; far from going to the African native producer, it is being accumulated as a fund to be used for some wider purpose.


I suggest that is the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the remarks we have heard tonight. I do not hesitate to say in view of what we have heard that the Ministry of Food has "pulled a fast one' over the United States.</p>

<p>If the House thinks I am misrepresenting the case, I will read it all again:
<q>There were discussions last summer between us and the Americans as to the advisability of increasing that ceiling price, because at that time there was a strong feeling that the native African was not getting sufficient for his cocoa, and there was also the complication of the Brazilian market: the Brazilians would not abide by so low a figure as 8.9 cents., and we felt that if we could fix a figure which was rather more reasonable, it might commend itself both to the Africans and to the Brazilians, and be acceptable to the Americans. Finally, after much discussion, it was agreed that the American ceiling price should be increased to 14.5 cents.</q>
Anyone reading that must agree that the basis on which we suggested increasing the price to be paid by us was that the Africans should get more, yet we are told that this money, instead of going to the individual Africans&#x2014;and, presumably, the Americans expected it to do, from the statement issued in November&#x2014;is going into a pool, some of which may eventually reach the individual Africans. I do suggest that the explanation given by the Parliamentary Secretary is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that we have put a fast one over the Americans.</p>

<p>If I may reply briefly, the date of November when the statement was issued is not really relevant, as the policy was adumbrated in a White Paper issued in 1944 (Cmd. 6554) by the Government of which the right hon. Gentleman was a Member. With regard to the question whether the surplus will go to the local producer or not, it will go eventually to the local producer, and will do him more good if it goes in the manner we suggest than if it goes in the manner proposed by the right hon. Gentleman. With regard to the quotation which he has made from the Minutes of Evidence, it is the case that we represented that the American ceiling price ought to be raised, and the price was eventually raised, but these discussions are also irrelevant, because, a little while afterwards, the ceiling price was taken off by the


Americans themselves, and the free market price rose to more than double the ceiling price, which, I think, proves that we were not asking too much.</p>

<p>It I might have the right of a brief reply to a most interesting discussion, I should like to say that there are some points with which the Under-Secretary has not dealt adequately. First, as to the question of consistency in the marketing policy of the West African Produce Control Board, the Under-Secretary said it would not be fair to discriminate in Britain's favour when selling West African produce, but that is precisely what he does in regard to other produce from West Africa. We get a much more favourable price for palm oil and groundnuts, and cocoa is the only product for which we do not have a favourable price arrangement. Secondly, it is said that it takes five years to grow a new cocoa tree. That is quite true, but the Minister's present policy will not encourage the growers to plant any new trees. The item in the evidence which is so striking has been glossed over rather cleverly. It is that
<q>there is also the complication of the Brazilian market.</q></p>

<p>That complication is a complication of increasing productivity because of a healthy price structure.</p>

<p>It is the free market in Brazil which is causing the increase in productivity in Brazil. The growers are planting fresh trees, and production is increasing, whereas in West Africa, where the natives are getting a low pegged price, production is steadily declining year by year, as the Minutes of Evidence show. My third point is in regard to the &#x00A3;20 million surplus. Of course, we are familiar with the White Paper that was issued in 1946, but we are sure it was never intended that the surpluses would be of the order of &#x00A3;20 million available for distribution in the manner described in that White Paper. For these three reasons, we feel that we shall have to press the matter to a Division.</p>

<p>Very often we have an opportunity of considering the case of prisoners of war but so far as I know, we have never, on an Adjournment Debate, considered the case of prisoners of war who have suffered more than any other type of prisoner of war: I mean British prisoners of war in enemy hands. I do not think, therefore, late as the hour is, that the House will feel we have wasted time if, in half an hour, we are able to show that many British prisoners of war have been, through the wrong operation of the Royal Pay Warrant, deprived of large sums of money which are, in fact, due to them.<br/>
Let me take the case of a constituent of mine, not because I want to raise a personal case but because this particular case is, I think, typical of the case of hundreds of other N.C.Os. By what I think the House will agree is an inhumane operation of the regulations, these men are deprived of large sums of money which are, in fact, due to them. My constituent, a Mr. Headford, was just an ordinary regular soldier, a man who had served 13 years with the Colours and 10 years with the Reserve, and who, at the beginning of the war, thought he ought to

volunteer again. He joined, up, and found himself in Singapore in February, 194I. On 13th February, 1941, he was appointed a lance-corporal, and a few days later, when the fortress surrendered, he found himself, like so many other people, a prisoner of war. As my right hon. Friend will <sup>*</sup>appreciate, all these units kept together, and this particular lance-corporal performed duties as an N.C.O. far above the work of an ordinary lance-corporal. He was a mess sergeant for an officers' mess of no less than 375 officers, seven of whom were colonels&#x2014;a task, on the small rations then available, which would have stretched the tact and patience of any very senior N.C.O.<br/>
My right hon. Friend will realise that had that man been a regular officer, under Article 116 of the Pay Code he would have been entitled to promotion during the period when he was a prisoner of war. But, of course, he was just an ordinary regular soldier. I am not even asking that he should be paid for the rank he occupied. I am not even asking that he should be paid for the job that he did&#x2014;though, if I might make this comment to my right hon. Friend, there is something to be said for the principle of the rate for the job, even in the Army. I am only asking my right hon. Friend that he should pay this Mr. Headford, and hundreds of other N.C.Os. like him, in accordance with the provisions of the Royal Warrant. Let me make this point quite clear. Hon. Members who have served


in the Army during the war will know that there were two types of N.C.Os. There was the N.C.O. who was outside the establishment, for example, the so-called unpaid lance-corporal, who, however long he was a lance-corporal never received any pay and never got any higher. There were also appointments made within the establishment. The appointments which were made within the establishment were made in accordance with the regulations laid down in the Royal Warrant for Pay, Appointments and Promotions.<br/>
If my right hon. Friend has a copy of the Royal Warrant and cares to turn it up he will find that the relevant Articles are Articles 794, 795 and 796. Let me just quote them to him, so that the point will be perfectly plain. Article 794 of the Royal Warrant says:
<q>All vacancies"&#x2014;</q>
this is during wartime&#x2014;
<q>&#x2026; shall be filled, in the first instance, by the grant of acting rank or appointment &#x2026;</q>
Article 795 provides that;
<q>A soldier granted acting rank or appointment &#x2026; shall not be eligible for the pay of the higher rank or appointment until it has been held for 21 consecutive days. &#x2026;</q>
Thus, my right hon. Friend will see there is only one type of appointment within the establishment. The only difference is if a man loses the appointment in the first period of 21 days he is not entitled to his pay for it. That leaves vague what the position of the prisoner of war ought to be. But the Royal Warrant goes on specifically to provide for this and sets out an Army Council Instruction which lays down specifically the position; and it says:
<q>An acting N.C.O. who is taken prisoner of war will be automatically struck off the strength of his unit but will be allowed to retain the acting rank or appointment held at the time of capture, together with entitlement to the corresponding rates of pay.</q>
Nothing could be plainer or more obvious than that that refers to acting rank, and not to paid acting rank; but if the right hon. Gentleman should be in any doubt about it, let me refer him to the sub-paragraph which follows, and which differentiates between "paid acting rank" and "acting rank."<br/>
What has the Secretary of State come here to tell us? That the soldier would be a fool to believe what is in the Royal Warrant? That it does not mean what it says? My submission to the House is that

it is absolutely, perfectly clear and plain what the Royal Warrant means. It means that once Mr. Headford became an acting lance corporal in the establishment he was an acting N.C.O.; on being taken prisoner he was entitled to retain his rank; if he retained his rank for more than 21 days he was entitled to be paid for it. Nothing, to my mind, could be clearer. What is the answer of the War Office? As I understand it from the somewhat confused correspondence sent to me on their behalf, there is some new regulation; that the Army Council got together at some time long after my unfortunate constituent, Mr. Headford, was taken prisoner; that they have tried in some hole and corner way to make a regulation which sets aside the Royal Warrant. That seems to be the argument. Perhaps, the Secretary of State will tell me on what page of the Royal Warrant we can find anything that sets aside its provisions. I have been careful to provide myself with a copy of the Royal Warrant of 1915; and, so far as my right hon. Friend has seen that the House has had them, I have studied every amendment made since that Warrant was issued. I have searched the Royal Warrant very carefully. I shall be very glad indeed to know where we can find this new provision which is to set aside the Royal Warrant. Is it the case that there is a regulation, unprinted, unknown, never communicated to the people affected by it&#x2014;very humble people, soldiers broken in health through captivity&#x2014;by which they have been denied the pay provided by the Royal Warrant for the jobs they did? I hope I am not right: I hope that that is not the case my right hon. Friend is going to make. If it is, I think I shall not be alone on this side of the house&#x2014;if this is the way the War Office is being administered&#x2014;in seeking another occasion when it is possible to divide the House so that on a matter of administration of this sort we can test the feeling of the House by a vote.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has tonight brought forward an individual case of one of his own constituents in order to illustrate a principle. Perhaps it may be more convenient if I explain what the principle of promotion has been during this last war. During the first world war, when promotion was not so indirect, it was found that quite frequently


N.C.Os. and, indeed, officers, having taken the rank which they held, ought not to be deprived of it during the war, whatever happened. If they became casualties, if they were sick or if they were prisoners of war, but particularly if they became casualties or non-effectives, they held that rank, and thereby blocked promotion for many others who were doing the job. They would not be doing the job because they were non-effectives, and in war time there is a war establishment, which fixes the number of particular appointments or ranks that can be held.<br/>
In the last war the War Office devised a system whereby the man doing the job, or holding the appointment, received the pay and the rank of that appointment, but with lance appointments, which were made by the commanding officer and not by the records officer, it was decided that there should be a probationary period of 21 days during, which it could be seen whether the man was really fit to hold that particular appointment or rank. If the individual held that appointment&#x2014;in this particular case the appointment of lance-corporal&#x2014;for 21 days, he was then confirmed in that rank, and was paid for that rank from the date when he was first appointed lance-corporal. In the case of the constituent of my hon. Friend the man might not have held that appointment for 21 days, even if he had not been taken prisoner. He might have become a non-effective for various reasons such as sickness, and this would have prevented him from holding that particular job for the 21 days, after which his acting rank would have been converted into temporary rank. After that temporary rank, there was the war substantive rank, and this was a more permanent rank.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1673.0" hansard_membership_id="1285" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12383" speakername="Mr. Bing" colnum="1673" time="">
<p>Before the right hon. Gentleman leaves that point, would he direct his attention to the very clear instruction on page 250 of the Royal Pay Warrant? The point I was trying to make was that there is a distinction made in the Royal Warrant between "paid acting rank," and "acting rank" which is an appointment without pay. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) states that an acting N.C.O. who is taken prisoner will be automatically struck off the strength of the unit or formation, but will be allowed to retain acting rank or appointment at the time of capture, together with the corresponding rates of pay. Will the right hon. Gentleman tell

us why he is suggesting the man is not entitled to hold that rank?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1674.0" hansard_membership_id="1130" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12212" speakername="Mr. Bellenger" colnum="1674" time="">
<p>I am going on to explain why he could hold the rank, but not the pay of the rank. Acting rank is unpaid for the first 21 days, and it would only be after the 21 days had expired, that the unpaid acting rank would be converted into paid acting rank; antedated to the date on which he was appointed In his case what happened was that the man was appointed acting lance-corporal, and, of course, unpaid. Two days afterwards&#x2014;not several days as my hon. Friend says&#x2014;he was captured. Therefore, he could never have completed the 21 days after which he would have been entitled to temporary rank on which he would have drawn his pay.<br/>
My hon. Friend is probably a little confused as to that Article of the Royal Warrant which, as he read it, says that the acting rank could be held while the soldier was a prisoner of war. As I shall show in a moment by reading the appropriate Army Order, it could be held not only while he was a prisoner of war, but up to a period of 61 days after being repatriated to this country on release from captivity. My hon. Friend made great play with the point that the Army Council Instruction would be unknown to the simple soldier, and that he would not get it. If I may say so, it is probable that the Royal Warrant would be unknown to the simple soldier. My hon. Friend knows that soldiers, except a few, do not study King's Regulations or the Royal Warrant. I admit that there has been a good deal of misunderstanding about the acting unpaid ranks and the temporary ranks, and the war substantive ranks. In relation to a prisoner of war the Army Order was 155 of 1944. The Army Order defined this, but did not alter the situation which was prevailing in 1942. I may say that Army Orders were purchasable even in war time by members of the public. [An. HON. MEMBER: "By prisoners of war?"] A prisoner of war could not get them, but those at home who were interested in his affairs could have obtained them.</p>

<p>Yes, they have authority to vary it from time to time. The Army Order did not alter the position,


even under the Pay Warrant which was prevailing in 1942, at the time when my hon. Friend's constituent was taken into captivity. Perhaps the House will permit me to read the passage in that Order which explains that it does not vary the Royal Warrant for Pay. I think the House will see that this Army Order shows clearly that this particular lance-corporal, and indeed all others and not only those in captivity, are affected in a similar manner, because they become non-effective, and are prevented from fulfilling the essential condition laid down in the Royal Warrant, namely that they must hold acting unpaid rank for 21 days before they can be confirmed into temporary paid rank. The Order reads:
<q>An officer or soldier holding temporary or acting rank"&#x2014;</q>
and acting rank was the one held by this lance-corporal&#x2014;
<q>at the time of his captivity by the enemy, or he becomes missing, shall continue to hold that rank"&#x2014;</q>
that is where the hon. Member has perhaps misunderstood the situation&#x2014;
<q>shall continue to hold that rank so long as he is a prisoner of war or missing.</q>
This lance-corporal held that rank all the time that he was a prisoner of war. The Order further states:
<q>No part of the period during which an officer or soldier is a prisoner of war or missing shall count towards any period of service necessary to qualify for the pay of an acting rank, for conversion of acting rank into temporary rank, or for the conversion of either into war substantive rank.</q>
It is clear from the passage I have read that an individual can hold his rank. The purpose of this provision was to freeze the pay of a prisoner of war at the time he was captured. This man's rank was not that of lance-corporal, but that of private with appointment to lance-corporal. Therefore what happened was that his pay was frozen at the rate which he was receiving when captured, but his rank was held during the whole of the period of captivity.</p>

<p>Let us get this clear. He was not given the rank he was entitled to after serving the 21 days, because he spent these 21 days in captivity through no fault of his own?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-05-14a.1675.1" hansard_membership_id="1130" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12212" speakername="Mr. Bellenger" colnum="1675" time="">
<p>He may not have been entitled. If he had not been captured he might not have fulfilled that qualifica-

tion of serving 21 days of this probationary period. If nothing had happened, and he had served his probationary period he would no doubt have been confirmed in his acting rank and been given the pay of that rank dated back to the time of the appointment. Perhaps the House will allow me to read a little further:
<q>Any part of the period during which any person covered by paragraph I is a prisoner of war or missing shall reckon towards any period of the service necessary to qualify for pay of acting rank for conversion of acting rank into temporary rank or conversion of either into war substantive rank.</q>
The whole purpose of war establishment is to provide a means by which "the Army can fulfil its duty. Its duty in war is to fight. Thus we require to have different ranks within different units as provided for in the war establishment. This soldier, like all others in similar cases, has not been able to fulfil the qualifications which would have entitled him to fill a particular part of the war establishment to which he was appointed and therefore he, was not paid for it. But many others not prisoners of war who did not fulfil that essential qualification of completing a 21 days' probationary period were not confirmed in pay.</p>

<p>I think it would save argument if I might put the main point. The Secretary of State does not seem to be very familiar with Army Council Instructions. The right hon. Gentleman should address himself to the Pay Warrant and explain why there should be in one case a reference to acting rank in which a soldier could continue and draw the pay appropriate and in another case there should be a reference to a paid acting rank.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is endeavouring to show that unpaid acting rank is the same as paid acting rank.</p>

<p>Do let us get this clear. A soldier granted acting rank or appointment under Article 794 will not be eligible for pay of higher rank or appointment, until he has held it for 21 consecutive days. That is "acting rank." Now, we turn to the Army Order and it says that an acting warrant officer or N.C.O. who is taken prisoner of war will be automatically struck off the strength of his unit or formation, but will be allowed to retain his acting rank or appointment at the time of capture, together with entitlement to corresponding rates of pay. Therefore, the acting rank shall be retained if the man is taken prisoner of war. There are different provisions if the man is wounded, and it is a great illustration of how wrong it is for a man to be forced to suffer this injustice without being able to appeal to a court.</p>

<p>That is an entirely different matter. A prisoner of war captured before he completes the 21 days' probationary period is not entitled to the pay of the rank. Whatever the merits or demerits of the case may be, my hon. Friend is asking me to reverse the whole procedure which I have endeavoured to explain, and which dates back, not to 1944, but to the beginning of the war. Millions of men have served under these conditions, and it would be wrong for me, in my interpretation of the Pay Warrant, to reverse this whole procedure at this late stage and give this man the pay of a rank for which he did not fulfil the obligations laid down in the Pay Warrant and the Army Order concerned. I hope that whatever happens, at any rate, it will be agreed that it is too late to reverse the whole procedure.</p>

<p>May I suggest to my right hon. Friend that he should read King's Regulations to find whether it is not the case that the Regulations do not cover every case, and that there are some cases which should be met in the spirit if not in the letter? The Royal Warrant takes the case of a man in captivity, but this soldier is not in the same position.</p>

<p>Barbed wire does not define a prisoner of war. A prisoner of war is one who is captured by the enemy, and who ceases to be responsible to his commanding officer, and becomes responsible to those who have captured him and who give him orders.</p>

<p>But this man was in a unit doing a specific job. I ask the Minister to remember the pleas which he has made in the past on behalf of soldiers. If he would give this N.C.O. the elementary justice, which the Army always gives when it understands the case, this man would be helped. The Secretary of State has demonstrated that he does not understand the case, and that he is hiding behind the barbed wire of the Regulations to deny this man his rights.</p>
