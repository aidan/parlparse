<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he will consider granting powers to local education committees to inquire of young persons when registering at 16 years of age whether they are employed for long hours in violation of the Factory Acts, so that such information may be conveyed to the factory inspectorate?</p>
</speech>

<p>Arrangements have already been made for local education committees to send particulars to factory inspectors of cases coming to their notice in the course of the follow-up of registration where boys or girls under 18 are working for hours which are excessive and proving too tiring. It would not be possible for the education committees to investigate the question whether the hours are in violation of the Factory Acts.</p>

<p>May I take it, therefore, that the procedure is that where a boy or girl volunteers this evidence to the education committee information is sent to the factory inspectorate, but that where there is no volunteering of the evidence nothing is done?</p>
</speech>

<p>No, it works two ways. It is the duty of the inspector himself to inspect, but with the magnitude of operations at the present time the inspectorate may not be able to cover everything. I therefore took the precaution of asking my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Education to supplement the work of the factory inspectorate. Where his officers come across any cases, in addition to the factory inspectorate's own discoveries, they send information along so that we can follow it up.</p>

<p>Does not the right hon. Gentleman see that the weakness of the position is that no complaint is sent to the factory inspectorate at all unless the evidence is volunteered, and is it not a little unfair that some education committees are put in a position in which they cannot do it?</p>
</speech>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that in some cases, when evidence has had to be given of the service of a notice on a man, it has been very difficult for his own officer to say that service has been properly effected, and as this is a very important piece of evidence when a man is charged with desertion or with non-compliance with a calling-up notice, will he consider some more effective method of making certain that a man receives the notice?</p>

<p>The present practice is that laid down in the Act, under which it is my duty to send a notice to any person, for the purposes of any provision of the Act, by post to the person's last known address. I have looked into the matter very closely, and I cannot think it is practicable, in view of the thousands of notices which have to be sent out under the various parts of the National Service Acts&#x2014;not only concerning military service&#x2014;to do the whole business by registered post.</p>

<p>For the reasons which I explained in reply to a Question by the hon.

<p>The general principle in this matter is to provide work by means of which interned or detained persons who are without means can earn some money. If work is not available or the person is unfit for work, a small grant of pocket money would be made from the Camp Welfare Fund, which is derived mainly from canteen profits. In the case of the women detained under Regulation 18B in the women's camp or the married camp, a grant of pocket money from public funds has been made in a very small number of cases as the welfare fund of these camps, where there are no canteens, are insufficient for this purpose.</p>

<p>The letter to which my hon.

<p>I have made inquiries and find that this death was reported to the Coroner on 10th April by the authorities of the hospital in which it occurred with a view to investigation of the question whether death might be due to some form of poisoning. The Coroner ordered a post-mortem examination by a pathologist, thinking that possibly such an examination might render an inquest unnecessary: and pending the receipt of the pathologist's report he took the view that he was not authorised to allow the body to be buried, as the question whether an inquest should be held was still undecided and there was a possibility that the pathologist might want to see the body again. The pathological investigation proved difficult and the pathologist's report was not received until 23rd May. The Coroner was, I think, wrong in this case in not opening an inquest, adjourning it pending the receipt of the pathologist's report and issuing the authority for burial.

<p>County war agricultural executive committees are organising supplies of supplementary labour from every available source for seasonal agricultural work, and in so far as growers are unable themselves to obtain the labour they will need for fruit picking, committees will do their best to assist if they are given sufficient notice of growers' requirements. In Worcester, the executive committee is arranging camps in the fruit growing districts for some 400 boys and girls from public and secondary schools to Supplement the local labour, and further labour will be available from this source if necessary. The plans being made by committees in Worcester and elsewhere should be adequate to enable the fruit crop to be gathered in good condition provided the circumstances are not too unfavourable.</p>

<p>The recent outbreak of violence in Sind has been caused by the Hurs, a fanatical sect with a long history of violent crime in the Province and in the neighbouring State of Khairpur&#x2014;so much so that they are scheduled under the relevant law as a "criminal tribe." Their criminal propensities are said to be due to their traditional customs of giving their whole property to their hereditary Chieftain known as the Pir Pagaro, and thus having no other livelihood than robbery. Military measures were necessitated early in the century to round up Hur strongholds, and it has been necessary at various times to place the present Pir under restraint. Most recently he was arrested last October and is now under detention outside the Province because of grave suspicion that he was continuing to instigate murders and other serious crimes committed by his followers, notably upon the persons of all those who gave evidence against him when he was last convicted. It was impossible to bring him to trial for his responsibility for these crimes owing to terrorisation of possible witnesses. In the past few months a number of his followers, no doubt in revenge for the action taken against their leader, have engaged in a series of outrages of which the most serious occurred on the 16th May, when a party of them derailed the Karachi-Lahore mail train and murdered and looted a number of passengers. The son of the Home Minister of Sind was one of those killed. Military measures which, in the considered view of the Provincial and Central authorities, are once more necessary to deal with those implicated in the outrages, are now in progress and a large area of the Province east of the Indus has been placed under martial law.<br/>
I am not aware of any accusation made against members of the Provincial Assembly in connection with these outrages. The attitude of the Sind Legislature to the situation is well indicated


by their action a couple of months ago in passing, in secret session and with very little debate, a Bill conferring wide powers on Government for dealing with the situation&#x2014;the "Sind Suppression of Hur Outrages Act." The powers and authority of the Sind Government have not been affected except of course in the area placed under martial law.</p>

Compared with engines driven by petrol or diesel oil, it has certain disadvantages; but the results have been sufficiently encouraging to enable the Government to decide that it is the best alternative to petrol for ordinary commercial transport, and that, in view of the need for stringent economy in imported fuel, its use shall be considerably extended.</p>

<p>I desire first of all to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to make a statement to the House. At Question Time yesterday, when I was unavoidably absent from the House, a Member raised, by Private Notice, a question which implied that I had made a statement in a speech on Tuesday which was incorrect and false. I desire to say at the outset that I have no objection at all and no hard feelings toward the Member who raised this particular question, realising that he is a director of Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Company, Limited. I can quite realise his anxiety with regard to this particular subject. I desire, however, to substantiate my statement, and to lay before the House one or two facts so that hon. Members can consider the whole position.<br/>
The "Daily Sketch" on 21st February, 1941, stated:
<q>281 Summonses say cars misused 145,600 gallons.</q>
The defendants were Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Company, Limited, Hugh Beaver and Brian Colquhoun. I wish to point out that in my speech I asked for an assurance that personnel and organisations who are involved and convicted with regard to petrol offences should not participate in the future planning of this country. In the "East Anglian Daily Times" it was stated on 22nd February, 1941:
<q>Mr. Brian Colquhoun was recently appointed Director-General of Aircraft Production factories.</q>
On 19th March, 1941, the "East Anglian Daily Times" stated: "
<q>&#x00A3;402 petrol case fines.</q>


The fines imposed were:
<q>H. E. C. Beaver &#x00A3;12, C. B. H. Colqunoun &#x00A3;10.</q>
All defendants gave notice of appeal. On 22nd April, 1941, the, "Daily Telegraph" stated:
<q>Mr. Hugh Beaver to be Director-General of Works and Buildings, Ministry of Works and Buildings.</q>
On nth June, 1941, the "Daily Telegraph" stated:
<q>Petrol appeals dismissed. Appeals by Hugh Beaver and Brian Colquhoun against convictions and" penalties imposed at Newton-le-Willows for a breach of the petrol regulations were dismissed at Liverpool Quarter Sessions.</q>
The "Daily Telegraph" then refers to another case of a petrol officer, Mr. Arthur Fox, which has been dismissed. The Secretary for Petroleum (Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd) stated that the employment of the officer in question had now been terminated. The "Daily Telegraph" on 8th April, 1941, stated&#x2014;
<q>Another Petrol Prosecution; 170 Summonses.</q>
The defendants were&#x2014;
<q>Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, Hugh Beaver, at Liverpool.</q>
On 9th April, the "Daily Telegraph" stated:
<q>Firm's Misuse of Petrol. One of the largest firms of building contractors in the country, George Wimpey and Company, Limited, were fined &#x00A3;600 and &#x00A3;63 costs &#x2026; for misusing petrol.</q>
I want to remind the House that this misuse of petrol was taking place when the Government were putting out posters appealing on behalf of the many sailors who were losing their lives in carrying petrol to this country. After Wimpey's had been fined, the Ministry of Works and Buildings appointed their Chairman, Mr. G. W. Mitchell, to be Controller of Building Materials in succession to Mr. H. Beaver, now Director-General of Works and Buildings. Mr. Mitchell resigned his directorship of George Wimpey and Company, Limited, in order to take up his appointment.<br/>
I want to be very brief. Here is the case in a nutshell. I referred to the organisations which are participating in the work of the Ministry of Works and Buildings, and I mentioned Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Company, Limited, who have been acting in an official capacity to the Ministry of Works and Buildings in various contracts, and George Wimpey,

and I mentioned personnel attached to those firms. It was stated on 8th April that the firm of Wimpey's were fined &#x00A3;600 and &#x00A3;63 costs, and, as I have already said," in July, 1941, the chairman of the company was appointed to the Ministry of Works and Buildings. Mr. Hugh Beaver was fined &#x00A3;12 and costs for the misuse of petrol when engaged on Government contracts. In July, 1941&#x2014;this seems to be a lucky month for those who contravene the laws of this country&#x2014;we find it announced that Mr. Hugh Beaver is to be Director-General of Works and Buildings and Mr. B. H. Colquhoun, fined for the same offences as Mr. Beaver in March, was later appointed to the Ministry of Works and Buildings. [<i>Interruption</i>.] He was appointed to the Ministry of Works and Buildings in July, 1941.</p>

I do trust that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen will agree that the task of planning this nation should be in the hands of men and women of proved integrity who will give to this House and to the nation that high standard of administrative impartiality, without being associated with any organisations at all, that we have always expected and generally receive from the great Civil Service of this country.</p>

They never have had any there. There never were any there, and they have not done any work


for the Ministry of Works and Buildings since 1936, when they built Chorley Ordnance factory for the Office of Works, so there is no connection there at all. As far as any petrol offences were concerned, they were convicted of a technical offence as agents for the Ministry of Supply, and there was no implication of any irregularity in any shape at all. I feel sure that the hon. Member, if he is fair, will take these facts into consideration and withdraw the allegation about private firms, who find it very difficult to defend themselves.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 13, line 3, at the end, to insert:
<q> Proviso regarding grants to local authorities.</q>
<q>following proviso shall be added to section eighty-two:</q>
<q>'Provided that this section shall not affect the principles upon which any grant of payment from the Exchequer to any local authority depends.' </q>
I desire to bring to the notice of the Committee and the Chancellor of the Exchequer something which is, I think, in the nature of an anomaly. The Committee will note that War Damage Contributions are to be treated as being in the nature of capital payments. This is quite clear in the case of private individuals or private trusts or property companies because they have some capital, but when we come to the case of Government Departments we find a somewhat confusing state of affairs. I understand that the Board of Education permits the debiting of these contributions to education accounts, but the Ministry of Health prohibits local authorities from debiting War


Damage Contribution, in the case of local authority housing schemes, to the housing account of the local authority concerned. The result is that the payment of War Damage Contribution which has to be met on housing estates belonging to local authorities has to be obtained out of the general rate and in some cases it is conceivable that, in order to pay these heavy amounts, a general rate may have to be increased. I submit that these payments ought to be debited to the housing account in each case and not thrown on the general rate. I hope the right hon. Gentleman has followed my explanation sufficiently to find himself in sympathy with that view.<br/>
There is another implication. Where local authorities in heavily blitzed areas are not able to gather in sufficient rates to meet their own requirements and those of the precepting bodies, they come to the Ministry of Health for assistance. The Ministry of Health may, however, get out of the liability for any deficiency on the housing account if the war damage contributions are not debited to that account but are thrown on the general rate. In such circumstances, the housing account would not show the loss or the deficit which it might show if these contributions were debited to that account and if the amount of the contribution went on to the general rate, then, obviously, the ratepayers have to find the money. Therefore, the contention which has been put forward by the Chancellor that this contribution is in the nature of a capital payment, is not borne out in the case of local authorities who will be compelled to find it out of the general rate. The object of my Amendment is to rectify this anomaly. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate my point and even if he is not prepared to concede it to day will at any rate give it further consideration.</p>

<p>I support the plea which has been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger). This is really a question of local authority finance. When a local education authority pays a contribution in respect of educational buildings, it is allowed to charge that contribution to revenue and it gets the appropriate grant from the Board of Education. But when it comes to dealing with a housing revenue account the Ministry of Health do not

take the same view as the Board of Education and do not permit a local authority to charge War Damage Contribution to its housing revenue account. The result, according to the contention of the local authorities, is that their housing revenue accounts become unduly inflated. Under the Housing Act, 1936, at the end, I think, of every quinquennial period, the surpluses on these housing revenue accounts are taken by the Ministry of Health. At any rate the Ministry take a proportion of such surpluses. The point, therefore, is that by not permitting the War Damage Contribution to be charged to the housing revenue account there may arise an artificial surplus, which the Ministry of Health take away. It can only arise if, as the result of not permitting the War Damage Contribution to be charged to the housing revenue account, there is a surplus when otherwise there would be a deficiency. Housing authorities feel that the surplus should not be taken away from them when it is really an artificial surplus, and if the housing revenue account were dealt with in the same way as the educational account, there would be no surplus, and no part of the surplus could be taken away. It is a rather complicated point, but I hope I have made it clear.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the two hon. Members who have put the matter forward. I cannot pretend that I can make a complete statement to-day. The Amendment obviously could not be incorporated in the Bill, and I take it that the object is really to bring the matter before the Committee in order that I might make a statement on it. The suggestion to enable local authorities to charge War Damage Contributions on municipal housing property to the housing revenue account is made, I think, under the mistaken impression that such a charge would result in increasing the subsidy payable by the Exchequer in certain cases. If that is so, it is not the case. That impression is mistaken. It is true that Section 82 of the War Damage Act provides that contributions should all be treated for all purposes as outgoings of a capital nature, and it is obvious that such outgoings cannot properly be charged to a revenue account. It may be suggested that if local authorities were to borrow, as they would be entitled to do, to finance these contributions, the loan


charges could then properly be charged to the Housing Revenue Account. But this might result in the raising of rents by local authorities which could not finance their contributions without borrowing, and that would produce an anomalous position in relation to private landlords, who are precluded by the Rent Restriction Act from passing on their contributions to their tenants. Municipal houses are excluded from rent restriction for reasons quite unconnected with the present question, and it would be unreasonable that this exclusion should place local authorities as landlords in a specially favourable position in comparison with private landlords, and their tenants in a specially unfavourable position in comparison with that of tenants of private landlords.<br/>
The two hon. Members suggested that the Board of Education provided a precedent that they might quote in favour of their proposition. The Board of Education recognise for grants War Damage Contributions in respect of school buildings, and Section 41 of the Act enables grants to be made in respect of highway contributions, but those are both cases in which capital expenditure by a local authority normally attracts percentage grants and cannot therefore be regarded as analogous to housing grants. The matter is somewhat complicated and difficult to explain, but I have endeavoured to give a reply on what we could surmise of the intention of the Amendment. I should like to examine the hon. Members' statements carefully with a view to seeing whether there is more that I can profitably say; and I will communicate with both of them.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 13, line 35, at the end, to insert:

<q>19. Certain fixtures and fittings to be deemed land and not goods for purposes of principal Act.</q>
<q>Any fixtures or fittings which are situate in or upon or are attached to any contributory property and are treated as part of such contributory property for the purpose of the net assessment or net annual value (as the case may be) on which the contribution in respect of such contributory property is calculated in pursuance of the provisions of section nineteen of the principal Act shall be included in the definition of the expression 'land in section ninety-five.'</q>
This is a rather curious matter. I was asked to put the Amendment down by friends who are interested in blocks of flats and offices. I understand that frequently in such premises there is a certain amount of furniture which is for the communal use of the people in the buildings, which is taken into account in settling the Schedule A assessment. Therefore, for the purpose of Income Tax, these chattels are deemed to be land, but for the purpose of the War Damage Act they are not. The War Damage Contribution is based on the Schedule A assessment, so that they pay on that, and they are brought in a second time under the business scheme and are called chattels. I am told that flats and offices are equipped with fixtures and fittings and furniture in entrance halls and on staircases, trade lifts for the delivery of goods, refrigerators, electric cooking stoves and fires. I mention those things by way of example. They are deemed to be in the Schedule A category for Income Tax and attract the 2s. in the &#x00A3;. They are also deemed to be chattels and attract another contribution under Part I. This is unfair, it seems to me. As they are already dealt with for Income Tax under Schedule A they ought to be included for the purpose of the Act under Part I.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is quite right. There are cases in which the use of furniture and fittings which are not-really part of the house may be reflected in the Schedule A valuation. The actual proposal would be impracticable. For one thing, there may be considerable doubt as to whether a particular article of furniture is included or not. It may be that it has been based on a rent which reflects that there will be certain fittings available, and it would be a difficult position if the Board of Trade always had to be quite certain that a fixture had not become land, and <i>vice versa</i>. What has


happened in certain cases, by inadvertence or for mutual convenience, is that instead of having a separate Schedule D assessment in respect of profits derived from the use of furniture, there has been one assessment. It is not as black as it may look, because the result of that is that the person gets a repairs allowance on the total figure, the allowance, of course, being directed to land. If there were a proper assessment under Schedule D, he would get no such allowance. So that to some extent what the man loses on the swings in having to make a War Damage Contribution in respect of movable furniture he gets back on the roundabouts because he gets a repairs allowance.<br/>
I saw some figures which were worked out showing that in a case in which there was a definite sum which might reasonably be attributed to furniture the man would not have been better off in the end if he had had a separate Schedule D assessment. In a good many cases of blocks of flats and hotels the assessments in force in September are capable of being reopened and are being reopened, When a case is reopened under that procedure the Revenue are prepared to consider this point and get it put right. If in the case of blocks of flats or hotels it can be shown that the combined tax and contribution charges have been substantially increased by including net profit from letting fixtures and fittings in the Schedule A assessment, the Revenue will be prepared to look into it and see whether it can be put on a proper basis. I hope that my hon. Friend realises the impracticability of the methods he has suggested and will withdraw his Amendment.</p>

<p>I realise that administratively there are difficulties, but it is hard on the people paying twice. Although the Attorney-General has rightly told us that where Schedule A assessment is reopened this matter can be adjusted, the trouble is that the Chancellor will not permit an assessment to be reopened for the specific purpose of dealing with war damage matters. It is only if by chance an assessment is reopened for some other reason that this matter can be taken into account. The Attorney-General realises that there is a measure of injustice, and as it might be cleared up administratively if the

Chancellor would permit assessments to be reopened on this ground alone, the matter would be cleared up. I shall be glad to know whether the Attorney-General will consider this and let us know if he can solve the problem on those lines.</p>

<p>I do not think that my hon. Friend quite followed what I said. Let me make a correction. I was wrong in using the word "hotels." We are dealing with blocks of flats and offices, and that is the only category in which we are prepared to consider this problem. The Inland Revenue will be prepared to revise any case of blocks of flats or offices in which it is shown that the combined tax and contribution charges have been substantially increased by including net profits from letting of furniture and fittings in Schedule A assessments.</p>

<p>There is no need for hon. Members to go on debating this question of Order. This is the first Amendment relating to this matter, and it is obviously a broad one. It must be left

to the Chair to decide on the scope of the discussion. I have no desire to restrict the Debate unduly.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1942-06-04a.844.0" hansard_membership_id="1130" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12211" speakername="Mr. Bellenger" colnum="844" time="">
<p>In moving this Amendment which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for North Battersea (Mr. Douglas) I desire to say that to a large extent, or to a certain extent, the case has been dealt with on the Second Reading of this Bill and on the principal Act when that was under discussion. I have no doubt that most hon. Members are familiar with the arguments which Members in all parts of the Committee wish to put to the Chancellor, and we hope that we shall receive a different reply to that which was given on previous occasions. This is the most vital controversial principle in this Bill, and we desire that it should receive substantial consideration and that we should be given some improvement. Section 25 of the principal Act has admitted that in certain cases direct contributors, who may be and often are mortgagors, can pass on to the mortgagee a proportion of their War Damage Contribution. These isolated cases are those in which the mortgagor has one property on the mortgage deed which he acquired by borrowing money from a mortgagee, or which he converted and the money which went to the cost of that conversion was obtained by mortgage. That very limited class can pass on part of the War Damage Contribution. We say, therefore, that the principle of apportioning War Damage Contribution between the mortgagee and the mortgagor has been admitted in the principal Act, and we are asking for this principle to be extended to other classes.<br/>
The Committee may be aware, as the Chancellor certainly is, of an anomaly which arises under this Section 25 whereby the individual whom the Chancellor wished to protect, and has indeed protected, namely, the single householder who acquired his house by borrowing money, is prejudiced if he happens to have bought another property at the same time and more than one property was then included in the mortgage deed. Small properties are often put up in pairs as semi-detached houses. When the builder or his successor in title is asked to


sell one of the houses he often says, "You must take the two if you want to buy the one." We then get the position,&#x2014;a case has happened in my own constituency, and I put it to the Chancellor&#x2014;that a man who wishes to buy one house to live in has at the same time to buy the semi-detached house next door, which is occupied by somebody else. If he borrows the money for the acquisition of those two houses and they are both included on the one deed, he is prohibited from passing on to the mortgagee any proportion of his War Damage Contribution. That is an anomaly which ought to be put right, whatever the Chancellor is going to say about the Amendment.<br/>
There is another anomaly to which I would draw attention before coming to the vital principle of the Amendment. Under this Section there is a limit even to the very small class of mortgagors who can pass on a proportion of their contribution. That limit arises upon the assessable value. In the case of any property over &#x00A3;150 assessable value even in that limited protected class the mortgagor cannot pass on a proportion of the War Damage Contribution, except in the case of agricultural property, where the figure is &#x00A3;500. I suggest that the Chancellor should remove the &#x00A3;150 limit altogether.<br/>
Now we come to the vital principle with which the Amendment deals. The argument was developed on Second Reading, and the Attorney-General replied to the Debate. As far as I understood his arguments, they were mainly these: You must not interfere with a transaction which has taken place in normal circumstances; in other words, you must not affect the sanctity of contract principle. The Attorney-General did not admit that this abnormal circumstance, damage by enemy air-raid action, should affect the mortgagee who has lent a fixed amount of capital for a fixed rate of interest and who expects nothing more and nothing less. Shylock himself asked for his pound of flesh and for nothing more and for nothing less, but the judge told him that he could not get his pound of flesh if at the same time he took some blood with it. I am suggesting seriously that what we are doing is to enthrone moneylending, currency, over money's worth, which means human effort, human endeavour and production, and I say that is a wrong principle on which to proceed.<br/>
With his other arguments the Attorney-General gave as an illustration that when the premises are insured against fire the mortgagee is not asked to bear the cost of the fire insurance premium. The mortgagor is expected to pay the fire insurance, so that if the house is burned down, the mortgagee will be protected and will be able to recover his capital. But the fire insurance covenant is a part of the mortgage deed; it was envisaged at the time the bond was settled, whereas the War Damage Contribution was never foreseen by either mortgagee or mortgagor. The Prime Minister has assured us that in these abnormal times the burden is not to lie where it falls but is to be spread equitably over the whole of the community. The mortgagee is a part of the community, and I am saying, and I hope that other hon. Members will support me, that the mortgagee is one of those persons to whom the Prime Minister referred when he said that the serious burden caused by enemy air-raid action should be spread over all classes in the country and not left as a burden upon one particular class.<br/>
I believe that in another place, the argument of the widow's mite was advanced; it was said that the widow who had only a small sum of money, which she had been advised to invest in a mortgage, would be heavily penalised. I am afraid that argument will not hold much water, because these widows who are so conveniently brought in to substantiate arguments against our case are relatively few in number and represent only a small amount of capital in relation to the capital value of mortgages in general; and, further, widows usually invest their money in the houses themselves and not in mortgages. We know that in this matter we are dealing with very powerful financial interests and that it is they that are behind the Chancellor in refusing our suggestion.<br/>
I do not want to go over the whole of the ground which I and other hon. Members traversed on the Second Reading. I have no doubt that many hon. Members will have a point of view to put which, while coinciding mainly with the point of view which I am now putting, will perhaps differ in some of the concrete examples. I want to put a particular point to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Attorney-General. If the mortgagor


does not keep up his payments of interest, the mortgagee has the right to foreclose. Of course, he has to go to court for an order, but in certain circumstances he can foreclose and come into possession of the property, which had already been conveyed to him on a lease when the mortgage deed was entered into. The mortgagee then has to pay War Damage Contribution in order to protect his capital invested in the mortgage. In certain circumstances, the mortgagee will have to pay the War Damage Contribution or possibly lose his capital.<br/>
The mortgagee relies not only on the real property security but on the personal bond of the mortgagor. What is this personal bond worth to-day, in many cases? What was the personal bond worth before the War Damage Act was passed last year? There was no compulsory insurance. There may have been many voluntary insurance schemes, and if the mortgagor did not wish to enter into such a scheme, he did not need to do so. Therefore, the mortgagee, whose only interest was the real property itself, stood to lose the whole of his capital, if the premises in question were blitzed and the mortgagor was unable to implement his personal bond. The War Damage Act has protected not only the holders of real property but the financial interests behind them. Even if we are not prepared to admit that finance is a partner with the holders of equities in property, it has a very substantial fiduciary interest in making sure that the property&#x2014;which means the capital&#x2014;is fully covered, and therefore, we say it should bear the proper share of the War Damage Contribution.<br/>
Mortgagees held out inducements to mortgagors to borrow money in order that buildings should be put up for the very lowest rented class of tenants. The Housing Acts of 1933 and 1936 offered special inducements to local authorities which would persuade housing associations and housing trusts to put up hereditaments mainly for the working classes. Those associations, of which there are many in this country, did a good job of work by building houses at low rents. They are forbidden to increase those rents, in spite of the abnormal, circumstances, and are now being forced to bear a heavy contribution, running into many thousands of pounds and jeopardising

their own solvency. There are many Amendments on the Order Paper dealing with those cases. I cannot imagine it is good policy for the Government to induce builders in whatever form, to put up houses for the working classes at low rents and then to throw on them a burden which they are not able to meet and which will, perhaps, force many of them, if the war lasts long enough, to go into bankruptcy. I cannot believe that that was the intention of the Government, and I hope that this argument alone will induce my right hon. Friend to see our point of view.<br/>
We are told that War Damage Contribution is a capital charge. That is all right in theory, but in practice many individuals, societies and companies are so mortgaged to-day that they cannot borrow any further capital. Indeed, if they wanted to, I am not at all sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would permit them to do so. I believe that he has given instructions to the banks to go very carefully in lending money for the acquisition of real estate. Money is now directed into the channels where the Chancellor wants it, namely, into war production. I know that building societies and banks have been prohibited from lending large sums of money for the acquisition of properties. Building has now almost ceased. War Damage Contribution has to be found out of income. It cannot be found out of capital. Rents have been controlled since the end of the last war, and rightly so. I am not advocating that rents should be put up in order to ease the burden of War Damage Contribution, but if rents are controlled, and then an unforeseen burden is thrown on those who receive them, there will be bankruptcy and insolvency far and wide. A very difficult position will be created. I do not know whether there is any way out of the position at the present moment, by the mortgagor passing on some of his burden, perhaps illegally. I do not think any have tried to do so yet, but facilities are given to the dishonest man to try and pass it on, even though he is prohibited from doing so by the Act.<br/>
I have given a few additional examples to those which I gave when I spoke on the Second Reading. I feel that there is support in all quarters of the House for the contention advanced in this Amendment. The mortgagee and house property


business has now assumed such proportions, whether considered from the angle of the building societies, the property investment companies, housing trusts or banks, and there are millions of people who own some share of the home in which they live, even though it may be only a very small share. If you stop these people from being thrifty and from putting more of their savings into their homes, you attack the foundations of our present order and of the reconstructed order which we want to see after the war. I would reiterate something of what I said on the previous occasion. In the homes of the people is the soundest and solidest sheet anchor for good citizenship, and anything which attacks that solid principle of our national life will be dangerous for the State and for the community. Because I believe that, I have moved the Amendment.</p>

<p>I do not propose to detain the Committee for more than a few minutes, but I should like to do my utmost to induce the Chancellor to reconsider his decision on this question of the liability of the mortgagee. I gather that his present decision is based on his desire to preserve the sanctity of contract, and probably to maintain the idea that investment in mortgages is a sound form of investment which should be encouraged. I do not think that I or any sane man could fail to sympathise with him in this desire, but in the case of war damage it seems to me that this question of upsetting a contract does not arise. A new and exceptional condition has been created by the war, and the decision of the Government was to meet this new condition by exceptional measures. This measure amounts to a levy on capital, and that falls, of course, at any rate at first, upon holders of property and then upon the whole community. It weighs heaviest on small property owners and upon those who have invested their money in the ordinary shares of a property company. I do not fancy that people who are not associated with property companies realise what tremendous damage they have had to face as a result of the war. It is not only the fact that their property has been destroyed, but that as a result of the blitzing of towns it has been extraordinarily difficult to let what remains. Consequently, their incomes are enormously reduced,

and this is the time when they are expected to pay&#x2014;and naturally in their own interests it is right that they should have to pay&#x2014;their contribution to the War Damage Fund.<br/>
It seems to me that it is quite impossible to deny the fact that all persons who lend money on property for other than a short term have a direct interest in the property, and this fact indeed is recognised, partially at any rate, in the Act of 1941. It seems to me, therefore, both illogical and unreasonable to bring into the scheme some long-term lenders and not others. I notice that the Chancellor, in his Second Reading speech, besides saying that he saw little difference between a mortgage and an ordinary debt, said that another reason which made him determine to maintain his attitude was that it was impracticable to draw up any simple formula for the mortgagee's contribution which could reasonably be applied to the various types of commercial mortgage, including floating charges, debenture capital and so forth. I appreciate that there may be some such difficulty, although I do not believe that any administrative difficulties are so great that they cannot be surmounted with a little good will. At the same time, there is a distinction between a long-term mortgage and a short one, and I should have thought that it might have been possible without any great difficulty to differentiate between the two. A lender lends his money on the security of the property, and in practice if the property is lost by enemy action or otherwise the lender will lose his money. The War Damage Act protects him against such loss caused by enemy action, and it seems to me only fair and just that mortgagees should come into the picture and take their share of the liability which is imposed upon the mortgagor. I do not propose to go any further into the matter to-day, because I know there are many other hon. Members who wish to speak. I do, however, associate myself very strongly with the speech just made by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger), and I hope that the Chancellor will see his way to come to the assistance of the mortgagor in this particular case.</p>

<p>I rise to oppose the principle which has been enunciated by my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger). I did so on


the Second Reading of the Bill, and today I do not propose to advance again the arguments which I then put forward. I rise because I am most anxious to put what I regard as a new view, and if that view is accepted by my hon. Friend, I am sure he would then see his way to withdraw his opposition to-day. In the early part of his speech he said that the Prime Minister had stated that the loss should be borne by the community as a whole. May I take the words of the Prime Minister? He promised that the damage suffered by enemy action would not be allowed to remain where it fell but would be borne by the whole community. Surely that is provided for in the Bill, which provides that after the first &#x00A3;200,000,000 of damage has been sustained the Government will be responsible for the second &#x00A3;200,000,000. Afterwards on any damage in excess of the &#x00A3;400,000,000 the Treasury will pay half the additional over and above that figure. I think that that puts the position in rather a different light, in view of the Prime Minister's statement, which in fact has been borne out by this Bill and by every action that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has taken during the course of the Debate.<br/>
There is another point that I might just mention in passing before I come to my main point. My hon. Friend stated that he knew that there were powerful financial interests behind this opposition. I am not here to say whether that be true or not, but I would like to say that, so far as I personally am concerned, I have no financial interest in it. I have never given a mortgage, nor have I ever taken one, and I have not been approached by any financial interest. I speak from a purely independent standpoint.<br/>
The point I wish to raise, and which I now come to, is this: In practice, it would not be possible to do what my hon. Friend desires. Indeed the very Amendment which is on the Paper in itself condemns what my hon. Friend has in view. The Clause to which I refer states:
<q>the expression 'mortgage' means any charge, lien, floating charge, debenture, debenture stock or like security on any property (including in that expression floating assets) for securing money or money's worth, other than a security, which can be discharged upon less than three months' notice".</q>
Take just one extract from the "Financial News," which I should say was supporting

my hon. Friend's Amendment. I can take their own words to oppose it. This extract says:
<q>In the case of a property company, the contribution is in effect paid by the ordinary shareholder. The debenture holder goes free, although his interest in the property is real. Even if the Amendment were agreed to, he would still come off better than the ordinary shareholder.</q>
I maintain that you cannot really separate a mortgagee from a debenture holder. Therefore, for all practical purposes both come under the same category. A mortgagor is in the same position as an ordinary shareholder in a company. He owns the whole of the equity of the property or business. The mortgagee is in the same position as the debenture holder in a limited company. He holds a charge upon the whole of the properties of the company and usually also upon the floating assets. One might therefore argue&#x2014;indeed, one should argue if my hon. Friend is right&#x2014;that debenture holders in all limited liability companies should contribute towards the cost of war insurance in the same way.<br/>
In other words, the point I wish to make is that for all practical purposes a mortgage, whether it be a single mortgage on a property or whether it be a mortgage company that issues debentures and ordinary shares, both of these cases are parallel with the ordinary great industrial concerns that issues debentures which are secured upon the properties of the company. Indeed, if they had not the properties on which to secure the debenture no company would be able to issue a debenture. What takes place? The debenture holder secures his fixed rate of interest, nothing more. The ordinary shareholder holds the equity of the business. If the business is successful the ordinary shareholder comes off well. That applies equally to a mortgagor. On the other hand, if the business is unsuccessful, the ordinary shareholder derives no benefit upon his investment. That is parallel with the case of a company which owns property, whether a company owns property only or whether it owns property, plus machinery, plus business. So I maintain that no argument has been advanced which could really substantiate the argument which has been put forward, and for those reasons I oppose the Amendment which is before the Committee.</p>

<p>I do not know that I can add very much to the arguments which have been put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) and my hon. and gallant Friend the member for North Newcastle (Sir C. Headlam). But I make no apology for bringing forward this question, because my feeling is that it is the one serious criticism against a Bill which is otherwise a very brave and courageous measure to meet the abnormal circumstances in which we find ourselves. I hope that I can impress the Chancellor with the strength of feeling which I think exists throughout the country on this one point. I have read the remarks of the Chancellor and the Attorney-General upon the Second Reading, and I gather that they both feel that the relationship between a mortgagee and a mortgagor is only that of an ordinary borrower and lender. My view, and I believe it is the view of many people throughout the country, is that in these abnormal circumstances the only real criterion which can be applied is this: Has the mortgagee any interest whatsoever in what happens to the property on which he has lent his money? If he has any interest, it is only equitable that he should bear a part of this contribution. May I put it in this way? Suppose this Act were taken off the Statute Book to-morrow morning. I wonder who would be on the Chancellor's doorstep first to ask for it to be re-enacted, the mortgagees or the mortgagors?<br/>
Supposing this Act were not on the Statute Book, would I be right in saying that in connection with the property which has been badly destroyed and upon which a mortgage exists at least 90 per cent. of the mortgagees would in fact lose every penny they have put into that property? In other words, I contend that the mortgagee is very definitely an interested party. I know that the argument has been used that he does not pay any of the fire insurance. That was dealt with very fully and, if I may say so, very ably, by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw, and I do not propose to refer to it. We also have another argument put forward, that if the mortgagees were called upon to bear some share of this contribution, it would give such a shock, as it were, to their nervous systems that property-owning businesses after the war would

not be able to obtain money as they were able to do before the war.</p>

<p>Would my hon. and gallant Friend agree that a debenture holder in a public company would be in precisely the same position and that therefore if my right hon. Friend were to consent to my hon. Friend's suggestion he would also have to make it compulsory on debenture holders also to pay a contribution? If the mortgagee had to pay a contribution in regard to mortgages taken out in the future, the mortgagee would take this liability into consideration and ask an appropriate or equivalent increased rate of interest. In regard to existing mortgages, the mortgagee could, and in many instances would, call in the mortgage, or alternatively come to agreement with the mortgagor to increase the rate of interest to compensate him for the insurance to be paid.</p>

<p>I think the position is exactly the same except that in one sense you may argue that the ordinary mortgagee may conceivably have some remedy in a personal covenant to recover his money, but a debenture holder has none. If the property is destroyed, he has no chance of recovering the money he has invested in that company. As I was remarking, we have had the argument that it would give this shock to the mortgagee interests, and therefore in the long run it would not be an advantage to property owners to pass on some part of this charge to the mortgagees. I fail to be impressed by that argument. It seems to me that it is an argument that you can use as a boomerang. In other words, if building and property owning generally is put at the grave disadvantage it appears to be at, you might find that people who would normally come forward after the war to put up houses will be just as disinclined to do so as we are told mortgagees will be to-day if they are called upon to bear some of this cost. In other words, my own opinion is, that taking the long view, the only sound thing, as well as the only equitable thing, to do is to spread the risk over as many people who are interested in the property as possible. May I deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Ealing (Sir F. Sanderson)? I understood that his point was that the proposers of this Amendment might be prepared to withdraw if the Treasury would provide the second &#x00A3;200,000,000.</p>

<p>That was not my point. The point I was endeavouring to make was that my hon. Friend who moved the Amendment thought that there was really no limit to the amount to which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor must be prepared to go to meet his case, if he was going to be equitable and just. Therefore, he may realise that he has no alternative but to withdraw his Amendment.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) is impressed by that argument, but I confess that I am not impressed by it. If the contribution had been pound for pound from the beginning, I might be prepared to withdraw my Amendment; but I hope, at any rate, that we have not yet reached the first &#x00A3;200,000,000 worth of war damage from air raids. I was struck by the argument that this is an ordinary transaction between lender and borrower. If so, why make any exemption at all? Why make an exemption in respect of property of less value than &#x00A3;250 in cases where the money was specifically lent to build or to buy the house? Could anything be more unfair than an exemption granted on the question of purchase? I do not think it matters whether the money was lent to buy the house, to finance a business, or to spend at the races: the only question is, Has the mortgagee any interest in what has happened to it? I hope I have been able to impress the Chancellor with the strength of the feeling which exists throughout the country. He cannot have failed to notice that, both on the Second Reading and to-day, this point has been strongly urged from all parts of the House. I do not know whether there is any difficulty in collecting from the mortgagees. I cannot see that there is. It will simply be the case that the mortgage interest is subject to a deduction of 2s. in the &#x00A3;. I do not press the actual words of the Amendment in my name; if the Chancellor appreciates the principle upon which I and others feel so strongly, he may be able to meet this very important point.</p>

<p>I think we should try to draw a distinction in our minds between equity and soundness. We want, first, to consider whether the Amendment proposed is equitable or not, and, secondly, whether it is sound

or not. On the question of equity, it has been generally admitted, in spite of what was said by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Hornsey (Captain Gammans), that there is, in fact, a dividing line on grounds of equity between those who borrow for the purpose of building or buying homes to live in themselves, and those who do so for other purposes&#x2014;for example, in order to make an income or a capital profit. It is possible to exaggerate the analogy a little further. Surely, there is a difference in equity between someone who mortgages a house in order to own and live in it, and someone who mortgages the house he owns for the purpose of buying a pearl necklace for his wife, or, it may be, for a lady who is not his wife. Surely, between those extreme examples there is a difference in equity. It is not possible to disregard the purpose of the borrower, when considering the question of equity. I think that public opinion has generally accepted the very rough attempt to draw the line just above the small owner, to the value of &#x00A3;150 a year. Above that value, roughly speaking, the transactions come into the category of what might be called commercial borrowing and commercial lending, transactions between people who are engaged in the business for profit.<br/>
Once one gets above the level where equity governs, and into the field of commercial borrowing, it becomes a question of whether what is proposed by the Amendment is sound or not. Here I would join issue with my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Newcastle (Sir C. Headlam) and my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Hornsey on the question of soundness. Those of us who desire that things should be left as they are do not do so because of any abstract principle of the sanctity of contract. In point of fact&#x2014;and I speak from practical experience of this, as a director both of an insurance company which lends a lot of money on mortgage and of a bank which has a certain amount of mortgage transactions, and in other capacities where I have to deal daily with mortgagors and mortgagees&#x2014;one is continually having to amend a contract because of the borrower's circumstances. There is never any objection by a lender to amending a borrower's contract when the borrower is in difficulties. But what we seek to avoid is any possibility that the form of a contract which has been such a valuable


servant to many forms of industry for so long should be interfered with in order to relieve the present difficulties of some borrowers. Particular borrowers can always meet their lenders, and in 99 cases out of 100 get their contracts adjusted on equitable grounds of pure reason. But this business of borrowing and lending on mortgage has been a very valuable servant to the borrowing and lending community for over 200 years, and we do not want to see that form of contract upset. It is not a question of seeing that every contract made in that form is maintained, but of not upsetting the general form.<br/>
Here I speak also from the point of view of a director of investing companies which have substantial investments in the equity of large property companies. From that point of view, although the ordinary shares of those property companies are suffering at the present time, and although their sufferings are partly due to the additional load placed upon them by the War Damage Contribution, we do not, as investors in the equity, wish to see destroyed a form of covenant which is the very basis of our prosperity in peace-time. I could give figures which would reinforce what the hon. and gallant Member for North Newcastle has said about the importance of this whole thing to the property companies, but I think those figures would probably lead the Committee to a conclusion different from that which Members were invited to draw by the hon. and gallant Member for North Newcastle. An ordinary structure for a large property company might be &#x00A3;9,000,000 book value of property, of which they would be borrowing &#x00A3;6,000,000, and the remaining &#x00A3;3,000,000 might be represented by the equity capital. As a general rule that &#x00A3;9,000,000 of property may be earning 6 per cent. net, and on &#x00A3;6,000,000 of borrowed money the property company has to pay only 3&#x00BE; or 4 per cent. It is simple mathematics to show that 6 per cent. on &#x00A3;9,000,000, which is &#x00A3;540,000, less 4 per cent. on &#x00A3;6,000,000, which is &#x00A3;240,000, leaves &#x00A3;300,000 for the &#x00A3;3,000,000 equity capital, which is 10 per cent. thereon. That form of borrowing cheap money on mortgage has been the basis of the property companies' success for quite a period of years. I know of a particular company&#x2014;and all the companies are

comparable, though they differ in detail&#x2014;which for years in peace-time was paying 11 per cent. on its ordinary shares owing to the fact that it was borrowing &#x00A3;6,000,000 at an average rate of 4 per cent. or 3&#x00BE; per cent. To-day that company is paying nothing on its ordinary shares, and, very roughly, what has brought that about is that there has been a fall in net rentals of &#x00A3;263,000 a year and an increased charge owing to the War Damage Act of &#x00A3;70,000 a year, a total of &#x00A3;333,000 a year, and the 11 per cent. dividend used to take &#x00A3;275,000.<br/>
It is clear that the major reason why that company is not paying a dividend now is not on account of War Damage Contribution, which is merely a contributory cause, but because of the falling-off of rents. It would not be proper to say at this time whether the net rentals are improving again, because that might possibly be an indication to the enemy whether particular towns were filling up or not, but if it should be the case that a large part of that loss in net revenue which took place in 1940 has now been restored, does that alter the situation with regard to the equity of whether the mortgagee should make a contribution? It might be that, without any question of this War Damage Contribution, this company might get back to the position where it could pay 11 per cent. on its equity capital. Meanwhile still the mortgagees would go on getting only their 3&#x00BE; and 4 per cent. The company might own property in a town in which there had been considerable destruction of property and there might be a great shortage of housing, office and shop space in that town after the war, and a considerable increase in rentals. The company, with the improving rentals it would get after the war, might be in a position to pay 16 per cent. or 18 per cent. on its ordinary shares. Is it desired or proper to suggest that in those circumstances the amount of interest that it pays to the holders of mortgage debentures should be increased? I do not think that the Movers of this Amendment contemplate that that should be done by the equity holders, who are suffering very much from the present situation.<br/>
I speak on this matter without any direct money interest of my own, but as touching it from many angles, as a Director and as a Trustee, from the point


of view of insurance companies, which lend money on mortgage and from the much less affected point of view of the short-term lenders, the banks and others, who do not have to make new contracts if they do not want to, and therefore would not accept real property as part of their security if it carried this proposed disadvantage; and also from the point of view of the investment trusts which invest moneys in the equity of property companies. "From all these viewpoints we invite my right hon. Friend the Chancellor to leave this question alone. It is a question of sound business policy. It is a question of what is the best business. From the point of view of the investor, and as representing investors in the equities of the property companies, we would very much prefer that the management of these property companies should occupy their minds with other activities than a political agitation which can only serve in the long run to destroy the very basis of the prosperity of the companies which they are managing.</p>

<p>I have not intervened in these Debates before because I was not able to do so, but I am very sorry that when I do so I should have to differ from one who was my old Chief when he was Minister of Health. My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson) has justified the present position on the broad grounds that it would upset a form of service which has been of very great advantage in general housing development. That is true, but as far as I can see, no one wants to upset it, neither the hon. and gallant Member for Hornsey (Captain Gammans), the hon. Member for Basset-law (Mr. Bellenger) nor the hon. and gallant Member for North Newcastle-on-Tyne (Sir C. Headlam). All that they ask is that, in providing against an unknown risk which is something altogether different from the ordinary risks that may fall in peace-time, but a risk which falls upon rich and poor alike, there should be no form of property, investment or finance which should be put into a privileged position. That is the position without a shadow of doubt. It does not matter whether rich people invest in equities, debentures or mortgages, the fact remains that companies which carry on with borrowed money are having a bad time

now. The whole of the burden of providing for the security of the money advanced by the mortgagee falls on the equity and not on the mortgagor. It really does not comfort a particular company to know that at some unspecified date in the post-war period they will earn 18 per cent. The point is that here and now this burden has fallen upon them. These housing companies, particularly the Voluntary Housing Associations who use this form of mortgage, find it very difficult to keep up their contributions.<br/>
I realise the difficulty of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is difficult to distinguish between the different forms of lending in respect of the different propertie's. He has been rather ingenious in Section 25 of the Act in making a distinction there. The principle is admitted in that Clause that, in so far as building societies lend money in respect of certain classes of mortgage, they should pay a proportion of the contribution accofding to a sliding scale. All we ask is for an extension of that principle. We are putting a liability upon building and other societies, which is not shared by insurance companies. Why should we put one in a more favourable position than the other? I think the Committee will agree that there are certain institutions, like banks, which do not make a general principle of investing in property. If I want to borrow money from my bank, I may have to put down some security, some collateral, but it is not the business of a bank normally to invest in property. It is the business of a bank to accommodate clients in finance, and no one would wish to increase the liability of the banks. But there are agencies which normally and habitually advance money on the security of a mortgage or of debenture shares in a company, all of which is in the nature of an investment. It should be possible for the Chancellor to find some method whereby, if such advances do take the form of investment in property, then, at least the man who is mortgagor or the man who is lending the money should bear his share of the burden that falls on every one, rich or poor alike.<br/>
I cannot understand the basis on which this Bill is drawn up. It does not matter whether a man puts his house against a loan and gives a pearl necklace to his wife. The point is that he


invests his money in a house. For what purpose he requires money seems to me to be immaterial. Under the Amendment the mortgagee, instead of getting 5 per cent., would get 4&#x00BD; per cent. In other words, he would receive one-tenth less as his contribution for the general security of the property concerned. I think a holder in equity would be very lucky if, after the war, he thought he would get back nine-tenths of the value of what he had lost. I hope the Chancellor will realise that there is great feeling in the Committee and outside, and that he will be able to do something to meet it.</p>

<p>I hope the Chancellor has been impressed, not merely by the arguments which have been addressed to him now and in the Second Reading Debate, but by the fact that those arguments have been addressed to him from all quarters of the Committee by Members who, on other matters, do not act in common and who differ fundamentally very often upon their approach to social questions of this kind.

<p>No, perhaps it does not, but it is important that the Chancellor should bear in mind that this cannot be said to be a sectional appeal. It has come from all quarters and from varied interests. What is really at stake is a general principle. My right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) and the hon. Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson) both disclaimed any financial interest in this matter, and we accept what they say, but when they both said so I was forcibly reminded&#x2014;I hope they will not mind&#x2014;of an epigram by the late Humbert Wolfe. He once wrote:
<q>You cannot hope to bribe or twist,</q>
<q>Thank God, the British journalist,</q>
<q>But seeing what the man will do,</q>
<q>Unbribed, there's no occasion to.</q>

I could not help thinking of that when they rose in order to give effect to a principle that really is indefensible. What is the purpose of the Act? It is to see that losses caused to property-owners by enemy action shall not be borne by the property on which the bomb falls but shall be equitably shared among all those people who have common interests and who should share that burden. That is the purpose of the Act. An hon. Member opposite said it was most important that you should not alter the mortgage contract but you cannot help altering it. It has been altered by the war, by this peril The question is not whether you shall or shall not write a new term into the mortgage deed. You must write a new term into the mortgage deed. You are writing it into the mortgage deed whether the Amendment is passed or rejected. The question is what the new term is to be. It is nonsense to say that you can leave the mortgage contract where it was. You could have done so if there had been no war, but here there enters into the substance of the contract something which neither the money-lender nor the borrower contemplated, something which they cannot control. The State has thought it right to legislate for that and legislate for it we must. It is for us to say that whatever new term we write into the mortgage, it shall be fair and equitable, ensuring a reasonably shared burden.<br/>
In order to examine whether, without this Amendment, the burden is equitably shared, let us see what is the position of the two parties under the Act. The hon. Member opposite raised the question of who would complain most, if there were no Bill. Let us see who would complain most. What is the position of the mortgagees under the Act, whose positions would be effected by this Amendment? If the property upon the security of which he lends his money disappears as a result of enemy action, a money-lender loses, nothing whatever. He is entitled to the whole of the debt acknowledged to be due by the Commission so far as his mortgage claim extends. It is true that he has to wait for that money until after the war, but, in the meantime, the borrower is bound by law to pay every penny of the contractual interest even though the War Damage Commission only pays to the borrower 2&#x00BD; per cent. The money-lender, therefore, is fully and completely secured both as to the return of his capital and as


to the payment in the meantime of every penny to which he is entitled under the letter of the mortgage deed. For that security what does he pay under the Act.<br/>
The answer is that he pays nothing. How can anybody seriously argue that that is equitably sharing a burden? There is a situation in which, on the one side, a person is entirely secure and cannot lose in any circumstances, and pays for that complete security not one penny, whereas, on the other side, a man who pays the whole of the contribution gets a partial security long deferred and has to pay in the meantime every penny to the moneylender to whom he is bound by the original contract. It really does not bear examination. The Attorney-General, in replying to this kind of argument in the Second Reading Debate, said that the Bill would admit that principle wherever the money had been lent for the purpose of buying or building the property affected.</p>

<p>I would point out that I went on to say words to this effect&#x2014;in circumstances similar to a building society mortgage, where it could be said that there was an analogy with the-position of landlord and tenant.</p>

<p>I accept that. I was only attempting to state briefly the spirit of the argument to which the Attorney-General lent his support. That argument attempted to draw a distinction between money borrowed generally for the purposes of the building upon which it was borrowed, and money borrowed upon the security of a building for extraneous commercial purposes. I think the Attorney-General will agree that that is a fair statement of the argument. In order to illustrate the matter, the Attorney-General said that a man who lends his money upon the security of a building accepts a lower rate of interest than he might get if he had no security. He said it was fantastic to argue, in those circumstances, that the man ought to be called upon to bear a share of this contribution. The Attorney-General said that that argument is fantastic, and if he says so, perhaps it is, but all I can say is that what seems to him to be fantastic is to me the plainest of common sense, and indeed, since we are bandying words, I should have thought it was his argument

and not ours that was fantastic. Once it is admitted that the moneylender has himself so highly valued the security which he gets as to be willing to forfeit a share of the return in order to get that security, surely it is established that he has an interest in the property for which he is willing to pay good hard money and to accept a lower rate of interest in order to obtain the security based upon that property. How, then, can it be argued that he has no interest in the property? His interest in the property is precisely measurable; he has valued it himself, and has paid for it according to his assessment. Certainly, he is interested in it, and if he is interested in it, he ought equitably to bear his fair share of the cost of preserving the value of that security against the acts of the King's enemies. That is all that is contended.<br/>
Were it not for the big financial interests involved, the insurance companies and the banks, this Amendment would not be resisted. It cannot be resisted in equity, and it would not in fact be resisted but for the power of these great financial organisations. This is a Bill, as it stands, to make the world safe for moneylenders. They are the only people who are fully secured under the Bill. They are the only people who will pay no share of the cost of insuring their security. It is not right that a great social Measure of this kind should be not merely marred but, as far as these matters are covered, destroyed in the public mind as an equitable Measure by its tender regard for institutions that are better able to look after themselves than are those for whose interests we are contending in this Amendment. If there had been advanced good, sound and equitable reasons why these particular mortgagees alone should escape any share of the common burden, we would not be pressing this Amendment upon the Government. But I say that no one who has listened to the two Debates on this matter, the Second Reading Debate and the Debate on the present Amendment, can think for one moment that any sound case for this favourable discrimination has been or can be made, and I hope it is not too late for the Government to look at this matter again with a view either to accepting one or other of the Amendments&#x2014;I would prefer the one that raises the general principle&#x2014;or, if they think that the


Amendments do not effectively deal with the matter, finding some other machinery for carrying out what I think is the universal opinion of the Committee.</p>

<p>I want to reinforce the arguments that have been used in this Debate, and to say how unusual it is that on a matter of this kind the arguments should come from every quarter of the Committee. As the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman) has said, there is a widespread desire to remedy an injustice which is apparent and inherent in the Bill as it now stands. This is not an insurance scheme. If it were an insurance scheme, the owner of property would have the right to decide whether or not he should come into it. This Bill imposes obligations on every owner of property in however remote or safe an area of the country the property may be. There is no choice and no opportunity for the property owner to elect whether or not he will come into the scheme. But there is this point, that wherever and in however dangerous a position may be the property on which the money has been advanced, the property is guaranteed against war damage for the benefit of the moneylender who has lent money on it without his making a penny contribution to the scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson) concluded his remarks by saying that the matter should be left as it is. There are many people in remote parts of England who would not come into this scheme unless the Government compelled them to do so. The purpose of the scheme is to spread the burden as far as possible and as fairly as possible, and the sole test is whether a person has a definable interest in the property of which he may suffer some loss. I do not believe the Chancellor intends to accept the Amendment, but unless he does so, it will go out that of all the people who are interested in the property only the moneylenders can get benefits for which they do not pay.</p>

<p>Let me say in reply to the observations which have been made that I hope the Committee will dismiss from its mind any question here of sinister vested interests. Indeed this is the first time this notion has been imported into our discussions. If we were to look into the question we should, I suppose, find

that the large section who might be particularly interested in this Amendment are proprietors of great blocks of flats who have felt the considerable weight of the contributions which have to be paid under this Measure, coming on top of the very considerable losses which they have sustained by loss of rents. I am very sorry for them, but I am glad to observe, without giving any secrets away to the enemy, that the loss in regard to rents is now rapidly disappearing. Therefore, if one wishes to go into the motives, or into the question of where vested interests stand, much can be said on both sides. And let us not prejudice the position by using a word to which some people object. A stigma seems to be attached to the word "moneylender," which my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Holland-with-Boston (Lieutenant Butcher) used of the mortgagee.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that my hon. and gallant Friend should use the words "borrower" and "lender." The word "moneylender" has that little touch which excites prejudice. Let us put these two matters on one side and endeavour to deal with the case on its merits. It is a case for which much can be said from both points of view. This is, of course, not the first time we have had to deal with this problem. The House has already debated it and come to a decision. That decision was taken when the first Measure was brought before the House. That Measure was the subject of very careful consideration. Points of view were put by both sides, both in this House and in another place. Therefore, as I say, we are not considering this matter for the first time. What we are really being asked to do now is to upset a decision which was arrived at by both Houses before the principal Act was put on the Statute Book. It would have very serious consequences, quite apart from the merits of the proposal, if we reversed that decision at this stage. The House of Commons has power to take a step of that kind, but first, it must have regard to the previous decision, and whether there is a considerable amount of


opinion to support such a course. We have only to look round the Committee to-day to judge the measure of that. [<i>Interruption</i>.] My hon. Friend draws attention to the hour of the day; but I myself have not had an opportunity to avail myself of it. This Debate has been going on for some time, and here we are a nice little happy party&#x2014;and no more than that. It does not look to me as if the masses of the country are up in revolution about this proposal.<br/>
I do not for a moment desire to minimise the arguments which have been advanced against the Government's proposal by my hon. Friends, who always speak with great force and persuasion, but we have to have, not only an overwhelming case, but a case which is backed up by a very large body of opinion&#x2014;larger than has been exhibited to-day&#x2014;before we can reverse a decision of this kind. What was the decision taken? In a typically British way we arrived at a compromise on this proposal, although, no doubt, it can be attacked upon strictly logical grounds. The compromise which we reached, as the Committee is well aware, was that we would make special provision for cases excepted by the House. There was a special kind of relationship between landlord and tenant, and for that we made special provision. The compromise was accepted, and, as is set out in the Section of the principal Act, no contributions are made by the mortgagee.</p>

<p>I do not want to interrupt my argument to deal with that. I would refer my hon. Friend to the Section of the Act, with which I think most Members are fully familiar. The arrangement was come to after the most careful consideration, yet it is that arrangement which we are now asked to upset. There were very good grounds for that decision. I do not think that sufficient ground for altering that decision has been given by anything said in the course of this Debate.<br/>
Since the principal Act was passed the position of the persons who have to pay contributions has been very much improved by the decision of the Government

and the course of events which have taken place since the first Bill was introduced. A considerable contribution is exacted from those who have to make it. But so far as concerns the bearing of the burdens, there has been great improvement since the House came to its decision on the last occasion, and that must obviously be borne in mind in our consideration of the matter to-day. It is true, as has been indicated by some hon. Members, that if a house is completely destroyed the mortgagee comes in and takes the whole amount of the money that is due to him. He has paid no contribution towards it, and therefore he receives great advantages under the Measure. It is entirely overlooked however that, owing to the provisions of the Bill and the money which has been found by compensation, the person who has borrowed the money is relieved entirely from the covenant into which he has entered and the obligation which he has incurred, which would follow him for the rest of his life if it were not otherwise met. And you must have regard in all these cases to the fact that, apart altogether from the question of the mortgaged property, there is a personal covenant entered into which in a very large number of cases is of considerable value. I do not think there will be very many who, with the choice of mortgages available to-day, would themselves lend money or advise other people to lend money to people with shaky reputations or about whose honesty there was doubt.<br/>
One of my hon. Friends instanced the position of some of these large property-owners and the important and proper part that they play in lending money for the purchase of houses and matters of that sort. There is another section of the community whom I do not want to see prevented from assisting us in our housing efforts in the future. I think it is the experience of almost all of us&#x2014;it was certainly mine in days gone by in my professional capacity&#x2014;that one of the best things in the country was the number of people, not with large fortunes, who were prepared to lend sums of &#x00A3;300, &#x00A3;400 or &#x00A3;500 on property and to regard it as a first-class investment. One has often been asked to advise as to the choice of investments for such sums, and again and again it has been said, "This is one of the safest investments you could make. It is true you are not getting a big sum by


way of interest. You could get more if you liked to take a measure of risk, but if you lend your money in this way at a smaller rate of interest you are sure of getting it and it is one of the best and safest securities you can have." I submit we should not do anything to make people look askance at that kind of investment. If you begin to interfere and make arrangements of that kind impossible, you will be doing a great deal of mischief. We shall want all the assistance we can get in dealing with the housing problem after the war, and I believe that in this way a very useful contribution can continue to be made by those investors who have helped us so much in the past. Therefore, I will do nothing which might disturb or interfere with that valuable type of investment.<br/>
The difficulties are also illustrated by the Amendments that appear on the Paper. All sorts of suggestions have been made in order to overcome them. One of my hon. Friends seeks some kind of remedy in an arbitrary contribution to be made by the mortgagee, which he fixes at 2s. in the &#x00A3;1. Other of my hon. Friends have, I suppose, apprehended the difficulties which arise from bank overdrafts and commercial mortgages and they in their turn have put down varying Amendments, all in an endeavour to meet an extremely difficult situation. If we attempted to put upon the Statute Book the Amendment that we are debating, it would throw into chaos many commercial transactions. When the Act was in another place Amendments were moved designed to meet the difficulty, which it was found impossible to accept. If we accepted this Amendment or any of the others on the Paper a difficult position would be created with regard to debenture holders covering in their security some measure of real property. I can visualise a large gold-mining company with a head office in the City of London. The contribution they would have to make in respect of that building under the War Damage scheme would be hardly of any account for such a large company. If, however, this proposal were followed to its logical conclusion, there would have to be a fractional deduction in the case of every one of the people concerned with debentures. Clearly it would be impossible to follow out, in practice, a proposal of this kind.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend does not follow me. I am pointing out how impossible it would be to obtain the contributions where the building was covered by debentures. I will look at some of the suggestions that have been made. I do not think it is possible to distinguish housing associations from others. I think that the House came to a reasonable decision on the last occasion. It is a compromise and I would advise the Committee to adhere to it. It has been illustrated, again and again, that that decision is a reasonable compromise, and the solution of many of the difficulties that confront us in dealing with this matter.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has almost converted me against him. On this matter I have differed with many of my property-owning friends, but now the Chancellor says, "Look at this man. He is a mortgagee and is therefore a valuable creature. We must cosset him and be careful with him, or otherwise he will not come forward in future and lend money on mortgage." If you lend &#x00A3;400 on mortgage you are safe, but if you use the &#x00A3;400 to buy the other end of the house, the equity end, you have to carry the whole burden. There is a house worth &#x00A3;800. If you buy the back end the Chancellor comes to your aid and you must not pay one penny. If you buy the other end you are like Barnum's elephant, you have to carry the whole lot. My King Charles's head is that this problem will never be solved until we provide compensation for loss of rent and the rates of contribution should run for a sufficient number of years to meet all charges. The burden is very oppressive on some mortgagors. Take the case of a house with a Schedule A value of &#x00A3;100. The income runs out roughly the same as Schedule A. There is &#x00A3;60 mortgage interest to be paid to the mortgagor, who pays 5s. in the &#x00A3; contribution on his income. He is paying only 2s. in the &#x00A3; on the &#x00A3;100, but his income is only &#x00A3;40. On that he has to make a contribution of &#x00A3;10, which is 5s. in the &#x00A3;. The Chancellor, by way of Income Tax, takes any &#x00A3;10, so that these people are bearing a burden, where the mortgage is 60 per cent. of the total, of 15s. in the &#x00A3;. If the mortgage is 70 per cent. there


is only 1s. 6d. in the &#x00A3; left out of the whole income. It really is, therefore, a very oppressive burden. It is not 2s. in the &#x00A3;, but anything from 3s. to 8s. according to the proportion which the mortgage interest bears to the Schedule A valuation. That is an aspect of the problem to which the Chancellor has not yet devoted sufficient attention.<br/>
I am satisfied that until a change is made in some direction or another, this agitation will continue. I have tried to explain to my property-owning friends that mortgages have to be divided into two categories. There are those which are associated with the purchase of a house and those advanced for reasons which have nothing to do with the purchase of a house. I do not go so far as the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman) who suggested that big financial interests were behind the Chancellor in preventing him from doing what is desired. I think that it is the desire to preserve the sanctity of contracts that is fundamental in the Chancellor's mind. It is no good attacking the banks and insurance companies and calling them great financial interests. They are trustees and we have to bear that in mind. My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson) is the director of an insurance company in which I have insured my life. He does not take a narrow selfish view of the affairs of his company as a director, but he acts as a trustee of the thousands of people whose capital is with the company. There is no narrow selfish point of view in these concerns, and it weakens our case to say that there is.</p>

<p>I did not suggest that anyone was taking a narrow or selfish view. I did assert, and I repeat, that even if the great institutions are acting in a trustee capacity and are as altruistic as my hon. Friend suggests, this Amendment would not be resisted but for their influence.</p>

<p>The phrase used was "big financial interests," and we know its implications&#x2014;that they are necessarily dirty dogs who must have no consideration. We all indulge in that kind of prejudice. It goes down splendidly when we are addressing our constituents on enthusiastic occasions. There was a proposed new Clause on the Paper in my name

which was not called because it was thought that the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for the Abbey Division of Westminster (Sir H. Webbe) which follows this would cover the point. The idea was that where the purchase of the property and the mortgage were transactions which took place at the same time and where they were definitely associated, the mortgagee should pay part of the contribution. We have the case of the housing associations. The proposal which I tabled affected the First National Housing Trust, which has large estates in Croydon and many other parts of the country. The Chancellor of the Exchequer actually cut the first sod of an estate in Birmingham undertaken by the Trust, and, therefore, he is interested in seeing that the great estates which he helped to develop when Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health, are not oppressively treated. When they raised the money they did not raise a separate mortgage on each house but raised a collective mortgage upon the lot, and therefore they do not get the advantage of the compromise.<br/>
They do not get the advantage of the compromise because Lord Kennet, when he was Minister of Health, with the support of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health, passed through Parliament a very valuable housing Bill whereby people who in the ordinary way could have got mortgages up to 60 per cent. could raise a mortgage up to 90 per cent. The State came to their aid in order to encourage masses of people to buy their houses. As a result of that useful Housing Act a large number of additional houses were constructed, but the people concerned with their construction, entirely as a result of the form of the Housing Act, 1932, not through any malice on their part, not through any ill-will but merely because they were complying with one useful Act of Parliament, are now condemned under the War Damage Act. Having regard to my declarations in the past, I cannot go so far as to support the Amendment before the Committee, but I hope nevertheless that consideration will be given, if not to-day, at any rate before the Report stage, to proposals for abating an injustice which manifestly now exists.</p>

<p>I have followed this Debate closely and I


am satisfied that those Members who put their names to these several Amendments had just occasion for doing so. The Chancellor has endeavoured to push this Amendment on one side, because Parliament has already passed the War Damage Act. I do not want the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to be too severe with me regarding the observations I am going to make, but at the time that Measure was passing through this House I think I am right in saying that he made an observation to the effect that it was a make-shift Measure. If those were not his exact words the words he used had that meaning, and I would say that it was a correct expression, because Parliament was doing something it had never done before and something which was deliberately contrary to the undertaking which the Prime Minister himself had given to the House. Long before the War Damage Act was introduced the Prime Minister made a statement at that Box to the effect that the State would be responsible for damage incurred through enemy action. That undertaking has never been implemented. We have had an experimental period and we have found that there are faults in this original Act, and I say there is justification for accepting one or other of these Amendments, or a compromise based on the whole of them.<br/>
I want to say that I am opposed strongly to the mortgagee making any contribution. But the position is not normal. The very fact that Parliament has put the War Damage Act on the Statute Book has created an abnormal situation, and if the Government choose to deal with this very serious matter in this way I feel justified in supporting these Amendments, although in principle I am against the mortgagee making any contribution. It has been asked, "But what</p>

<p>is the mortgagee's interest?" It has been said that he has merely lent money upon a definite security. His interest in the matter is more clearly identified. When money is borrowed on a property it is the natural and proper thing to insure that property against fire, and the mortgagee says, "I must have my name endorsed oh that policy as recognising that I have part ownership." I think that is so; and if that is correct, then it is right, having regard to this abnormal piece of legislation that we should expect the Government, who have failed to implement the Prime Minister's undertaking, to endeavour to bring about an equitable adjustment among the various interests. The imposition on property-owners to-day is very great, and, as I have told my property-owning friends, I blame them to a large extent for it, because there is no unity among them. If there were unity in the ranks of property-owners, this legislation would never be on the Statute Book, because it is such a piece of gross injustice. I said so yesterday and repeat it to-day. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, in his cynical way, seemed to brush that on one side, but, after all, the property-owners of this country have a right to expect justice from this House. I hope that the Financial Secretary will report to the Chancellor that there are other Members in this Committee whom he has not heard who feel that some consideration should be given to these Amendments between now and the Report stage, in an endeavour to see whether even a small measure of justice cannot be given to the property-owning community.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 19, line 5, at the end, to insert:
<q>except in any case where the Commissioners of Inland Revenue have allowed the discharge of such liability to be deferred by reason of the fact that a payment in respect of expenditure on the making good of war damage to property has accrued or is accruing but has not been discharged.</q>
It is sought to insert this Amendment at the end of sub-paragraph 12, which provides:


<q>A right to indemnity conferred by Part I of, or the Fourth Schedule to, the principal Act or by paragraph 9 of this Schedule shall not be enforceable until the discharge of the liability in respect of which the right arises.</q>
The exception we seek to insert is:
<q>except in any case where the Commissioners of Inland Revenue have allowed the discharge of such liability to be deferred by reason of the fact that a payment in respect of expenditure on the making good of war damage to property has accrued or is accruing but has not been discharged.</q>
The right to indemnity which is referred to in sub-paragraph 12 of the Second Schedule to the Bill is the right which arises under the principal Act that the ground landlord shall make a partial contribution to the contribution made by the direct contributor. In the Fourth Schedule to the principal Act there is a table which defines the appropriate proportions in which the contribution is ultimately to be divided between the direct contributor and the ground landlord or other parties bearing a similar relation to him. As matters would stand, were the Bill to proceed unamended so far as this sub-paragraph 12 is concerned, the direct contributor, whose contribution is deferred because there is accruing to him a war damage payment of some kind, as in those circumstances where there is a permitted set-off, would not obtain the due indemnity from the ground landlord according to the strict wording, although I do not think according to the intention of the Government. He would not be able to get this indemnity although he had in effect discharged his liability to the contribution, because what he is to receive will be subject to an appropriate set-off. I think that the matter will be corrected if the Chancellor can accept the words of the Amendment or some similar words so as to secure in effect that a set-off shall be equivalent to a discharge of the liability within the words of sub-paragraph 12.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1942-06-04a.879.0" hansard_membership_id="7445" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/27643" speakername="Sir K. Wood" colnum="879" time="">
<p>This matter is a rather complicated one, as my hon. Friend pointed out. I would just say that I will bear in mind what he has said in any further consideration I give to this particular proposal. I would remind he Committee that sub-paragraph 12 of the Second Schedule which my hon. Friend desires to amend provides that an indemnity is not to be recoverable by a landlord, tenant or mortgagor, until the liability in respect of which the right to an indemnity arises has been discharged.

Consequently the direct contributor must have paid the Inland Revenue before he can recover his indemnity. My hon. Friend proposes that this condition shall not apply where under an administrative arrangement the Inland Revenue has allowed collection of the contribution to be deferred until the direct contributor has received from the War Damage Commission payment in respect of expenditure which he has incurred in repairing war damage. The deferment extends to contributions on the damaged property and the direct contributor's other properties up to the amount of the claim on the Commission.<br/>
As we see it, the proposal before the Committee would operate in a way which probably my hon. Friend would not regard as satisfactory. Suppose that a person held long leases of 20 properties from 20 different landlords and the instalment due from him as a direct contribution on 1st July, 1942, in respect of all the properties amounts to &#x00A3;500 and that he will be entitled to recover from his landlords indemnities amounting in all to &#x00A3;200. If he has expended more than &#x00A3;500 in repairing war damage to one of the properties and has claimed that from the War Damage Commission, the Inland Revenue Department is prepared, if he so requests, to allow the collection of &#x00A3;500 for all the properties to be deferred until the Commission pays. But the effect of the Amendment would be that because a direct contributor's claim for making good the damage to a single property has not been met he would be allowed, before paying anything to the Inland Revenue, to recover his indemnities, both from the landlord of the damaged property and the 19 other landlords whose property has suffered no war damage. It would indeed be hard to satisfy those 19 that they should be excepted from the general rule by the fact that the lessee holds from another landlord a property which happens to have been damaged. That, as I understand, may be the effect of this Amendment. But perhaps my hon. Friend will allow me to consider what he has said, and I will confer with him if necessary.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 20, line 5, at the end, to insert:
<q>3. Conditions to secure application of early payments for replacement of essential goods.
<ol>
<li>(1) Where the whole or any part of a payment in respect of the destruction of or damage to any goods is made on an earlier date than would be allowable under Sub-section (1) of Section sixty-one, and is so made by virtue of the Board of Trade being satisfied that the replacement or repair of the goods is expedient in the public interest, the Board may impose conditions requiring that the sum paid shall be applied in or towards the replacement or repair of the goods, or shall be so applied within such time as the Board may specify, and if any such condition is not complied with the sum paid shall be recoverable as money had and received to the use of His Majesty.</li>
<li>(2) Nothing in this paragraph shall be taken to prejudice the power of the Board of Trade under Sub-section (3) of Section sixty-one to impose conditions restricting the manner of application of a payment."</li></ol></q>
This Amendment is designed to set right an oversight in the drafting of the original Act. The original Act lays down that the Board of Trade may impose conditions restricting the manner in which the sum paid for destroyed business goods may be applied in the replacement or repair of such goods destroyed or damaged. It was thought that that gave us complete power to specify how any money we paid out should be expended. In fact, we are advised that we have not any such power. We can say how the money shall be expended if it is expended, but we cannot say that it must be expended. Suppose that a man lost a capstan lathe, and we decided that it was in the public interest that that capstan lathe should be replaced, and we gave him &#x00A3;500 to replace it. We could say, "You will spend that &#x00A3;500 on replacing that lathe, and you will paint it blue." If he painted it green, we could get the lathe back. On the other hand, if he did not buy a lathe, but spent the money on having a few months in Blackpool, we could not get our money back at all; we should just be left looking rather foolish. This Amendment is to give us power to say how any money provided by us for a specific purpose shall be spent.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 20, line 20, at the end, to add:
<q>5. Payments for damage prior to scheme coming into force.</q>
<q>Notwithstanding anything in Section sixty-eight of the War Damage Act, 1941, and subsequent regulations made under the provisions of that Section, payments shall be made to a person who suffered war damage to goods or private chattels prior to the date of the scheme coming into force on such terms as would have applied had the scheme been in force on that date.</q>
My reason for moving this. Amendment, which I think will appeal to the sense of the Committee, is that, according to my reading and the reading of a good many friends of mine, when the original Act was before the House it was the intention that those people who were unfortunate enough to lose their private goods and chattels prior to the passing of the Act should come under the same conditions as to compensation and as to premiums as those who suffered damage after the passing of the Act. The general feeling was that we were all in this together, and that we should share alike. Section 68 of the War Damage Act stated that&#x2014;
<q>The Board of Trade, acting in accordance with the regulations made by the Treasury, may make payments to persons in respect of &#x2026; war damage occurring to goods which &#x2026; if the scheme in question had then been in force would have been uninsurable &#x2026;</q>
It might almost seem that those words would cover the Amendment I am now moving, but a position has arisen which is contrary to the speech made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 17th December, 1940, when he said:
<q>Out of evil good may come, and this Measure will not only enable us to do justice by securing that the burden shall be shared between those who suffer and those who are fortunate enough to escape damage to their property &#x2026; It is another principle of this Measure &#x2026; that all must stand together, so far as the rate of contributions is concerned."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 17th Dec, 1940; cols. 1125&#x2013;6, Vol. 367.]</q>
When the Board of Trade issued Notice 123, dated April, 1941, Section 1, headed "What the private chattels scheme is," said:
<q>If you are a householder, there is free compensation, without payment of a premium.</q>
A further explanatory leaflet was issued, known as P.C.S.5, in Section 15 of which occurs the phrase:


<q>The War Damage Act also provides for those cases in which the damage occurred before the scheme came into force. You will be treated as if you had a policy under the scheme, and will receive the same compensation as you would have received in that case. A sum will be deducted from your compensation to cover any premium which you would have paid if the scheme had been in force.</q>
No mention was made, when the assessments were done on the pre-Act damage to furniture, of any deduction of a-premium where the amounts were assessed by the valuer. That went on right through the year, until January this year, when a further assessment was sent out, showing how much the original assessment was, how much had been paid on account, and the balance to be paid in future, when the war had finished. It was not until the Spring of this year that the first mention was made in official documents of the deduction of a premium which would be paid to the people who suffered damage prior to the passing of the Act. I put down a Question to the President of the Board of Trade on 28th April, and he replied:
<q>My attention has been drawn to this case. For reasons of practical administration and for the advantage of many of the claimants, the very large number of claims outstanding, when the War Damage Act became law, have been assessed for compensation as if they were the subject of an insurance policy. No premium is levied where the loss is less than &#x00A3;100 or payment is made on hardship grounds. In other cases the premium is calculated on the actual loss only."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 28th April 1940; col. 777, Vol. 379.]</q>
That means that a married man, living with his wife, may have suffered &#x00A3;300 damage to furniture prior to the Act coming into force, and another man, living in the same circumstances, may have suffered damage to his furniture to the same amount in the following month. One man is charged a premium, or is notified that a premium will be deducted from the &#x00A3;300, while the other has no such premium charge made. I am sure that it is not the desire of the Treasury that this distinction should be made. I am not particularly wedded to this Amendment. I would rather learn that there was a sense of the justice of the thing. If there has been administrative difficulty, I hope there will be some statement from the Treasury that they will meet this case in a just, generous and open way, so that people who suffered before the passing of the Act

may be treated in-exactly the same way as those who have suffered after the passing of the Act.</p>

<p>I am glad that my hon. and gallant Friend was able to say that he did not attach great importance to the particular form of this Amendment. Although we cannot possibly accept the Amendment as dratted, for the reason which I will shortly explain, we can do something which will substantially meet the point that he has put so very clearly. If we were to accept this Amendment, it would mean, in these pre-Act claims, that we would have to investigate the amount of free cover to which each applicant was entitled. The Committee will remember that anyone is entitled to a certain amount of free cover for himself, a certain amount of extra free cover for his wife and a certain amount of extra free cover again for his children living with him at home. It would have been a very great administrative difficulty&#x2014;in all these matters we are dealing with hundreds of thousands of cases&#x2014;to have had to make such inquiries, and again there would have been the difficulty that a man might have exhausted his free cover but might not have realised the fact and probably would not have realised it. Were he unfortunate enough again to be bombed out of his house&#x2014;because there are many cases where people are bombed out two, three, and even more times&#x2014;he might well have expected that he would again be subject to a free cover and would have been extremely disappointed and aggrieved when subsequently he found that he was not covered at all for the second calamity. There are certain disadvantages in that, under free cover, the amount that one can get for any specific article destroyed, such as a motor car, piano or wireless set, is limited to &#x00A3;25, whereas under the policy as a whole it is &#x00A3;50 or 5 per cent. of the total amount insured, whichever is the larger, without any limit for a motor car.<br/>
In all the circumstances the Board of Trade decided that it would be best to deduct this small premium&#x2014;I know that my hon. and gallant Friend will agree with me that although it is an annoying premium, it is a very small one&#x2014;when the payment came to be made, but subject to two very material provisos. The first is that when an immediate payment is made on the ground of hardship no


premium deduction is made at all, and the second, which is equally important, is that no premium deduction is made when the claim is under &#x00A3;100. These two provisions together can make us reasonably sure that no payments have already been made from which premiums have been deducted. We are therefore able to meet my hon. and gallant Friend in this way. The Board have decided that under their existing powers they will in future waive the deduction of premium on the first &#x00A3;300 of pre-Act claims, which will substantially meet the case.</p>

<p>I will deal with that. Instructions will be issued that, in cases where the notice of deferred payment showing a deduction of premium has already been issued, such deductions are to be disregarded when the payment comes to be made after the war. If there are any cases in which the deduction has already been made from a cash payment, then we are prepared to refund, but we do not think that there are any such cases. I hope that my hon. and gallant Friend will feel that that provision substantially meets his case.</p>

<p>I would like to thank my hon. and gallant Friend for the way in which he is meeting my suggestion. I know that it must present great administrative difficulties, and it is, as he says, a very small amount to deduct from the point of view of the Treasury, but it is a considerable amount to some of the people who have suffered this damage, and it gave them a feeling that they were being penalised by their misfortunes. I am sure that his announcement will be received throughout the country with wide approbation among these unfortunate people. I beg to ask the leave of the Committee to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<q>5. Payments for damage to goods pertaining to places of worship.</q>

<li>(<i>a</i>) war damage has occurred to goods pertaining to a church, chapel or certified place of meeting for religious worship of any denomination, being goods in respect of which a policy has been issued under the business scheme; and</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) a representative body of that denomination, whether central or not, has made application to the Board of Trade, either as respects that policy or as respects any class of policies comprising that policy, that any payment thereunder in respect of the goods should, in lieu of being made to the person insured, be made to a body of persons specified in the application,</li>

<p>The Amendment relates to the operations of the war damage business scheme as operated by the Board of Trade. In present circumstances the operation of the scheme is a contractual arrangement with the particular person who arranges the insurance on the part of the particular denomination or church or chapel. The Bishop of London's Committee, which embraces representatives of all the religious bodies of the country, has decided that this Amendment is necesary in view of the eventualities of our time. For example, evacuation has taken place in many districts, air raids have destroyed churches and chapels, and trustees are concerned about their insurances against war damage. This Amendment aims at releasing the Board of Trade from the obligation of dealing with the particular person who carries through the insurance policy and ensures payment to the representatives of the church or chapel affected by the insurance itself. I need not elaborate the matter, but, in the circumstances in which we live, people are often out of touch, and some of the persons possibly who have effected an insurance may be non-existent or untraceable. An insurance can be effected by a particular person on behalf of a particular church or chapel. In the Roman Catholic Church we have a diocesan committee whose responsibility is the maintenance and continuity of church or chapel arrangements. That body would be the proper one to receive the compensation if it was paid under the provisions of the principal Act operated by the Business. Committee of the Board of Trade. I understand that the Board of Trade is friendly to this Amendment being introduced into the existing legislation, and I


have received a friendly smile from no less a person than my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>I think there is nothing I need add to the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Moseley (Sir P. Hannon) except to endorse what he said about this being an Amendment which is proof of the collaboration of all the main Christian bodies in this country. It is a very happy collaboration in considering the problems of physical reorganisation after the war, and this is an exceedingly useful product of that body. I had a letter to-day from the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Luton (Mr. Burgin) asking me to add his name on behalf of the Methodist Church, so it will be seen that the main Christian bodies are united in this request. The purpose of the Amendment has been clearly explained by the Mover, and I think it will be for the convenience not only of the Churches but, I hope, of the Board of Trade as well. The principle of a negotiation between a central body of State and a central body of the Churches is accepted in the first part of the War Damage Act, and I think that principle will be conveniently applied to the insurances under the business section of the same Act.</p>

<p>An Amendment on these lines was first brought forward in another place by the Bishop of London when the original Bill was under consideration.

<p>and promised that on the first suitable subsequent date, if the matter was raised again, it would be most sympathetically considered. This, of course, is the first such occasion and, as the hon. Members who have moved and supported it have pointed out, it has been agreed by all the main bodies of the Churches in the country. There are adequate safeguards, we think, for the rights of the insurers. After all, it is up to the Board of Trade to see that those rights are properly safeguarded. If the parochial council of any particular Church have taken out an insurance policy and some other body; of that denomination thinks the payment should be made to the diocese or to themselves rather than to the insurers, the first thing the Board of Trade have to do is to consult with the insured.</p>

<p>I must apologise to the House for taking up its time with what may be considered a matter of very small importance, but this is a matter of considerable importance to the part of Scotland which lies within my constituency, namely, the three islands to which this Order refers. Agricultural conditions in these islands have been steadily declining for a number of years, and I would like to say to the Government that the farmers there are deeply appreciative of this scheme having been extended to them as a result of representations which have been made. It is true that there has been a certain dilatoriness in the

scheme being brought into effect for these three islands, and I frankly admit that it is not only the authorities which are to blame for the delay. There was, among a very conservative set of farmers, definite opposition to bringing these three areas under the control of the Milk Marketing Board However, good sense has prevailed, and the scheme is now to include these three islands.<br/>
I would like to refer to the Island of Coll, which is five or six hours' steaming away from the mainland and has a population of about 200 people. Not so long ago the number was about 1,000. The cheese-making industry on this island was fast disappearing. The inclusion of Coll in this scheme will be the beginning of a new lease of life for the farmers and inhabitants of this island. I am given to understand that this is only a war-time Measure, and while many of us know wartime Measures of control are not always welcome or acceptable, I can assure the Government, on behalf of the farmers, that this one is most decidedly welcome. We hope it will not only be a war-time Measure but a peace-time Measure, when that happy time comes again. The war may be over in two or three years' time and it is very difficult for farmers when they are more or less at the mercy of uncertainty, particularly in such an industry and in


such remote areas, if they do not know whether this is to be a permanent scheme or not. On behalf of my constituents, I hope that the scheme will be carried on after the war. I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland and many others in Scotland are firmly convinced that co-operative marketing is one of the principal conditions that will bring better times to our agricultural industry. We look upon this scheme as a small beginning. I know that in some parts of my constituency, inclusion in the Milk Marketing Board's scheme has brought a tremendous revival in agriculture. We look forward to these three islands also having a new lease of life as a result of the scheme. Other islands in my constituency and outside it on the West Coast of Scotland, and also certain

parts of the mainland, have rejected up to now all efforts to include them in the scheme, but I feel certain that when they see the beneficial results that come from inclusion, they also will be only too anxious to be included in the scheme. On behalf of the agricultural community of the islands, I heartily welcome the scheme.</p>
