	<p pid="a.853.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-15">15 December 2004</phrase>, I informed the House that I had commissioned a review into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of four young soldiers at Princess Royal barracks, Deepcut, during the period 1995 to 2002. As I told the House then, I was aware that its scope and nature may not satisfy all those, including hon. Members, who have been calling for a formal public inquiry into combat deaths in the armed forces, especially the four deaths at Deepcut. I said that by concentrating on the circumstances of the four deaths, the review would focus on the issue at the heart of current public concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/2">The review has been undertaken by the distinguished human rights lawyer, Mr. Nicholas Blake, QC, and is now complete. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. This morning, the families had the benefit of a briefing by Mr. Blake on his conclusions. I know that this will be another difficult day for them; the passage of time, in such sad circumstances, does little to lessen the pain. I hope that they will find at least that Mr. Blake has addressed carefully and sensitively the questions that have troubled them. I acknowledge the dignity with which they have conducted themselves over this long period.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/3">I am grateful to Mr. Blake for the thorough and professional way in which he has approached his task. In conducting his review, he has had the full co-operation of the Ministry of Defence. He has had full and unrestricted access to our records, and all serving and retired soldiers were encouraged to help the review in any way they could. I am satisfied that the report, which runs to 416 pages, plus annexes, represents an independent, objective and comprehensive analysis of all matters that have a bearing on the four deaths, and that Mr Blake has not been constrained by his terms of reference. Importantly, he has been able to tackle the wider issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/4">There were three issues about which much comment had been made on events at Deepcut: the alleged suspicious circumstances of the deaths, a claimed culture of bullying and the need for a formal public inquiry. I am pleased to note that Mr. Blake makes substantial findings on all three points. First, he has concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, the deaths of Sean Benton, Cheryl James and Geoff Gray at Deepcut were self-inflicted. Given the recent coroner's inquest into the death of James Collinson, he understandably refrains from reaching any conclusion on that particular death. However, he comments that the opportunity for self-infliction was afforded by the policy of frequently assigning trainees at Deepcut to guard duty, unsupervised by experienced soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/5">The review found a number of factors that may have contributed to the trainees' unhappiness and may have made them more susceptible to self-harm. The review considers that,</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/6" class="indent">&quot;although the Army did not cause any of the deaths&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/7">there were institutional failures to identify potential sources of risk and subsequently to address them. On the question of bullying, Mr. Blake states that there is no evidence that any of the trainees were bullied to death. However, he accepts that some trainees at Deepcut&mdash;probably only a small minority&mdash;experienced harassment, discrimination and oppressive behaviour. Those who did not complain appear to have had little confidence that the system could or would address their grievances. These are important criticisms, which will be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/8">Finally, on the question of a public inquiry, as I indicated in my response to the earlier House of Commons Defence Committee on this matter, I did not consider that a formal public inquiry was required. The Defence Committee was of a similar view. In a carefully reasoned examination of the arguments for such an approach, Mr. Blake has concluded that a public inquiry into the immediate or broader circumstances surrounding these deaths is not necessary. I reaffirm my earlier position and concur with his conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/9">This review, taken alongside the other inquiries and inquests into the deaths at Deepcut, has set out with great clarity the circumstances of the four deaths and the context in which they occurred. We now need to move on and take forward the changes that are required. We accept Mr. Blake's conclusions and welcome the opportunity to address his recommendations. We accept that there have been shortcomings, and we will do all that we can to address them.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/10">Although the purpose of the review was not to attribute blame, Mr. Blake has described a disturbing catalogue of allegations of misconduct at the relevant times. The Army authorities will carefully examine the report to see whether there is any indication of professional misconduct or negligence that might make administrative action appropriate. In addition, any matters that suggest that a disciplinary offence may have been committed will be referred to the Royal Military Police for further investigation. We will also have to take into account the overall training environment in which our personnel were working and the constraints faced by those in the command chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/11">Mr. Blake understands the importance, particularly for the Army, of recruiting under-18s, but he has highlighted weaknesses with regard to their appropriate care. We are alive to that issue and we are improving the standard of care and support afforded to young recruits. For example, trainees' surveys have been established and a note of guidance for all commanding officers covering all aspects of working with under-18s has been produced. Furthermore, Mr. Blake particularly commends the specialist training regimes for 16-year-olds established at the Army Training Regiment, Bassingbourn, and the Army foundation college, Harrogate. However, there is clearly still more to do, especially in extending best practices such as those at these establishments, and we are committed to implementing such changes as far and as quickly as we can.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/12">The quality of our armed forces and the professional way in which they were, and are, meeting their operational commitments is evidence of the quality of military training, and I pay tribute to that without hesitation. The report describes the British Army as a unique and extraordinary institution. For the past decade or more, it has been sent on a wide variety of operational deployments in many parts of the world, involving great personal danger and regular personal sacrifice.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/13">The report notes that many of the young people who are, or were, accepted as recruits into the Army have had very challenging lives as children. A high proportion were from single-parent homes, some had left school with no qualifications, and many had deficits in basic skills. The report comments that it is a remarkable challenge to turn these young people into effective soldiers forming part of a disciplined and interdependent team. It is worth noting that Deepcut alone sent approximately 10,000 trainees into the field Army during the period covered by the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/14">However, the number of young people, particularly those under 18, that the services employ places particular responsibilities on us to recognise their potential vulnerability. We are committed to improving the way in which all our recruits are trained, developed and looked after. In view of that, and in light of the recommendations made in previous recent reports by the Defence Committee and the adult learning inspectorate, work has already been done, and continues to be done, to make changes for the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/15">As in society as a whole, bullying, harassment and other inappropriate behaviour can never be totally eliminated in the armed forces. However, it is essential that we establish an environment in which bullying is wholly unacceptable. At every stage of their training and careers, it is made very clear to personnel that bullying and harassment, in any form, is not tolerated, and that it is part of their duty, and a function of leadership, to eliminate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/16">It is a sad and unfortunate fact&mdash;again, just as in wider society&mdash;that the armed forces will never be able to eradicate the tragic incidence of suicide or self-harm. However, the risks can be reduced to a minimum by careful management, pragmatic policies and better understanding, knowledge and education. As the Blake review makes clear:</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Every Officer, NCO, civilian instructor and trainee should be alert to any sign of abuse and be required to report it through the chain of Command, so prompt and effective action can be taken&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/18">The Armed Forces Bill, currently being scrutinised by a Select Committee of this House, contains proposals to streamline the complaints redress system, including provision for an independent element. Also, the Bill will consider aspects of the procedures applying to boards of inquiry. The review makes recommendations in those two important areas. We will give full consideration to those recommendations, and the Bill gives us the opportunity to implement any changes deemed appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/19">The report has identified areas in the training environment, especially between 1995 and 2002, that required improvement. It cites examples of inappropriate behaviour that should not have taken place. It also identifies areas where we can, and should, improve the way in which we manage the young people for whom we are responsible, and we accept those observations. We now need to look at every one of Mr. Blake's 34 detailed recommendations to see how they should best be taken forward to address the weaknesses identified as quickly and as effectively as possible. I also urge right hon. and hon. Members to take time to analyse Mr. Blake's report in full prior to forming their own opinions.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/20">Mr. Blake has given us a detailed and painstaking report of considerable substance. I am confident that it will provide further impetus for improvement. I can assure the House of my determination to deal with the issues that he has raised, and I undertake to provide a detailed formal written response to the House on all the recommendations. I am determined to ensure that everything possible is done to prevent similar tragedies occurring in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/21">I have enormous confidence in the dedicated men and women working as instructors in our training organisation. I want to make sure that they have the support, the resources and the facilities that they need to pursue excellence. The trained young men and women they produce lie at the very core of how we deliver on the defence interests of this country. Their efforts have to be matched by commitment from the very top of the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.1/22">Mr. Blake concluded his report with his profound condolences to each of the families concerned. On behalf of the Ministry of Defence, I again add my condolences.</p>

	<p pid="a.875.6/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That this House disagrees with the Lords in their amendments 22J and 22K.</p>
	<p pid="a.875.6/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">This is the fourth time that amendments to remove the automatic linkage between designated documents and identity cards have come back to us from the other place and I very much hope that it will be the last time. The amendments were tabled by Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, who sits on the Cross Benches. I have high regard for Lord Armstrong, his commitment to the constitution of this country and his knowledge of history relating to it. I know that he was trying to help to reach a constructive conclusion by tabling the amendments. However, as I have said before, the moment has passed for discussing the principle of linking designated documents and ID cards, and it simply would not be possible for the Government to accept a complete opt-out for people who apply for documents designated under the Bill from the requirement to be entered on the national identity register and issued with an identity card.</p>
	<p pid="a.875.6/3">I understand the reasoning behind Lord Armstrong's amendments. As I have said before, I am grateful to him for trying to help to resolve the impasse that exists. However, while in theory an opt-out might well make more sense than an opt-in, the reality would be the same. We would still be introducing an unacceptably large degree of uncertainty into the plans for rolling out identity cards linked to passports.</p>
	<p pid="a.875.6/4">When the Bill returned to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">21 March</phrase>, the debate was essentially about the timing for implementing the requirement for people applying for a designated document, such as a passport, to register and obtain an identity card, rather than the principle of so doing. That was certainly the line taken by the Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" name="Nicholas Clegg">the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)</phrase>, although I have to say that he was more coherent than Lord Phillips of Sudbury in yesterday's debate in the other place when he made a mistake about a name. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> for reminding me of a particular factor behind that, so I will not read the relevant part of <i>Hansard,</i> although I refer hon. Members to column 655.</p>
	<p pid="a.875.6/5">The line taken by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam was very clear. He said that the amendments to be proposed by Lord Armstrong would</p>
	<p pid="a.875.6/6" class="indent">&quot;blow a hole in the Bill&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">21 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 192.]</p>
	<p pid="a.875.6/7">The position of the Liberal Democrats throughout has been to use any device, however constitutionally doubtful, to destroy the scheme decided by this elected Chamber. I have no intention of accepting any changes that would have the effect of blowing a hole in the Bill, or damaging the delivery of the identity cards scheme as a whole.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-29a.882.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" speakername="Nicholas Clegg" colnum="882"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/debtext/60329-13.htm#60329-13_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.882.2/1">Last week I suggested to the Home Secretary that, if he rejected the amendments that were before us then, he would, as turned out to be the case, be facing the amendments before us today, which are arguably just as problematic from his point of view, because they would, as he explained, allow a wholesale opt-out from the need to register for an ID card. It remains my view that he would have been well advised to settle for the amendments that were before us last week. Even so, I hope that, even at this late stage, the Home Secretary will put himself and us out of our misery and accept the amendments from Lord Armstrong of Ilminster.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/2">As the noble Lord said in the debate in the other place yesterday:</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/3" class="indent">&quot;My amendments would restore an element of voluntariness&mdash;of personal freedom&mdash;which is absent from the Government's proposals&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/4">but that voluntarism, or voluntariness, as he put it, was entirely in keeping with the Government's oft-quoted election manifesto, where there was a clear emphasis on voluntarism in the introduction of identity cards, an emphasis which the Government have been so quick and keen to forget. As the noble Lord rightly said:</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/5" class="indent">&quot;There are a good many people out there who genuinely thought that the Government were proposing a voluntary scheme, and they were prepared to go along with it on that understanding&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 680, c. 651.]</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/6">The Government have already conceded the principle&mdash;it was a welcome concession&mdash;that compulsion will occur only on the back of separate primary legislation, which makes it all the more inexplicable that they seek to reject amendments that would allow them to do precisely that and take a voluntarist approach in the early stages of the introduction of identity cards, to be replaced by legislation enforcing compulsion at a later stage. That is the Government's intention. That is what they have explained to us. The amendments do not disturb that plan at all; indeed, they are perfectly consistent with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/7">The other compelling reason why the Government would be well advised to support the amendments is that they would allow time to deal with the accumulating list of uncertainties about how the draconian ID database would work in practice. We still do not know how much it would cost, who would run it or how they would run it. We have heard conflicting messages about chip and pin features and biometric features, but we do not know what would be on the card.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/8">On Monday, we heard that yet another uncertainty had come to light. In a written answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>, the Under-Secretary of State for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" name="Andy Burnham">the Home Department, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase> explained that some British citizens would have two identity cards&mdash;one listing their nationality, which could be confiscated if the Government wished to prevent them from travelling, and another not listing their nationality, which they would retain while the other one was confiscated, to access domestic services.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/9">The written answer stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/10" class="indent">&quot;However, to ensure that anyone subject to restrictions for an extended period of time can demonstrate their identity for domestic purposes, they will be able to obtain an identity card which will be issued to the same standards as other cards but which will not be valid for travel. This will be achieved by not specifying the nationality of the card holder on the face of the card.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 758W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.882.2/11">We now know that we might have not one, but two identity cards, on top of all the other uncertainties that I have enumerated. This is a model of bad Government policy and bad legislation. It raises the question why the country is expected to accept the imposition of a scheme that we know is illiberal in principle and flawed and open-ended in practice. For that reason and many others, I hope that the House will support the amendments tabled by Lord Armstrong.</p>

	<p pid="a.887.2/1">I am sorry, but we must all heed Madam Deputy Speaker's words of warning and we need to make our points in the short time that is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.2/2">Lord Armstrong of Ilminster is moving towards that sort of voluntary scheme, and I could happily live with that. Even Lord Phillips said that his amendment</p>
	<p pid="a.887.2/3" class="indent">&quot;would have meant that the citizen had an option&mdash;effectively, for five years&mdash;on whether he or she wished to have an ID card.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 680, c. 645.]</p>
	<p pid="a.887.2/4">If he means by that that one would be on the ID register but could choose whether to have an ID card, he should support the solution that is beginning to emerge. It is the ID register that is important, not the actual possession of a card.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.2/5">When my passport runs out and I have to renew it, I cannot see that it will make much difference if an ID card is thrown in as well. I shall be happy because it provides an additional form of identity. The point was made in the last debate&mdash;it is central to the issue of voluntary and compulsory&mdash;that the information one gives to the Passport and Records Agency to renew one's passport is exactly the same as that required to go on the ID register. It consists of name, address, date and place of birth and nationality or immigration status&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.888.4/1">I am sorry, but this is a one-hour debate. I consider myself lucky to have caught your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I want to make my points.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.4/2">The argument put by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary that the passport is not really compulsory has been widely mocked by people on the other side of the argument, but they must address the argument that if passports are compulsory they are surely just as objectionable as ID cards. The ID card is no more than a passport to public services. It is a different form of passport, to be used in a different context. When someone wishes to obtain a benefit or open a bank account, they will not need to take their passport, which is a bulky document, because they will be able to use their ID card. It will work exactly the same as a passport does when crossing international borders. It will be a domestic passport and I do not understand why people object to one, but not the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.4/3">At the heart of this debate lies deep confusion about the words voluntary and compulsory. If people are prepared to go along with Lord Armstrong's approach and accept that the important aspect is not the card but the register, we can all find common ground on which to agree.</p>

	<p pid="a.911.1/1">My hon. Friend makes one of the many good points that are made by those who suffer under the current system: the quality of decision making seems to be hugely variable, depending on from which entry post the applications are originally made. That is shown in the statistics as well. Some of them have much higher rates of successful appeals than others. One can only assume that that reflects a variable quality of initial decision making. It is impossible to imagine that it reflects anything else.</p>
	<p pid="a.911.1/2">The Government's point is that the new system is better because it will be much more objective and transparent. Good&mdash;let us hope that that happens. However, as the Minister himself said in Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.911.1/3" class="indent">&quot;100 per cent. objectivity is a fool's errand . . . It is not about simply ticking boxes and adding points up, although that is a large part of the measure.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-20">20 October 2005</phrase>; c. 116.]</p>
	<p pid="a.911.1/4">He is absolutely right about that. The system will not be 100 per cent. objective. Subjectivity will still come in, so if the new system is to inspire more confidence and perform better than the existing system, it is essential that everyone can be confident that the people making the decisions, which will still be subjective in part, are up to the job. That is one of the key reasons why it is vital that we review the system after a few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.911.1/5">The other key point was made at length by the outgoing independent monitor, Fiona Lindsley, who has been extensively quoted in the debates on the issue. Talking about the system and referring to the fact that 37 per cent. of appellants were successful in paper-based appeals, she said, &quot;That is pretty damning.&quot; The Minister is famously contemptuous of everyone who disagrees with him, but I hope that he will take an independent monitor seriously, especially as she pointed out that the National Audit Office broadly agreed with her assessment of the system. If she thinks that the system is inadequate and the National Audit Office thinks that it is inadequate, it is not unreasonable for other people to think the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.911.1/6">One could have many serious reservations about what the Government are doing, and I congratulate their lordships on producing a way in which the House, the other place&mdash;and, indeed, anyone involved in the system&mdash;can come back in a few years to find out whether the Minister's optimism was justified. I hope that it will be justified, but I fear that it will not.</p>

	<p pid="a.913.4/1">These amendments are all, in the main, fairly minor and technical. Some go to points made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee; here, rather than elsewhere, we move from negative to affirmative procedure with some of the order-making powers, especially in amendments Nos. 12 and 13. Some dwell on&mdash;legalistic purists might demure at this&mdash;the issue of effluxion of time, which might be better put into English in the Bill, so it duly is, in amendment No. 15. Many of the other provisions simply repeat these technicalities or go to some of the consequences that should be reflected from the Equality Bill. I know that people always bristle and become deeply suspicious when a Minister contends that a series of amendments is minor and technical. They scurry off and read them in great detail, because they having the feeling that the Minister is trying to hide something. I can assure the House that in this instance all the amendments before us, which were agreed to by the other place, are entirely acceptable to the Government. In that spirit, I ask the House to accept the amendments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-29a.917.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="917"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/debtext/60329-23.htm#60329-23_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.917.0/1">There has been a misunderstanding about Lords amendment No. 18 and section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. To make it clear what we are talking about, I remind hon. Members that section 4 of the 1999 Act applies to people who have had their asylum claims refused, who have lost their appeals, who have reached the end of the process and who have agreed that they will leave the UK when it is possible for them to do so, which is a condition of receiving support under section 4. In some cases, people have signed up to say that they will leave the UK when it is possible for them to do so, not because they really want to leave, but because that is the only way in which they can get any support. Nevertheless, the vast majority of people covered by section 4 are receiving support because the Home Office accepts that it is not possible to return them to their countries of origin at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/2">Last year, the number of people covered by section 4 rose to 7,000. Many of them were failed asylum seekers from northern Iraq, but there were also significant numbers of people who were originally from Zimbabwe and whom it was impossible to remove for obvious reasons&mdash;other countries that were heavily represented include Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. Although the Home Office would say that people covered by section 4 are about to leave the United Kingdom, the reality is that people are and will be on section 4 for significant periods of time, so the provision is not necessarily just for a week or two.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/3">The Lords amendment and my amendment to it address the issue of vouchers. Some of the discussion has not been clear, and some people outside this House have not realised that people who are covered by section 4 now are getting support in vouchers. Section 4 allows for accommodation and food, and if people are getting food that is not provided in their living accommodation, then they are getting it through vouchers. The Home Office accepts that that system has not been working satisfactorily&mdash;we debated that point in Committee&mdash;because it does not cover people's other essential needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/4">I have seen people who were on section 4 and who could not get on the bus to see their solicitor, because they did not have any money or a voucher to allow them to travel on the bus. Other people have been issued with vouchers that can be used only at a particular supermarket that is two or three miles away from where they live, and they have no way to get there other than walking. The Lords amendment seeks to address some of those points, and there is no doubt that it would improve the current situation, because it provides vouchers that can be exchanged for goods and services as well as for accommodation and food. Will the Minister clarify whether, for example, bus passes will be included among those goods and services to allow people to travel?</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/5">We know that there are fundamental problems with voucher systems from our experience when all asylum seekers were expected to use vouchers. Expense is one such issue, because it is more expensive to distribute vouchers than money. Furthermore, vouchers ended up being sold for cash under the old system, and they often cannot be used in the most convenient places and cannot necessarily be used in the cheapest places. If I were looking to buy cheap food in the area of London that I represent, I would not go to the supermarket. I would go to Walthamstow market, especially towards the end of the day when the traders are trying to get rid of stuff cheap before the market closes. That would be much cheaper than going to the supermarket, but people who live on vouchers do not have that option.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/6">The fundamental objection to vouchers is simple. The people involved may be failed asylum seekers, who are being supported until such time as they are expected to leave the country, but they are still human beings. We should therefore think about the simple issue of human dignity. Having to survive on vouchers is stigmatising and humiliating. I suppose that none of us has ever had that experience, but we should try to imagine what it would be like to try to exist for even a day or two without any cash&mdash;without a penny to buy a drink or newspaper. It must be humiliating to live like that for weeks and months on end.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/7">I welcome the fact that the Government have responded positively to some of the problems that were identified in section 4 when it meant that people could get only accommodation and food. Amendment No. 18 includes the power for the Secretary of State to make regulations to allow vouchers to be exchanged for goods and services, and I hope that that will include travel. The amendment specifically forbids a regulation to be made that allows people to be supplied with money. The effect of amendment (a) would be to remove the word &quot;not&quot; in that provision. It is a modest amendment. I would prefer it if vouchers were removed entirely, but my amendment would not force the Government to give out cash, but allow them the option to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/8">I do not understand why the Government will resist my amendment. What will happen if amendment No. 18 is not amended and it then turns out that it is not possible to meet all people's needs through vouchers? The National Asylum Support Service says&mdash;as it did about section 4&mdash;that it will not work. If the Government wished to make a change to the system because it was not working, they would need more primary legislation. However, if the Government accept amendment (a) they would have the option. It would provide the flexibility to make changes through secondary legislation without having to resort to more primary legislation. The amendment would not do away with vouchers or force the Government to give out cash.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/9">In a later amendment, the Government have accepted a similar argument in relation to section 9 of the 2004 Act. That amendment will give the power to introduce secondary legislation to repeal section 9. That is obviously intended to be used if it becomes apparent that section 9 is not working. I would therefore argue that my amendment's impact on section 4 would be exactly the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/10">When we discussed this in Committee, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I do not know if we can address the matter in the Bill, as it is more about practicalities than any point of statutory substance or import, but I am happy to consider it further.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-26">26 October 2005</phrase>; c. 234.]</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/12">I would suggest that my amendment is very practical and straightforward, and I do not understand why it should be resisted. It would not remove from the Government the option of doing what they intend, but would make it possible to move away from vouchers, which is what some of us would ideally like.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.0/13">An early-day motion on this issue has been signed by 55 hon. Members, including 27 Labour Members. I suspect that there is no chance of the parliamentary arithmetic being with us on this amendment. However, I hope that the Government will give my proposal serious consideration, because it offers a way of dealing with some of the criticisms of section 4 and of the Lords amendment, but leaves them with the flexibility to change in future if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.919.5/1">I am grateful, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I wish to speak principally to amendment (b), which stands in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase>, but I also wish to comment on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the arguments of the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/2">As our amendment is careful modelled on amendment No. 6, which has been agreed between the two Front Benches in another place, I have high hopes that the Minister will accept it. He will agree that the argument over vouchers is a delicate one. I have been following his correspondence in various newspapers with those who are flatly against his scheme and his argument that it will not make much difference and will not be a voucher scheme. He has clearly failed to convince the hon. Member for Walthamstow, among others. I am sure that the House will be waiting to hear how he deals with that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/3">Although I do not agree with all the arguments of the hon. Member for Walthamstow, he raises valid points, particularly as regards people from Zimbabwe, who are in a very difficult situation. The Government, rightly, do not wish to return them to Zimbabwe even if they have failed in their application for asylum. That gives rise to practical problems as to how they are to continue living in a decent and civilised way in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/4">One of the questions that the Government have not answered adequately concerns the cost of such a voucher scheme. They have tried voucher schemes before and scrapped them before. A previous Home Secretary conceded that the voucher scheme that operated previously was unworkable and unfair. Having come to that conclusion once, it is incumbent on the Minister to explain why the current scheme is going to be workable and fair and, while he does so, what, in broad terms, he thinks that the costs will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/5">That question may be impossible to answer because the Government have no idea of how long many people will be forced to wait until they can be returned to their own country. As the hon. Member for Walthamstow pointed out, the phrase, &quot;about to leave&quot;, is a term of art that appears to cover not just days or weeks but in some cases months and years. Clearly, a system designed to cope with the needs of those who may be here for a few weeks will not serve those who might be here for years. The hon. Member for Walthamstow and the Refugee Council have made that point, which is central to the argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/6">Nevertheless, I should make it clear that Conservative Members have no objection in principle to vouchers, provided that the system is workable and fair. However, we recognise the possibility of inefficiency and waste, which may lead to hardship for some vulnerable people. We have tabled amendment (b) to Lords amendment No. 18 in the hope that it gives the Government a decent escape route, not least from the criticism that the Minister is receiving from Labour Members. I am sure that he sincerely believes that the voucher system will not cause the unfairness and hardship that some Labour Members claim, so the Government should, at the very least, enable Parliament to receive a full report on its working in three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/7">If the Minister will listen, I am about to praise him. A few moments ago, he made a sensible comment about parliamentary scrutiny and using the Bill to enhance Parliament's ability to revisit legislation that it has passed. He was right to say that the lack of that ability is a common failing of our legislation. That is why amendment (b) tries to give hon. Members the opportunity to debate whether the new system causes genuine hardship and to have the Government justify their actions if they need justification. The terms of the amendment allow that to happen earlier if there is an immediate crisis or if the Government want a convenient vehicle to enable them to change the policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/8">Even if the scheme proves perfectly practical and the Government want to continue with it, the requirement to report back on its day-to-day workings will act as a spur to Ministers to check what is happening. The Minister knows that many bodies that object to that sort of scheme concentrate precisely on which shops can take the vouchers and the range of goods to which they apply. The nitty-gritty, day-to-day details will make the difference in some cases between fairness and unfairness and hardship and lack of hardship.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/9">I agree with the Minister that reporting back on the scheme is important. I hope, therefore, that he will accept the amendment in the constructive spirit in which it is offered. The long-term solution is not to have a system that keeps thousands of people in limbo for years. Since that happy prospect is many years away, I commend amendment (b) to the House, as a modest improvement to managing the current failing system, and I hope that it will satisfy hon. Members from all sides of the debate.</p>

I, too, in common with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, hope that the hon. Member for Walthamstow will press his amendment to a Division, and if he or others do, I am strongly minded to support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.922.0/2">Let us be clear. As the Minister who is engaged in the public debate well knows and has already acknowledged, vouchers are not new. They are not only not new in the sense that they have applied to a certain category, section 4 recipients&mdash;failed asylum seekers&mdash;since April 2005&mdash;they are not new in another sense, in that, as he will acknowledge, they have applied before. I believe and, in fairness, the Minister believes&mdash;I raise these issues in a positive spirit&mdash;that the Government were right to remove vouchers across the piece in 2002. It is relevant to the public debate to recall what was said at that time, by the then Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>. Announcing the intention to remove vouchers for asylum seekers more generally, he said that those vouchers were</p>
	<p pid="a.922.0/3" class="indent">&quot;too slow, vulnerable to fraud, and felt to be unfair&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-29">29 October 2001</phrase>; Vol. 373, c. 627.]</p>
	<p pid="a.922.0/4">He was right.</p>
	<p pid="a.922.0/5">Yes, the debate has moved on since then, and the Government have decided, for reasons that I think are scarcely intelligible let alone defensible, that voucher provisions should apply to a very limited category of persons&mdash;the section 4 cases, people whose applications for asylum have failed and who are destined eventually to go back to the countries from which they have come. They are not going back at this stage, because there is an impediment to them doing so&mdash;it would not be safe for them to travel. That might be because the country to which they would have to return is unsafe and they would be at risk of imprisonment, torture, death or a grisly combination of all three, or it might be that they cannot travel for the more prosaic but equally important reason that they are unwell or, in the case of a woman, pregnant.</p>
	<p pid="a.922.0/6">In those circumstances, it is true that for virtually a year now those people have received voucher support to the tune of &pound;35 a week. We all know the cases of people who have been affected. My anxiety about what the Government are doing is that it seems to me that Ministers are unnecessarily closing down the options. I am always ready to joust with the Minister of State, as he knows, and to listen to the points that he makes, but I have not yet heard a persuasive argument. I found the case made by the hon. Member for Walthamstow and the Refugee Council compelling.</p>

	<p pid="a.938.4/1">During Lords Committee, we were asked to consider whether any guidance that is published by the Secretary of State should be published &quot;contemporaneously&quot; with the issuing of it. We could not accept that wording, but could not argue with the principle. We believe that there should be a degree of consistency in the Bill and once we decided that it was right to publish such decisions as soon as practicable, we thought it sensible to apply it to any decisions made by the Secretary of State under this Bill. Therefore, this group of Government amendments adds various requirements that the Secretary of State should publish directions, guidance and lists that she may issue under this Bill as soon as reasonably practical after their issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.4/2">Amendment No. 38 to paragraph 16(1) of schedule 1 and the identical amendment No. 39 to paragraph 16(1) of schedule 2 are purely grammatical. They have no effect on the Bill's text other than to improve the grammar, and I am sure that all hon. Members will approve of that. Amendments Nos. 56 to 63 are minor amendments to schedule 11 and address two technical issues. The first three amendments of that group are small clarifications to three paragraphs in schedule 11 of minor and consequential amendments. They will ensure that there is consistency of application within the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, clarifying whether particular provisions apply to the 12-mile territorial waters around England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.4/3">The remaining five amendments contain small consequential amendments in the schedule 11 paragraphs that make minor amendments to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 in relation to the protection of limestone pavements. The National Assembly for Wales has relatively recently confirmed that it wishes to benefit from the existing alteration to subsection (1) of section 34 of the 1981 Act so that Wales will benefit equally from the enhanced protection for limestone pavements. The substituted subsection (1) will enable pavement to be more easily protected both in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.4/4">Amendment No. 28 is designed to reflect the fact that the new Inland Waterways Advisory Council will be an advisory rather than an executive non-departmental public body and ensure that it can be appropriately supported. The amendment substitutes wording customarily used to authorise Ministers to support advisory NDPBs.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.4/5">I commend this group of amendments to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.4/6" class="italic">Lords amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.4/7" class="italic">Lords amendments Nos. 5 to 10 agreed to.</p>

	<p pid="a.942.4/1">The amendments do two important things. The first is a small facilitating measure that will benefit landowners and occupiers, especially by removing the implication that the power to denotify SSSI land should be available only if it was previously of special interest. In essence, and without detracting from the main purpose of the provision, it provides for a simple remedy for any landowner or occupier who discovers that a part of his land has been mistakenly included in the boundary of a SSSI, for example, because of a cartographical discrepancy between paper and digitised maps.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.4/2">The second amendment benefits the public interest. By the strong will of Parliament, shown in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the conservation bodies have been required to serve SSSI notifications on every owner or occupier of the land in question. Despite their best efforts, that can be a tall order, given the paucity of comprehensive sources of land tenure information. The amendment introduces a saving to ensure that, provided that all reasonable steps have been taken to discharge the notification duty, SSSIs, present or future, will not be rendered invalid by reason of it later being discovered that some relevant party's interests were not identified when the notification was served.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.4/3">Importantly, the provision protects any such missed party from any liability for things that happened before commencement, and they become fully liable as a notified owner or occupier only after they have come to light and the notification papers have been served on them by the relevant conservation body.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-29a.944.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1477" speakername="James Paice" colnum="944"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/debtext/60329-30.htm#60329-30_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.944.4/1">I presume that it is in order for me to address the whole group, as all the amendments in it relate to national parks.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/2">One of the reasons that I wanted to table an amendment, apart from on its own merits&mdash;to which I will return in a moment&mdash;was that most of this section is completely new to the House. The reason for that, as I am sure that the Minister would tell us, is that the Meyrick judgment handed down by the courts came after we dealt with the Bill in the House. The Government took the decision that the Bill was a suitable vehicle to revert, as they intend, the law to what it was prior to the Meyrick judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/3">I understand that the noble Lord Bach told the other place on Monday night that the Government have been granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal in the Meyrick case. Lord Justice Keene was quoted at column 50 in House of Lords<i> Hansard</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/4" class="indent">&quot;The grounds are properly arguable and, in any event, raise issues of importance which ought to be considered by the Court of Appeal&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/5">We are considering these amendments in the absence of knowing the final outcome of the Meyrick judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/6">Nevertheless, I agree with the Government that the Meyrick judgment, as it stands at the moment, is anomalous. It goes way beyond what any of us has previously understood as being the criteria for national parks, and refers to this high degree of &quot;naturalness&quot;. The judge in the case, again quoted at column 50, said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/7" class="indent">&quot;well-maintained historic parkland providing the setting for a grade 1 listed building, and well-ordered dairy fields of dairy farms would seem to be the antithesis of naturalness&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 680, c. 50.]</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/8">Arguably he is right, but if we accept that as the criteria for national parks, there probably would not be any. We all know that the British landscape has been affected by mankind since time immemorial. Certainly, all the evidence suggests that since 12000 BC, when mesolithic man first invaded the wild woods and started cutting them down, the British landscape has been in a state of change and affected by mankind. To refer to naturalness seems a bit odd in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/9">Having said that I entirely agree that Meyrick goes too far, I also believe that the amendments go too far in the other direction. I accept that the Government's intention is simply to return the law to where it was before the Meyrick judgment&mdash;although if they won the appeal such action would not be necessary, because that would emphasise that the pre-Meyrick legislation stood, or that the interpretation of it stood. In many ways, I hope that the Government do win the appeal, but they tabled the amendments using the Bill as a vehicle, so it is therefore right for this House to have an opportunity to debate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/10">Lords amendment No. 17, which would insert a new clause on criteria for designating national parks, suggests measures that I believe would extend the criteria for designation beyond where they were before Meyrick. Indeed, I think they could almost be seen to be opening the whole of rural England to such designation, which goes too far in the opposite direction. I believe passionately in national parks, but they need to have specific attributes&mdash;to which I shall return&mdash;that identify them as being areas of particular importance. If we allow the criteria to be too lax and end up being able to designate much larger swathes of rural England in the coming years, the designation of national parks as a whole will be brought into disrepute, and will not be treated with the respect to which it is entitled. That would be a great sadness, which is why I tabled amendments (a) and (b).</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/11">Lords amendment No. 17 proposes that Natural England may,</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/12" class="indent">&quot;when applying subsection (2)(a) in relation to an area, take into account its wildlife and cultural heritage&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/13">I think that most of us would accept that it is sensible to include wildlife in a provision relating to national parks, for obvious reasons. It is the term &quot;cultural heritage&quot; that I find more difficult to understand. I am sure that the Minister, who has briefing papers, will point out that it was the last Conservative Government who first introduced the phrase to national parks legislation. He nods&mdash;he was going to throw that at me, so I am glad that I got in first. That is perfectly true, but anyone who reads Lord Bach's speeches and the briefing that we have all received from the Council for National Parks will observe that the terms &quot;cultural heritage&quot; and &quot;landscape&quot; appear to be interchangeable. It seems to me that the Government mean &quot;landscape&quot;, and I would therefore prefer that word to be used in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/14">We all understand what &quot;landscape&quot; means. It deals with the issue of naturalness, because we all know that the landscape of England is affected, has been affected and will be maintained by mankind. There can thus be no dispute about the interpretation of the word, whereas I believe that the phrase &quot;cultural heritage&quot; is open to much more question.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/15">New subsection 2A(b) provides that Natural England may</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/16" class="indent">&quot;take into account the extent to which it is possible to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of its special qualities by the public.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/17">Of course, we want the public to be able to enjoy the special qualities of a national park, but that ability has always been there. I do not understand why the Government want to open it up to that extent. The issue of enjoyment of those special qualities was clearly included in the criteria specified in the Countryside Act 1949. There have been various reports on national parks: the Addison, Dower and Hobhouse reports, and more recently the Sandford and Edwards reports. There seems to be a common theme in all that work, namely, the importance of special areas with an element of wildness, beautiful and suitable for public access at the time of designation.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/18">That is very important point and a constant theme, so we are forced to ask what it is that the Government are changing, given that such a provision already exists in legislation. It seems that, in using the phrase</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/19" class="indent">&quot;take into account the extent to which it is possible to promote opportunities&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/20">the Government are implying that in future the public enjoyment of such special qualities could be opened up considerably. That, in turn, raises the possibility of damaging the special qualities that caused an area's designation in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/21">Amendment No. 17 widens the criteria too far the other way, although I readily except that Meyrick needs to be redressed if the appeal is lost. Of course, if the Government win the appeal, this whole debate could become irrelevant. Indeed, the Minister may wish to tell the House this afternoon how he sees the legislation working. If we pass all this and the Government then win the Meyrick appeal, what impact will that have? In a sense, two different pieces of legislation would apply to national parks.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/22">Amendment No. 33 would insert a new clause defining:</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/23" class="indent">&quot;Natural beauty in the countryside.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/24">As I understand it&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;this, too, is part of the Government's desire to rebalance the Meyrick judgment, with which I wholly agree. Indeed, I do not disagree with any aspect of the new clause's definition of natural beauty. That is fine, but why, having included that new clause, is amendment No. 17 still necessary? I appreciate that I have spoken first and that the Minister has not had a chance to respond, but I hope that he will indeed explain why amendment No. 17 is necessary, given that amendment No. 33 defines natural beauty, and that such a definition is fundamental to the criteria for designating national parks.</p>
	<p pid="a.944.4/25">We do not oppose the idea of correcting Meyrick or of national parks, but if national parks are to retain the value and esteem that people attach to them, they should remain areas with special qualities. My concern is that the Government, in their desire to rebalance the legislation following Meyrick, have gone too far the other way. In future years, attempts could be made to designate areas that perhaps do not have the special quality that we attribute to existing national parks. I look forward to hearing the Minister explain why it is necessary for the Government to go as far as they are going with their amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.959.1/1">That is certainly my understanding. If the situation is any different, I will write to the hon. Gentleman and copy the letter to Opposition Front Benchers and place a copy in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/2">The transitional arrangements have been drafted in such a way as to ensure that only those definitive map modification order applications for BOATs made before <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-20">20 January 2005</phrase>, or <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-19">19 May 2005</phrase> in Wales, that are made correctly and in accordance with the statutory requirements, will be preserved by the transitional arrangements in clause 62(3).</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/3">Amendment No. 23 also amends the provisions that provide for private rights of access for property owners. That is necessary to ensure that there are no human rights issues created by commencement of the rights of way provisions shortly after Royal Assent without a period of statutory notice. Amendment No. 24 is a procedural amendment that refers to certain transitional provisions set out in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The provisions provide that, where a local authority has made a definitive map modification order under section 53 or 54 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 reclassifying a road used as a public path, or RUPP, as a footpath, bridleway or byway open to all traffic, that order must be processed to its conclusion. However, the amendment will ensure that those transitional arrangements are subject to part 6 of this Bill in the normal way, so that unless they fulfil the criteria for any of the exemptions set out in the Bill's transitional arrangements, any vehicular rights in such claims will be extinguished.</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/4">Amendment No. 25 addresses cyclists' concerns about whether a qualifying period of past, or future, cycle use may give rise to a restricted byway. The view of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is that a normal pedal-powered cycle is a non-mechanically propelled vehicle and therefore may give rise to restricted byway rights. This amendment introduces a clause that will make that clear on the face of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/5">Amendment No. 26 clarifies that a definitive map modification order or DMMO application is, of itself, capable of bringing a route into question for the purposes of section 31 of the 1980 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/6">Amendment No. 27 is in two parts. The first amends an existing provision, which provides that a restricted byway may be created through an application for a definitive map modification order. This amendment clarifies that a restricted byway can be created on the basis of both user and historic evidence. The second part will ensure that anyone driving on a restricted byway, which was a road used as a public path prior to reclassification, to access their property would not be committing a criminal offence under section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/7">Amendments (a) and (b), tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1477" name="James Paice">the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice)</phrase>, would amend Lords amendment No. 27. They concern subsection (7) of what is now clause 70. This subsection closes a possible loophole, which may have enabled those driving illegally over former RUPPs, to visit land that is designated for public access, to claim immunity from prosecution under section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Subsection (7) specifically excludes such people from the exemption from prosecution, so that it is only available to those accessing their own property over former RUPPs, and their lawful visitors. The amendments seek to further close the possible loophole, by extending the categories of land specified in subsection (7) to include</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/8" class="indent">&quot;any land which is treated as being accessible to the public&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/9">so that it would include any rights of way and town or village greens.</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/10">We considered similar amendments very carefully when they were tabled in the other place. We have concluded that the exemption from prosecution works properly without the amendments. We are satisfied that the Government amendment that has been incorporated into clause 70 closed any potential loophole and that no further amendments to the clause are necessary. Amendments (a) and (b) as drafted cannot be accepted because they would introduce uncertainties into the definition of visitor. For example, if they were accepted, they would not mention section 15(1) of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. We recognise that there is some concern that people using a right of way could be regarded as a &quot;visitor to the land&quot;. However, we do not share that concern. We have considered this issue very carefully and have concluded that those using a right of way could not be regarded as a visitor to one of the parts of land which the right of way may cross. The right of way may cross several fields in the ownership of several different landowners. The user of the right of way is not visiting those fields, he is using the right of way. I appreciate that this is a complex area of the law. We intend to issue guidance to the police, local authorities and others about the rights of way provisions in this Bill. That will include guidance to assist with the understanding and enforcement of this new legislation on rights of way. I hope that in light of that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendments and that the House will accept the Lords amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.965.4/1">Amendment No. 29 responds to a small but important point picked up by the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee in its helpful report. It noticed that, in clause 74, which deals with reserved functions, we had excluded from delegation various legislative or quasi-legislative functions but had not mentioned codes of practice. We agree that that should be done because codes of practice are often indistinguishable from guidance. We are happy, therefore, to make that small change.</p>
	<p pid="a.965.4/2">Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 have the sole purpose of improving the clarity of the wording of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.965.4/3">Amendment No. 42 adds to the list of designated bodies in schedule 7 the joint committees of local authorities that discharge functions in relation to areas of outstanding natural beauty.</p>
	<p pid="a.965.4/4">Amendments Nos. 43 to 55 relate to schedules 9 and 10. Those schedules list detailed provisions for part 8, chapter 2, which relates to agricultural levy bodies. The purpose is to put in place an explicit means of implementing the recommendations of the November 2005 Radcliffe report, which reviewed the position of the main agricultural and horticultural levy bodies. A public consultation on the report's findings was completed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-03">3 February</phrase> and we expect to announce our decisions on the future levy board structure around Easter. The amendments set up a structure that would allow us to proceed after that consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.965.4/5">I ask hon. Members to accept the Lords amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.965.4/6" class="italic">Lords amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.965.4/7" class="italic">Remaining Lords amendments agreed to.</p>

	<p pid="a.972.1/1">The Minister's answer on how irresponsible practices would be defined seems to contradict what he said on <phrase class="date" code="">14 July</phrase> last year. Then, he said, &quot;The amendment&quot;&mdash;a different amendment&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.980.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. Data sharing is crucial. His predecessor as Liberal Democrat spokesman had discussions about it with the Minister and me. The matter is proceeding, so perhaps cross-party consensus could be developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/2">Moving from that consensual tone, I turn to amendment No. 3, which would amend clause 29 by inserting an additional subsection at the end of line 6, page 24. I shall not read it out as I am sure that Members have studied it. The amendment makes explicit the power of the OFT to take account of irresponsible lending when monitoring and enforcing the fitness of licence holders. As originally drafted, the Bill required the OFT to have regard to the</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/3" class="indent">&quot;skills, knowledge and relevant experience&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/4">of any person applying for a licence in relation to consumer credit, consumer hire or ancillary credit services. It also required the OFT to bear in mind whether an applicant had</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/5" class="indent">&quot;committed any offence involving fraud, dishonesty or violence&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/6">contravened any relevant law relating to consumer credit, engaged in discriminatory practices or business practices that the OFT judged deceitful&mdash;a point to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase> referred earlier&mdash;oppressive, unfair or improper.</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/7">In Committee, several Members on both sides of the House supported amendments to include a requirement that creditors lend responsibly. The Government originally resisted those proposals. However, as the Minister told us, considerable concern has been expressed throughout the passage of the Bill about the fact that debt in itself is not the problem, but that irresponsible lending and, therefore, borrowing can be. Lending to someone who is already up to their neck in debt is neither sensible nor responsible. It is good neither for the customer nor, in the end, the lender. In previous debates, here and in the other place, the Government steadfastly refused our calls for a specific power on irresponsible lending in the Bill, on the grounds that it would be difficult to define irresponsible and that including such a specific duty would require guidance as to what did and did not constitute irresponsible lending.</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/8">The Minister in the other place, Lord Sainsbury, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/9" class="indent">&quot;A positive duty to lend responsibly may, considered in isolation, appear attractive. However, by imposing such a positive duty, the consequence is that the guidance will need to provide lenders with sufficient information to comply with that positive duty. That would involve the compilation of a list of rules of what is and is not responsible lending.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/10">He concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/11" class="indent">&quot;We want to encourage responsible lending. But we do not believe that the way to do this would be to include an unhelpful duty in the legislation or in guidance. We are convinced that it will lead to the development of a multiplicity of procedural rules, which we want to avoid.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">18 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 677, c. 742&ndash;43.]</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/12">We welcome the Government's willingness to recognise that that would not be the case in their U-turn on the matter. Does the Minister now believe that guidance on what constitutes irresponsible lending will not after all reflect on the concerns to which the Minister in the House of Lords referred and which were described as an inflexible tick-box approach? What particular aspects persuaded the hon. Gentleman of the change? He made some brief allusions in his opening remarks but he did not give us the full explanation. It would be helpful for us to understand the reasoning behind the decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/13">As the Minister is aware, the Opposition expressed continuing concern in the other place that amendments may still not cover the irresponsible granting of credit; for example, where customers are offered further credit facilities for the purchase of furniture, kitchens or other big-ticket items, despite already being able to borrow thousands of pounds on credit cards. The Government's view is that the amendment will cover that issue as well as irresponsible lending. We hope that will prove to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/14">The Minister is no doubt aware of the latest concerns expressed by industry representatives about the lack of definition. Members from various parties touched on that earlier. Only yesterday, I received representations from APACS&mdash;an organisation that will be at the heart of the Bill's implementation&mdash;that the lack of definition will give the OFT inappropriate power. Rosalind Sellers from APACS stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/15" class="indent">&quot;This amendment gives the OFT powers to refuse credit licences based on an undefined concept of 'irresponsible lending'. We strongly support the principle of making what has been implicit throughout discussion of the Bill&mdash;i.e. the need to curb irresponsible as well as unfair lending&mdash;explicit at this stage. However, we are concerned that, in practice, the lack of definition will enable the OFT to define its own powers and then enforce them without consultation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.980.3/16">In previous debates, one of the Minister's arguments for excluding the provision was that it would be difficult to reach a definition. It would not be surprising if the Minister said that part of the problem is as much of our making as his, given that we pressed for inclusion of the provision. However, as he has conceded to our request, it is his duty as a Minister of the Crown to ensure that the Bill is workable. That, in essence, is my concern. So will he tell us his plans for issuing guidance to the OFT and creditors on the definition of irresponsible lending?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-29a.990.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" colnum="990"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/debtext/60329-43.htm#60329-43_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.990.1/1">I would certainly like to put on the record my appreciation of the work of credit unions. However, they are not accessible to everyone in those circumstances. We need to promote a diverse and varied credit industry. I hope that the Minister and the Department will continue to work with the industry to do so once the Bill is enacted. However, I fear that the industry may withdraw its services from certain parts of society if the law is not certain or if it is over-prescriptive. A balance needs to be struck.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford referred to the briefing note circulated by APACS, which highlighted concerns about withdrawal from the market:</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/3" class="indent">&quot;In practice we are concerned that the OFT will set an unnecessarily wide definition and that this will in turn have an impact on whom lenders choose to lend to.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/4">Lenders should be more cognisant of the people to whom they are lending. That is the concept of responsible lending that Members on both sides of the House have sought to promote throughout the progress of the Bill. There should be greater responsibility, but not if that means that services are withdrawn wholesale from certain parts of the market. It is self-evident that the socially disadvantaged are in a difficult situation, so an extortionate credit bargain under the existing legislation could put them in a much worse position. People would not have access to direct or regulated credit, so they would fall prey to the unregulated sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/5">There has been reference to the involvement of the courts. In exercising its powers, the OFT must be certain about its remit and the provisions that it seeks to interpret. We have missed an opportunity by failing to spell out the concept of irresponsible lending in the Bill. In Committee, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/6" class="indent">&quot;If we are very specific about an issue we could undo what we are trying to achieve.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/7">I agree. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/8" class="indent">&quot;For many, responsible lending imposes a requirement that lenders do certain things before extending credit. However, the things that a lender may take into account in the case of one debtor may be very different to those of another. It will depend on a debtor's circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/9" class="indent">Any duty to lend responsibly would mean defining what is, and what is not, responsible lending.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>; c. 93.]</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/10">Several months down the line, we have included the concept of responsible lending in the Bill, but we have not included a definition. I therefore hope that the Minister can explain where we can find such a definition, given his comments on the issue in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/11">In summary, there is not certainty in the Bill about the meaning of responsible lending. I accept that a balance needs to be struck, but clause 29 deals explicitly with fraudulent, deceitful or oppressive practices. As a lawyer, I interpret things according to their context, and such practices suggest that a high standard would have to be breached before the responsible lending test were applied. Someone would therefore have to be guilty of an outrageous practice to breach that standard.</p>

	<p pid="a.999.5/1">No, I shall not</p>
	<p pid="a.999.5/2">Earlier today, the Commons re-affirmed its view, for the fifth time, that those who apply for a designated document should have their details entered on the national identity register and be issued with an identity card. As hon. Members know, that was fundamental to the Government's approach in implementing the ID cards scheme, from our first consultation exercise in 2002. That was followed by a policy announcement in 2003, the draft Bill that the Home Affairs Committee scrutinised in 2004, the Bill that was debated before the 2005 election and the Government's manifesto commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.5/3">We have now agreed, as a concession-seeking compromise, that anyone who applies for a British passport could say that they did not want an ID card to be issued. However, that applies only to applications made up to <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase>. As I have said during our debates, we have been constructive in seeking compromise on many points and I am grateful that Lord Armstrong, to whom hon. Members should give credit, has persevered in his honourable attempts to secure an agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.5/4">There are three critical points of difference between the amendment that he tabled in the other place, which was overwhelmingly agreed to, and his resolution, which we considered earlier. First, Lord Armstrong's amendment preserves the integrity of the national identity register. It ensures that the details of all applicants for designated documents will still be entered on it. That will mean that they will be afforded the protection that that will provide from identity theft. It will also provide the wider benefits to society by ensuring that attempts by people to establish multiple identities are more easily detected.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.5/5">Lord Armstrong's acceptance of the importance and integrity of the national identity register was an essential point of his amendment in the other place at this stage. It was not covered in previous amendments and it is the key point that has enabled us to accept it. I observed the debate in the other place and Lord Armstrong made it clear that that first point was essential.</p>

	<p pid="a.1000.1/1">To be candid, I find non-partisanship on the issue difficult. However, in its spirit, I pay genuine tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase>, who has campaigned for identity cards for many years since his election in 1997. It has not been an easy pitch on which to bat but he has done it exceptionally well and made his case powerfully. I am glad that, today, Parliament has paid tribute to his work. Earlier, he drew attention to the critical importance of the national identity register. Lord Armstrong's acknowledgement of that has enabled us to support the amendment from the other place. The integrity of the national identity register has been the central point that enables us to accept Lord Armstrong's amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.1/2">Secondly, the amendment removes from the scope of any opt-out, designated documents other than the passport. The new amendment removes any opt-out from the resident's permit, which specifies the right of third country nationals to reside in this country and the terms and conditions that they must honour. I noted from the earlier response of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> that he accepted the logic of that change</p>

	<p pid="a.1001.4/1">No, I will not give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.4/2">The third concession that Lord Armstrong has made is that, once the passport becomes a designated document, his amendment will provide for a time-limited opt-out for people applying for passports also to be issued with an ID card. I share Lord Armstrong's view, which he expressed again in the debate, that it will be a small number of people who choose to opt out. However, while those who opt out will not be able to prove their identity securely in a range of transactions with public and private sector organisations&mdash;that is the choice that they would make in opting out&mdash;they would also not be required to inform the authorities of changes in prescribed details such as their address. That obligation applies only to those to whom an ID card has been issued. If we agree to the amendments from the other place, as I hope we will, the opt-out will extend until <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1002.5/1">I will not give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.5/2">The date of <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase> adds a little bit of uncertainty to the Government's plans for implementing the scheme, but we believe that that uncertainty will be manageable. That is a judgment that we have made in discussions with Members of the other place on these matters. Lord Armstrong's proposal has the support of the Government as one which, in our opinion, strikes a sensible and acceptable compromise. It is important that that is the case, and I again pay tribute to his work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.5/3">In drawing the ping-pong of this Bill to a close, I would like to express my appreciation to the people who have worked so hard on this piece of legislation: first, to my ministerial colleagues, and even to the Opposition spokespeople&mdash;and, indeed, Back Benchers&mdash;of all parties in both Houses who have worked so hard in this process. I know that it has been a difficult Bill, but people have sought to address it in a constructive and positive way, even when we have disagreed&mdash;except the Lib Dems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.5/4">Secondly, I want to pay tribute to the staff of Parliament. They have dealt with what has been one of the longest ping-pongs with integrity and professionalism. On behalf of the whole House, I express appreciation for their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.5/5">Thirdly, I want to express appreciation for the officials in the Home Office and elsewhere who have worked on the Bill. They are dedicated and they sought to give professional advice, without any partisanship, to everybody involved in the debate. I pay tribute to their work in developing and taking forward this scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005.1/1">It is certainly true that the amendments before us now are very different, in two important respects. First, as has already been pointed out, they would provide an opt-out only from having the card: a person's details would still be entered in the register. Lord Armstrong's first set of amendments refer to the register rather than the holding of the card. Secondly, they introduce the sunset clause referring to <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase>, which simply does not pass the acid test of falling on the other side of the latest conceivable date for a general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.1/2">The Bill is also based, as we know, on a form of covert compulsion by the back door, despite the Government's own election manifesto commitment to the voluntary introduction of identity cards. That makes the Government's agreement to introduce separate primary legislation to usher in full-blown compulsion at a later date a largely redundant concession.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005.3/1">I am glad that the Home Secretary scrutinised our manifesto with the care and attention that we have devoted to that of his party. Our manifesto stated, dare I say, the flamingly obvious, which is that it was always the Government's intention to ram the Bill through as a compulsory measure&mdash;and that is exactly what they propose to do now, if on the slightly later date of <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase>. We were right back then, we have been right throughout all these debates and we are right this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/2">That is why we have consistently argued that the British people should be given another opportunity at the next general election to judge for themselves this illiberal, expensive and possibly unworkable scheme. That is why we agreed with Lord Armstrong when he said yesterday:</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/3" class="indent">&quot;There are a good many people out there who genuinely thought that the Government were proposing a voluntary scheme, and they were prepared to go along with it on that understanding&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>; <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 680, c. 651.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/4">And on that understanding alone. Incidentally, that is also why I found myself in unusual agreement with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)</phrase>&mdash;he is not here now&mdash;when he said this afternoon, &quot;We cannot accept a compulsory identity card in this Parliament, given the Government's position at the election and the strong sense among our constituents that we want freedom in this country.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.1006.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a compelling point and I suspect that many people will renew their passports in the weeks leading up to the new compulsory deadline of <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006.1/2">Of course we recognise the extent to which the Government have been forced to climb down and to defer the imposition of covert compulsion in these amendments, but this climbdown does not pass the key test: that any move to compulsion must, under all circumstances, occur after the latest possible date of the next general election. As has been said, it is also significantly less important as a concession than Lord Armstrong's original amendment, since it only allows people to opt out of having the cards; their details will still appear on the ID register.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006.1/3">I have admired and agreed with almost everything that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> has said about this Bill, but here we part company. He is prepared to go along with the Government's victory in ramming through compulsion during this Parliament on the basis that, in practice, things somehow will not be so straightforward. For us, second-guessing the precise timing of the next general election or predicting exactly what may or may or not occur between January and May 2010 can never be a substitute for an objection of principle. The imposition of compulsory ID cards must not under any circumstances occur before the electorate make their own views known where it counts&mdash;at the ballot box. That is why, once again, we will vote tonight&mdash;alone, if necessary&mdash;against the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1008.0/1">I was warming to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> until his last couple of phrases. However, I assure him that those of us who oppose the proposal are not saying that people should join us because it is a Liberal Democrat vote. The vote is against the principle so I hope that not only the hon. Gentleman realises what is going on, but that colleagues from all parties who have stayed true to their principles will continue to maintain their position.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1413" name="Stephen McCabe">The argument of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe)</phrase> is flawed in one obvious respect. He says that we will be able to see how people respond when the Bill is passed. It is exactly because the Bill has been amended in this form by the Lords that we shall not be able to see people's responses so clearly. Until today, we were fighting the argument that there could be a choice. He and his Government are trying to ensure that there will be no choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.0/3">I want to deal with the Home Secretary's repeated constitutional point. Today, he again lamented the fact that the House of Lords had stood so firm for so long. If there had been a clear Government manifesto commitment, the arguments about how the second non-elected Chamber should respond might have been different. But the Government manifesto was at least ambiguous, and many of us believe that their subsequent arguments were the opposite of their manifesto commitment. The other part of Parliament is thus absolutely within its rights to stand up to a Government who claim an unjustified authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.0/4">The Home Secretary cannot deploy the argument against the lords because they are hereditary, bishops or appointed. The current House of Lords was created by the Labour Government. It has been made up in its current form because of the policies of the Prime Minister and the Labour Government. It is no good their complaining that the lords are not doing what they are meant to do; the Government put them there, some possibly, as we have heard recently, in unacceptable ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.0/5">Colleagues in our party argued the case consistently in the other place. It is a great regret to me and many people outside this place that Conservative and Cross-Bench colleagues and Labour Back Benchers did not stay with my colleagues and take the Government to the wire. It would have been a perfectly justified constitutional challenge and a reasonable defeat of the Government, and would have resulted in a much better Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.0/6">If the Home Secretary thinks this is the end of the matter, he is wrong. Many of us have made it absolutely clear that we will do everything in our power, personally and on behalf of other people, never to have identity cards or to be on a national identity register. I encourage everybody listening and watching to renew their passports now so that they will not have to be subject to the ID card regime for the next 10 years. I hope that many will do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.0/7">The Liberal Democrats hope that the Government lose their majority&mdash;not just their moral majority but their majority support among the British public, which they lost a long time ago&mdash;but also their majority in the House of Commons. They won only 35 per cent. of the vote and were backed by only 20 per cent. of the British public, yet they have a majority in the House of Commons. When that majority goes too, one of the first things that my colleagues and I will insist on in the next Parliament is that the ID card legislation is reversed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.0/8">We are happy to go to the country in defence of liberty, to oppose an increasingly authoritarian Government. That is true to our traditions, and the British public will respond far better to us than to the Bill, with its new powers of enforcement, even if there is a Labour majority for the proposal in the House of Commons tonight.</p>

	<p pid="a.1009.1/1">Through certain of our laws, this country has defined its character, and there are some laws that are of particular importance. Through our common law and our statute law, we can trace a finger to show why we are an independent, free and liberated country. If there was a message that we sent around the world, it was the concept of our liberty. It was reiterated through the declaration of independence of the United States and the constitutions of Australia, Canada and New Zealand. That is the tradition of which we are part.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.1/2">Today we are faced with the final round of a Bill that restates who we are: we are the servants of the state if new the Labour Government prevail in the passage of the Bill. It looks a lost cause, but I believe profoundly that this nation is more vibrant and more lively and that it will in the end not tolerate this nonsense. If we look to the history of who we are and we stand firm by the belief in the individuality and autonomy of the citizen, we know that the measure gives unto the Government the central control of information through a register that may or may not be secure, and the information that we have had from people who understand these matters is that no system can render secure the information that is our personal data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.1/3">On the proposition of the Government therefore, the House is now prepared to launch billions of pounds in an experiment that not only diminishes the people of this country, but beggars them in a sense: it beggars them in liberty, but it beggars them through taxation, too. For what purpose is this engineered? The rules of the game have changed, we are told. To what extent does that mean that we must surrender the first presumption of every citizen of these islands that we are free, independent and not the servants of the state?</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.1/4">The House should go out with a ringing defiance of a majority predicated on party, because this is a measure that extends beyond the sense that we are loyal party men or women. We are representatives of something stronger, deeper, longer and more intense than anything that the Home Office now presents to us as the settled will of the new Labour Government. I agree with much of what has been said this evening: people will unpick and begin to understand about all those who will provide information to the Government, who say that they deserve to know all about us. What about the derelicts under the bridges beneath Waterloo? What about the old and confused? What about the mentally anxious?</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.1/5">Those are the people who will be squeezed to try to remember who they are, but we will remember who we are. One day, this Government will experience the wrath and indignation of a country that understands that this is not a small social measure; it is in fact a declaration by Government that the centralised state is more important and greater than the sum of every individual free citizen of the country that we were sent to represent. We should oppose to the utmost and to the end this benighted and wrong Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.1011.1/1">I have listened with interest to the remarks that have been made. At the beginning of the whole debate, the Home Secretary pointed out that the measure was essential in the fight against terrorism. Those who come from Northern Ireland certainly have a great interest in that, because we have been doing that for more than 30 years, particularly and personally. Many of our colleagues have suffered grievously because of that. However, at the time when the Home Secretary was presenting the measure as so essential in the fight against terrorism, we could not understand why the scheme was going to be voluntary and was going to come in in 2008. Now we hear the date of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1011.1/2">It is interesting to note that a Labour Member, speaking about how essential the measure was, said that it would aid the fight against crime, fraud and identity fraud, but seemingly someone can be a criminal or a fraudster, or be involved in the identity fraud game, up until 2010. As far as my colleagues and I are concerned, on the fight against crime or terrorism we believe that if something is essential, it is essential now. However, it seems that the measure is do so with something other than the fight against terrorism, and it is like Big Brother to desire to have all the details of the citizens of the United Kingdom. My colleagues and I will vote against the Lords amendments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-29a.1018.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" speakername="Derek Wyatt" colnum="1018"  time="022:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/debtext/60329-51.htm#60329-51_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.1018.2/1">This is the third time that I have raised the issue of the Kent science park in the House. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-14">14 July 2004</phrase> I had an Adjournment debate on the issue, and on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-02">2 February 2005</phrase> I had an Adjournment debate on the Kent and Medway structure plan in which I mentioned the science park. So I am extremely grateful that I have again been given the opportunity to raise the issue of the future of the Kent science park in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/2">In 2004 the Minister responding was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1848" name="Keith Hill">my right hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill)</phrase>, but he is now PPS to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. The Minister who responded in 2005 is now a Minister in the Department for Education and Skills. I make no apology, therefore, for raising the issue yet again, because Ministers and indeed Departments move, sometimes more frequently than we would like. It is important that this issue remains in the in-tray at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/3">The Kent science park is still affectionately known locally as the Shell research centre. Shell had two research centres, and in one of its rationalisations closed the one just outside Sittingbourne in the mid-1990s. It was a blow to the town, because in many ways, it had been our postgraduate university. Many of its 900 staff could be found as leaders in our community. When it closed, part of the town died.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/4">In due course, the research centre was bought and renamed the Sittingbourne research centre. It had the job of trying to attract small businesses of any description to the 116-acre site. There were several different owners, but gradually it attracted some science-based companies, some public sector organisations and some non-science-based companies. It has never been 100 per cent. full, and to my knowledge, is only 70 per cent. full at present. It has always had a more general business ownership than strictly science.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/5">In the middle of 2004, Sittingbourne research centre, now owned by the De La Salle pension fund, which is part of the secretive Mars organisation, relaunched itself as the Kent science park. The new owners were smart. They persuaded my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister to join them in their relaunch, and from the outset this so-called association has made our local villagers from Bapchild, Rodmersham, Milsted, Tunstall and Bredgar assume, wrongly, that that meant that the Government had given their blessing and were working secretly with De La Salle to approve its grand expansion plans, of which more anon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/6">In Swale borough council's local plan for 2007&ndash;17, we have been asked by the Government to agree an additional 8,000 homes. I should add at this stage that as a result of the water shortage in Kent, I have written to my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning to ask her to put an immediate stop notice on all future build until the water shortage is resolved. It is madness for us, as the Government, to promote the notion of sustainable communities when not only do we face a water shortage, but it looks as if by 2020 we shall face a power shortage too.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/7">We all know that the planning laws favour the developer. It is a huge sadness to me that after almost nine years we have not produced sufficient legislation to change the balance of power between the developer and the local community. In Sittingbourne and Sheppey, such is the quality of the leadership in our Tory councils at both borough and county level that almost every section 106 has failed to be taken up. There has been no new primary school at Warden Bay, no school at all at Thistle Hill in Halfway, and no additional recreational support for our great rugby clubs at Sheppey, plus no shops, pubs or village halls on the Meads estate. Moreover, what starts as 350, 500 or 750 houses in an initial plan always ends up as 550, 780 or 920. It is no surprise to me that there is sometimes a disconnection between our citizens and the political process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/8">Where is that more evident than with the Kent science park development? My constituents are involved in a cat and mouse chase. Kent science park cannot get enough adhesion to its ideas, so it is ducking and diving at every level. For instance, in the recent Kent and Medway structure plan&mdash;page 16, policy NK3, Swale 25&mdash;it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/9" class="indent">&quot;Purpose of the proposed modification was to acknowledge the need for new access arrangements to serve Kent Science Park whereas it refers merely to 'improved' arrangements.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/10">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/11" class="indent">&quot;Description of development of Kent Science Park&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/12">this is the critical part&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/13" class="indent">&quot;as a 'technology and knowledge-based cluster' would be more appropriate than 'science based cluster'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/14">The critical aspect of that is that if &quot;science&quot; is changed to a &quot;technology and knowledge-based cluster&quot;, there does not have to be an affiliation with an academic institution. One of our bones of contention has been that there was no connection whatever to any international or national university.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/15">Let me draw to the Minister's attention the scale of science and technology parks in the United Kingdom. I quote from the 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 UK science park statistics:</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/16" class="indent">&quot;Number of operational Science Parks . . . around 60 . . . Property in square metres . . . around 1.2 million . . . Number of jobs in tenant companies . . . around 50,000 . . . Number of tenant companies 2204 . . . 62 per cent. of tenant companies are independent single site companies . . . Only 15 per cent. of companies are Bio-related . . . 45 per cent. of companies have 1&ndash;5 employees . . . 30 per cent. have 6&ndash;15 employees . . . Less than 8 per cent. have more than 50 employees . . . Around 62 per cent. occupy between 1&ndash;150 square metres, with only 18 per cent. occupying more than 400 square metres.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/17">One can conclude from those statistics that the average science park employs around 861 people, the average number of tenants is 40, and the average floor space is 20,909 sq m. Kent science park currently has 56,000 sq m of floor space, nearly three times the national average. It wishes to create an additional 145,000 sq m of floor space, which means that it will account for approximately 17 per cent. of all the science park floor space in the United Kingdom. Kent science park is already one of the largest science parks in the country. At 116 acres, it is larger than Oxford science park at 75 acres and just a little smaller than Cambridge science park at 152 acres.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/18">The owners of Kent science park plan to expand to more than 300 acres. The park will be required to expand its company base from 84 to approximately 375 companies. The largest employers in the park, which account for a large proportion of jobs, include Amicus Response Ltd, a housing association call centre and Galleon BBC magazine distribution centre. One can therefore get a feel of how much science is currently on the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/19">At no time has De la Salle Investment Management introduced a plan to redevelop the current site of 116 acres. Unsurprisingly, neither Kent county council nor Swale borough council have demanded that. Both should be ashamed of themselves. There is substantial space on the current site for it to improve what it wants to do without developing on a greenfield site.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/20">Science parks have become the vogue, and in all cases, they are attached to universities. Leeds university, Leicester university, Bristol university and Bath university announced science technology or innovation parks in 2001. Liverpool university and Liverpool John Moore's university followed suit in 2004. Interestingly, they are funded by the local regional development agency. London, too, followed suit. More recently, Nottingham and Nottingham Trent have also announced science parks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/21">The Chancellor of the Exchequer is a science enthusiast and has increased science research funding substantially in successive Budgets, but at university level. At the same time, he has ensured that our investment in share option tax breaks are better than those of California. According to last year's league tables in &quot;The Times Good University Guide&quot;, notwithstanding the usual reservation about league tables, Kent was placed 44th and Greenwich was 94th. However, Kent has one newcomer, which constitutes the most stimulating part of the discussion. It is Imperial college, which is currently in Kensington, but owns Wye college near Ashford.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/22">Imperial is ranked third in the UK, after Cambridge and Oxford, but first in technology and science. Although it is a university college of London, it recently announced its determination to become a full-blown university. Imperial is hampered by its location at Kensington, and it could not develop a science park except on its site at Wye.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/23">I was the only Member of Parliament who attended the Kent and Medway discussions on science parks in September 2004. Kent county council said then that there was no intention to develop a science park at Ashford. However, late last year it announced a &pound;1 billion science and technology park to be based at Wye college and run by Imperial and Kent county council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/24">I am not sure that one can have two science parks in Kent&mdash;one in Sittingbourne and the &pound;1 billion science park. There is simply not enough investment or companies. If I were a young entrepreneur and I had a choice, I would choose Imperial, because of its history, rather than an independent science park.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/25">The downgrading of the Kent science park to a technology cluster means that it will be no more than a glorified business park. The Minister should seriously consider asking the Thames gateway to downgrade the Kent science park as a flagship project, because it has been superseded by events at Imperial.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/26">Let me state some of the things that the Kent science park wants to do. According to its website yesterday, it wants to increase its floor space to 145,000 sq m. It wants a new &pound;29 million motorway junction and southern relief road to connect the science park to the M2 and A2. It wants approximately 5,000 new dwellings&mdash;on top of the 8,000 that my community has already been asked to provide in the next 10 years. It wants a &pound;3 million enhancement to the public transport system as a link to it, through the provision of additional buses and bus routes. We are not sure who will pay for that. It is prepared to put down a &pound;5 million endowment for providing the academic campus but I believe that that, again, that is superseded by Imperial's intentions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/27">Kent science park wants to create a country park and a conservation park totalling 54 acres, but we already have a country and conservation park, called South Sittingbourne&mdash;a very beautiful place that houses five wonderful Saxon villages. I do not see the point of breaking up the countryside and putting it back in an artificial place, as is being suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/28">One of the reasons why Kent science park wants to do that is that the Government have provided &pound;25 million for a northern relief road called the northern distributor road, which will give the 6,500 people who go to the Eurolink industrial estate every day fast and easy access to the estate without having to clog up the centre of Sittingbourne. Kent science park now wants to build a southern ring road to match the northern ring road. The game is this: it hopes that the Government will also pay for the southern ring road, even though there is absolutely no economic reason for it. And when we say that we are not prepared to build it because it is the responsibility not of the Highways Agency but of Kent county council, Kent science park will say, &quot;Now we will have to build the 5,000 houses, because under section 106, that will allow the funding for the &pound;28 million road.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/29">We do not like the game that Kent science park is playing, because it is not representing what we feel that we need in our community. I hope that my hon. Friend understands that there is a great deal of concern about this in the five parishes&mdash;which contain 3,500 of my constituents&mdash;about the pace of this process, which goes against the feel and flavour of what we would like in our community for the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/30">We have a local plan hearing after Easter, at which the future of the Kent science park will be debated, and of course I recognise that the Minister is hamstrung, because of the quasi-judicial role of his Department. I understand that he cannot comment too much on the matter tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/31">The only people who will benefit from the expansion of the Kent science park are the pensioners who benefit from the pension funds of De La Salle and Mars, the two farmers who own the land, and the consultants. After all, this will not be a science park; it will not offer added-value jobs for my community. It will be an ordinary business park, and we already have substantial business parks in the community, and substantial space left to develop for the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/32">I will finish in a moment, but before I sit down, will the Minister tell me whether the De La Salle team can withdraw their plans at the local inquiry in April, May and June and appeal over the heads of the system directly to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister? In conclusion, I can put it no better than Michael Peters did in a letter to the local paper. It was headed:</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/33" class="indent">&quot;Time for another Wyatt's revolt&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/34">The letter reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/35" class="indent">&quot;More than 450 years ago, when Wyatt's rebellion broke out in Kent, the government in Whitehall began to quake. Roger Truelove's letter&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/36">published in the <i>East Kent Gazette</i> on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/37" class="indent">&quot;gives grounds for hope that history might repeat itself. The Deputy Prime Minister is rumoured to support the Kent Science Park plan for a huge new commercial zone sprawling across the fields of Tunstall&mdash;five times the size of the present one&mdash;bringing traffic hell to our roads as streams of vehicles drag through the town to the site. Maybe our present-day 'bloody Wyatt' (seemingly more effective than his 16th century namesake) can stop this dreadful plan in its tracks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.2/38">I hope that that will be the case.</p>
