	<p pid="b.939.6/1">I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. He will be aware of the socially responsible work that credit unions carry out, but he will also be aware that the credit union movement feels that the current legislative framework is stunting its growth, and he will be aware that there are far higher levels of credit union membership in other countries, such as Ireland. What steps is he considering taking to update the law governing credit unions?</p>

	<p pid="b.939.7/1">First, I should point out that the growth fund investment that my Department is making is the first ever substantial investment by Government in the credit union movement, and my hon. Friend will know of the First Alliance credit union in Ayrshire which is benefiting from growth fund money. My Department is looking in conjunction with the Treasury at the legislative and regulatory rules that affect credit unions, and I am sure that colleagues in that Department will have more to say about that in future.</p>

	<p pid="b.939.8/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important that credit unions are not just an urban phenomenon, but that they also offer savings and loan opportunities in rural areas? Will he commend the work of North Yorkshire county council, which on <phrase class="date" code="">4 December</phrase> will consider a business plan drawn up in association with local housing associations to expand the common bond of the York credit union to the whole of North Yorkshire so that credit union facilities will be available in the whole of the county of Yorkshire?</p>

	<p pid="b.940.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, and I can tell him that no fewer than 11 credit unions in Yorkshire are benefiting from the investment that the Government are putting in through the growth fund. We have found that in many areas a number of small credit unions have come together to collaborate and pursue a bid for growth fund money. That has been especially effective for credit unions that cover rural areas. My hon. Friend is right that such amalgamations must take place if we are to get wider coverage on behalf of credit unions, and that is precisely the sort of thing that growth fund investment has encouraged.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.940.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his answers. Obviously, the people who benefit most from credit unions are those at most risk from loan sharks and least able to look after themselves in this respect. Will my hon. Friend clarify the situation with regard to the funding he mentioned in his first answer? Is that just for expanding existing credit unions, or are there facilities for creating new credit unions from scratch, and where should people go if they want assistance in, or advice on, starting a credit union?</p>

	<p pid="b.940.2/1">The growth fund money is being used in a number of ways. Some of it is expanding the capitalisation of credit unions&mdash;it is having a substantial impact in that respect. As I said, a number of credit unions have amalgamated or brought collaborative deals to us in order to bid for the growth fund. Some of the money is also available to assist in training and development for those who work in credit unions&mdash;both full-time staff and volunteers, who play an important role.</p>

Friend for that answer, but what would she say to a 17-year-old constituent of mine with a severe stammer who could be helped by a SpeechEasy device to get into employment&mdash;it would help him make telephone calls, attend interviews and so on&mdash;and yet has received just one piece of advice: that he should go on jobseeker's allowance and then people will look at helping him? He is a bright young man who is eager to work, and a small investment now would repay the taxpayer many times over in the future. Can we not look at providing more help for people such as him who want to contribute to society?</p>

	<p pid="b.941.0/1">I recognise the picture that my hon. Friend has painted. Through Jobcentre Plus and our disability employment advisers, there are ways in which a young man in such a position can be assisted through the training and interview processes. If they are successful in getting a job there is also, of course, our successful &quot;access to work&quot; programme to address ways of supporting them in employment. I know that my hon. Friend has written to me on the specifics of her constituency case and I will respond on that as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.941.1/1">Anyone who has a speech impediment or communication difficulty, whether it results from a physical disability or a psychological problem, should ideally be able to access speech therapy long before they reach the stage when they want to attend a job interview. I would include in that many young people who do not have a speech impediment but who have barely intelligible speech. They need to have that made known to them, so that they present themselves well and to best advantage when they go for a job.</p>

	<p pid="b.941.2/1">I understood <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" name="Helen Jones">the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase>, and likewise I understand exactly what the hon. Lady is saying. I hope that she welcomed the recent statement in the pre-Budget report supporting enhanced facilities for speech therapy. We recognise that communication is important in getting through the interview process and getting a job. That is why Jobcentre Plus works with the individual, particularly if they have a speech impediment, to see what is most appropriate to take them through that quite difficult process,</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.941.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="941"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0001.htm#0711196000433">
	<p pid="b.941.3/1">Does the Minister think that a young person who has a severe speech impediment would qualify for incapacity benefit under the new assessment announced today, or would she include such a person in being part of the sick-note culture? Would it not be better for all concerned if the Government concentrated on putting their efforts into providing tailored support for such people to get back into work, as proposed in the Freud review, which Ministers have now ditched, rather than on demonising disabled people by using negative stereotypes of the type that we have read about again in the papers today?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.941.4/1">I regret the sort of angle from which the hon. Gentleman has come at this issue, because when we debated the Welfare Reform Bill in Committee, we were clear that the way in which we would work in future would be to consider and support the individual, and to identify their needs to ensure that they moved into work with the proper support when that was appropriate. Of course, it would be ludicrous for me to say that one person would be able to qualify for the new employment and support allowance whereas someone else would not, because it is very much tailored to individual needs, including training needs, individual aspirations and how those people move into work. For the hon. Gentleman's information, we are implementing the recommendations of the Freud report.</p>

	<p pid="b.942.0/1">My question follows the point ably made by the hon. Member for Warrington, North, and is similar. The Minister will know that last week Scope launched its &quot;no voice, no choice&quot; campaign, which specifically examines the need of many disabled people for communication devices, both to have much more fulfilled lives and to get into employment. Is she able to update the House on the steps that she and her colleagues are taking to improve that situation to deal with both the constituency case that has been mentioned and people more widely?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.942.1/1">Obviously, I have read Scope's report. We have clearly identified communication as an issue for many people, which is why we have support workers for many people who have a visual impairment and why Braille is part of the working environment&mdash;that is supported through our access to work programme. For those who have a hearing impairment, we provide British Sign Language signers and we examine different ways in which we can support technology to maintain people in their employment. Of course, I would be delighted to update the hon. Gentleman, in his new capacity as shadow spokesperson on disability, at an appropriate future time.</p>

	<p pid="b.942.5/1">I thank the Secretary of State for that answer. What would he say to my constituent, Martin Smith, who has been in correspondence with the Child Support Agency for the past four years? He has stated that he was the father of a child, and he then submitted his DNA report, which the CSA has lost. The CSA has been taking money out of his account every week, and he now risks losing his job. Will the Secretary of State assure the House that the transitional arrangements that he brings into force will ensure that such cases will be dealt with swiftly before the new organisation takes over?</p>

	<p pid="b.942.6/1">I would certainly like to examine the case of the constituent mentioned by my right hon. Friend, because his account makes it sound disturbing. There is no doubt that from its original inception in the early 1990s, the CSA has been a real problem in dealing with the problems that it was set up to resolve. It has improved its performance recently, but we are replacing it with the new commission precisely to start on an entirely new footing and to ensure that we provide child support in the way that it ought to have been provided all along.</p>

	<p pid="b.943.0/1">The Secretary of State has just rightly said that since its inception the Child Support Agency has encountered many difficulties. I am sure that he will be aware, as are many hon. Members, that one of the principal difficulties has occurred when the absent parent&mdash;the parent without care&mdash;has been self-employed, and it has therefore been impossible to reach or place enforcement orders on their earnings. Can he tell the House whether the new agency will have any other, better methods of dealing with that intractable problem than has been the case in the past?</p>

	<p pid="b.943.1/1">We will provide powers for direct collection from bank accounts, because the hon. Lady is right that there is a problem with self-employed people. We will also encourage mediation, especially for those on benefit. At present, they have to enter into a statutory relationship, via the CSA. If the issue could be voluntarily agreed, it could remove that obstacle to a proper relationship between the parents and support for the resident parent.

In talking about the financial assistance scheme&mdash;the help for the 125,000 pensioners concerned because of the breakdown of their pension scheme&mdash;the Tories should be a little careful; they cannot afford to claim that they looked after pensions during their term. They created the circumstances in which many of those schemes got into trouble. In 1986, pension fund surpluses were capped by the then Chancellor. They allowed pension holidays&mdash;</p>

One is to welcome the economically active and very intelligent workers whom we have taken into my constituency, largely from Poland. The other is deliberately to foment trouble by attacking such workers in the local paper and having pictures taken outside Polish shops, as though they were not only a wave of invaders who are damaging the economy, but totally unacceptable.

That is why the minimum wage that we brought in must be enforced rigorously throughout the economy. In some cases, that is not happening, and foreign nationals themselves are being exploited, so we are bringing in tougher measures to ensure that it does happen&mdash;and to enforce employment rights, which are not always enforced. I hope that he will join me in insisting that the legal rights for which we have legislated as a Government, including the minimum wage, are properly respected, in Macclesfield and elsewhere.</p>

He could have added that the proportion of UK workers has fallen in the same period. Furthermore, is he aware that since 1995, the number of British jobs occupied by British workers has decreased? At the same time, there has been a continued increase in the number of non-UK nationals in employment, including both EU nationals, to whom <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the hon.

	<p pid="b.948.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman supported the policy of identity cards, it might be easier to resolve the question that he has put. Let us look at the facts. The facts are that we have seen a million more British nationals in jobs under our Government. Unemployment and the claimant count rate are at an historically low level. There are 660,000 job vacancies in the British economy today and every day. Also&mdash;this is crucial to a sensible analysis of the debate&mdash;the number of working-age British people has fallen significantly, because it is an ageing society. Therefore, one might also ask the question: what if those foreign nationals, including those from Europe, had not been here to fill the jobs in the gap that an ageing population left behind? That is why we want to get more people off benefits and into work, and why the Prime Minister's policy of getting British benefit claimants into British jobs, so that they become British workers, is the right policy.</p>

Four weeks ago, she reapplied for a medical assessment, but she does not even have a date for it yet. If I supply the Minister with the details, perhaps she will kindly look into the matter. In general, is the picture not rather a poor one?</p>

Many of the 2.64 million people of working age are currently on incapacity benefit because the personal capability assessment has focused more on people's incapability than their capability for work. In October 2008, I am therefore introducing a new medical test&mdash;the work capability assessment&mdash;that will assess people's physical and mental ability and what they can do rather than what they cannot do. I placed a report evaluating the new test in the Library this morning.</p>

	<p pid="b.953.0/1">May I invite the Secretary of State to indulge in a bit of interdepartmental thinking and action to overcome a problem that is becoming very apparent in inner-city areas such as mine? Single parents have great difficulty in accessing council or housing association properties because of the shortages and are therefore placed in private accommodation by the local authority, often on a very high rent&mdash;sometimes as much as &pound;300 or &pound;400 a week. That rent is then paid for by housing benefit. I have no problem with people getting housing benefit; this is not an attack on housing benefit, but the problem that then emerges is that, if and when they are offered a job or encouraged into a job by the agency, they have to reject it because they need to get one that pays more than &pound;15,000 to start with just to pay the rent. That means that they are in danger of losing benefits and we are in danger of losing somebody who wants to work and contribute to society. This is a twin problem of benefits and housing. I realise that it is not entirely the Secretary of State's responsibility, but does he recognise that it is a serious issue, and is he prepared to do something about it?</p>

That is why the Prime Minister recently announced that for London there will be an in-work credit of &pound;60 a week for an individual coming off income support, in the case of a lone parent, to enable them to take a job and to deal with precisely the problem that my hon.

We sought to draw attention to a radical change from what has gone on in the past, in the 1980s and 1990s, when people were smuggled off the unemployment statistics on to incapacity benefit. The numbers tripled, which led to the benefit mountain we received as a legacy from the previous Conservative Government. We are reducing it. For the first time in a generation, the figure has come down&mdash;by 120,000 during the past few years&mdash;having risen year on year as a result of that legacy. The new, stringent, personal capability assessment, of which I have informed the House, will enable us to bring that number down even more.</p>

	<p pid="b.954.1/1">On the contrary, compared with the record of the Tory Government, where incapacity benefit tripled, we have already brought the numbers down by 120,000 and this additional test will enable us to accelerate that process. In addition, the rolling out of pathways to work throughout the country by April next year will bear down even more sharply on those figures. At last we will begin to get rid of the awful legacy bequeathed to us by the previous Tory Government, where people were written off on incapacity benefit, instead of being helped into a job, or being given new opportunities, skills and support to get a job, which enable them to transform their lives as a result.</p>

Of course, we know that there is a second state pension&mdash;an important part of the UK state pension system&mdash;that brings people up to a third of average earnings. In the UK, private pensions are more important, and 86 per cent. of UK pensioners have income other than state pensions. Private pensions are also eligible for tax relief so, including a private pension, a pensioner on a medium income gets an income of two thirds of average earnings. The Aon report got a headline, and added a lot of heat but little light. We remain committed to our policy of re-establishing the link to earnings.</p>

Now there are jobs. There are vacancies everywhere, in every constituency in this country, which is why we want people on incapacity benefit, lone parents on income support, older workers and the long-term unemployed to join the jobs programmes we are undertaking with local employers to get them into work, and we can do that.</p>

The issue is also about how our Jobcentre Plus staff work with other organisations, such as the housing benefit office, and with the voluntary sector and, importantly, about the changes that we are going to make to the contracting of provider services, to ensure that we get better outcomes for the taxpayer's investment, rather than just paying for processes. That is the direction for the future, with jobcentre staff, others in partnership and contract providers playing an even more effective role.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.959.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1981" speakername="Alistair Darling" speakeroffice="The Chancellor of the Exchequer"  colnum="959"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0003.htm#0711196000532">
	<p pid="b.959.1/1">With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement to update the House on the current position with regard to Northern Rock. The House will recall that last week I said during the Queen's Speech debate that I would keep the House informed of developments. I also said that I expected to publish a statement of principles underpinning the Government's approach to proposals received by Northern Rock with regard to its future. I published that statement this morning, prior to the markets opening, in the usual way. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/2">It is important to be clear about the respective responsibilities of the Northern Rock board and the Government. The board is legally responsible to its shareholders for the future of the company. However, the Government have a wider public interest in maintaining financial stability, which is why we agreed to lender-of-last-resort support in September and subsequent lending by the Bank of England. The Government also have an interest in protecting the interest of the taxpayer. Because of this, the Government have, as a major creditor, a direct interest in the future of Northern Rock. The Government therefore have to agree to any proposals for the future of Northern Rock.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/3">Before turning to our approach, let me deal first with the position on the guarantee arrangements to Northern Rock depositors provided by the Government and, secondly, with the loan facilities provided by the Bank of England to support Northern Rock and to maintain financial stability in general. First, we have made it clear that the guarantee arrangements already announced for depositors in order to safeguard their position will remain in place during the current instability in the financial markets. These guarantee arrangements were absolutely necessary. They have not had any cost to the taxpayer because these deposits covered by the guarantee arrangements remain in the bank. As I have said before, savers are free to take their money out if that is what they want to do, but they have no need to do so. The guarantee arrangements ensure that savers' deposits are safe. The guarantee will not be removed without proper notice being given to depositors.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/4">Looking ahead, I have made it clear that the Government will legislate for a new regime for protecting bank depositors. As the House knows, we have published a discussion paper on this legislation, and I very much welcome the offer of cross-party support for it. But it is important that we get it right. There are many examples, both here and in other countries, of legislation having been rushed through only to be regretted later. The current consultation finishes on <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>. I will bring forward proposals in the new year when I have also had time to consider the outcome of the Treasury Committee's work, as it has requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/5">The second element of support is the Bank of England loan facilities. It is important to remind ourselves of why this support was provided in the first place. Northern Rock got into difficulties because it was almost totally reliant on getting very substantial sums from the securitisation and money markets on a continuous basis to do its business. When that lending became ever more difficult, it had no option other than to go to the Bank of England. Because of the possible impact on the stability of the wider financial system, it was right that I authorised the Bank of England to intervene. That, too, had cross-party support.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/6">While international financial markets have shown signs of improvement since the sharp credit squeeze in August and September, following the problems that arose in the American housing market in the summer, there clearly remains continued uncertainty in the markets. The rates at which banks are willing to lend to each other also remain high in all the major currencies. It is therefore vital that we do everything we can to maintain stability internationally, as well as here at home. As the House knows, we are taking steps at an international and domestic level to improve the regulatory regime and to provide greater transparency. That was the subject of the discussions of G20 Finance Ministers that I attended in Cape Town over the weekend.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/7">The continuing support of the Bank of England has also given Northern Rock an opportunity to consider its strategic options. I am very clear that this is also the right thing to do and, indeed, when I announced this, it enjoyed support from both sides of the House. I know that there has been interest in how much support the Bank of England is giving. The Bank publishes its balance sheet every week. However, in common with other central banks, it does not provide details of any operations because it believes that doing so would undermine its ability to provide such support. I understand the frustrations that that can sometimes cause, but to provide what would, in effect, be a running commentary on any operations would be likely to have adverse affects that none of us would want.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/8">Having said that, I can tell the House that Bank of England lending is secured against assets held by Northern Rock, which include high-quality mortgages with a significant protection margin built in and high-quality securities with the highest quality of credit rating. The Bank is the senior secured creditor. The Financial Services Authority has said before, and continues to say, that Northern Rock's main asset base&mdash;its mortgage book&mdash;is strong and sound.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/9">As with any lender on this scale, we have ensured that the Bank's lending is subject to significant conditions and controls to ensure that our interests are protected, and, in return for that facility, Northern Rock has agreed a number of controls, including not declaring, making or paying any dividend without the prior written consent of the Bank of England, and not making any substantial change to the nature of its business.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/10">I now turn to the next stage. It is in the interests of everyone that the situation with regard to Northern Rock is resolved as soon as possible. That was why Northern Rock asked for expressions of interest in purchasing the business. As the company announced earlier today, as part of its review of its strategic options, it has received indicative expressions of interest, covering a range of options for the business. It currently expects to receive further expressions of interest in the next few days.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/11">It is essential that the public interest is protected. That is why I have published today the principles that will underpin the Government's approach, when assessing proposals from Northern Rock regarding its future. As I have already said, the Government have to agree to any such proposals. The principles make it clear that the Government have a clear duty to protect the public interest, and we will do so. However, I think that the whole House, and particularly Members representing the north-east, will want us to do everything we can within the constraints on us to resolve a very difficult position for Northern Rock.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/12">Let me therefore set out our approach. First, we must protect the interests of the taxpayer. Substantial sums have been lent, and that money has to be repaid at an appropriate time and rate. The Government will consider proposals with a view to reaching the best outcome for the public purse. Secondly, we want to protect depositors. It is essential to do everything we can both to safeguard their interests and to maintain the service provided to them. Thirdly, we will maintain wider financial stability.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/13">As I have made clear all along, the Government will now assess proposals from the company consistent with the approach that I have set out, and we remain closely engaged with the company as the best outcome for its future is assessed. As the company has acknowledged today, any proposals would have to be approved by the Government and, importantly, any proposal can be vetoed by the Government. In that way, the Government can ensure that the public interest is safeguarded. As I have told the House on previous occasions, any outcome must meet EU state aid rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/14">It would be quite wrong to dismiss any option now without proper consideration, as some have suggested we do. I continue to believe that it is right to use this time to explore the best outcome for the company and the public interest. I agreed to Bank of England support because I believed it was right to do so. I agreed to continue support to allow Northern Rock the time it needs to consider its strategic options because it was right to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/15">I have set out today the approach that the Government will take as they assess proposals from the company to ensure that we will approve a solution only if it safeguards both the public interest and the specific interests of the taxpayer. That work is being done now and will be concluded as quickly as possible. I will, of course, continue to keep the House informed in the coming weeks. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.961.1/1">Order. Let the hon. Gentleman ask his questions.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.962.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1868" speakername="George Osborne" colnum="962"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0004.htm#0711196000535">
	<p pid="b.962.0/1">The question we now ask of the Chancellor is simple: has he been honest with taxpayers about the risks that they face, and has he told the whole truth? First, let us look at what he has announced today. He announced that what was supposed to be a short-term emergency facility for Northern Rock may now be extended beyond February and could last for years. Thank you, but we already knew that because it was in a memo from the company's advisers that was leaked last week. Indeed, throughout the crisis we have learned more from media leaks than we have from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/2">The Chancellor will not tell us the size of the facility, when he expects it to be repaid or the terms of the repayment, even though much of that information is an open secret in the City. Indeed, the Governor of the Bank of England wants to publish the letter that he sent to the Chancellor to set out those terms. He told the Select Committee that he wanted to do so, but the Chancellor refuses to publish the letter and simply says that it is in the public interest that he should refuse. Clearly, the Governor of the Bank of England disagrees. Will the Chancellor explain in greater detail why he will not publish that letter?</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/3">This is not about the commercial interests that the Prime Minister spoke about last week, but about the public interest and the &pound;900 that has been pledged on behalf of every taxpayer in Britain. The Chancellor talks about the Government's liabilities being secured against &pound;100 billion of Northern Rock assets, but he does not say that many of the assets are already promised to other creditors. Will he confirm that the free assets at Northern Rock could be closer to &pound;40 billion and that total Government liabilities, through both the facility and the deposit guarantee, might now be approaching the total of the available assets, putting the taxpayer further at risk?</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/4">The Treasury also said today:</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Authorities expect the costs and risks associated with Northern Rock to be borne to the greatest extent possible by the current and future private sector providers of capital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/6">So do we, but has the Chancellor given a general guarantee to cover the &pound;13 billion or so lent by medium-term note holders&mdash;the large institutions that lent money with their eyes open? Has the Chancellor considered reducing the risk to taxpayers by announcing a cap on the guarantee offered by the Government so that only individual savers are fully protected? Of course, we need to get the depositor protection legislation right, but we now know from the Governor of the Bank of England that he has been pressing the Chancellor to do that for a considerable time.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/7">The Chancellor has failed to address today the two things that he appears so far to have kept secret from Parliament and from the taxpayer. First, will he tell us whether it is true that the Treasury, as well as the Bank of England, has lent money to Northern Rock? He mentioned only the Bank of England in his statement, but today we are told that the Treasury has also lent so-called subordinated term debt, which does not have to be paid for five years, comes at the back of the queue and is in most danger of default if the bank is wound up. If that is true, taxpayers have been exposed to an extraordinary long-term risk, yet we have been told about that Treasury loan by the BBC's business editor rather than the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If it is true, the Chancellor is surely deliberately withholding information from Parliament and the public. Will he confirm the existence of that Treasury loan?</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/8">The second thing that has become clearer today is that the Chancellor cannot be sure of keeping the promises that he and the Prime Minister made to the taxpayer. He said to the Select Committee that</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/9" class="indent">&quot;we fully expect to be able to get that money back.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/10">He said to the public that</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/11" class="indent">&quot;any money that the Government makes available&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/12">to Northern Rock</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/13" class="indent">&quot;we can recover from its assets&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/14">The Prime Minister said at the Dispatch Box last week that the money from the taxpayer was</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/15" class="indent">&quot;guaranteed against Northern Rock assets.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November 2007</phrase>; Vol. 467, c. 660.]</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/16">Today, the Chancellor merely says that he wants the best outcome for the public purse. Will all the money lent by the taxpayer be repaid with interest&mdash;yes or no? Let us hope that the answer is yes and that, in the final reckoning, the taxpayer will not have paid a heavy price for the Government's incompetence. Let us hope that the Chancellor can be honest today about the risks to the taxpayer and about the existence of the secret Treasury loan.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.0/17">We are considering a tale of incompetence and weak leadership from a Government who now reel from one disaster to another. We have a Chancellor who appears to have made secret loans from the Treasury, who has made guarantees to the taxpayer that he cannot be sure of honouring and whose weakness contributes to the instability of the financial system. That is why the Chancellor's job is now on the line.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.963.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1981" speakername="Alistair Darling" colnum="963"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0004.htm#0711196000536">
	<p pid="b.963.0/1">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was unable to make any constructive proposals. He supported the decision that I made at the start to enable us to provide lender-of-last-resort facilities to the bank. He also supported providing a guarantee, yet he now tries to give the impression that he does not agree with any of those things.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/2">On the many questions that the hon. Gentleman asked about future proposals, he knows full well that, until we have had a chance to assess the proposals that the various financial institutions have presented and reach a view about what would work, it is impossible for me to state precisely the arrangements that we expect for Northern Rock in future. However, it is right to spend time assessing the proposals that the various institutions have made and then come to a view about what is best to ensure that we secure a future for Northern Rock and protect the wider public interest, especially the taxpayers' money that has been lent to the bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/3">It is hardly a secret that we have made facilities available to Northern Rock&mdash;I have informed the House at each and every stage of events, as hon. Members would expect. Furthermore, we were absolutely right to take such actions because the consequences of letting the Northern Rock bank fail, as the hon. Gentleman now appears to suggest that we should have done, would have been immensely damaging to this country's financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/4">The hon. Gentleman asked several questions. First, he asked about the deposits that we are guaranteeing. As I told him, they remain in the bank, so there has been no cost to the taxpayers. The money is there; people can take it out if they wish. However, the guarantee exists, and it is not, therefore, necessary for people to take out the money. There has not been a cost to the taxpayer because the money is in the bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/5">The hon. Gentleman asked about lending to the Northern Rock bank. The lending of last resort and the lending that started in the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="">9 October</phrase> has been by the Bank of England. He asked especially about a story that appeared on the BBC this morning on the element of the loan that represents the penal rate of interest that the Bank of England normally charges. The sum concerned is nothing like the figure about which Mr. Peston speculated on the radio. It is a small amount of money, which will be recovered from Northern Rock. It is due to be recovered by Northern Rock as and when we move to the next stage. There is, therefore, nothing secret about it. It is a perfectly normal lending operation by the Bank of England that is necessary to secure the future of Northern Rock.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/6">The hon. Gentleman asked about the letter that the Governor of the Bank of England sent. I repeat what I said when he asked that question last week&mdash;the Treasury Committee asked the same question. On the evening before the lender-of-last-resort facilities were announced, both the Governor of the Bank of England and the chairman of the FSA wrote letters advising me to authorise such facilities. The letters must be seen together. It is true that the Governor of the Bank of England told the Select Committee that he had no objection to publication. However, the chairman of the FSA most certainly objects to the letters being published. As I said to the Treasury Committee, I do not say that we will never publish them&mdash;I believe that, given time, it may be appropriate to do so. However, it would not be in the public interest to publish them now. I have consistently taken that position with the Select Committee and in the House last week and today.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/7">I believe that what I did in respect of Northern Rock at the start was right. I believe that it is right now to give the bank the space that it needs to consider its strategic options. Anything else, I believe, would be grossly irresponsible, and I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has chosen to follow that path.</p>

In defining the public interest, is he prepared to look at the question of employment, not only at this time but at the time that any bid might be successful, and for a five-year period afterwards? Will he ask any bidder to itemise its employment plans, both at the time of sale and for a period of five years afterwards?</p>

	<p pid="b.964.1/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend's support. As he rightly says, there is a great deal of understandable interest in the issue in the north-east, because of the impact on jobs and on the wider economy there. As I have said on previous occasions, I hope that we can do everything possible to allow the Northern Rock to continue to do business. As he knows, many hurdles must be crossed, but we will do everything we can to help. That is why it is so necessary to provide Northern Rock with a breathing space, and it is deeply regrettable that some people, particularly Conservatives, now seem to be suggesting that that is wrong.</p>

	<p pid="b.965.0/1">I do not know whether the Chancellor has been singing in the bath, but he does bear an increasing resemblance to the former Conservative Chancellor, Norman Lamont, who presided over a comparable financial disaster.</p>
	<p pid="b.965.0/2">I want to focus on the &pound;24 billion loan&mdash;&pound;900 for every taxpayer&mdash;which is over and above the &pound;18 billion deposit guarantee, which is less controversial and which we all support. The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was widely criticised for advancing &pound;800 million for the millennium dome. In the past few weeks, the Government have provided the equivalent of 30 millennium domes to this bank, without even the prospect of a decent pop concert at the end of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.965.0/3">The key question, which I put to the Prime Minister last week, is this: is the lending secured? He said that it was. Will the Chancellor confirm, however, that that is not the case? Of the loan, &pound;13 billion has a first charge security, although at a more relaxed standard than is normal; &pound;11 billion, however, is wholly unsecured. Half the assets of the bank have been packaged up by a company called Granite, which is registered in the Channel Islands and has the first claim on the assets. The remainder is a collection of mortgages, many of which were advanced at the peak of the property market and are now of declining value. I therefore return to the question that I put to the Prime Minister, and that has been partially put to the Chancellor already. Will he stand up and give an absolute guarantee that the loan will be repaid in full, with full interest, within the lifetime of this Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="b.965.0/4">Will the Chancellor also comment on the management of the company? Does not Mr. Adam Applegarth, who has just been dismissed, now have a pension pot of &pound;2 million and various bonuses, which are underwritten by the taxpayer? Will the Government explain how they got into a position in which they have entrusted &pound;24 billion to a management team that was discredited, that led the bank into its present crisis, and whose chief executive showed such contempt for his own bank that he sold his own shares to invest in a country estate and a Ferrari for his wife?</p>
	<p pid="b.965.0/5">That is not the only conflict of interest. An attempt is being made to sell the bank, led by the company. The company has a clear conflict of interest.

	<p pid="b.966.0/1">The ideal outcome would be the sale of the bank, as a going concern, to a private operator who could maintain the employment in the north-east and the brand, and repay the Government in full. It is clear from this morning's bids, however, that that is a fantasy and will not happen, which leaves us with two very unpalatable options.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.0/2">The first option is liquidation of the bank&mdash;putting it into administration&mdash;which I think we all agree would be a disaster. It would devastate the north-east, the shareholders would get nothing, and the Government would lose a great deal of money. Should not the Government therefore consider the other option, which is temporarily assuming full control of the bank?

	<p pid="b.966.2/1">I note that over the weekend the hon. Gentleman changed his position on Northern Rock several times. On Saturday he was calling for full-scale nationalisation, by yesterday he was calling for reluctant nationalisation; and today it was reluctant nationalisation for a very short period. This afternoon, having denounced the City, he went on to press for a quick sale to the very people whom he had denounced.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.2/2">I understand full well that the board and the shareholders have a particular interest with regard to Northern Rock&mdash;I made that clear in my statement&mdash;but we, the Government, have an interest in protecting not just financial stability but the taxpayer's money that is being lent. The reason that we insist on our interests being upheld is that we would have to agree with any proposal for the future of Northern Rock. If we do not like a proposal, we can say no to it. We can veto it because, through the Bank of England, we are by far the major creditor.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.2/3">I believe, however, that simply plumping for one solution today&mdash;and presumably, by extension, not bothering even to consider any of the expressions of interest that have been received&mdash;would be extremely short-sighted and foolish. Would it not be better to use the time that we have to establish whether those expressions of interest can be translated into a firm proposal that would both help the company and, crucially, protect the public interest? I think that that would be far the better course, and it is the one that I propose to pursue.</p>

It will be difficult&mdash;many hurdles will have to be overcome, and a great deal of hard work will be involved&mdash;but I think that the Government have a responsibility to ensure that we can manage the process, and that it would be wrong to close the door on any possibility of something in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.967.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman raises two points. Let me deal with the second one first, as there has been some comment about a proposal that a major bank made to the Government, the Bank and the FSA at the end of August. There was no firm proposal on the table, but, as the FSA chairman has said, an exploratory inquiry was made as to whether the Bank would be prepared to lend the institution in question about &pound;30 billion at commercial rates. It was explained that there were three problems with that. First, neither the Bank nor the Government normally provides commercial lending in this way to a going concern, which is what that financial institution was. The second problem was that if we were to entertain such an option we would have had to ask other banks whether they would be willing to enter into a similar arrangement, perhaps involving less Government money. As the right hon. Gentleman will recognise, the Government cannot just, in effect, lend &pound;30 billion to a bank without there being some sort of due process to allow others to see whether they could do something more competitively. I would have been open to severe criticism if I had done that. The third problem was that, on any view, this would have been state aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/2">As it happened, having made the preliminary inquiry the institution never pursued the matter. The proposal was made on a Saturday and the institution withdrew its interest in Northern Rock on Monday. Therefore, it was never the case that there was a proposal on the table that was there to be considered and accepted or rejected. There was a preliminary inquiry, and I have explained what the difficulties were. However, as I have also said to the House, and to the Treasury Committee, I have always taken the view that had it been possible for Northern Rock to have been acquired prior to all these difficulties, that would have been the best solution. I must also say to the right hon. Gentleman&mdash;I apologise to the House for taking up so much time in dealing with this, but it is important&mdash;that we should remember that that approach was made before anybody in the outside world knew there was a problem with Northern Rock. For us to have then started a competition as to which bank might take it over might have drawn attention to the very problems we are concerned about.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/3">Let me now deal with the other part of the right hon. Gentleman's question. I will be able to tell the House about the terms of repayment once it is clear what course of action is best for Northern Rock and the public interest, as I have set out. It is not possible to do that until we have a proposal that is properly assessed and worked out. On the right hon. Gentleman's point about the general Bank of England question, I explained the position in my statement.</p>

We have never said that everything would stop at the end of February and could not possibly continue. Surely the best thing to do to secure the best possible repayment of the loan made by the Bank of England is to assess the proposals being worked up and then decide on the appropriate rate and timing of repayment. To box ourselves in now and exclude options without having properly considered them would be the wrong thing to do.</p>

For the sake of the Treasury Committee's inquiry, will he tell us in what order he places those objectives? May I remind him about Friday's statement from Northern Rock, which was put out late in the evening and did nothing to bring credibility or focus to this issue. Will he impress upon Bryan Sanderson, its chairman, that there is no case for a payout for its chief executive, Adam Applegarth? Suspicious minds would consider that he is staying on until February so that it is reported in the spring 2009 annual reports, when this will have been swept under the carpet. Credibility is important in negotiations over the next few months. Will the Chancellor ensure that that credibility is injected into this company?</p>

	<p pid="b.969.0/1">I am sure that Bryan Sanderson will have heard what my right hon. Friend has had to say. It is important, especially given the position that Northern Rock is in at the moment, that whatever it does, it must ask itself whether that is the right thing to do. In answer to his question about the three principles that I set out&mdash;to protect taxpayers, to promote financial stability and to protect depositors&mdash;they are all equally important. For the avoidance of doubt, both inside this House and out, ensuring that we safeguard the taxpayer's interest is very important, but the other principles are important too.</p>

	<p pid="b.969.1/1">The Chancellor said in a previous answer that the facility would be reviewed at the end of February. Today's Treasury press release was headed:</p>

I wish to remind him, as many of my colleagues from the north-east have done, of the employment considerations.

One thing that we should not lose sight of is the root causes of the problem: Northern Rock had a business model predicated on its being able to get very large sums of money from the financial markets, which simply dried up so that it could no longer get those sums. The FSA accepts that it should have looked at that situation.

	<p pid="b.976.3/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">We have a rare treat today&mdash;a Treasury double-header, as Sky Sports might say. The Bill implements the decisions agreed at the December 2005 European Council under the UK presidency and gives effect to the new own resources decision for the financial perspective from 2007 to 2013. That agreement was in our long-term national interest. It is good for Britain and good for Europe, and today I shall explain why. It is good for Britain because it not only preserves our rebate but will see it rise in value during the next six years. It is good for Europe because it provides investment to help the emerging economies of eastern Europe prosper, which in turn and in time will benefit our own economy, as have all previous EU enlargements. The Bill will help to pay for European enlargement.</p>

	<p pid="b.976.7/1">I will come to the changes implemented by the decision, but the point that I was about to make when the hon. Gentleman intervened is that it is not enough for the Conservative party to say that it is a supporter of European enlargement; it is not enough to support the end goal without taking the sometimes difficult decisions that will allow that goal to be met. It is simply not good enough to flinch from decisions on the issues that stand in the way of making EU enlargement a success. I shall return to his precise point and make the positive case throughout my remarks.</p>

	<p pid="b.977.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has raised a range of points that I will address in the substance of my remarks. As I have said, I want to make a positive case for what Britain agreed in 2005. That agreement brought Britain and France into rough parity on net contributions to the European Union. The Government made a clear request for a review of the European budget as part of that agreement, which we secured. We can address all the hon. Gentleman's points.</p>
	<p pid="b.977.0/2">Today, I expect to hear variations on the refrain that what is good for Europe cannot possibly be good for Britain and that Europe's interests and Britain's interests are essentially incompatible, and I intend to meet that argument head-on. The Government reject that isolationist and negative thinking, although we do not uncritically accept everything that Europe says. The deal secured by the Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is &euro;160 billion cheaper than the original proposals from the European Commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.977.2/1">I will come on to that point in my remarks, if the hon. Gentleman will hold his horses. I ask him head-on whether, if he supports the EU, he supports enlargement. If so, will he accept that a contribution should be made by this country to the cost of enlargement? As English regions improve their competitiveness, as I am pleased to say Merseyside has recently done, is it not right that the available funds should go to support the regions of Europe that most need that extra investment?</p>

	<p pid="b.977.3/1">The Chief Secretary is right that it is important that the parts of Europe that need structural funds receive them. Cornwall, in which my constituency is situated, will continue to receive those funds. Does he agree that the funding available is also based on the amount of match funding available from the Government? It is unfortunate that the Government are not match funding at similar levels to those achieved on objective 1 funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.977.4/1">The hon. Lady is right on that strict technical point. I hope that she accepts that Cornwall will continue to benefit from structural and cohesion funding. To pick up <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the point made by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>, funds will continue to be available to the less well-developed regions of Britain. Merseyside has recently improved its competitiveness, but challenges remain in Cornwall and, I believe, the western highlands. Parts of this country will still benefit substantially from funding to improve their competitiveness.</p>

	<p pid="b.978.0/1">Many of us are and always have been in favour of expansion and of contributing money to the new accession countries, but why is France the biggest recipient of funding from the EU budget?

	<p pid="b.978.1/1">My hon. Friend knows my background, and I do not agree with him at all. Indeed, it is possible to argue that in this financial perspective we make ground on the traditional complaint aired by many Eurosceptics over the years. I am comfortable with the deal. I come back to where I started: the deal is good for Britain and shows that Britain is a middle-ranking net contributor among the wealthier nations.</p>

	<p pid="b.978.2/1">If the Minister cares to read page 32 of the excellent paper prepared by the Library for this debate, he will see in the final column on net contributions for 2006, which is before the next budgetary round kicks in, that France made a net contribution of &euro;3,140 million and the UK made one of &euro;4,086 million. France is therefore up with the UK and Germany as a major net contributor. I am afraid that the notion that France is a net recipient is 20th century truth, but 21st century mythology.</p>

	<p pid="b.978.3/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely correct: France is a net contributor, as is this country. As I have just said, France's contributions will grow twice as fast in this financial perspective&mdash;as, incidentally, will Italy's. That is why I come back to the point that the agreement is good for this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.978.3/2">Let me give an indication of the net contributions that we will make. Table B11 of the pre-Budget report document shows that the estimates for the net expenditure transfers to EC institutions are &pound;5.6 billion for 2007-08, &pound;5.5 billion for 2008-09 and &pound;5.7 billion for 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="b.978.4/1">The Minister has mentioned France's and Italy's net contributions. In the interests of transparency, will he give a commitment to the House to publish official Treasury estimates of the net contributions of all member states? My understanding is that, to date, the Treasury has officially published only an estimate of the French net contribution.</p>

	<p pid="b.978.5/1">I should say to the hon. Gentleman&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]</i> If he holds his horses, I shall give him his answer. It is not common practice for one EU state to publish details about others in a haphazard and cherry-picking way; the Commission makes those figures available. I have said clearly this afternoon that, on the basis of figures in the public domain, Britain's net contributions will be in rough parity with those of the French. I hope that he is satisfied with that answer.</p>

Even if one accepted the Minister's argument, one would still have to ask how on earth he can say that it is in British taxpayers' interests to keep giving more and more money to a body open to so much fraud and whose accounts the auditors will not sign off. Is there, anywhere in the world, any other organisation whose accounts have not been signed off by auditors, but to which the Treasury would agree to keep giving more and more money?</p>

Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase>? &quot;Misled&quot; is perhaps overdoing it, but they inadvertently got their figures a little muddled. The figures on net contributions per head, which are of extreme interest to individual members of the electorate, produce a quite different answer from that proposed by the right hon. Member for Rotherham. In the United Kingdom, we pay &euro;124 per head, which is the third most. Denmark pays the second most, with &euro;127, and the Netherlands pays the most&mdash;&euro;241. Germany's net contribution per head is only &euro;100, while France pays only &euro;50. Does not that rather blow his argument out of the water?</p>

Britain benefits from being part of an open, prosperous Europe of 500 million people.

First, the Bill and the agreement that it implements will preserve the British rebate in full on all spending on the EU15 and on all agricultural spending on the EU27, irrespective of their accession dates. The abatement has the same basis as it did at its inception at Fontainebleau in 1984. The rebate will be disapplied only on non-agricultural expenditure, which primarily supports economic development in the member states that have joined the Union since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April 2004</phrase>.</p>

As the former Prime Minister told the House, overall the abatement will get us back around &euro;41 billion in this budget period, which is more than in the last one. Thirdly, the agreement will see sensible, restrained growth in the overall budget. The latest forecasts are that the budget will fall below 1 per cent. of EU gross national income in commitment terms by the end of the financial perspective. Overall, the budget will grow by just 7 per cent. across the financial perspective, as compared with growth of 17 per cent. in 1988 and 22 per cent. in 1994. I wonder which Government negotiated those EU budgets.</p>

	<p pid="b.982.5/1">May I clarify one point with the Minister? He says that our rebate is going up, but will he confirm that the rebate is a percentage of the difference between what we pay in and what we receive back? If the rebate is rising, the gap between what we pay in and what we receive is also rising. Rather than being enthusiastic about the rebate rising, we should look for it to fall, so that our gap falls, too. Surely that is the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.982.6/1">My hon. Friend is correct that that is how the rebate is calculated. Indeed, the first line of article 4 of the Council decision on own resources says:</p>
	<p pid="b.982.6/2" class="indent">&quot;The United Kingdom shall be granted a correction in respect of budgetary imbalances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.982.6/3">Those on the Opposition Benches who claim that the rebate has been lost in the decision simply have not read the own resources decision. My hon. Friend's point about the gap is correct, but that is because there is a disapplication of the rebate on economic and structural spending in the new member states, as I have explained. With those countries having been welcomed into Europe, our judgment is that the right thing to do morally is equip them to compete competitively. If we did not do that, we would be in breach of our responsibilities as a full member of the European Union. That explains the gap to which my hon. Friend has drawn the attention of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.982.6/4">Let me put on record more facts about the Bill. Fourthly, in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)</phrase>, the UK's contribution is forecast to rise on average by 3 per cent. in real terms from 2007 to 2013. Fifthly, in answer to my hon. Friend's question a moment ago, new member states will receive &euro;158 billion in structural and cohesion funds in this financial perspective&mdash;a 250 per cent. increase on the previous financial perspective period. The share of new member states' receipts will rise from 24 per cent. of the total to 56 per cent. in 2013. Lastly, because of the shift in spending from west to east, all wealthier nations will see their net contributions rise, some by more than others. In this financial perspective, French and UK net contributions will be in rough parity, with French and Italian contributions rising twice as fast as ours.</p>

	<p pid="b.983.0/1">If we cut to the chase, are there not two key questions? One is: is the United Kingdom a member of the European Union or not? It is a club and there is a price to pay for belonging to a club, and I think that the price is well worth paying. The second question, the answer to which ought to be clear on the Labour Benches at least, is: are we in favour of redistribution of wealth? We certainly are on these Benches, particularly with regard to the Government's magnificent record both in international development and within the European Union, with redistribution of wealth from the west to the east, so that ultimately we will all be richer. So I have two questions: are we in or are we out, and are we in favour of redistribution of wealth?</p>

Friend has tempted me to give a non-new Labour answer to the second question, so perhaps a fudge is in order&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i> I am joking, of course. He has made his point incredibly well. Let us cut to the chase, as he suggested. We support making a contribution to help the countries of eastern Europe to prosper. That is the crux of this debate. That is the difference. Let me get to that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.1/2">The Leader of the Opposition said in a speech in March this year:</p>

But the work is not yet done.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.983.1/4">He is right; the work is far from done. The economies and infrastructure of the new EU member states need considerable investment and support before those states will be able to compete in the market on an equal footing, and that process of regeneration is now just beginning in earnest. The Leader of the Opposition is the self-styled champion of those countries, but what kind of champion does the easy bit, providing the fine words, but then looks shiftily away when asked to back up those words with real financial commitments from the wealthier, established EU nations? The countries of eastern Europe need real champions who are prepared to step up to the plate, not fair-weather friends whose words are worth nothing at all.</p>

	<p pid="b.984.0/1">I feel very cross with the Minister for suggesting that we do not want to help the eastern European countries. My grandfather came to this country from eastern Europe during the war, and we on the Opposition side of the House feel passionately about those countries. Our problem is that we do not expect the United Kingdom to have to stump up all the cash; France, Germany and the others should do so as well. The Minister's comments are outrageous.</p>

As we have seen with previous EU enlargements, there may have been an immediate increase in the number of people using their ability to move around Europe, but in the long term people are more likely to return to their country of origin, particularly if that country is experiencing economic development and prosperity.

I want to make it clear that I do not believe that he is one of the bad boys, but I do think he is a bit of a rascal in seeking to polarise the debate by suggesting that anyone who has any reservations about any negotiated settlement is necessarily in favour of withdrawing altogether or of giving nothing to eastern Europe. That is most certainly not the position of Labour Members who have reservations. Surely the Minister would accept that we have made virtually no progress in reforming the CAP during this settlement and that although the submission of additional money for eastern Europe is welcome, it does not necessarily go to the right people there. It is almost entirely devoted to channelling the common agricultural policy, which, certainly in this country, helps the undeserving rich rather than the deserving poor&mdash;so will the Minister resign?</p>

	<p pid="b.986.1/1">Thanks very much! I know that my hon. Friend is feeling bad because Scotland lost at the weekend, but that is no reason for him to take his nastiness and resentment out on me. This financial perspective does include reform of the CAP. I do not have the precise figures to hand, but it drops reasonably significantly as an overall percentage of the budget and member states are being asked voluntarily to shift spending away from simple direct support into helping improve the sustainability of local rural economies. So, yes, there is reform. If my hon. Friend is asking me whether that is enough, I would have to say no. We want more reform of the common agricultural policy. That is the very clear position of the British Government and we believe that we have secured the means&mdash;through the review of the process&mdash;to achieve it. It is not perfection. I am not arguing that the EU budget and the recently agreed own resources decision represent perfection. We have made progress and continue to do so, because that benefits us all.</p>

However, does the Chief Secretary accept that we have to recognise that if we did not have the CAP that would probably mean that the French would give money to French farms and the Polish to Polish farms and that the amount of subsidy would increase rather than decrease?

	<p pid="b.988.0/1">The Chief Secretary said earlier that giving more money to countries in eastern European would benefit British business. Local businesses in West Yorkshire want more money for local infrastructure to help transport. The Government cannot afford to give it. According to them, it is all about spending priorities. Is the right hon. Gentleman genuinely trying to argue that businesses in West Yorkshire will benefit more from building up the infrastructure in eastern Europe than from doing that in West Yorkshire?</p>

	<p pid="b.988.1/1">The hon. Gentleman betrays alarming ignorance of those matters. Businesses in West Yorkshire have benefited over the years from European structural and cohesion funding. I am now looking at details of programmes throughout Yorkshire that support the growth and competitiveness of the region. Why does not he recognise and celebrate that rather than trying at every opportunity to whip up anti-European feeling?</p>
	<p pid="b.988.1/2">It is in our national interest for our net contribution as a percentage of national income to be roughly equal to that of France and less than that of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. That confirms Britain as a middle-ranking net contributor among the wealthier nations. It also fulfils our long-standing commitment to budget discipline. In 1994, a budget of 1.2 per cent. of EU gross national income was agreed. In the current financial perspective, the budget will be less than 1 per cent. of EU GNI, which is nearly 20 per cent. lower. That represents a saving of &euro;160 billion compared with the Commission's original proposal. For the first time, CAP spending will not be the largest item of expenditure in the EU budget. Instead, it will be sustainable growth. The budget is disciplined, with a fair contribution from Britain, which preserves our abatement. The Bill will secure our national interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.988.1/3">However, there is a bigger picture to consider. It is emphatically in Britain's long-term interest to provide for the fair financing and enlargement of the European Union. We thus bring British business immediate market opportunities and secure Europe's long-term competitiveness. Achieving a fair deal was the challenge that faced the UK presidency in 2005, but we met it. It means that new member states will experience a 250 per cent. increase in structural funding on the previous financing period.</p>
	<p pid="b.988.1/4">Britain has been a strong supporter of enlargement and we are proud of the part that we played. That enlargement has made a huge contribution to establishing our central and eastern European partners as the free democracies and vibrant economies that they are today. It is right that we should stand by them and that they should not be denied the economic investment that has benefited Britain and other parts of western Europe so much. As I said earlier, it is also firmly in our interest. Allowing our partners in central and eastern Europe to grow and develop strengthens them and strengthens Europe, making us all more secure. A more developed Europe will be better able to meet the common challenges that we face, such as climate change and security. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I can hear Conservative Members chuntering. We have heard about attempts by the Leader of the Opposition to form a new political party in the European Parliament&mdash;the grandly named Movement for European Reform. It sounds good, but the problem is that there is neither much European nor a great deal of movement about it. So far they have recruited the Czech ODS party and, to fanfare earlier this year, the Bulgarian Union of Democratic Forces party. There has, however, been a slight setback. On <phrase class="date" code="">14 September</phrase>, the president of the European People's party, Wilfred Martens, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.988.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Six months ago, I said that it is not compatible for a member party of the EPP to join initiatives like this 'movement' and at the same time remain in our party. Today I am glad that the UDF understands and shares our position&quot;.</p>

Friends' efforts to woo partners from eastern Europe, that their failure to back our commitment, and to put up real resource to support the commitment to enlargement, means that nobody wants to join this new Movement for European Reform. They are on their own in Europe. All the western European economies have agreed to make this contribution to improve the competitiveness of eastern Europe. The Conservatives are completely isolated.</p>

	<p pid="b.990.2/1">I cannot make myself any clearer to the hon. Gentleman than I already have. I told him at the beginning that the value of the rebate rises in this financial perspective. I have also told him that Britain receives immediate economic benefits from increased trade with the new member states, and will in time receive even greater economic benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.990.2/2">It is possible that people in those new member states listen to these debates. They will note the position taken by the British Conservative party, and they will hear those words about having always championed enlargement. What are they to conclude when the hon. Gentleman and other Conservative Members argue against the funding that will make an enlarged European Union more prosperous, and stand in the way of all the progress that they claim to want?</p>

	<p pid="b.990.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is now raising spurious points. I think I owe it to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.990.4/2">Overall, the single European market has created an additional 2.75 million jobs across the EU in the 15 years since it was established, and increased gross domestic product by 2.2 per cent. or &euro;225 billion. Enlargement is strengthening and widening that single market: it is now half a billion consumers strong, and the largest market in the world. That helps our partners to grow, and helps make Europe more prosperous. It is not to our cost, but to our benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.990.4/3">Let us look at the facts of earlier enlargements. After the 1986 enlargement, United Kingdom exports to Spain increased by a quarter. After 1995, exports to Sweden rose by a similar amount. The benefits that EU membership can have are demonstrated by the fact that since our closest neighbour, the Republic of Ireland, joined the EU it has received almost &euro;53.5 billion from the EU budget. Between 1993 and 2003, the EU supported more than 120 major infrastructure projects. That has helped Ireland's exports rise from &euro;1.1 billion in 1973 to &euro;88.4 billion by 2005. In 2003, gross national product per capita was more than three times its 1973 level in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.990.4/4">Ireland also demonstrates that the economic development of our partners is good for Britain, a point entirely lost on Conservative Members. It increases trade, and creates new opportunities and new jobs. Between 1998 and 2006 alone, UK exports to Ireland have doubled. Such development has particularly benefited Merseyside, which is one of this country's poorest regions and receives objective 1 funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.990.4/5">The Conservative party's claim that the Bill secures us nothing in return is self-centred and narrow-minded, but also wrong. As I have said, the Bill will disapply structural and cohesion funding, and in time that spending will benefit Britain. Just as development funding in Ireland helped Britain to increase trade from a buoyant Irish economy, we will gain the long-term benefits of a prosperous eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.990.4/6">Already British firms are making the most of the opportunities that the recent accessions have brought. In 2006, UK exports to the A8 countries amounted to &pound;8.8 billion, a 36 per cent. increase in the first full year after accession. Tesco, Unilever, Vodafone, BP and International Power are already investing in our new single-market partners, and UK foreign direct investment in the A8, which averaged just over &pound;860 million in the three years before accession, was more than twice that amount&mdash;nearly &pound;2 billion&mdash;in 2005, the year after accession. Enlargement is good for those economies, and provides economic opportunities for our largest companies.</p>

	<p pid="b.991.0/1">I think that my right hon. Friend is being a little unfair to the Conservative party. After all, widening rather than deepening was John Major's policy, and he was absolutely right in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.991.0/2">I believe that some Conservative Members recognise that the enlargement of the European Union is good for the UK economy. What they do not understand are negotiations. I spent a great deal of my professional life negotiating in business, in the private sector, and I know that if one obtains all that one wants in negotiations with a partner with whom one frequently negotiates, that partner will get back at one next time. The Conservatives do not understand that there is wave upon wave of negotiations in an entity such as the European Union, and that if one pushes too hard for something on one occasion, one will not obtain it on the next. They do not understand the need to play it for the long term.</p>

	<p pid="b.992.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and what we have witnessed this afternoon provides ample illustration of the very point he makes. Conservative Members will make knee-jerk statements to please the newspapers and party members in their constituencies. They will come out with such rhetoric because they know it will be good for their personal standing within their local Conservative party when they next return to their constituency for a meeting&mdash;they will probably pass around the relevant volume of <i> Hansard</i>. What that does not do, however, is show any understanding of proper negotiation in Europe&mdash;of how to get a good deal for Britain and be a constructively engaged partner in EU discussions.

	<p pid="b.992.5/1">Interestingly, on that last point, in fact I was not; I am happy to put that on the record today.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.5/2">I say to my hon. Friend that I am just making a positive case for Europe and for our engagement in it. Opposition Members might think that someone such as me might be defensive on these matters, but that is not the case at all. I have come to the Chamber today to say that the deal was not perfect in every respect but it serves our interests and moves us forward, and it moves the EU forward. I am quite happy and comfortable to be standing at the Dispatch Box making that case.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.5/3">There are wider economic benefits. Migration from central and eastern Europe is much discussed and I recognise the challenges it poses to some of our communities, but there are indisputable benefits to British business and the British economy. A8 migration contributed about &pound;6 billion a year to the British economy between autumn 2001 and the middle of last year, and those workers from central and eastern Europe who have come to Britain taking advantage of the free movement of labour are likely to make a stronger net contribution to public finances. The Bank of England reported last year that overseas workers have played a significant role in boosting the pool of available labour and helping to ease labour shortages. Britain is experiencing direct and immediate benefits in increased trade, extra jobs and the benefits of migration from enlargement&mdash;a process that the December 2005 agreement consolidates.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.5/4">Britain has also benefited, and will continue to do so, from structural and cohesion funding. Between 2000 and 2006, the UK received about &euro;15 billion of those funds, going to projects that benefit constituencies in all parts of the country. That has contributed to the economic development of some of our poorest regions. Merseyside alone has received more than &pound;300 million of European social fund investment, and Cornwall has also received a significant sum&mdash;the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne mentioned that. UK regions that still need funding will continue to receive it&mdash;to answer a point made by the hon. Member for Stone, who has now left his place&mdash;but as areas such as Merseyside grow stronger it is right that the focus switches to the poorest EU regions, particularly the new member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.5/5">Before I conclude, may I turn to the budget review and the future of Europe? The figures I have been quoting this afternoon support the case that we need to be even more hard-headed in prioritising funding towards the future challenges that Europe faces collectively, if it is to secure value for money. As well as the benefits I have already outlined, we have secured a frank and honest process of challenge and review of the EU budget to ensure that Europe is helping to equip itself to face the challenges of the future. As the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary set out in the recent &quot;Global Europe&quot; pamphlet, the EU has spent too long focused on institutional questions. Europe needs to move on from that debate and focus on the issues that matter to its citizens: competitiveness; jobs; migration; the environment; and security. It needs to meet the challenges of globalisation and play its full part in the wider world, and to do that, its budget needs reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.5/6">Some change has been made, as I said to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase>, but he is correct in saying that too much expenditure&mdash;40 per cent.&mdash;still goes on the common agricultural policy, and more than 50 per cent. of economic investment spending continues to go to the richer member states. Without reform, the EU cannot meet its future challenges and we will not see the global Europe that we need. So it is clearly in Britain's interest&mdash;and in Europe's&mdash;that the budget is reformed. The fact that the agreement that this Bill implements provides for a review of the budget, including the CAP, is the third reason why the Bill will implement a good agreement for Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.5/7">As part of the budget review, the Government will work with their partners to make the case for a reorientation of the budget towards areas such as innovation, tackling climate change, international development and migration. That does not mean any lessening of our commitment to budget discipline&mdash;far from it&mdash;and spending resources effectively will remain at the heart of our approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.5/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">The hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> enticed me earlier into talking about the European Court of Auditors' report, and I told him plainly that much more progress must be made in this area. In addition to the measures that we have championed over recent years, such as the establishment of the European Anti-Fraud Office, former Commissioner Kinnock's work on Commission reform, the shift to activity-based budgeting and accruals accounting, and the Commission's 2006 action plan following the UK presidency's work, we will go further. We have made proposals for increased national parliamentary scrutiny of EU funds through the publication of an annual consolidated statement of EU expenditure, prepared to international accounting standards and audited by the National Audit Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.994.2/1">I am grateful for that round of applause from Conservative Members. Surely the important point about the auditors' figures is that nearly all the problem areas involve member states' expenditure rather than the Commission's.

The EU has made Europe and Britain more secure and more prosperous. On this side of the House, we are pro-European, but we are not uncritical and we are hard-headed.

	<p pid="b.995.5/1">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Would it be in order for me to move a vote of thanks to the comrade Minister, on the basis that, while still partially deluded, he has been generous in taking interventions?</p>

	<p pid="b.995.7/1">This is a very small Bill, with one operative clause, although after the Chief Secretary's speech I am grateful that it does not have 30 clauses. That one operative clause contains, however, the single biggest spending commitment in the whole of the Government's legislative programme. It is a &pound;7.4 billion bill, addressed to the British taxpayer, and an hour and six minutes of obfuscation from the Chief Secretary has not changed that.</p>
	<p pid="b.995.7/2">This is a stealth Bill, sneaked in without a mention in the Queen's Speech and completely ignored in the Prime Minister's speech in the debate that followed. Far from being something of which the Government are proud, it is a Bill that dare not speak its name. The Prime Minister has done with this Bill exactly what he always does with bad news: he has tried to slip it in under the radar in the hope that nobody will notice it.</p>
	<p pid="b.995.7/3">It is in order to congratulate the Chief Secretary, who made a valiant attempt to defend the completely indefensible. He gave a fair impression of a man who has been living in a complete vacuum since 1999. He stood here and told us that the own resources decision that the Bill will implement is a great victory for Britain, despite the fact that his own Government told us for years&mdash;until they gave way in December 2005&mdash;that they would fight tooth and nail to avoid that. The Government are not proud of the Bill, and neither should they be. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that the Chancellor is not in his place to support the Chief Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="b.995.7/4">The agreement that the Bill implements is a bad deal for Britain, and the Chief Secretary knows it. We know it, too, because when the former Prime Minister signed away Britain's rebate, the current Prime Minister briefed every journalist he could find that it was a bad deal, that it was all Tony Blair's doing and that he would never have agreed to it. A Treasury official put it this way at the time:</p>
	<p pid="b.995.7/5" class="indent">&quot;We have ended up giving away much more than we expected and with precious little to show for it in return&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.995.7/6">A senior aide to the then Chancellor&mdash;no prizes for guessing who&mdash;told the press that the sell-out would inevitably lead to public spending cuts. No wonder the Government want to get this Bill out of the way at the very beginning of the Session with as little noise as possible. It is an embarrassment and reminds us again of some of this Government's serial failings, such as duplicity, in repeatedly breaking their promises on Europe; incompetence, in failing to obtain anything in return for our money at the negotiating table; and fiscal incontinence, in throwing away yet more hard-earned taxpayers' money for nothing in return.</p>

	<p pid="b.996.0/1">Clearly, the hon. Gentleman does not like this deal, but, as he knows, in negotiating a different one he would have to persuade other countries to sign up to it. Can he name just one other country, or party, in Europe that would support his proposals? Secondly, if there is a Conservative Government, will they renege on the measure if it has already gone through Parliament?</p>

	<p pid="b.997.3/1">I do not want to fall into the same trap as the Chief Secretary and extend my remarks beyond an hour, so I will give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.997.3/2">The Chief Secretary said that giving away the rebate was the right thing to do. It was all so different back in 1999, when the then Prime Minister said that the rebate was non-negotiable. He maintained that position as late as June 2005, when he reiterated it to the House of Commons in ringing tones:</p>
	<p pid="b.997.3/3" class="indent">&quot;The UK rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away. Period.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 434, c. 1234.]</p>
	<p pid="b.997.3/4">His then Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, took the same view. When asked in an interview whether the rebate was non-negotiable, he replied simply, &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.997.3/5">I remember the then Prime Minister's statement in the Chamber&mdash;I was sitting at the end of the Opposition Front Bench&mdash;and thinking that the commitment he had made was so clear and unequivocal that even he could not possibly wriggle out of it. I should, of course, have known better. Within two weeks, we had a West-style 180<sup>(o)</sup> clarification of those words, when he said that the rebate was</p>
	<p pid="b.997.3/6" class="indent">&quot;an anomaly that has to go&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.997.3/7">Perhaps we should all have realised that he had been trying to say that in the first place. There was a further &quot;clarification&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="">29 June</phrase>, when, attempting to defend his volte face, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.997.3/8" class="indent">&quot;Of course, if we get rid of the common agricultural policy and we change the reason why the rebate is there, the case for the rebate changes.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-29">29 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 1293.]</p>
	<p pid="b.997.3/9">That is not exactly &quot;the rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it&quot;, but it is a perfectly respectable negotiating position and one that we made it clear we could support. Radical reform of the CAP in exchange for a corresponding reduction in the British rebate would provide a satisfactory outcome for the UK taxpayer and at the same time move the EU from the disastrous agricultural protectionism that damages consumers and developing economies alike, and which the Prime Minister described as a prerequisite for making poverty history.</p>

	<p pid="b.997.4/1">I realise that I spoke for a long time, but if the hon. Gentleman believes that the deal gives away too much&mdash;even though, as I said, Britain as a net contributor will be in rough parity with France and the middle-ranking wealthier nations&mdash;will he say how much the Conservative party would be prepared to pay to support economic development in eastern Europe? Anything? Between the amount the Bill implements and nothing? How much exactly would it be?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.997.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="997"  time="017:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0010.htm#07111925000201">
	<p pid="b.997.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman completely misses the point of the debate, which is the own resources decision&mdash;the contributions of individual member states to the agreed disbursement budget. Nobody suggests that as a result of the Bill the amount disbursed under the EU budget will change, although if we chose not to support the Bill the composition of the contributions would change. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that under this proposal the UK will contribute an additional &pound;19 billion net over the next seven years. If the rebate had not been given away we would still contribute an extra &pound;12 billion over that period. There is, rightly and properly, an increased contribution to pay for the increase in the size of the Union&mdash;the price of enlargement.</p>
	<p pid="b.997.5/2">I shall continue with my narrative, if I may. The Prime Minister went off with his team to Brussels with clear objectives: first, to cap the budget at 1 per cent. of European Union gross national income; secondly, to shift the focus of EU spending from agriculture, with the ultimate objective of scrapping the common agricultural policy; and, thirdly, to keep the British rebate unless and until that reform was complete. So how did they do? They failed on every single one. The budget that this lot signed up to added more than &pound;25 billion of extra spending. The Prime Minister claimed after the event that that reflected the cost of enlargement, but without reform, Ireland, whose per capita GDP is 30 per cent. higher than the EU average, is getting more per head than Lithuania, Slovakia or Poland. France will remain the EU's biggest recipient and the UK the lowest net recipient per capita.</p>

	<p pid="b.998.0/1">The hon. Gentleman feels that the Government did not drive a hard enough bargain, but let us talk real politics, not fantasy politics. What tactics does his party have that he believes would have achieved agreements from some other EU member states that were not achieved by this Government? I and my party have talked to colleagues from our sister parties in&mdash;I am talking personally now&mdash;Spain, France, Germany and Greece to explain why we want changes to the common agricultural policy and other things. What sister parties could the hon. Gentleman speak to? Why does he think that the Conservative party could drive a better bargain than our Labour Government?</p>

	<p pid="b.999.2/2">Far from scrapping the common agricultural policy, the Government agreed to an increase in its budget in every year to the 2013 horizon. In fact, it emerged later that, despite the rhetoric, the UK Government did not table specific proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy during the negotiations. What they did achieve was a review, which, surreally, will be conducted during the French presidency of the Union, so I advise my right hon. and hon. Friends not to hold their breath. We can only speculate on the hilarity that will have been occasioned on the Quai d'Orsay by this display of British negotiating prowess.</p>
	<p pid="b.999.2/3">The UK team came back with no 1 per cent. cap on the budget and no reform, let alone scrapping, of the CAP. In accordance with the Prime Minister's formula, that meant no surrender of the British rebate, right? I am afraid that that was wrong. They returned not only empty-handed but with a pledge to send more bounty, in the form of a &pound;7.4 billion reduction over the years 2008 to 2013 in the rebate that would have been payable to the United Kingdom were the own resources decision not to be implemented in UK legislation.</p>

The agreement has nothing to do with agricultural spend. It has to do with the own resources decision&mdash;the contribution made by individual members. That is what the Bill will implement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1000.1/1">The hon. Gentleman criticises me for not doing my homework, but that is far from the case. Does he accept that the two matters are obviously linked? It is extremely important that we consider both sides of the bargain. He is continuing to evade the point. He does not want to recognise an enormously important achievement&mdash;that the weighting of agriculture in total EU spending has been reduced as part of the package. Why does he not recognise the facts when they happen to be in favour of the Government rather than of his own party?</p>

	<p pid="b.1000.2/1">The hon. Gentleman refers to the link or otherwise between the spending decision and the own resources decision. I shall come to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000.2/2">To return to the result from Brussels, the limit on the cost to the UK of the reduced rebate will end in 2013. Failure to reach agreement on a budget for the period after 2013 would have a devastating effect on the UK contribution, because the rebate reduction would become uncapped. We would have no effective veto, and thus no negotiating power, during negotiations on the EU budget for the period from 2013&mdash;and our partners in Europe would know it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000.2/3">There is one further twist to the tale. The Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, put it about that he was against the deal. When it was announced, the Treasury pointedly refused to endorse it and denied all responsibility, because it was worried that the deal would force future spending cuts. According to the Treasury briefing, the current Prime Minister was &quot;quietly fuming&quot;. What did he do? This April, it became known that having failed to claw back some of the rebate through negotiation, he too had caved in and agreed to accept the original deal&mdash;the deal that he had previously condemned. So much for his powers of persuasion on the international stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000.2/4">That is the sorry tale behind the Bill, although, of course, that could never be discerned from reading it. We, the Parliament of the United Kingdom, whose responsibility is to our electorate and our UK taxpayers, are invited to give the Bill a Second Reading, thus giving effect to what was done&mdash;in our name, but in complete contradiction of everything promised to us in this House&mdash;at Brussels in December 2005. If we do so, by 2010 the UK taxpayer will be footing the bill for an extra &pound;1.9 billion a year&mdash;a sum roughly equivalent, fittingly enough, to the total Foreign Office budget&mdash;as a result of the sell-out on the rebate. That is in addition to the increase in the UK contribution to the underlying budget&mdash;&pound;1.5 billion a year on average for the period 2007 to 2013&mdash;to deal with the cost of enlargement. Taking into account the loss of the UK rebate, which will increase our share of total EU costs, and the growth in the budget during that period, the UK's net contribution will more than double, from &pound;2.8 billion a year on average under the previous financial perspective to an estimated &pound;7.3 billion in 2013.</p>

	<p pid="b.1001.0/1">May I tempt my hon. Friend to speculate about why we caved in on the rebate? Given that it was non-negotiable and that there has been no meaningful reform of the common agricultural policy, does he think that there is a connection between our sudden cave-in and the recent statement by the French that they thought Tony Blair would make an excellent President of the EU?</p>

	<p pid="b.1001.1/1">That is an extraordinarily interesting piece of speculation better made from the Back Benches than from the Dispatch Box. I leave my right hon. and hon. Friends to draw their own conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1001.1/2">The choice before the House when the Question is put this evening will be whether to endorse or reject the sell-out of the British rebate. It is not about the overall EU budget or the financing of enlargement, which the Government have tried to spin; it is about the division of the total budget cost into individual contributions. It is about whether we are prepared to throw away the hard-won victory of 1984.</p>

	<p pid="b.1001.2/1">The hon. Gentleman keeps making that point, but he is completely confused. The 2007 to 2013 budget and the own resources decision that determines how that budget will be financed are inseparable; they are part of a package. If he reads the own resources decision, he will see that it sets out a schedule for how the payments will be calculated and indeed how the British rebate is to be calculated. How on earth can he continue to make the point that the two things are not part of the same issue?</p>

	<p pid="b.1001.3/1">The calculation of the amended rebate is a purely mechanical process to give effect to the political decision made in Brussels. If the Chief Secretary looks at his own Bill and the decision that it implements&mdash;he looks terribly perplexed&mdash;he will see quite clearly that the decision deals with the calculation of own resources, not the overall financial perspective and the total budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.1001.3/2">The question that we must decide tonight is whether we are prepared to throw away the hard-won victory of 1984, which recognised the budget system's unfairness to Britain and enshrined the rebate that we are now being asked to sacrifice&mdash;the rebate, I remind the Chief Secretary, that the former Prime Minister said could not be negotiated unless and until the CAP was scrapped or radically reformed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1001.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is straightforwardly wrong. I have the own resources decision here. Clearly, he has not read it, but article 4 sets out the precise terms by which the UK rebate will be calculated between 2007 and 2013. That is the framework by which the EU budget will be determined in the next financial perspective. <i> [Interruption.] </i>It is part of the package. The two things sit together.</p>

	<p pid="b.1001.5/1">I advise the Chief Secretary to stop digging. He is right that the own resources decision sets out the mechanism by which the British rebate adjustment will be calculated&mdash;of course it does&mdash;but it does not set out the EU budget, which is what he has been spouting on about for most of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1001.5/2">Let me come to the critical point. If we decline to give the Bill a Second Reading, what will happen? Will the roof fall in? Will the sun not rise in the east tomorrow morning? Nothing will happen. Life&mdash;even life in the EU&mdash;will go on exactly as before. The existing own resources decision will continue in force, indefinitely if necessary. The total expenditure budget will not be affected. The only difference will be that member states' contributions will continue to be assessed on the same basis as they were last year and the year before. The UK will remain the EU's second largest net contributor, but we will have &pound;7.4 billion more to spend on British priorities; perhaps we could use it to reverse some of the Government's most recent round of stealth taxes or reduce the &pound;143 billion that the Chancellor plans to borrow in the next five years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1002.1/1">No. As I said to the Chief Secretary, the UK's net contribution will rightly increase substantially, without the change proposed in the Bill, to finance enlargement. The Chief Secretary is trying to have his cake and eat it. He wants to give away our rebate on top of that increase, which we will pay anyway as the EU budget increases.</p>

	<p pid="b.1002.2/1">It is right that our contribution will increase to pay for EU enlargement in eastern Europe. Our contribution is calculated by taking away the value of expenditure and the rebate from the overall gross contribution. The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the situation.

	<p pid="b.1002.3/1">I know that the Treasury operates only a static model. The Chief Secretary would be right if everything else were static, but the budget is increasing. If the Bill is passed tonight, as he knows, our contribution will increase by an element that reflects the surrendered rebate and by another element that reflects the underlying increase in our contribution to the EU budget. If we do not give away the rebate, the UK contribution to the EU budget will still increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1002.3/2">I know that I am damning the Chief Secretary with faint praise, but even he could make a better fist of spending &pound;7.4 billion of British taxpayers' money than the EU. Last week, the European Court of Auditors refused to sign off the EU accounts for the 13th year in a row. The accounts are riddled with material errors and irregularities&mdash;for example, the irregularity that receipts are still not collected for MEPs' expenses, and the material error by which money earmarked for agriculture is spent on golf clubs. That is to say nothing of the &pound;3.8 billion a year that the EU spends on propaganda&mdash;public relations staff, pamphlets, teaching aids, school trips and cartoons. There is the originally named &quot;Captain Euro&quot;, whose mission is apparently to uphold the EU's values&mdash;perhaps he could find time to fight fraud and waste as a sideline.</p>
	<p pid="b.1002.3/3">At a time when many priority areas of public spending are under intense pressure in the UK, how can this Government contemplate giving away &pound;7.4 billion of British taxpayers' money in exchange for absolutely nothing? That money would pay for 45,000 nurses, 37,000 teachers, 42,000 prison places or, if the Chief Secretary prefers this currency, 1.2 million hip replacements. It would also pay for much-needed equipment for our front-line troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1002.3/4">We are used to this Government's casual attitude to public money: &pound;5.7 billion was wasted on tax credit overpayments; &pound;3 billion was spent on nine NHS reorganisations in nine years; and &pound;141 million was wasted on an abandoned Department for Work and Pensions IT programme. We are used to tough rhetoric on Europe followed by craven surrender, and we are used to broken promises: there were broken promises on the referendum; a promise has now been broken on the rebate; and no doubt promises will be broken on the red lines. The Bill is so objectionable, because it embodies all those failures of government in one measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1002.3/5">We were promised that the rebate would be non-negotiable, yet it was surrendered without a fight. The Government talked tough about how they would force the scrapping or at least the radical reform of the CAP, but the CAP will remain untouched. At a time when our public services are feeling the squeeze, when our troops in the front line are short of equipment and when our schools are falling down the world league table, this Government propose casually to chuck away &pound;7.4 billion of our money. By giving away our rebate, which has been worth &pound;54 billion since it was negotiated in 1984, without securing anything in return, this Government have manifestly failed in their paramount duty to protect Britain's interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.1002.3/6">We have a chance to salvage the situation. By rejecting this Bill tonight, Parliament has the opportunity to rectify the damage caused by the incompetence and duplicity of this Labour Government, to stand up for the interests of Britain and British taxpayers against an Executive who have broken their promises and betrayed the people's trust, and to send a clear message that Britain's hard-won rebate is not for giving away. I urge hon. Members to seize the chance this evening to send the Government back to the negotiating table in 2008, in parallel with the promised budget review, and to enter into a good-faith discussion about the rebate, the budget and the future of the CAP on the clear basis that all three are linked and that there will be no change to the British rebate formula unless there is long-term, sustainable reform of the CAP. This is our last chance. If the Bill is passed, Britain's rebate, and with it the principal lever to secure sustainable reform of the CAP, will be gone. I urge hon. Members to deny the Bill a Second Reading and to keep the cause of EU reform alive.</p>

	<p pid="b.1005.3/1">He will come in later, I am sure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005.3/2">During the debate that I mentioned, senior members of my party&mdash;its leader and one of its brightest young stars&mdash;were roaring with Europhobic and mathematically illiterate nonsense at the good deal that the then Prime Minister had brought back. Later in the debate, she was challenged about why she was not spending the money on British priorities&mdash;a point that was also made today by the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Lady Thatcher said, &quot;Are you saying that we should not help the poor people of Portugal?&quot; She stood there and told the Labour party to be generous to poor countries in Europe. In effect, she agreed to a significant increase in the overall budget&mdash;to 1.4 per cent. of European GDP, an increase of about 40 per cent. The EU budget is now lower as a share of European GDP. Again, I salute Margaret Thatcher; there are things in Europe that can be done better collectively than through the mechanisms of 27 national states. She was right then, and this Government are right now. I invite Conservative Members and Front Benchers to become a little more Thatcherite; it will not do them any damage at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005.3/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">The hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> has left his place; he wants us to quit the European Union, and some other hon. Members are joining him. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> has quit his place, probably to prepare for the longer debates that will take place when the ratification treaty comes back to this House. We are left with the cream and core of the intelligent Conservative party, who understand the figures, and I am sure will make wise contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005.3/4">So far, we have seen from its Members' interventions the Conservative party that we know and love: right-wing, reactionary, righteous, rabid and utterly contemptuous of the notion that Britain should lend any help to countries and people to whom we owe a debt of honour&mdash;and not only that. Playing his usual surrogate accountant's role, the Chief Secretary went on and on about how much money we make from Poland and other such countries. That is true, by the way, but Britain is achieving a nobler ambition through this Bill and its proposals on EU financing&mdash;to discharge a debt of honour, which we owe particularly to Poland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005.3/5">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham and I share a concern and a family connection with Poland; he is welcome to make an intervention later. In the past century or so, British history has not been generous vis-&agrave;-vis Poland. Tory appeasement betrayed Poland to the Russians and the Nazis in 1939, and at Yalta Churchill allowed the division of Europe, and allowed the communists to take control of Poland. In the 1970s a Labour Government even objected to the raising in Gunnersbury of a memorial statue to the victims of the NKVD executions in Katyn in 1940.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005.3/6">As a Government, we have discharged some of that debt by leading the encouragement to Poland to join the EU. To give it credit, in 2004 the Conservative party did not join the rabid tabloid press and its campaign to stop Poles from coming to work here. There were some remarks, but the party did not vote against the Bill in question. I think that the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham was the shadow spokesman on Europe at the time; we worked together on the issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005.3/7">When I was Minister for Europe, something upset me considerably as I went round the eastern European countries and spoke to people. I was asked why they&mdash;the people of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic&mdash;were signing cheques, for &euro;50 million or &euro;74 million, directly to Her Majesty's Treasury to pay for the British rebate. I could talk about France and the common agricultural policy, but it was not cutting much mustard; such countries were signing cheques to HMT as part of the rebate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005.3/8">That is how the rebate works; it is not an aggregate sum of money, some of which we do not pay, although that is what people think; it is paid directly by national Governments. I did not have an answer for those countries. After the stunning success of Labour Governments who, after the disastrous economic policies of the preceding Government, have seen national wealth more than double in the past 10 years, how could we, one of the richest nations&mdash;not only in Europe, but in the world&mdash;say to eastern European Governments, &quot;Your poor people have to pay money to our rich nation&quot;?</p>

	<p pid="b.1006.0/1">I agree that Britain has helped Poland and other eastern European countries tremendously. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned Margaret Thatcher. In 1990 she was instrumental, in the Paris club of lending nations, in getting rid of Poland's debts. However, the way to help countries such as Poland in future is through increased trade and helping British companies trade liberally with Poland, not constantly giving it handouts, as the Bill purports to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.1006.1/1">I do not want to make this a Polish-Polish debate, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect a little on what he has said. In 1982, the communist secret police in Poland put me in prison for taking money to the underground Solidarity union. The following year, Britain imposed swingeing visa controls against allowing Poles to come into the United Kingdom. The year after that, Mrs. Thatcher was talking about that faded communist hack Gorbachev as a man with whom she could do business. I accept that once the Poles had won their freedom, Mrs. Thatcher came round to accepting that that was a good thing. However, I wish that she had been a bit stronger in her support when I was in prison, and when the Poles needed to come to this country a bit more easily.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006.1/2">Thanks to the joint work of the Labour and Conservative parties in facing down the anti-eastern-European tabloid press, Poles have been able to come here. However, the tabloids are once again screaming against the eastern European ladies and gentlemen working here.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006.1/3">Yes, I accept that Britain will now pay a bit more. I have no problem with that, because we have had a good deal from the rebate in the past 24 years. Despite what the shadow Chief Secretary said, we are not, in per capita terms, the largest or second largest contributor to the EU budget. Page 32 of the very good Library report shows that we paid 68 euros per head last year. The Netherlands pays four times as much, at 241 euros per head; Denmark pays twice as much at 127 euros per head; Sweden pays 124 euros per head, while Germany pays 100 euros per head. France and Austria pay 50 and 40 euros per head respectively. Those countries, too, are pretty fed up with the assumption that Britain does not have to pay its fair share.</p>

	<p pid="b.1007.0/1">I should like to take this opportunity with regard to a point&mdash;not exactly an allegation&mdash;that I made earlier. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> for correcting himself to a certain extent just now. He specifically mentioned France, which brought me to my feet earlier. Per head, we pay considerably more than France and Italy, but that is without prejudice to the fact that I had said that we contributed much more than we do. I wanted to correct that for the record.</p>

	<p pid="b.1007.1/1">The Francophobia that always infects these debates is jolly good fun, but there are 25 other member states apart from France and the United Kingdom, in the European Union, and the figures vary. I fully accept that there are grotesque anomalies such as Luxembourg. I am getting into some gruesome detail which I would not want to inflict on the House, but the plain fact is that the Netherlands&mdash;our trusty old Protestant ally for 300 years&mdash;pays four times, pro rata, what we pay. Why on earth should the Dutch always have to pay part of the British bill? That is how they will see it&mdash;ditto the Swedes and the Germans. The Germans have spent 4 per cent. of their gross domestic product, year on year, on East Germany following unification. That is twice to two and a half times what the United States put into western Europe under the Marshall plan. The Germans, with a much bigger problem to solve than we have ever had to face&mdash;the incorporation of a bankrupt third-world country, the German Democratic Republic, into the western German Federal Republic&mdash;have made huge personal sacrifices as a nation, yet still pay proportionately far more, 35 per cent. more, on last year's figures, than we do. The figures against us are much worse, in terms of Germany, the Netherlands and some of the Nordic countries, during the recent past.</p>
	<p pid="b.1007.1/2">If we get into arguments that simply state that whatever happens we must pay less than everybody else, the European Union might as well pack up shop. I fully accept the shadow Chief Secretary's point about the common agricultural policy. I do not deny that for one second. The figure is coming down as a share. Let me read more&mdash;I might even be tempted to do it in French this time&mdash;from today's <i> Le Figaro</i>, which says in the course of a long article: &quot;France now accepts that there will have to be a reduction in European Union agricultural expenditure. The debate among the 27 member states will start under the French presidency in the second half of next year. That is when the next pluriannual budget, 2013-2020, will be adopted.&quot; I would love the Conservatives to address this issue, as well as my own Government, because we are not good enough at explaining to partners with sufficient force and vigour that the way in which the European Union budget is constructed is not necessarily the best way for Europeans.</p>
	<p pid="b.1007.1/3">The biggest defenders of the CAP are not the French but the Irish. Ireland&mdash;an English-speaking country with a centre-right conservative party, Fianna F&aacute;il, in power&mdash;is passionate in defending the CAP. I would invite the Conservatives to talk to Fianna F&aacute;il; I cannot do it, because it is not in the same political family as the Labour party. I would even ask my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench to create a special EU CAP reform persuasion budget that could be given to the Conservatives, so that they could go to talk to all the ruling centre-right parties in Germany, Poland, the Nordic countries, Netherlands, and France&mdash;but, as we know, the Conservatives want to effect a total rupture with the EU's other centre-right ruling parties. The UK is extremely badly served by a neo-isolationist attitude whereby they will not go and network politically for the common goals that most people in Britain, across parties, would support.</p>

	<p pid="b.1008.0/1">My right hon. Friend has made several references to Ireland. If I were Irish, I would be very enthusiastic about the CAP and the structural fund policies, because the Irish are massive net beneficiaries from the budget. At its peak, it went as high as 5 per cent. of GDP, which in British terms would be &pound;60 billion. A net inward transfer of funds from the EU totalling &pound;60 billion might make us rather more enthusiastic.</p>

	<p pid="b.1008.1/1">I am terribly sorry, but page 34 of the Library report shows that in 2006 Ireland received &euro;475 million of structural fund expenditure, while Britain received &euro;3,021 million. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> My hon. Friend is right in per head terms; I cannot disagree with that. However, I am making a different point: if we want Ireland, France, Germany and other countries to change, we must engage with them. Believe it or not, this debate is not being listened to right now by the good people of Ireland as they settle down to their boiled ham and cabbage and a good pint of Guinness.</p>

	<p pid="b.1009.0/1">My hon. Friend is talking through his hat. Ireland was so poor when it joined in 1973 that the amount of net transfers from the UK economy would have been absolutely enormous. The idea that each country goes round with a begging hat saying, &quot;I'm poor, please give me some money&quot;, simply will not work. I respect my hon. Friend&mdash;although he does not like the EU and the way it works, he has always taken a consistent, cheerful and friendly position on it&mdash;but we have to work with what we have, and if we want to change it, we have to engage, network and discuss. That is what the Conservatives completely and resolutely refuse to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.1009.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman has been talking about Ireland. I must tell him&mdash;we get on quite well with one another, so I hope that he will take this on board&mdash;that the Irish Government have just spent &pound;300 million of taxpayers' money on propping up the Irish dairy industry. I am chairman of the all-party group on dairy farmers. How can our dairy farmers in the west of England and Wales compete when the Irish are so flagrantly contravening the spirit of the common agricultural policy?</p>

	<p pid="b.1009.2/1">I wonder whether that is a wise intervention on the afternoon when we have learned how much money we are giving to Northern Rock. If the Irish subsidy, subvention or support is against EU state aid provisions, let it be taken to the European Court of Justice. To be fair, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear that any aid that the British Government choose to give to protect the 1.5 million borrowers and savers in Northern Rock must be within EU rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.1009.2/2">Hon. Members have spoken as if Britain were a net contributor to the EU in all areas and we got nothing back in return. In fact, last year's structural fund expenditure figures show that the UK gets a third more than France, 20 per cent. more than Belgium and nearly twice as much as the Netherlands. We get more than Slovenia, one of the accession member states, and&mdash;the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham might want to listen to this point&mdash;only &euro;1 per head less than Poland. The world's fourth largest economy gets from the EU only &euro;1 per head less in structural funds than Poland, which, despite its enormous economic progress, is still a not very rich EU country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1009.2/3">I want reform of the CAP. What we are debating was, in effect, set in stone in 2002 with the agreement between the then French President, Jacques Chirac, and the then German Chancellor, Gerhard Schr&ouml;der, to maintain CAP expenditure at a fixed amount, not as a percentage amount. That was in the context of the Iraq conflict and, frankly, a deep worsening of relations and divisions within the EU. If we want to achieve desired British goals of getting some reduction as regards the CAP, we will have to look at linking up, making networks, making the argument and going out to persuade people. These decisions are not taken in some closed caballing session in Brussels. They are taken by parliamentarians like ourselves in Paris, Dublin, Germany and Rome, and we need to talk and network far more with them ahead of decisions being taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.1009.2/4">We might also decide that the common agricultural policy could focus its attention on the poorer farmers in Britain&mdash;the hill farmers, the sheep farmers and those with a very small income&mdash;and increase the support that goes to rural development. But what did I read yesterday in <i> The Observer</i>? It was suggested that the richest recipients of CAP aid, such as the Duke of Marlborough and all the Tory-supporting ex-aristocracy, are receiving hundreds of thousands of euros. The British Government, who like a duke when they see one, will try to defend outrageous payments to the richest cereal and agro-industrial companies in Europe, as well as to some very rich individuals in our country. We have to consider motes and beams before we lecture other countries on those issues.</p>

Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> mentioned Ireland, which has become very rich since it joined the EU. I welcome that. I went on holiday to Ireland as a small boy, and it was a very poor country then. I saw cattle driven through the streets of rather big towns. In the 1950s, almost every second Irish male had to emigrate to find a job.</p>

	<p pid="b.1010.6/1">Ireland is successful today because it plays a full role in the European Union. Were Scotland to quit the Union, I would be interested to see the price it would have to pay to enter the EU, because it would be a tricky renegotiation. However, we are veering way off the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.1010.6/2">What counts is that the Irish used the moneys that they got from the EU better than almost any other country. They were combined with enormous investment in education and a sensible taxation policy&mdash;a point that I concede to the hon. Member for Stone. None the less, are we saying that after 1973, Britain should not, to a lesser degree than Germany or the Netherlands, have made significant fiscal transfers that have allowed Ireland as a nation during the past 33 years to become richer and happier than it ever was when it was an independent state before it joined the EU, or when under English control? I do not think so. It must have been in our interests to do so. It is why Ireland today is a country of immigration, not emigration. Immigration brings its own problems, as we know, but it is far better to be a country that is so successful it needs to attract workers to do jobs that nationals are not prepared to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.1010.6/3">That ought to be our ambition for the rest of Europe. Many hon. Members will remember travelling to Spain, southern Italy or even bits of France not so long ago and being able to see rural and social poverty. It was quaint, and it was nice for the British ex-pats who could buy houses and drinks that did not cost very much, but now it is far better that Italians and Spaniards can, in contrast to their position in the 1950s and 1960s, stay in their own countries, and that those countries are rich enough to attract people to work in them. That is my ambition for Poland and the Baltic states. In order to achieve that ambition, some generosity on our part, and some lessening of the assumption that it is only the Germans, Dutch and Swedes that should pay, would be welcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.1010.6/4">We can see the success that membership of the European Union brings to all countries. I have explained why it makes us all more wealthy, and I hope that the figures are not in question.</p>

	<p pid="b.1011.4/1">I love <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, but he has not been in his place since the beginning of the debate, and nei<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2004" name="Angus MacNeil">ther has the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil)</phrase>, so I shall not give way. I will do so to those who have been here since the start of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1011.4/2">As well as making us more wealthy, it transpires that membership of the EU makes us more healthy. A new book that has just become available in the Library, in the new arrivals section, contains a marvellous statistic showing that between 1965 and 2004, the life expectancy of the British male increased by 13 years. In the United States over the same period it increased by only eight years; in France, it increased by 10 years and in Norway by just seven years. Membership of the European Union is allowing us to live longer; I would have thought that all hon. Members would welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1011.4/3">This modest Bill will allow financing of the European Union that has been negotiated, agreed and signed, and on which our word has been pledged. The shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury is quite right to say that we can veto it and reject it, but he would have a hard time explaining to the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and other eastern Europeans who are the principal beneficiaries why we should continue the current practice, which will come to an end once the Bill becomes law, of their sending large cheques to Her Majesty's Treasury. It is not worthy or honourable. The Conservative party is not anti-Polish or anti-European, but it seems to be absolutely locked into a philosophy of rejecting anything that helps the EU to grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.1011.4/4">This time last week, the shadow Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase>, made endless appeals in a fine and effective speech for more European Union action. He said that EU Foreign Ministers had wasted opportunities and that they ought to do more on Iraq. I agree with him. On Burma, he says that the EU should tighten</p>

	<p pid="b.1011.4/6">I cannot disagree with him. He also said that EU Ministers need to show collective strength over Zimbabwe. I agree with him, but if he wants those desired goals to be achieved, there is a problem. It is not possible to demand more action from partners in Europe&mdash;I might add the case of Afghanistan or one or two other places&mdash;at the Dispatch Box while allowing members of one's party to campaign openly for withdrawal from the EU, or while writing articles and making the bulk of one's speeches utterly contemptuous of our partners. When the Leader of the Opposition talks about one-legged Lithuanians, the Opposition have a problem. When members of the Public Accounts Committee say, &quot;We're going to have to get tough&mdash;these guys coming in to talk to us are foreigners&quot;, we see the subconscious xenophobia deep at the heart of the Conservative party.</p>

	<p pid="b.1013.7/1">As I was saying, the right hon. Gentleman made two important points. The first was that we should remember that we get something back from the European Union and that it is not just the new member states that benefit from matters such as structural funds. Some of the poorest parts of Europe are in this country, such as Cornwall, where GDP per head of population is still less than 75 per cent. of the European average. It is right that some of those resources should be directed towards helping to boost growth in the economy there.</p>

	<p pid="b.1014.0/1">I sympathise entirely with the hon. Lady's concern about poor regions in Britain, including Cornwall, but would that not be better addressed by a vigorous and generously funded national system of regional assistance?</p>

	<p pid="b.1014.1/1">It would be fantastic if that were the case, but unfortunately it was a hard fight even to get Cornwall recognised as a distinctive economic region in its own right, something that neither the Conservatives nor the current Government were prepared to countenance. Only through the work of the then MEP Robin Teverson, now Lord Teverson, was the area identified as an economic entity in its own right.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/2">The second point that the right hon. Gentleman made was about the need for reform of the common agricultural policy and about how we should make the most of our opportunities. However, as I shall explain, we had an opportunity but we passed up on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/3">We on the Liberal Democrat Benches are not going to engage in anti-European rants. We have always been clear that we take a constructive, pro-European approach, which we do not intend to change. We welcome the fact that the EU has brought a period of unparalleled peace and prosperity to Europe, and that there has been successful integration with new member states. However, that does not mean that there is no need for a proper public debate about the future of Britain's relationship with the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/4">Over our 35 years as a member state we have seen the EU widen its membership and share sovereignty, from Mrs. Thatcher's Single European Act to a succession of treaties agreed by both Conservative and Labour Governments. The EU has changed beyond recognition since 1973, which means that the need for a renewed debate has never been greater. Since 1997 Labour has given away powers, but has refused to make the positive case for Europe and engage in a proper debate about the direction of the EU. The Conservatives, who promoted closer integration without referendums while in government, now indulge in populism of the worst kind, calling for a referendum to mask their own divisions. So let us have that proper debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/5">That debate could be achieved by a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. That was raised on the Liberal Democrat Benches during the debate on the Loyal Address, and I was proud to walk through the Lobby supporting our amendment, which would have delivered that. I was disappointed that the Conservatives chose to oppose such a proposal, or are they afraid that too many Conservative Members would vote to withdraw from the EU altogether? Instead, the Conservatives will use the debate on the treaty as a proxy for that debate, despite the fact that it has much narrower terms. I am sure that those opposed to EU membership altogether will take the opportunity to air their views then, but much of the treaty is in fact about the practicalities of dealing with an enlarged EU, such as whether we need 27 Commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/6">We need to see the Bill in the context of that wider debate about a constructive approach. Although the Bill is short, it gives effect to the new own resources decision made by the European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-07">7 June 2007</phrase>. The Bill sets out the new financial framework for the EU for 2007 to 2013, the basis of which was agreed under the UK presidency in Brussels, in December 2005. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches believe that the EU is good for the UK. We support measures to enable smooth running of the expansion of EU membership, and we believe that it would be wrong to defend an arrangement under which we were recipients of funding from eastern Europe. Those measures were part of the negotiations for a new financial framework&mdash;a part that we wholeheartedly supported, because we wish to support the poorer parts of the European Union, which means those in the UK as well as in the new accession states.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/7">The key point is that the negotiating objective was to trade the rebate against fundamental change. The question we must ask is: could the Government have done more in trying to achieve that fundamental negotiating objective? The Minister has not conceded today that the end result was a bad deal for the UK. It was a bad deal because the former Prime Minister totally failed us in the negotiating process during his six-month presidency of the EU. He seemed to think that any deal was better than none at all. The result is a bad deal, caused by the Government failing to identify, let alone secure, their objectives. That result is more the legacy of the former Prime Minister than the vision of the current one, which is probably why he chose not to raise it in the Queen's Speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/8">The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, liked talking about grand ambition and using radical rhetoric about reforming the EU, but when he had his golden opportunity he failed to deliver. He totally mishandled the negotiating process before it had even started. He spent most of 2005 saying that the rebate was non-negotiable. Clearly, however, it was negotiable, and was actually being negotiated at the time he was saying that it was not. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> spoke earlier about negotiating skills; perhaps he should have shared some of his expertise with the then Prime Minister, who completely failed in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/9">Such a position resulted not only in the Government looking foolish. It also meant that they could not open up terms of compromise from anyone else. Perhaps it would have been better to say, &quot;Okay, we'll put our rebate on the table if you're prepared to talk about the serious reform of the common agricultural policy.&quot; But they did not, so they had absolutely no hope of delivering reform of that kind. The best that they could do was to cave in on the rebate, while giving the pathetic excuse that it related only to the expansion elements, and not to those linked to the CAP.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/10">This was the area of greatest opportunity, and of greatest failure. Too much was given up in return for too little reform. There was an opportunity for a long-term strategy to be put in place, but the former Prime Minister bottled it. Instead of a long-term sustainable solution to CAP reform being found, the issue was effectively kicked into touch, with a full review of EU spending and resources by the Commission scheduled to report in 2008-09. In other words, it will become someone else's problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/11">Today's debate has highlighted the fact that the urgent need for CAP reform has still not been addressed. We have seen significant reform, but we need to go further. It was good to see the reforms in 2003. Despite the problems that the Government have had with the administration of the single farm payment, it is less bureaucratic than its predecessor systems, and it is no longer awarded on the basis of production. However, there is still a need to go further, to increase trading opportunities for developing countries while safeguarding the changing rural economy. The Government should have been more ambitious in what they believed they could achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/12">The Treasury set out its vision, to &quot;stimulate and inform debate&quot;, on <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase>&mdash;about the same time as the meeting in Brussels took place. This gave an indication of where it believed the EU needed to be in 10 to15 years' time. Operating on that time scale, the Brussels Council should have been crucial to taking the first steps, yet that opportunity was missed. The Treasury document highlighted many of the issues that need to be tackled and, yes, tariffs remain one of the key obstacles to further and more fundamental reform. The Government's position in 2002, in failing to secure a renegotiation of the CAP, not only undermined their position at the summit in Brussels in 2005, but also impacted on the subsequent World Trade Organisation negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/13">Instead of kicking the issue into the long grass with the review, the Government should have looked much more closely at potential co-financing arrangements and at splitting the responsibility 50-50 between the EU and the national Governments. This would have had a much greater impact on the rebate than the measure that we are debating here today and the sums of money that we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014.1/14">The Chief Secretary to the Treasury talked about the way in which resources had been allocated across from pillar one to pillar two of the common agricultural policy. Those are the kinds of issues that really should have been pushed at the Brussels Council. Such an approach at Brussels would have helped to bring decision-making powers&mdash;and with them, decisions over resources&mdash;back from Brussels to a more local level within the UK. That would have put money back into rural communities, using public money for the delivery of public goods. It would have encouraged food to be produced and sold locally to high animal welfare and environmental standards, which would have cut food miles and ensured sustainability. Fundamentally, it would have made a real difference, but the opportunity to get those changes moving was wasted.</p>

	<p pid="b.1017.1/1">Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017.1/2">I was saying that other Members have mentioned the problems with the European Union audit process, and Ministers made it clear, when the draft documents were debated earlier last year, that tougher audit trails and constraints needed to be in place. We support them in their intent, but that will mean national Governments, as well as the EU, taking on responsibilities. Perhaps it will mean taking more responsibility down to national level, as some of the problems are caused by centralising too much of the detail at EU level. This issue was highlighted in the past week or so, when we learned that the EU auditors had refused to sign off the EU's financial accounts for the 13th year in a row. One of the issues identified by the report was poor knowledge of complex rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017.1/3">The applications for structural funding in my constituency involved an incredibly complicated process, but the layers of complication often came not from Europe but from the regional body administering the structural funds. One of the most frustrating things was the fact that the goalposts were moved during the application process. The example that always springs to mind relates to industrial buildings and work spaces, for which funds were available. Because there were a lot of applications going in, however, the Government office for the south-west decided to raise the environmental standards required. That was great, but unfortunately there was no one available to assess those standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017.1/4">We can see from that example how these complications can arise. The fact that the Department for Work and Pensions has failed to have its accounts signed off for the past 13 or 14&mdash;or is it 17?&mdash;years shows us that it is not just the European Union that has difficulty in dealing with these issues. The Government must sort themselves out as well as demanding improvement in Europe. Clearly, there are lessons to be learned at national and Europe-wide level. If we can do that, we shall achieve greater clarity and help to inspire confidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017.1/5">The Government should concede where they failed in this set of negotiations. They should admit that it would have been better to have had no agreement under Blair's presidency, rather than an agreement that was nothing but a bad deal for the UK. If, like us, they want the European project to succeed, aspects of the Union must be fundamentally reformed. They should accept that the greatest failure in this whole process was not on the part of the EU, but on the part of our then Prime Minister in giving up part of the rebate without securing fundamental CAP reform. Achieving that reform would have been a legacy to be proud of, but it is one that this Government have failed to achieve.</p>

	<p pid="b.1018.0/1">I am pleased to be able to speak in a European debate, and in particular to speak on the Bill that will give effect to the deal signed up to by our previous Prime Minister last December. That deal will cost Britain billions in future years and, as has already been pointed out, will bring very little to Britain in return, at least in material terms. The deal was described by <i> The Economist</i> as a very poor one for Britain. <i> The Economist</i> is hardly the kind of Eurosceptic, leftist magazine that I would support, but it said that no deal would have been better than that deal. I certainly agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018.0/2">The previous Prime Minister negotiated&mdash;if that is a fair description&mdash;the deal at the last minute, at the end of Britain's presidency of the EU. It was also done in a rather spontaneous and arbitrary manner that apparently shocked and astonished other politicians, who felt that they would at least have had to refer back to their Cabinets and Governments before making such a dramatic decision. The fact that our then Chancellor of the Exchequer was not with the previous Prime Minister at the time might have made it rather easier for him to do that deal. Perhaps he knew that he was soon to leave office, and that it would be left to his successor to pick up the tab. That is precisely what has happened, and one suspects that, behind the scenes, our new Prime Minister is, unsurprisingly, not happy about the deal.</p>

	<p pid="b.1018.1/1">At the time, it was greatly publicised on television that the then Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, was in constant telephone contact with the current Prime Minister and that he ran everything by him. My understanding is that the current Prime Minister was very much aware of what we were signing ourselves up to at the time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1018.2/1">I sincerely hope that they were speaking on the telephone, but it may be that they did not have the degree of harmony that one would hope for in taking such a big decision. Perhaps some of this friction between the former and the present Prime Minister that has been talked about in recent days was in evidence. I have never believed those stories myself, but perhaps there is some substance to them after all.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018.2/2">The Government and my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary have constantly emphasised the importance of giving assistance to the newer member states, which are distinctly poorer than ourselves. That is a noble and respectable objective. However, the debate was really about the common agricultural policy and its genesis was the suggestion by us that the CAP should be reformed and the budget for it reduced. President Chirac was already smarting from his defeat in the referendum on the constitution; he was extremely angry and looking for someone to lash out at. He saw Britain attacking his CAP and there was also the issue of our budget rebate, so it was President Chirac who forced the debate about our rebate on to the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018.2/3">At that point, we should have responded robustly and said &quot;no deal&quot;&mdash;at least until the cost of the CAP was substantially reduced. In my view, of course, we should entirely abolish it. I have said many times here and in Committee that the CAP should simply be abolished and agricultural support returned to member states. Member states are best able to judge what their own agricultural industries require and what subsidies, if any, are required. Under that system, they would also be democratically accountable. The subsidies would have to be accounted for in a direct way at elections, which is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018.2/4">Indeed, I would go further. Much has been made of structural cohesion funding, but here again it is an inefficient way of subsidising or trying to help the poorer regions. It would be much better for member states to decide what subsidies were appropriate for their regions and to pay for them out of their own budgets rather than have to go through the circuitous budgetary processes of the EU. Money is lost in inefficiencies&mdash;no doubt in fraud and corruption as well&mdash;and there is frictional wastage in distributing aid in that way. I am sure that I am not alone in being slightly annoyed when I spot notices around my constituency and elsewhere that are funded by the EU&mdash;indicated by the yellow stars on the blue background. That is effectively our money being used, yet it is claimed that it is European money. If we were a poorer nation and we were receiving a net contribution, that would be fine, but we are actually net contributors and only some&mdash;certainly not all&mdash;of that money is redirected back to Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018.2/5">As a socialist, I am strongly in favour of redistribution from those who can afford it to those who are in need. If we did that in a sensible, fair and non-corrupt way, it would represent a sensible way forward&mdash;but we do not do that through the structures of the EU. I have said before and I will keep on saying that a system of simple fiscal transfers from the richer to the poorer nations of Europe would be a much more efficient and much fairer way of doing things. The relevant member states could then decide how to allocate those extra funds to their own peoples, and be democratically accountable to them in doing so. We should repatriate agricultural policy and leave regional and structural funding to member states, not have it allocated through the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018.2/6">Various estimates have been made of the cost of the EU to Britain. This Bill will cost us an extra &pound;7 billion by 2013&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1019.1/1">Certainly in terms of borrowing it is, but that was a debate for earlier today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019.1/2">Other costs are associated with the CAP, such as higher food prices and market distortions. It is estimated by the OECD that that costs Britain &pound;15 billion a year, so the CAP is not just a matter of subsidies to the budget, but a real further cost in higher food prices as well. The CAP should be abolished, not reformed. Reform can mean many things to many people, but it usually means not very much to anyone. The reality is that reform has been gradual&mdash;a bit here, a bit there&mdash;and sometimes it is two steps backwards rather than two steps forwards. The reform programme has not been a great success.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019.1/3">We should have used the lever when the budget was being negotiated. We should have refused to agree until serious progress was made towards the eventual abolition of the CAP. We could have argued for that on the basis that what was saved could be used directly to help the poorer nations of Europe that are struggling to advance the living standards of their peoples. That would be far preferable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019.1/4">A number of estimates of the cost of EU membership have been made. There is a Swiss view&mdash;Switzerland is outside the EU&mdash;set out in a Europe 2006 report. It states that full EU membership would cost the country 1 per cent. of the Swiss national income. Well, 1 per cent. of national income in one year may not seem very much, but if it is compounded over many years or decades, it becomes a very large sum of money indeed. It has been estimated elsewhere that the cost of the European budgetary and economic arrangements to Britain is about 0.5 per cent. of our gross domestic product. Again, that may not sound much in one year, but if we compute it over 40 or 50 years, it becomes a very substantial sum. Many of us have argued that how the EU is constituted at the moment does not actually benefit the peoples of Europe economically, so we would do better to have different economic arrangements&mdash;not to break up the EU entirely, but to have different economic arrangements within it, with each member state deciding what is most appropriate for its own economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1020.1/1">Indeed. The hon. Gentleman is right to mention that. There may not be a lot of fishing in Luton, North, but we eat fish. I have seen an estimate that if something is not done, all the fish will be fished out of the seas by about 2020, which would be a tragedy for the whole world, as we cannot replace fish stocks. We have to guard fish stocks and I believe that member states would be best at guarding their own fish stocks when they knew that their futures depended on them. When fishing is going on in other people's fishing waters, far less concern will be expressed than when it is a matter of protecting one's own waters. Giving each member state responsibility for its own fish stocks in its own fishing waters would be a sensible way of protecting fish stocks for everyone.</p>
	<p pid="b.1020.1/2">I am afraid that I cannot support this Bill tonight. It would be dishonest for me to go through the Aye Lobby on this particular Bill. However, I would like to support what the Foreign Secretary said the other day. He argued that we should not promote the development of Europe as a superstate, but that Europe should be an association of independent and democratic nations. I agree absolutely and I have made that point very strongly in the past. What we are seeing is a constant drift towards that superstate and at some point we have to start saying no. We could start to say no by abolishing the CAP and restoring some of the functions carried out by the EU to member states. We could then work together on a co-operative, fraternal and sororal association of states to everyone's benefit. That would not only benefit everyone's living standards in Europe, but would improve our relations with our neighbours as well. We would not have so many arguments with our French neighbours&mdash;I must say that I love France very much and go there every year for my holidays&mdash;if the CAP did not exist. I suggest that we should take a much tougher line next time. Sadly, I cannot support the Bill tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.1021.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes his point well, as ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.1021.2/2">We are debating a small, defined Bill that will implement an agreement that was made in December 2005. The House last had an opportunity to debate the deal on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-08">8 May 2006</phrase>. It does little credit to the way in which we deal with EU business in the House and in this country that the Bill simply gives legal force to an arrangement that has been in effect since <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January</phrase>. Now, 11 months later, the House has the chance to debate a Bill that will implement the deal that was made by the former Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, nearly two years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.1021.2/3">The Bill and the deal that it will implement are bad measures, but they are also bad because of what they say about the state of the EU and of Britain's ability to negotiate a better arrangement and a better deal within the EU. The Bill is bad not least because this is a time of tightening public finances, when the Treasury and the Government face more difficult decisions about funding and public services in this country. The situation could become considerably more difficult in the year ahead, and even worse in the year after that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1021.2/4">The Bill represents a change in our financing commitments to the EU that, according to the excellent Library note produced for the debate, will contribute to a net increase in the UK's contribution of &pound;2.3 billion every year. That is a cause of considerable concern. The Chief Secretary seemed to try to justify it on the grounds that although it might cost us more, that was okay because it would also cost France more. I am not sure that that explanation would cut much ice with my constituents or with his.</p>
	<p pid="b.1021.2/5">The Chief Secretary went on to say that the rebate had not been cut, but rather that parts of it had been disapplied&mdash;as far as I can see, that amounts to the same thing. The rebate applies to fewer aspects of EU funding than it used to. Even though the absolute amount of the rebate may rise in line with our rising contribution&mdash;that point was made earlier&mdash;we will effectively see a cut in the scope of the rebate, which will contribute to an overall substantial increase in the net contribution from this country to an unreformed EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1021.2/6">A number of Members have already well made the point that the Prime Minister at the time, Mr. Blair, went to Brussels with an absolute commitment that he would achieve radical reform of the CAP and that only in those circumstances would it be acceptable to negotiate away part of our rebate. Instead, he returned with nothing.</p>

Only one such former Minister has made a speech so far this evening, but, as a former shadow Minister for Europe, I might be falling into the same habit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022.1/3">The right hon. Member for Rotherham seemed to suggest that CAP reform would require endless negotiations. He talked about networks and even suggested that the Government should create a new fund to pay the Conservative party to lobby in Europe in favour of CAP reform. I do not support state funding of political parties, so I would find that rather difficult to justify, but I can see that his logic is such that after the woeful inability of the Labour Government to negotiate CAP reform, he is even prepared to accept the job being subcontracted to the Opposition instead.</p>

	<p pid="b.1022.3/1">The right hon. Member for Rotherham talked a great deal, but he missed out one key possibility that was available to Mr. Blair two years ago: to use the strongest card that we had, which was won by Lady Thatcher in 1984&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">the British rebate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> said in his opening speech, we always made it clear that we would support sensible measures to negotiate the reduction and CAP reform balanced against a reform of the British rebate. Instead, we got a hopelessly one-sided deal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022.3/2">So, what is the upside to the deal that was secured and the arrangements that we are considering? Mr. Blair certainly failed to secure the prize of his key objective of CAP reform. Not only did he give up billions of pounds of British taxpayers' money but, more shamefully, he gave up a key bargaining point. He was wholly culpable for the fact that we conceded that crucial part of the British rebate while getting nothing in return. We should not readily forgive or forget that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022.3/3">It should not be a surprise to right hon. and hon. Members of any party that the deal is so unpopular, but that could easily have been missed. The Chief Secretary is an affable, likeable man. It would have been easy to draw the conclusion from the tone and demeanour of his lengthy opening speech&mdash;I accept he was generous in giving way&mdash;that the Government were presenting a great triumph. One might expect Her Majesty's Opposition to be most dismayed by the sacrifice of such an important part of the British budget rebate and cross about the Government's failure in Brussels in 2005, but I was delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">the hon.

	<p pid="b.1023.5/1">Indeed&mdash;and a few good men and true on the Labour Benches.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023.5/2">As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge reminded us, not only Opposition parties were unhappy with the deal. The then Chancellor of the Exchequer, now Prime Minister, was reported to be quietly fuming. There was considerable press comment, clearly stimulated by Treasury briefings. Several newspapers reported that &quot;Mr. Brown was unhappy&quot; that the deal would cost the UK an extra &pound;1 billion a year and that he had not taken part in final negotiations. Attempts were clearly made to distance the then Chancellor from the deal that Mr. Blair had made. Unattributed briefings on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-18">18 December 2005</phrase> stated that Mr. Blair had &quot;freelanced&quot; to strike a deal on Friday night and early Saturday morning, without speaking directly to his Chancellor. It was also reported that the disclosures threatened to open up a fresh and damaging rift between the two men and that, under the deal that followed 17 hours of intensive talks, Mr. Blair promised to surrender a further &pound;1.7 billion of the rebate first secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. My maths is not that good, but I believe that that is &pound;100 million given up for every hour of the negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023.5/3">The then Prime Minister, who had set himself such a clear target and easily identified goal, suffered a remarkable defeat in the negotiations. There was further criticism that the way in which the deal was structured would lead to costs being &quot;back-loaded&quot;. It was suggested that a time bomb had been left for the new Prime Minister who would take office in the next year or two. It was reported that the costs would gradually rise from zero in 2008-09 to &pound;1.9 billion a year by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023.5/4">This Second Reading debate and the Bill, however short, are allegories of everything that brings the House's dealings with EU business into disrepute. We are being asked to approve another &pound;2.3 billion a year after, not before, the event. We all know that the deal was bad. Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and even the Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, opposed it. As the right hon. Member for Rotherham told <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> shortly before the deal was made:</p>
	<p pid="b.1023.5/5" class="indent">&quot;Even out and out pro-Europeans like me could not accept a one-sided deal that only removes the rebate. That would be very difficult to get through.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1024.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is not here at the moment, but we will watch carefully to ascertain whether he makes it difficult to get the deal through by joining us in voting against the Bill. The Government are indeed trying to force through a one-sided deal under which they have given up the rebate and achieved nothing in return.</p>
	<p pid="b.1024.1/2">Today, the Chief Secretary assured us that the Government believe that the deal is good, and suggested that it has the Prime Minister's support. That is why they will try to force it through. The debate is welcome because it is an opportunity for all hon. Members to nail their colours to the mast. On the one side are our constituents' interests, and our need to defend their hard-earned money and to stand up for the important case for reforming the CAP to reduce food prices in the UK and remedy the damage that it does in the developing world. On the other side is the Labour Government's need to maintain face. Even though the previous Prime Minister was responsible for the failed negotiations, we are being asked to believe that the current Prime Minister now supports something to which he clearly objected violently at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1024.1/3">Today is the first of several opportunities to debate EU matters in the coming months&mdash;in some ways, it is the most fundamental opportunity. Only if the UK is prepared to use its negotiating hand, stand firm and, even at the risk of unpopularity from time to time, stand up for the national interest will we achieve the right deal for Britain and the right reforms in the EU. The Government, in presenting the deal and introducing the Bill, not only surrender &pound;2.3 billion of British taxpayers' money but give up our strongest hand in EU budget negotiations in future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1025.0/1">I rarely agreed with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase> when I sat on the same Benches as he. Judging by his speech, it is no more likely that I shall agree with him in future, on the subject of our debate. However, he is an honest and able man. He is always courteous in debate and in private discussion. It is therefore a pleasure to follow him in the debate. Doubtless we shall both take part in other debates on the subject in future&mdash;in the near future if we are so lucky as to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.1025.0/2">Let me say at the outset that I believe that the settlement is superb and I am unambiguously delighted that we have secured it. I shall vote for the Bill with enthusiasm. Indeed, it would be unedifying&mdash;to use a stronger word, obscene&mdash;if we enforced against much poorer countries in eastern Europe the rebate that we secured in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher against countries that were much richer than us at the time, such as France, Germany, the Benelux countries and the Nordic members of the Union. It would be taking money from someone who was much poorer.</p>

I find it extraordinary that the hon. Gentleman, given that he honourably and naturally takes that position, should say that we should enforce against Poland the mechanism that we secured to defend our interests when we were much poorer than the average member of the Community, as it was then called. I hope that he will reconsider the matter, although I do not know whether he will do that in time to change his vote tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.1025.1/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that this is only the start. Further waves of relatively poor countries will enter the EU. Is he claiming that he is prepared for Britain to have even less money in future, when those other waves of poor countries join the EU from the Balkans and beyond? The Foreign Secretary made a speech this week in which he said that he looked forward to an EU of which countries from north Africa and the middle east were also members.</p>

	<p pid="b.1025.2/1">I did not listen to that speech, but I do not think for a moment that the Foreign Secretary suggested that north African countries should join the European Union. He was taking about a free trade agreement, which is a different matter, and something that we already have with a number of countries outside the European Union. The hon. Gentleman has got that speech wrong; perhaps he would like to look at the record again and get it right.</p>
	<p pid="b.1025.2/2">As for further enlargement, the only country for which that is more or less established is Croatia, a small country that will create minimal and insignificant strains on the budget. Beyond that, Serbia and Moldova are possibilities. There is great scepticism about going much further than that. That is a different point, however, and you will correct me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I get dragged down into discussion of the natural limits of enlargement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1025.2/3">When I left the Conservative party, I said that it had become irretrievably cynical and opportunistic, and this evening's debate has shown how true that judgment was. There are only two possibilities: either the Conservative party is engaged in deliberate obfuscation or it is extremely confused. Its policies on the European Union generally, and enlargement specifically, completely lack coherence. It says that it is in favour of enlargement, but it is not prepared to pay for it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1026.0/1">At the next election the hon. Gentleman might wish to fight a seat representing people in a much poorer part of the country than he currently represents&mdash;for example, a seat in the inner cities. How much extra tax should such people have to contribute to pay to Poland?</p>

	<p pid="b.1026.1/1">The hon. Gentleman knows something about economics, and about something called a dynamic model, in which the indirect and subsequent consequences of any action must be taken into account. I believe that the settlement will result in enhanced revenues for the European Union as a whole: we will all have more money to play with.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026.1/2">That point has already been made this evening, using the example of Ireland. It is wonderful for us that Ireland has become so prosperous. I do not say for a moment that Ireland has become prosperous only because it has been in receipt of cohesion and structural funds. The Irish are extraordinarily enterprising people, and once released from the autarky pursued by their Governments in the initial generations after independence, some take-off was likely. Since the Whitaker report in the 1960s, they have invested in education in a big way. As Members on both sides of the debate have said, they have pursued sensible and attractive tax policies. It must be a matter of delight to us that not just Ireland but Portugal and Spain have been completely transformed since they joined the European Union, because it contributes to our prosperity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1026.4/1">If the hon. Gentleman chooses to answer his own question, he is more than welcome to do so. I was going to ask him to what he attributes Iceland's success.

	<p pid="b.1026.5/1">Having been shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for three years, I know a little about Ireland, but I must make the terrible confession that I have never made a study of Iceland. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not embark on an analysis of Iceland's economic experience now.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026.5/2">The second big problem is that the Conservative party has shown this evening that it does not want to face up to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">the facts. I put to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> the two most striking facts&mdash;I described them as salient&mdash;about the package. One was that for the first time the share of agriculture in total spending is now on a downward path. That is enormously important, as it means that the issue of agricultural spending is being resolved over time. As anyone who can do elementary logic will know, the curve could be steeper or less steep, but we are going in a direction in which the common agricultural policy problem will inexorably be resolved. The hon. Gentleman did not want to recognise that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026.5/3">The second fact that I put to the hon. Gentleman was that, under the settlement, France and Italy will increase their contributions at twice the rate of those of this country. That is also unprecedented, and an extraordinary achievement. Signor Prodi and Monsieur Sarkozy will have a much more difficult time defending this settlement in their national assemblies than the Government will have here. I have some sympathy for them, and I am glad that we have reached this sensible compromise, for all the reasons that I have mentioned. The hon. Gentleman did not even recognise those facts. I intervened twice, and his response was to run away from them and evade the points that I made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026.5/4">I must tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who is not in his place at present, that if they are serious about wanting to come into power, being in denial about the facts is a very bad basis for statesmanship and a disastrous basis for government&mdash;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I did not hear that point; if <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1461" name="Charles Walker">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)</phrase> wants to make an intervention, I shall certainly take it. Members have been generous in taking interventions this evening, and I am happy to live up to that convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026.5/5">The third problem, which goes back to good faith, or perhaps just to a lack of information or understanding on the part of Eurosceptics, both in the Tory party and in many parts of the press, is the rubbish and systematic, libellous and defamatory nonsense talked the whole time about the Court of Auditors and corruption and waste in the European Union. It is perfectly true that the Court of Auditors has regularly put reserves on the accounts that it has signed. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I will give way again to the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar, but I hope that I can proceed after his intervention.</p>

	<p pid="b.1027.0/1">Before we move on to the subject of corruption, we should acknowledge the deep, inbuilt, structural problems in the common agricultural policy.

	<p pid="b.1027.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not burn the midnight oil to discover the rates of payment to crofters in the Highlands and Islands. His figures might be right or wrong; I am afraid that I cannot comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027.1/2">A regular feature of Eurosceptic rhetoric both from Conservative Members and from the press has been to say that the European Union is a sink of corruption, that the Court of Auditors has never approved the accounts, and to ask how we can go on being part of such an organisation. Of course it is true that every human organisation is exposed to fraud, corruption, mismanagement or waste; there is no such thing as perfection in these matters. If I look back to the Conservative Government, there were egregious cases of waste and, indeed, corruption in the national health service in Wales at one point. We have also had corruption in local government. One can never clear that up completely. This country has a very good record, and northern Europe as a whole has a very good record and good traditions in this matter, particularly Germany, Scandinavia and the Netherlands. Therefore, by world standards, such cases are few and far between, but they exist in all institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027.1/3">I suspect that the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West knows this, but I do not know whether the other Conservative Eurosceptic Members do, or whether they are genuinely bemused by their own rhetoric or that of the Tory press. The fact of the matter, however, is that the Court of Auditors has not for many years put a reserve on the Commission's accounts. It has criticised not the Commission or the institutions of the Union, but the member states, which in many cases distribute the money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027.1/4">The logic behind the criticisms made of waste or corruption in the European Union is that we should have a federalist policy, and that member states should stop distributing structural funds and agricultural support of various kinds. The Commission should do it directly, and there is every chance, given its record, that it would do it very well. I have a little experience of the Commission, and it is a superb bureaucracy. There are few bureaucracies around the world that are so professional, good, clean, well motivated, efficient and so small in relation to the money that they are disbursing&mdash;even if it has 20,000 people, that is a small number in comparison with bureaucracies around the world and the money that they disburse. Getting 300 directives through and creating the single market in a few years was a formidable achievement. I am not advocating a federalist policy, but that is the logic of what Conservative Members are saying&mdash;they will not like it, but I ask them to examine honestly the logic of their criticism.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027.1/5">The problem lies in the member states, not in the Commission. If the Conservative party thinks that a radical solution is required, it ought to be a federal solution, extending the competence of the Commission and reducing the role of the member states. That would be a logical solution, but is it the solution that the Conservative party is suggesting? No, because the Conservative party will not recognise reality. The Conservative party will not draw the logical conclusions from its own position. The Conservative party will simply go on talking contradictory nonsense&mdash;for that it is what it is: it is contradictory and it is nonsense, and it is about time that it was exposed as such. But that is extremely difficult in this country, because the Eurosceptic press will never reproduce the points that I am making. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Of course it will not: we know that. So the public are genuinely bemused about the issue, which is extremely worrying. Here is a consistent and systematic libel&mdash;it is no less a libel for being consistent and systematic, and for being pursued for many years&mdash;which has infected public opinion about the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="b.1029.1/1">Will the hon. Gentleman give me a moment?</p>
	<p pid="b.1029.1/2">I do not think the Eurosceptics should be proud of that achievement. I do not think they should be proud of having deceived the public. I think they should be ashamed of using such methods, and I hope that the more honest among them will now examine the facts. I hope that they will look at the report from the European Court of Auditors, which they will find in the Library. If they do, they will see that I am right. The reserves, I repeat, relate to the member states' role in the disbursement of Union funds, not to the Commission and the other institutions of the Union itself. That is very important.</p>
	<p pid="b.1029.1/3">It is clear to me that the Conservative party is engaged in pure political opportunism. The Conservatives do not wish to draw the logical conclusions of their own policies, and they do not wish the public to draw those conclusions. They want to be all things to all men. They want to go in for doublespeak. They want to go around the Conservative clubs and talk to the chauvinists there. We all know that such people exist in Conservative clubs throughout the country, and I have met a great many of them over the past 20 years. The Conservatives want to go around those clubs and say, &quot;Get these nasty foreigners out. We aren't going to let our country be taken over by France and Germany,&quot; and so on. They want to come out with all that rhetoric, which will be popular in their constituencies and with the Tory party, but they know that it will not play with those on the middle ground of politics, so they will say to those people, &quot;Oh no, we really believe in our membership of the European Union; we're totally signed up to it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1029.1/4">I can give two reasons&mdash;indeed, I could give more&mdash;why it is clear that the Conservatives are not genuinely signed up. One is their policy on the European People's party, which was a gratuitous unprovoked insult to those who had been their best friends for generations. <i> [Interruption.] </i>That is what it was, and how can they possibly expect it to be forgotten? We are talking about having a relationship with someone, signing an agreement agreeing to sit with someone&mdash;in this case, in the European Parliament&mdash;for five years, and then saying &quot;We're going to tear up this agreement because we don't like it. We're going to spit in your face.&quot; Do the Tories really think that if they ever came to power, that would be forgotten? Do they really think that a bank of good will would be waiting for them if, by some awful mischance, they ever found themselves in Downing street? They would be far less well placed to negotiate anything on behalf of this country; that is absolutely clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.1029.1/5">What will happen if the House turns down the Bill tonight? Let us again draw the logical conclusions from the Conservatives' position, for they do not want to do it themselves. There will be an unnecessary and gratuitous crisis in our relations with the European Union. People will say, &quot;The British Government signed up to this, and then backed out of it.&quot; The east Europeans will say, &quot;My goodness me! We thought that the British were our friends, we thought that they supported us in enlargement, and now the Tory party has got itself a majority in Parliament&quot;&mdash;if that were ever to happen, which I trust it will not&mdash;&quot;and turned the deal down.&quot; It would take a long, long time to restore our reputation for good faith after that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1029.1/6">I put it to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that there are only two possible explanations. Either the Tory party has not realised the logic of its position, or it has, and it wants a crisis in our relations with the EU. That is why the Tories talk nonsense about pulling out of the common fisheries policy or the social chapter. It is really shorthand for creating a crisis and putting us in an impossible position&mdash;a position in which we could not pursue the principles that they have set out, and will I suppose set out in their manifesto, and still maintain our full membership of the European Union. That is a very serious matter for the House, and I am glad that the Tories have so blatantly revealed what is clearly their agenda.</p>

	<p pid="b.1030.0/1">Thank you for calling me to speak in this important debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.1030.0/2">If the Bill is passed tonight, it will set a dangerous precedent. It will mean that every time a new wave of relatively poor countries joins the European Union, we in the United Kingdom will somehow have to give up more of our taxpayers' money to support those new member states. As I told <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2025" name="Quentin Davies">the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase>, the Foreign Secretary has stated publicly that he wants to expand the European Union to include countries in north Africa and beyond. The hon. Gentleman disputes that. Only time will tell, but what is genuinely agreed on all sides is that Turkey will inevitably wish to join the European Union and become a full and active member.</p>
	<p pid="b.1030.0/3">I met the Serbian Foreign Minister today. He spoke of his concern about the possibility of Kosovo's becoming independent. If that happens, Kosovo will want to join the European Union as well. Many other poor countries either wish to join the EU or are in the process of actively submitting application forms. Ukraine, Georgia, Bosnia, Macedonia&mdash;all those countries are very poor, and will require massive financial assistance. At a time when budgets are being tightened here in our own country, with an ageing population and a massive borrowing requirement, the Government want us to go on bailing those countries out. I understand that we, as a nation, are already &pound;700 billion in debt.</p>

	<p pid="b.1030.1/1">Given the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, does he agree with the comments of his party leader in a speech to the conference of the Movement for European Reform on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-06">6 March</phrase> this year? He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1030.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The prospect of eventual Turkish membership is hugely important&mdash;not just for Turkey itself, but to demonstrate to the Muslim world that the EU is not an exclusive Christian club.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1031.0/1">No, I do not wish Turkey to be a member of the European Union. As I said, we are currently &pound;700 billion in debt as a nation, and this year alone we borrowed &pound;34 billion. My constituents will find it extremely difficult to comprehend how the Government could forgo such a huge rebate when we are borrowing so much money and our own public services are at breaking point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031.0/2">The Chief Secretary says that this is all about helping eastern European countries, and that we in the Conservative party are against eastern Europeans because we oppose the Bill. I feel very angry and upset about his comments. Never, in two and a half years, have I sat in the Chamber and been so incensed and appalled as I am by rhetoric of that kind. The Chief Secretary claims that we are against Poles because we are not prepared to give them huge financial subsidies. I feel very insulted by him. This is the arrogance of power. This is what the Labour Government are all about: they cannot justify giving up the rebate, so they want to insult us by saying that we are against eastern Europeans. What I object to is our country, the United Kingdom, footing almost the entire bill for the assistance of eastern European countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031.0/3">Of course all of us in the Chamber want to help those countries, which underwent a terrible experience during the days of communism and the iron curtain. However, we have helped them a great deal in the past. It was Britain, and Margaret Thatcher, who insisted that they enter NATO and become members of the European Union. We wrote off all the debts that they had incurred during the days of communism. We have always stood by the Poles, far more than many other European Union countries, and what the Minister said was very misleading.</p>

	<p pid="b.1031.2/1">Yes, of course I retract that and apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031.2/2">We are also one of the few countries that have allowed Poles and other eastern Europeans to come in and work, and they have made a tremendous contribution. The way to help the Poles, however, is to facilitate trade between our two countries; we should do everything possible to help British companies trade with Poland and other eastern European countries. Vast state subsidies and giving up our own rebate are not the answer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1031.3/1">The hon. Gentleman talks about helping the Poles. Does he think it would be helpful to them if we&mdash;the UK&mdash;got a windfall from enlargement and their joining the EU?</p>

	<p pid="b.1031.4/1">Nobody is talking about us getting a windfall from them. Conservative Members are scrutinising the Government on how they managed to give up such a large slice of our UK rebate, which is a totally different matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031.4/2">The Minister will not be surprised to hear that I have been to eastern Europe on many occasions. During visits to farms in Romania, for instance, we find that they are taking a great deal of our British taxpayers' money, but simply not complying with the rules and regulations that our farmers have to comply with.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031.4/3">We should have stood up for the British national interest during these negotiations. As hon. Friends have said, we should have used the veto in these discussions on the rebate. We are too important and big a country not to be able to stand up and use our veto. That would have been possible, and it should have been used.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031.4/4">We have tremendous support across Europe, not necessarily over the rebate but certainly over the future of the EU. Many eastern European countries are very troubled about Brussels railroading them on some of their concerns and the Franco-German control of agenda setting in the EU. They want to challenge that stranglehold, and they look to the UK for leadership. I feel passionately about that and will try to help my party find the right-of-centre partners in eastern Europe that the Minister spoke about. <i> [Interruption.] </i>He laughs from a sedentary position, but there are in fact many young right-of-centre politicians across Europe, such as myself, who feel passionately about having a European Union of sovereign states that trade and want to work together in co-operation, but also to guard their own sovereignty. There are a lot of them; I can assure the Minister that I myself have spoken to many young right-of-centre politicians from across eastern Europe who will work together to ensure that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031.4/5">In 1984 Margaret Thatcher showed that it was possible for the UK to fight for a rebate, and I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous courage she displayed all those years ago in standing up for our country's interests. It is clear that the current Prime Minister played a large role in the debacle over handing back our EU rebate. He was in constant contact with the former Prime Minister&mdash;Blair. He has built a reputation of having been an iron Chancellor, but he displayed a great deal of weakness over the EU rebate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031.4/6">I wish to put it on the record that I am very disappointed about the lack of help from Poland and other eastern European states in the negotiations over the UK rebate. I have openly stated to many politicians from Poland and other eastern European countries how disappointed I am that they did not come to our aid over these critical negotiations. Britain has done more for Poland than any other European country has, and it is very disappointing that on this one occasion when Britain needed help and support from her allies in eastern Europe, Poland and others did not do anything to support us. Britain was, after all, at the forefront of getting them into the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031.4/7">Little has been said about the accounts, which have not been signed off. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford suggested that Opposition Members were trying to whip up hysteria about them. While trying not to be rabid on the issue, I must say to him that it is concerning if the media report repeatedly, year after year, that there have been complications and difficulties with the auditing of accounts. All of us want to ensure that those accounts are watertight and can be presented to constituents as representing value for money.</p>

	<p pid="b.1032.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman confront for a moment a point that I put, which is the truth: the criticism is not to do with the Commission, as the problems are in the member states? If he understands that, he will see that this issue cannot be used as an argument against the EU itself. It is not the EU or its institutions that are in any way corrupt or wasteful&mdash;or if they are, it is only to a very minor degree&mdash;and the auditors have not made such a suggestion for years. The problems exist in member states, and especially some in southern Europe. The problems could be resolved by having a more federalist concentration of power in the EU. Does he want that?</p>

	<p pid="b.1033.0/1">No, I do not want that, but I want the accounts to be properly vetted so that there is more transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033.0/2">Eastern European countries are struggling to spend the existing vast sums of money that they have been given. During my various trips to Warsaw, people have confided in me that there are difficulties with some of the time scales that the EU has given the Poles to spend the money on infrastructure, as they are unrealistic. It is expecting the Poles to spend billions of pounds on building vast motorway networks across the country when that will simply not be feasible within the time frames given, due to environmental considerations and all the other complications that, as the Minister will be aware, major infrastructure projects inevitably bring about.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033.0/3">The Minister did not mention at all in his speech where the money was going, and I was slightly disappointed about that. If he is so confident that this British taxpayers' money will be of great benefit, it is a disappointment that he did not have one or two examples to share with the House as to what it could be spent on. I would have liked to hear an assurance from the Minister that some of the money would be spent on helping these countries reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. Owing to its communist past, Poland has hugely inefficient steel plants, such as Nowa Huta in Krakow, that belt out hundreds of thousands of tonnes of emissions. It would be at least nice for some of the money to be spent on helping countries to reduce their CO2 emissions, so I look forward to hearing in the winding-up speech how some of the money will be spent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033.0/4">The Minister spoke a lot about eastern Europe, but he did not mention British overseas territories. Having spoken to representatives of the Cayman islands, the Turks and Caicos islands and many other British overseas territories, I know that they get a raw deal from the EU. They are currently experiencing terrible problems in getting their hands on money to which they are entitled under European Union terms. Will the Minister assure me that the rebate that he has given away does not affect British overseas territories, and will he give me a commitment that he will help the Governments of the Cayman islands and the Turks and Caicos islands get what they are entitled to? They are fighting to get their fair share and they are coming across a great deal of red tape and bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase> mentioned her concerns about parts of rural England not receiving their fair share of money. I represent a rural part of the UK&mdash;Shropshire&mdash;that has massive underinvestment in basic public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033.0/6">If I may, I shall explain why I am so vehemently opposed to this outflow of money to eastern Europe. The reason is the problems that we face in the United Kingdom on public services. I visited Coleham primary school in Shrewsbury in my constituency. Its headmistress has worked out that she receives &pound;711 less per pupil than the average per child funding&mdash;I am not talking about the best schools&mdash;and that equates to a &pound;300,000 shortfall for one primary school in my constituency. I asked how that affects her. She said, &quot;Clearly we cannot buy certain books or put the heating on when we would like, and we have various problems.&quot; How can we be experiencing such problems in the fourth wealthiest country in the world, yet at the same time be giving so much to eastern Europe?</p>
	<p pid="b.1033.0/7">The Royal Shrewsbury hospital is millions of pounds in debt. I have told the relevant Minister that we have a huge funding shortfall. Our local education authority is ranked 145th out of 149 LEAs for funding. Later this evening, I shall present a 16,000-signature petition that aims to prevent the closure of Shrewsbury ambulance control centre. Can one imagine such a thing? At the same time, the socialists are giving my taxpayers' money to the eastern Europeans&mdash;it is unbelievable.</p>

	<p pid="b.1034.1/1">No. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that he did not want to give an analysis on Iceland, and I will not start giving an analysis on nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1034.1/2">I believe that much of this is about how effective the negotiators were in dealing with the rebate. Today, if one speaks to Icelandic politicians&mdash;we are returning to the theme of Iceland&mdash;one finds that they still talk in derogatory terms about how Roy Hattersley negotiated the fishing stocks between Britain and Iceland back in 1978. They still laugh at that. In political circles in Reykjavik it is still talked about, and people there say that the poor negotiation and his poor performance as a negotiator cost the United Kingdom millions of pounds. The deal before us will be talked about in 20, 30 and 40 years' time as an appallingly bad negotiated settlement that has cost our taxpayers and our children billions of pounds.</p>

	<p pid="b.1034.2/1">I do not want to follow on from what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> said, but I must put him right on Iceland. What he mentioned was not done by Roy Hattersley and it did not happen in 1978, because he was not in the Foreign Office at that time. The settlement was in 1976 and the proposals that Roy Hattersley turned down were made in 1974. The hon. Gentleman would have done better to stay off Iceland altogether. Apart from that, he made a good speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.1034.2/2">This is a nice opportunity to take part in one of the three-monthly contests between Eurosceptics and Euro-enthusiasts on which we spend so much time in this House. It is nice to welcome two new Ministers in the field as umpires or referees in the contest&mdash;my congratulations to both of them. I shall not put forward a view that accords with their policy or with official policy, because I shall not vote for this measure, and I would not want to give the impression that speeches by Labour Members will be, with one exception, that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>, panegyrics on Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1034.2/3">I am sorry that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2025" name="Quentin Davies">my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase>&mdash;my new Friend&mdash;has left the Chamber, but it was good to see him get all that accumulated bile about the Conservative party off his chest. I am sure that it did him a lot of good. It was interesting to see, but I do not think that those views will do him as much good under our new leadership as they would have done under the previous leadership until July&mdash;the bid is a bit late.</p>
	<p pid="b.1034.2/4">The basic problem that we face with this Bill is that it adds to the costs of belonging to the European Union, which are already unacceptably high for this country. After Germany, which is much more generous and committed towards Europe, we have long been the second highest contributor. That situation has been compounded by the concessions made on the rebate by our previous Prime Minister, whose name slips my mind temporarily, earlier in the year without much consultation with Labour Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.1034.2/5">The rebate was negotiated wisely by Mrs. Thatcher, because it addressed some of the problems that the structures and financing of the European Union placed on this country unfairly and unequally. However, it was wrong to give up any part of that rebate, and in particular to do so without concessions in the negotiations in return. One should not just make generous impulsive offers and throw all one's cards on the table</p>
	<p pid="b.1034.2/6">Europe is a matter of continuous negotiation, albeit a rather annoying and embittering one. In the negotiation, one must play one's cards and games in return for sacrifices. My concern is that there were no reciprocal gains and we got nothing in the negotiations, either on the treaty, which was also in play and being negotiated at the same time, or on the budget situation that has been so damaging to this country. Before those concessions, our contributions, which will increase under this Bill, were between &pound;7 billion and &pound;8 billion gross over the past few years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1035.0/1">The previous Prime Minister, when negotiating rebate reform, stated that European partners had arrived at a quid pro quo in respect of CAP reform.

	<p pid="b.1035.1/1">The so-called concession on the CAP was not worth the paper that it was not written on. Our experience of the CAP indicates the difficulty. The new settlement will be in 2013, but I do not imagine that we shall get any substantial concessions from the French. Indeed, this reminds me very much of the Berlin negotiations on Agenda 2000, when some concessions had been made on the CAP but then in marched President Chirac who cancelled the whole lot and took them back. This issue has been impossible to address. Every party in this country has promised at every election a fundamental reform of the CAP, but we have not got one.</p>
	<p pid="b.1035.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said that the negotiations have set the CAP expenditure on a remorseless downward path, but that is nonsense. It has been reducing as a proportion, but it has been increasing as a total, and it still represents well over half the annual EU budget going to 5 per cent. of the EU electorate. That goes to show what the EU's preoccupations are, so he was wrong to say that there has been a concession.</p>

	<p pid="b.1036.1/1">My hon. Friend is a fount of wisdom and sagacity, and I am always delighted to be corrected on any issue that is damaging to the European Union. So the trend is up for the proportion now, although it had been heading down for some time. Anyway, the CAP is very boring and I want to move on&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1036.2/1">The hon. Gentleman mentions the CAP. There is no question but that it needs reform and we all have our own issues with it, but at 0.4 per cent.&mdash;less than half a per cent.&mdash;it has provided secure food supplies for decades in Europe. It has also, to some extent, been a social tool to protect the most fragile economies in some of the most remote and rural areas. We all want to see changes in the subsidies for big agro-business, but what other changes would the hon. Gentleman make that might weaken or damage the good things that the CAP has delivered for many decades for a small proportion of Europe's income?</p>

	<p pid="b.1036.3/1">I do not want to make changes: I just want to scrap it. That would be the sensible thing to do, because then we could support our own agriculture in our own way. That is enough for now on the CAP, but the key point is that it is a massive budgetary contribution to a small section of the European economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036.3/2">Before the changes proposed in this Bill, our gross contribution to Europe over the past few years was between &pound;7 billion and &pound;8 billion a year, and our net receipt&mdash;the money that the EU graciously gives us back&mdash;was between &pound;3 billion and &pound;4 billion a year. That is our money with their costs deducted to spend on purposes that they see fit. It annoys me, as it does my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, to see on every dogs' home or retirement home for eurocrats the sign with the stars saying that it was built with European money. It was not built with European money, because it is our money that we have been given back, with their costs deducted. We could spend all that money for our own purposes much more effectively&mdash;and certainly not on the CAP.</p>

	<p pid="b.1036.4/1">In some ways, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, if one looks further north&mdash;latitude may have something to do with it&mdash;Norway and Iceland spend more money per capita supporting their own agriculture to ensure a secure food supply than do EU members. A secure food supply is not dependent on the existence of the CAP.</p>

	<p pid="b.1037.0/1">Yes, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037.0/2">The Bill will increase our gross contribution to &pound;10 billion&mdash;which will rise to some &pound;20 billion after 2013&mdash;and the net receipt to &pound;6 billion. I ask those hon. Members who say what a benefit the system is to the rest of Europe to envisage how many roads, schools, hospitals and health centres could be built here, at our discretion and for our purposes, if we were not making that annual contribution. We are told to rejoice that Italy and France are now beginning to pay something after all the years of paying nothing, but the proportionate increase in their contribution is less than in ours, and we have been making the second highest contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037.0/3">Our Government's contribution is about 0.5 per cent. of our GDP, and that is important, because that is the growth from which the people of this country benefit, but it is not our only contribution to Europe. We also make contributions to European institutions of &pound;1.8 billion in total, including for instance the blessings of the Galileo project, which is to send 20 flying pigs into space to bounce back a location system that we get free from the Americans at the moment, so that our motorists and defence forces can pay for it. I come back to the CAP&mdash;I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> will rejoice. The net cost of the CAP to us, by the OECD's estimate, is &pound;15 billion a year. That is partly in distortions to the market, but it is also the cost of not buying the cheaper food that is available on world markets, and being forced to buy the overpriced production from Europe. What could we do with that &pound;15 billion?</p>
	<p pid="b.1037.0/4">Then there is the cost of the European regulations that are showered on us, some necessary and some not. Estimates vary and some are higher than others, but let us say &pound;25 billion a year. Add that lot up and we are contributing between &pound;45 billion and &pound;60 billion a year to belong to that institution. It is some 2 per cent. of GDP, so in other words our growth would have been 2 per cent. faster each year had we not been making those contributions. That growth is cumulative, so at the end of 10 years our economy would have been that much more powerful&mdash;and that much better able to contribute to the needs of developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037.0/5">Cumulative growth has been lost, and that is a burden that has been assumed without asking the British people, and it is also a loss across the exchanges. We are in a substantial and growing balance of payments deficit, and we are adding to that by the flow across the exchanges. We have already suffered damage to manufacturing in this country. When we joined, we had a surplus in manufacturing trade with Europe. Now we have a steadily growing annual deficit. We have paid for that in previous years through a surplus with the rest of the world, but that has now gone, too. There is a massive drain on the balance of payments, which will only get worse if we carry on this course.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037.0/6">Where has all that money gone? Where does the &pound;45 billion to &pound;60 billion go? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">My right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase>, who is working hard for his European knighthood or whatever will come at the end of his long travails, said that it was going to help the Poles. Well, that is a wonderful purpose, and I am glad to help the Poles. I do not mind them: in fact, I quite like them coming here to help us, because our contribution does not keep them there. But what right has my right hon. Friend, or any other of my right hon. and hon. Friends, to be so generous with our money for those purposes?</p>
	<p pid="b.1037.0/7">Where has the money gone? It cannot all have gone to pay Mrs. Cresson's dentist the massive sums that he was receiving for advising in her office. It cannot all have gone on corruption, which adds 10 per cent. to so many budgets&mdash;all of them unqualified. My new hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford was quite wrong to say that it was not the Commission's spending, because it is the programmes that the corruption occurs in, and Europe is responsible for those programmes. Is the money going to the Spanish, to build fishing vessels to come and catch our fish and take it off to Spain? Is it going to farmers in the Republic of Ireland and France? I am sure that they do better out of the CAP and the aid than do the Poles, who are the poorest in Europe. Where is our money going and what benefit do we get from it?</p>

	<p pid="b.1038.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about the amount of money that will flow out of our country to eastern Europe. Is he aware that the debts of some countries in eastern Europe, such as Poland, are nothing like the national debt of this country, which is more than &pound;700 billion and rising? So it is nonsensical for our British taxpayers to give Poland money when our national debt is increasing at a much faster rate than its is.</p>

	<p pid="b.1038.1/1">If I accepted that specious point I should be criticising my leader and I would never ever do that. Let us say that there is a contribution across the exchanges rather than an assessment of the budgetary position.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038.1/2">What benefits do we get? There is a mantra. The Government and Euro-enthusiasts always tell us that inestimable benefits flow from Europe. They say inestimable, as a reason for not estimating them. Year after year I have tabled questions asking for a balance sheet of the gains and losses of our membership of the EU. Lord Pearson, who represents the provisional wing of the UK Independence party in the House of Lords, tables an annual motion asking for a balance sheet, but we are never told what the benefits are.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038.1/3">We are told that many jobs are dependent on Europe. That is just not true; those jobs would exist whether we were in the EU or out of it. Exports and trade would continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.1038.2/1">It is argued that one of the benefits of EU membership involves fiscal transfers. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there may also be many inestimable benefits to the European economic area, witness Iceland, Norway and Switzerland?</p>

	<p pid="b.1038.3/1">The countries that have done best economically are outside the European Union, especially smaller countries such as Switzerland and Iceland. They do not have to bear the EU's burdens, so they have had much faster growth than us. EU growth has been laggard.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038.3/2">What benefits do we get? We certainly cannot claim the common fisheries policy as a benefit. No one would defend that. Nobody seems to claim the CAP as a benefit, apart perhaps from the hon. Member for Dundee, East who said it brought stability, but it brings stability at enormous cost and distorts our market.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038.3/3">Nobody would say that the other common policy&mdash;foreign and defence policy&mdash;has achieved much. How successful was it in Yugoslavia? It was largely responsible for breaking up Yugoslavia. The EU was pushed into intervention in Kosovo by President Clinton. Look how united and solid the EU was on Iraq, where it fell into squabbling camps. In Afghanistan, we are being left to bear the brunt of the fighting and death while German troops have to clock off for tea at 5. Again the burdens fall on us.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038.3/4">As my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North said, there have been two surveys of the costs and benefits. The Swiss drew up an honest balance sheet for their Department of Foreign Affairs. It indicated that the burdens of Europe would take 1 per cent. from their annual growth. A French think-tank&mdash;pro-Government&mdash;obviously influenced Sarkozy, who wants the European Bank to lower the exchange rate and interest rates to make the euro more competitive. The French survey showed that economic and monetary union has damaged growth and turned Europe into the high-unemployment, low-growth blackspot of the advanced world. There have been glimmerings of growth in Germany&mdash;I am sure my new hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford would intervene at this point&mdash;but the EU is growing far slower than any other part of the world.</p>

	<p pid="b.1039.0/1">Recently there has been a softening of attitudes towards the euro, especially by the UK media. The euro has appreciated against the dollar and that could be seen as a sign of success, but in many respects it has become even more restricted as a currency, which presents even greater dangers were we ever to join it. Does my hon. Friend agree?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.1039.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" speakername="Austin Mitchell" colnum="1039"  time="020:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0017.htm#07111935000178">
	<p pid="b.1039.1/1">I am grateful that we did not join the euro. Our present Prime Minister kept us out. The euro is going up as the dollar comes down. People are coming out of dollar stocks and there is a policy of benign neglect of the dollar, which improves the US exporting economy because it is picking up as domestic consumer demand falls, but European manufacturing will suffer. The problem for us is where we should be in that equation. My view is that we should try to reduce the exchange rate through lower interest rates, although I do not want to go into that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1039.1/2">I want to know what benefits we are getting from the contribution enshrined in the Bill. Euro-enthusiasm has in some respects replaced socialism as a credo on the Labour Benches. The Liberals believe in &quot;My Europe, right or wrong&quot;, or perhaps &quot;My Europe mainly right, very occasionally wrong but we don't talk about it&quot;. However, the wealth of nations is built by hard-headed realism, not by impulsive romantic gestures, not by naivety and certainly not by being the slave of a dead ideology&mdash;Keynes' critique&mdash;repeating a pointless mantra about the inestimable benefits of EU membership.</p>
	<p pid="b.1039.1/3">We have to be realistic and hard-headed. The reality is that we would be better off out, sloughing off the burdens of Europe, trading with the wider world and co-operating with the nations with which we share problems rather than achieving that co-operation by financing a huge superstructure of marble palaces in Brussels, a play-away Parliament, a massive bureaucracy and all the failed programmes that go with it. That is the reality.</p>

	<p pid="b.1040.1/1">No, I am grinding slowly to a halt. It is a painful process for the House that I do not particularly want to interrupt.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.1/2">Reality is not mindlessly handing over money to every demand or mindlessly saying that we benefit from an institution that is in fact doing us harm, and which is constructing over our heads a state that will be set above our own nation state. We need an honest, objective measurement of the benefits and debits of membership&mdash;I hope we shall be given it by our Government. That would be a sensible basis for making a decision about our relationship with Europe. The decision may take the Euro-enthusiast direction that my new hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford and my old friend, the right hon. Member for Rotherham, want, but it may not. People may ask, &quot;Why should we spend all this money? Why should we donate all this money and suffer disadvantages and losses? Why shouldn't we build up our economic strength and decide our economic destiny?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.1/3">Let us see the balance sheet; then we can decide whether we are prepared to pay. Naivety is interesting and useful&mdash;perhaps necessary&mdash;in courtship, but it is no basis for a long marriage.</p>

	<p pid="b.1040.2/1">In 1984, as a young man, I was the chief policy adviser to the then Prime Minister. One of my proudest moments in that job was when she returned from a difficult negotiation in the European Community where, thanks entirely to her skill, determination and perseverance, she obtained for the UK a most important reduction in the amount that we had to pay into the European Economic Community.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/2">It was a great negotiation because to achieve that rebate, that lady had to persuade all the other member states to her point of view. She could not block the payments that we were making because a Labour Government had agreed them. She knew they were far too high, and it was her consummate skill as a negotiator and politician that slowly persuaded all the other member states, reluctantly and gradually, to the view that Britain was getting an extremely raw deal; it was paying far too much, and justice required that more of the money should be left in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/3">As a result, the Government whom she led and those led by her two successors were able to spend more money on British public services chosen freely by the elected representatives&mdash;the majority party in this House&mdash;or to return more money to the British people to spend on their own families and businesses through tax reduction, which I greatly welcomed. That makes tonight particularly tragic, because a subsequent Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, went to a European negotiation at which all he had to do was say no. He need not have given any of that money away. He did not need any of the skills that Baroness Thatcher required to win us the rebate&mdash;he had all the cards in his hand. He merely had to say no unless and until the other members of the European Union saw the justice of the case that he was making.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/4">When the former Prime Minister moved his position, from the excellent one that there was no need to give up the rebate and that it was not negotiable, to the position that it was negotiable, I and many of my right hon. and hon. Friends had misgivings. The Opposition were prepared to listen, however, and see whether it was feasible to negotiate a much better deal on the spending side of the account, whereby the British position would not worsen, while that of all members of the Union would improve if spending could be reduced on agriculture. Such spending gets in the way of efficient agriculture in many member states and prevents developing countries from getting fair access to our markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/5">Some of my right hon. and hon. Friends withheld their criticism to wait and see whether the then Prime Minister had some negotiating skills. It beggars belief that he had absolutely no negotiating skills at all. Armed with the veto, he threw it away. Armed with a strong case to win over the new member states and the Nordic member states to the proposition that the common agricultural policy was bad and should be reformed, he was unable to persuade any of them. Tonight, we have a House of Commons with Labour Members almost in denial and about to vote through a disaster for the United Kingdom in the form of an extremely large bill that we cannot afford and do not want.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/6">The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who opened the debate, showed bravado and obviously implied that he thinks everyone in the country is a fool. He tried to present the Bill as some kind of negotiating success and a way of increasing the rebate. Yes, of course it increases the rebate, because it increases the spending by so much more. It means that Britain will end up paying far more in the seven years of the proposal than if nothing had been given away in the negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/7">I notice that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who is on the Treasury Bench, has no intention of intervening, because she knows that I am absolutely right about the huge expense. The documents reveal costings of &pound;7.4 billion at the current euro-sterling exchange rate. Given the parlous state of the national accounts, we know that every penny of that &pound;7.4 billion will have to be borrowed. If it were borrowed over, say, a 20-year period at 5 per cent.&mdash;the Government might be able to do that&mdash;there would be another &pound;7.4 billion of interest on top of the &pound;7.4 billion of capital that will need to be paid and then repaid over the 20 years of the debt. I leave out the interest on the interest, which would add to the sum even more. On the Government's own admission in the explanatory notes to the Bill&mdash;they are riddled with errors, of course, but I do not think that this figure is an error&mdash;the minimum cost to the state and the taxpayer will be &pound;7.5 billion, which, in practice, will mean &pound;15 billion or more, because they will have to borrow it and we will have to pay interest on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/8">If we look beneath the Government's guidance, we see that the true bill to the taxpayer and the British Government will be far bigger. This Government have signed up to a set of spending plans that mean that, on average, every year over the seven-year period the United Kingdom will have to pay &pound;10 billion into the European Union, after knocking off the smaller rebate, which is still in place thanks to Baroness Thatcher. That means that, in practice, there will be an underlying spending increase of &pound;70 billion over a seven-year period. Using my simple sum, if the Government borrowed that over 20 years at 5 per cent., we are talking about &pound;140 billion of first-round interest payments and capital repayments, just to see us through the seven years. At the end of the seven years, of course, we know that we would be on another escalator, because our bargaining position would be greatly weakened thanks to the Government's foolishness in giving away this most important principle and allowing the rebate to be weakened.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/9">We know that the present Government are careless with public money. They say that any Conservative plan to spend a few hundred million or the odd billion on a tax cut would produce a black hole, yet along comes a mortgage bank in trouble and they can suddenly find &pound;24 billion without batting an eyelid. Now we discover that they can apparently pledge this country to pay &pound;70 billion over the cycle of the budget proposal. We know that they can propose that only because they intend to borrow every penny of it, just as presumably they are borrowing every penny of the &pound;24 billion that they have so far made available to Northern Rock.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/10">The Chief Secretary to the Treasury produced several arguments, in the course of a long and rambling speech, for why the budget was a good deal for Britain. There was the strange argument that the rebate was going to increase, whereas we all know that there will be a worsening of the rebate and increased spending. There was then the argument that we should be extremely grateful and welcoming of the fact that, as a result of our much bigger contribution to the European Union kitty, there would be more spending in countries outside the United Kingdom. He implied that he believes that, as soon as a country gets European Union spending, it becomes more prosperous and its growth rate rises. That is a curious argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/11">During my time in politics in Britain, I have seen some parts of the United Kingdom receive European Union money. We know that they have been receiving it because, as has been pointed out in the debate, one condition of it is that recipients have to stick the 12-star flag logo all over the sign boards for the projects, whereas I believe that under British law they are not allowed to put a Union flag on anything that we fund directly. Somebody rightly pointed out that the money is ours anyway, because we put more in than we get back. We know that some places have been getting that funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040.2/12">If we look, as I have, at the income levels and growth rates in the places that receive that funding, we see two interesting things. First, the poorest parts of the country receive the money. That is not surprising, as the main condition for getting it is that they start as the poorest parts of the country. The other thing that we discover is that, under this Government in the past decade, those areas have also had the slowest growth rates. The money is clearly not kick-starting those parts of the country into greater prosperity; it is part of the problem that is holding them down.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043.1/1">I see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase>, a Cornish seat, becoming agitated, but she must know that the Cornish rate of growth has been much less than that of London or the south-east. London and the south-east are not main recipients of European aid, whereas Cornwall is. If receiving subsidy and aid triggered a big increase in the growth rate, one would expect Scotland to have been the fastest growing part of the United Kingdom in the past decade, as it has had so much extra money from all sources. Instead, we discover that Scotland has been about the slowest growing part of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is correct that there is still a large gap between Cornwall and the rest of the country, not only in GDP per head of population but in income. However, the rate of growth is now faster than the England average.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043.3/1">Growth rates in London and the south-east are far greater than that in Cornwall, which demonstrates that European Union money is not managing to do what the hon. Lady hopes. I should be delighted if that money were well spent, but one of the big problems with European Union money is that under the rules, it must be put into schemes that it would otherwise not have been put into&mdash;by definition, marginal schemes or even those that are not thought very worth while.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043.4/1">Could not the argument be made that the issue is not actually about subsidies at all? The rate of growth in the Republic of Ireland, for example, has been double that in the United Kingdom. That has happened because Ireland left the United Kingdom and set its own tax structure to suit itself. Perhaps that is not happening in Scotland because Scotland is not independent so that it can compete, match and beat the Republic of Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043.5/1">This is not a debate about Scottish independence, but I agree that cutting the tax rate is a very good way to accelerate the growth rate. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury seemed to think that subsidies to the Irish agricultural sector were the main cause of accelerated Irish growth. There is no evidence from the Irish economy that the agriculture sector has led the growth; it has been led by the service and manufacturing sectors. That is definitely the result of very low corporation tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043.6/1">On the Irish economy, my right hon. Friend might not have been here when I made the point that there is an excellent book by Mr. Roy Foster called &quot;Luck and the Irish&quot; demonstrating that the money put in by the European Union has been less effective in increasing Ireland's prosperity than American money and tax reductions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1044.0/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend's endorsement of my case. So much European money went into the agriculture sector in Ireland, but that is not the great success story. The success story is in those sectors that have attracted large sums of foreign capital to create new businesses, which in turn have attracted a lot of talented Irish people back to Ireland to discover that it is a place where they can have very good careers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1044.1/1">Some economists argue that the agriculture subsidies not only did not help the Irish economy but hindered it in some ways, because resources were allocated to a less productive sector of the economy than they might have been.</p>

	<p pid="b.1044.2/1">Again, the hon. Gentleman makes a helpful and sensible intervention. I hope that Ministers are listening; they might learn from it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1044.2/2">To return to my argument, all too often the projects financed by the European Union are marginal, or, in economists' terms, sub-optimal&mdash;not those that one would choose for oneself. That is the role of the scheme. As the sage from Great Grimsby was saying a few minutes ago, would it not be much better if in some cases we could choose the projects ourselves and spend our own money on them without the middleman&mdash;without having to send the cheque to Brussels and then get some of it back after jumping through various hoops to prove that the project is one with which we would not otherwise have gone ahead? It is a rather crazy way to spend money.</p>

	<p pid="b.1044.3/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman think that there is a benefit to investing in high-risk projects? Those projects often give the opportunity for the greatest returns, although they might not be viable in their own right or have the resources to take on that risk themselves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.1044.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" speakername="John Redwood" colnum="1044"  time="020:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0017.htm#07111935000193">
	<p pid="b.1044.4/1">The hon. Lady should read a history of the 1970s, when we had a Government who thought that backing winners was a good idea, and every one turned out to be a flop or a loser. Maybe we are returning to that in the Government's latest approach to choosing investment projects and dealing with European Union funding. One begins to worry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1044.4/2">The Chief Secretary's next argument was that this had not all been in vain. Although perhaps in his more honest moments he accepts that we are talking about a very big bill&mdash;at least &pound;7.5 billion and maybe &pound;70 billion&mdash;he said, &quot;Ah, but there will definitely be agricultural reform.&quot; That has already been revealed as a curious opinion given the attitude of the French, who will be in the chair of the European Union when the so-called review occurs. The language of the European Union has already downgraded the review, and the French have made it clear that they do not wish major reforms of the common agricultural policy to occur under their chairmanship. We come back to the question of how to negotiate. I always thought that when negotiating, if one is minded to make a concession in order to gain a concession from the other side, one makes sure not to make one's concession until the other side makes theirs. That is what good negotiating is about. It is quite extraordinary to make a massive concession for 2007, and then say that in five or six years' time, somebody might discuss making a concession the other way. Why on earth should they give us anything when we have negotiated in such a stupid way?</p>

	<p pid="b.1045.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. As others have revealed in this debate, it is not even clear that the proportion spent on agriculture is falling, although it is certainly clear that the amount spent on agriculture continues to rise. That is the French agenda, which has a lot of supporters in the European Union. I do not believe that the Government have a majority in Europe to support a significant change, and they certainly do not have unanimity on fundamental change, which is what they require.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045.1/2">Even worse, we know that quite a bit of the &pound;70 billion that we have been asked to contribute will be spent on programmes to which the auditors will not be able to give a clean bill of health. Extraordinarily, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2025" name="Quentin Davies">the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase> has told us that that does not count, because such fraud, malpractice or misspending occurs in member states rather than as a direct result of European Commission action. However, all that money is spent under European Union rules.</p>

	<p pid="b.1045.2/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way again; he has been very kind. To control misspending, does he agree that there should be a cap on the amount that certain individuals receive, which would mean that people such as the Duke of Westminster, who is a very wealthy landowner, would not receive obscene amounts from the CAP?</p>

	<p pid="b.1045.3/1">I do not want to personalise the debate in that rather unsophisticated way. However, I make common cause with the hon. Gentleman in saying that too much money is spent through the CAP. The CAP should be reformed and that money should be repatriated. Too much money is also spent through a lot of other programmes. As the auditors have revealed, regardless of who technically spends the money, it is spent on European programmes, and all too often it is spent wastefully or even fraudulently, which should be a grave concern to us all.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045.3/2">I cannot say to the people of Wokingham, &quot;I voted tonight to make sure that you will pay more tax in order to spend another &pound;70 billion over the next EU budgetary period, and some of that money will be wasted, frittered or even spent fraudulently.&quot; As someone who looks at the auditor's reports from time to time, I cannot satisfy myself that that money will be well spent from now on and that we should relax. The money would be more likely to be well spent with proper investigation and control if it were spent closer to the people who paid the tax, rather than if it were to go through the intermediation of a remote and bureaucratic system of government on the continent before coming back here or to other member states to be spent by officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045.3/3">One of the myths of the EU is that it has a small and very effective bureaucracy. By remote control, the EU employs hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats throughout EU member states. Those bureaucrats might as well work for the EU, because they are doing the EU's bidding&mdash;I am glad that that is not the case, because they would be asked to do even more things with which many of my hon. Friends and I undoubtedly disagree.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045.3/4">I urge all sensible Labour MPs to vote against the Bill tonight. Those who vote for it will vote for more British taxpayers' money to be spent in faraway places, sometimes on fraudulent, incompetent or badly run schemes. They will vote for this country to borrow yet more money, which it cannot afford, and to pay yet more interest. They will vote for a further deterioration in the way in which this country's budgets are run by this Government. They will vote for the results of a negotiation that was so maladroit that our previous Prime Minister gave away a wonderful set of opportunities that another Prime Minister had negotiated for us without getting anything in return.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045.3/5">This is an extremely sad day for the United Kingdom. It is a sad day for this Parliament, and it is a day that Ministers will come to rue. Ministers should understand that they are in a big borrowing hole. They have the black hole of Northern Rock, and they have the black hole of this Bill. Labour Members will find that there is less public spending for their constituencies, and Conservative Members will find that there are fewer opportunities to cut the burden of tax on the British people so that we can prosper more.</p>

	<p pid="b.1046.0/1">&quot;We surrender; now let us negotiate.&quot; That seems to have been the Government's stance when they went to Brussels. Throughout the discussions&mdash;during the original negotiations, subsequently and again today&mdash;an entirely false dichotomy has been posed. We supposedly have either to accept anything at all that the European Union proposes, or to leave the EU, which would result in the collapse of civilisation as we know it. Those are not the alternatives&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]</i> I am glad to see the Chief Secretary nodding in agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046.0/2">Remember that exactly the same position was put forward when joining the euro was mooted. For a period, people said that if we did not join, the economy would collapse: 10 zillion jobs were going to go, and there would be a wasteland from John O'Groats to Land's End. Well, we did not join the euro, and lo and behold, the economy has gone from strength to strength, thanks not only to the brilliance of the former Chancellor, who is now the Prime Minister, but to the correctness of that decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046.0/3">Nowadays, not only can I not find anybody in favour of Britain joining the euro, but I find it almost impossible to find anybody who was ever in favour of it&mdash;such has been the process of re-education.</p>

	<p pid="b.1047.1/1">I see the Economic Secretary to the Treasury shaking her head; I presume that she is still one of the true believers, as befits somebody who used to be the chief economist for Britain in Europe&mdash;hardly an impartial organisation on such matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/2">It would be right for us to reject the proposals and for the Government to stand up for British interests. The budget negotiations were meant to rely on real reform as a quid pro quo for additional payments from the United Kingdom, but it is absolutely clear that there has been no real reform in the EU budget as a result of our conceding a substantial chunk of our rebate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/3">The Prime Minister and I completely agree on the need to repatriate to the United Kingdom expenditure on structural funds. As has been said, no value whatever is added by the process of passing money to Brussels, handling fees being taken off, and some of the money coming back to us for projects in this country. All that involves is a transfer of political power to Brussels, which allows politicians there to make decisions about which projects should be supported and which should not, and under which rules. Such issues would be far better handled in this country. It would be much better to dispense with the system whereby Brussels handles the structural funding throughout the European Union, and I shall come in a moment to how I think that ought to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/4">I have similar thoughts about the common agricultural policy in the UK. As far as I can see, for a long time there have been very few reforms in the CAP. As has been said, the policy basically operates as a wealth transfer system, whereby poor consumers pay more for their food so that wealthy farmers can benefit. It is an obscenity that, as has been mentioned, people such as the Duke of Westminster receive enormous sums from the CAP, and will continue to do so under this scheme. Under the proposals, the undeserving rich will continue to get richer from the CAP and that financial system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/5">It is completely false to suggest that I, or many of my hon. Friends who intend to vote against this budget, oppose aid for eastern Europe. I have been in favour of widening the EU for a long time, so that is a calumny that we should in no way be prepared to accept. However, it is not helpful to handle the money that we wish to give to eastern Europe as it is currently being handled. In our relationship with eastern Europe, we should adopt two models from the Department for International Development. First, where we have little confidence in the internal systems of the country involved, we should be prepared to say, &quot;Yes, we're willing to support this project, but we'll handle it. We'll seek your help and assistance, but we will not hand the money over to the local equivalent of the Mafia, so that they can take away a huge proportion of it instead of making sure that those who deserve it receive it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/6">The second method is direct budget support. Where we have confidence in the Governments of the recipient countries, it is far better to give them aid in their budgets, as we do with many African countries that have met various good governance standards, so that they, rather than some bureaucrat in Brussels, can determine how that money should be spent. It has always seemed absurd to assume that the European Union and its bureaucrats sitting in Brussels know better what is needed in Latvia, Lithuania and other parts of eastern Europe than the people in those countries do. If we support devolution in this country, we should support devolution in the form of direct budget support across the whole of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/7">Let me turn to some concerns about the detail of the system that the Government have not yet touched on. Does the Minister accept that the Government have, as they confirmed in a written answer, agreed to a last-minute &pound;1 billion increase in the administration budget merely to ease the passage of the proposals in Brussels? Why did we concede an extra &pound;1 billion in sweeteners? That is log-rolling, and I can see no reason why we did it, or why we expect the British public to pay our share of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/8">Following the agreement in December 2005, we were told, &quot;That's it&mdash;enough is enough. This is the agreement and this is what we are going to stick to.&quot; Yet two months later the Government agreed to an increase in the European budget of &pound;2.7 billion. Why was that? It seems to display a certain inability to strike even a bad deal and then stick to it. Saying, &quot;We surrender, but if you're not happy with that, we'll surrender again later on,&quot; is not the best way of dealing with these matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/9">We have been told that the Government are very keen on transferring money to eastern Europe. However, we should be absolutely clear that it remains the position that Ireland and Belgium will be net recipients from the budget, as are Luxembourg and several other wealthy countries, whereas a country such as Cyprus, with a gross domestic product half that size, will end up as a net contributor. That is absurd. Per head, the top three recipients of EU funds will be old member states&mdash;Luxembourg, Belgium and Greece. That does not display a transfer of wealth from the EU's old western members to its new eastern members. France will be the largest single recipient of money from the EU under the negotiated settlement, which is meant to be about transferring money to the east.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/10">I fail to understand how the Government can possibly defend this as a good deal. If this is good deal, I dread to think what a bad deal would have been. It is noticeable that the Government have refused to produce statistics indicating their estimates of how much every other country in the EU will pay in and receive&mdash;except for France. If they are prepared to do it for France, I cannot see why they are unwilling to do it for other countries, unless they feel that there is something to be ashamed of.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/11">I mentioned that Luxembourg will get the most in EU spending per person, followed by Belgium and Greece, and I would be grateful if the Minister would justify that to me. This does not strike me as being a reform budget. Spain was previously the largest recipient of funds, but it has been replaced by France, and that transformation does not seem to be a brilliant piece of negotiating. Ireland is the second richest country in the EU, with an income per head 30 per cent. above average, yet it will get more money out of the budget than it puts in. I do not understand the logic of that position.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/12">In fact, the CAP currently transfers money from the poorest states to richer countries such as France and Spain. I am happy to give way on this point if the Minister wants to intervene, but in 2004 the 10 new member states paid nearly &euro;1 billion more into the CAP than they got out of it. Perhaps that situation will change over time, but how did we get into that position?</p>
	<p pid="b.1047.1/13">Why are we prepared to accept that the EU's administration costs alone will rise by 28 per cent. in real terms? At a time when we are trying to squeeze budgetary expenditure and administrative costs, why are we prepared to accept that EU administration costs will go up by 28 per cent.? Is that another brilliant example of hard negotiation?</p>

	<p pid="b.1049.1/1">Indeed, I had already touched on that. Why are we giving more money to Belgium and Luxembourg? If more money has to go on administration, we in this country have a policy of trying to disperse jobs from the rich centre to the poorer periphery. Why is that policy not being adopted by the European Union? That seems an absurdity to me.</p>

We are not giving up the rebate completely in 2007-08. We give up 20 per cent. in 2009, 70 per cent. in 2010, and we have agreed to give up 100 per cent. of the funds between 2011 and 2013. Why has that process been end-loaded? Presumably they saw us coming, and it is now much more difficult for us to negotiate our way back. We have a far more disadvantageous deal than we would if the rebate were evenly given up over the period in question. At the end, we would end up with a better figure from which to work. I remember from when I was negotiating that if we could manage to get a deal that gave us a certain percentage over a year, but it was end-loaded, we started off in a much better position in the subsequent year. I can only assume that those elementary lessons in negotiating had not been passed on to the British negotiators, and I can only assume that the European Union saw us coming, and decided that taking sweets off children was quite an enjoyable process&mdash;but I will not digress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049.1/3">The difficulties caused by our failure in the negotiations spill over into other areas of interest for the British Government. We have an excellent record in the area of foreign aid. We have worked exceptionally hard, but we ought to be exceedingly concerned about the way in which our commitments to retain CAP spending have locked us into negotiating positions, in the Doha round and so on, that make world trade talks more difficult than they otherwise would have been. The agreement places us in a position that is directly against the interests of the third world in world trade talks. I can see why the French wanted to put us in that position, but I cannot understand why we were willing to accept it. We must do better subsequently.</p>

	<p pid="b.1049.2/1">I absolutely agree with that point. My worry is about the current economic partnership agreements, which seem entirely driven by Brussels so as to set the terms against the third world, yet are sold on the basis of fairness and justice. Surely they are the opposite.</p>

	<p pid="b.1050.0/1">Indeed they are. Not only are we trying to break the third world by forcing economic partnership agreements on it, we are trying to trap it into a world trade system that was established in the interests of French farmers and the Duke of Westminster. That is an absurd position for a Labour Government to accept for one moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1050.0/2">I am afraid that I have not been here for the whole debate, because I had other commitments. I therefore apologise if other hon. Members have mentioned the European Parliament and the monthly travelling circus, when its accoutrements, Members, committees and staff are transferred from Brussels to Strasbourg and then back again. That will go on under the budget. The issue has not been tackled, and was not even broached.

	<p pid="b.1050.3/1">I certainly do not want to stray into carbon footprints either. The hon. Gentleman is entirely correct, but we will move on from there.</p>
	<p pid="b.1050.3/2">We have to see the budget in the context of where the European Union is going. It will be the financial package for the implementation of the rebadged EU constitution, providing ever more centralisation, with money again being unnecessarily sucked into the centre to be spent from the centre. There is absolutely no evidence in the budget of any enthusiasm for subsidiarity, either.</p>
	<p pid="b.1050.3/3">We have heard from the Foreign Secretary that he envisages the European Union expanding into the middle east and north Africa. Presumably with the next set of proposals we will be told that unless we give huge amounts of money to Brussels, we will be against north Africa and the middle east. I have some sympathy for the view that we should expand the common market to those countries in trading terms, in order to help them develop. However, I hope that the Economic Secretary will make it absolutely clear at an early stage that we do not endorse any proposal for the free movement of peoples from north Africa and the middle east, because that is&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Economic Secretary looks sceptical at that, but I hope that she will make it absolutely clear that there is nothing in the agreement to take us towards the free movement of peoples from the middle east and north Africa en masse into the European Union in general, and into the United Kingdom in particular.</p>
	<p pid="b.1050.3/4">It is with some regret that I find myself having to oppose my Government. However, there comes a point when we have to say, &quot;This is an appalling agreement and we should never have signed it.&quot; Those involved in the negotiations were sucked into accepting the assumption that those who do not accept everything that comes from Brussels are in favour of withdrawal. I do not accept that those are our only two choices and I never have; nor do I accept the suggestion that those who do not accept the budget are against eastern Europe, and I hope that the House will not accept it, either.</p>

	<p pid="b.1051.0/1">Thank you for calling me to speak at the end of this important debate, Madam Deputy Speaker. I shall try to keep my remarks short. This has been an interesting debate, with some varied contributions. I notice that the Government could only get <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2025" name="Quentin Davies">the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase> to speak in favour of their position. The right hon. Member for Rotherham gave a long and&mdash;as I said when he was in the Chamber&mdash;fairly tedious speech, but he did it with a twinkle in his eye. Too often, however, when we have debates about Europe, we start to throw out words such as &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;xenophobic&quot;, and that does this place no good at all. It brings the whole political class into disrepute. It is perfectly reasonable to be concerned about this country's relationship, and its future relationship, with Europe without being called a racist or xenophobe. Those terms are thrown around the Chamber far too often, in far too many debates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051.0/2">The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made an excellent contribution. We on the Opposition Benches are now realising that he is far more use to us on the Government Benches than he ever was on ours. I have to tell the Minister that we are really not going to have the hon. Gentleman back; I know that you want him to come back over here, but he is yours for keeps.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051.0/3">One of my concerns about the European Union project and the common agricultural policy is the implications that they have for developing countries, particularly in Africa. Farming is fundamental to those countries' development and economic growth, yet we weight agricultural subsidies in favour of our own well-heeled farmers, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1991" name="Ian Davidson">the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson)</phrase> has just pointed out. We make it difficult for African farmers to bring their produce to our markets, yet we think nothing of taking our excess product that no one here or in Europe wants to buy and dumping it on their markets at massively reduced prices, making it impossible for African farmers to compete. I have used this example before, and I will use it again: there are markets in Nigeria that are selling tinned European tomatoes. That is simply madness, and we in the European Union must put an end to it. It is unsustainable for us to subsidise our farmers off the backs of struggling African farmers. If we are really going to demonstrate that we want to improve the outlook for African countries and to strengthen their economies, we must allow them access to our agricultural markets. We must allow them to compete on an even footing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051.0/4">I should like to inject a note of caution. The Minister talked earlier about the environment. Of course, the environment is hugely important; global warming is a huge challenge. We must be very careful, however, that people in the European farming community do not use the environment as yet another reason to deny African farmers access to our markets by talking about the number of air miles involved in the shipment of food. I am sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker. I know that you do not want us to talk about carbon footprints, but foods imported from Africa often have a far smaller carbon footprint, because they are grown in natural sunshine rather than in expensive, heated greenhouses. We must not use the concern about the environment that is shared by our EU partners to block African farmers' access to our markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051.0/5">When we have debates about Europe, we do not do the political class any great favours. We use abstract phrases and high-minded language. Of course, we are very high-minded people, but we must remember that what we do here has to be relevant to a wider audience. I know, from going around my constituency, that there is concern about the European project and about these quite significant additional sums of money that we are going to hand over to the newly joined member states of the European Union. I do not think that my constituents are mean-minded people, however. They understand that there is an argument for helping emerging economies in Europe to get the foothold that they need to become wealthier and to become our trading partners, but they also have a legitimate right to be concerned about the sums of money being talked about. We must not dismiss those concerns as the concerns of racists and xenophobes. After all, any money that we spend in this place belongs to the taxpayer. It belongs to the people whom we represent, and it is therefore incumbent on us to make a strong case for spending it. Ultimately, we should be answerable to them for where their taxes are going.</p>

	<p pid="b.1052.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is probably right in one respect: there is relatively little concern about the unreformed CAP providing net sums to the accession countries. I see little wrong with that. What does concern me is countries such as Austria, France, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, which are all net beneficiaries from the unreformed CAP. That cannot be allowed to continue for much longer, can it? How can that strike constituents in the hon. Gentleman's area or mine as being fair or sane?</p>

	<p pid="b.1052.1/1">I share many of the hon. Gentleman's concerns, and I will tell him why. My constituency faces significant funding pressures on public services. For example, we face the closure of not one hospital, but possibly two. My constituents are told that there is not enough money to meet and pay off the historic deficits and that that is the reason for the closures. We need to answer those concerns. If we believe in sending money to the emerging economies of eastern Europe, we need to make that argument. I personally believe that this country gives too much to the European budget and that we could do with giving quite a bit less. Again, however, I am happy to argue the case, as we have today, across the Chamber.</p>

	<p pid="b.1052.2/1">If the argument were about giving from the rich to the poor, there might not be so much opposition to it. In this country, we see the money going to rich people such as the Duke of Westminster and several other landed gentry. As some Labour Members have pointed out, countries such as Greece, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg are achieving most of the gains per capita from the common agricultural policy, so the money is not being transferred from rich to poor at all. If it was, it might not raise so much opposition.</p>

	<p pid="b.1053.0/1">I take the hon. Gentleman's point. If anything, the EU is too much about agriculture. The EU is obsessed with agriculture and with agricultural subsidies. For the EU to gain the support of the European population, it has to be seen to be working for everyone, but all too often, as he points out, it seems to be working for very few people. Conversely, for far too many people, it amounts to a nice dollop of extra cash on top of what they are already getting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1053.0/2">I have said before that I love the French rural way of life. I imagine it is rather like the way of life in this country 60 or 70 years ago, but the reason why the French can have farms of 50 and 60 acres, which are economically unviable, is that we in the EU&mdash;us and others&mdash;are subsidising that lifestyle. If France wants to continue with its agricultural marketplace in its current form, that is a matter for France, but it should not be incumbent on us to fund it on its behalf.</p>

	<p pid="b.1053.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that my constituents, like his, are annoyed that the rest of Europe is laughing at us over this matter and at the sums of money we give to countries that are doing far better than we are?</p>

	<p pid="b.1053.2/1">I accept my hon. Friend's observations. There is and must be a sense of frustration out there among the public. When we talk to our constituents, we find that about 50 or 60 per cent. now question the future direction of the European project. About 60 per cent. of our electorate think that it has gone too far and that it is not in this country's national interest. It is no good Labour Members&mdash;or, indeed, some Conservative Members who are more pro-Europe than I am&mdash;pooh-poohing those people and calling them little Englanders. That is a legitimate concern and we need to listen, understand and act on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1053.2/2">I listened carefully to the Minister earlier when he spoke about immigration in the European context. I am delighted that skilled and talented people want to come and work in this country. I really am, but I wish that we had given a little more thought as to how we could have managed that influx of workers to make it better for us and for them. Although I represent a Conservative seat, the south of my constituency includes what I would call a large working-class area: two of the wards are among the 20 per cent. poorest in the country. I understand&mdash;this needs to be confirmed later this week&mdash;that in one of my primary schools, English is now the first language of only a minority of students&mdash;</p>

If children whose first language is not English are to come into our schools, we need to ensure that we have the infrastructure in place to fund the specialist teachers who will allow them to take advantage of their education.

	<p pid="b.1055.1/1">Absolutely. The comparison was made with London, which has enormous financial institutions of world repute. Clearly, wealth creation in London is disproportionate when compared with the rest of the UK. It is therefore important that we work hard in the peripheral areas.</p>

We had a difficult coin to toss on convergence funding in Wales. Would our position be so improved that we would not get the convergence funding, or would we continue to be classified as needing it? It was a strange dilemma, because on the one hand we wanted to be poor enough to get the European money, but on the other, we would have liked to celebrate being not so poor as to attract it. However, we were clearly borderline, and we have been lucky because we have made progress, but we have also benefited from another &pound;1.4 billion for Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.1055.7/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.1055.7/2">Let us revert to the CAP, which needs reform. That is on the EU agenda, and it throws up anomalies in that some wealthy farmers manage to get even more money. However, it is a tremendous lifeline to many of our small hill farmers in Wales. Many have benefited enormously over the years from EU subsidy, which has enabled them to keep going. Frankly, many would be out of business were it not for that money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1055.7/3">It is easy to criticise administration and find one example of something going wrong or being misappropriated. However, we must understand that there can be examples of good and bad practice in all government, whether we are considering Brussels, the UK national Government or local government. It is sometimes easy to overlook the significant benefits that we have enjoyed from EU membership, such as opportunities for Japanese electronics companies, for example, to invest in this country and to be part of the market, economy and purchasing power that is Europe. When we consider financial gain, we must therefore take into account more than the single sum of money that is being pushed one way or another in any specific budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.1056.0/1">When we joined the European Economic Community, 32 per cent. of our exports went to it. Now, only 25 per cent. goes to the EU. How does that constitute economic improvement?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.1056.1/1">We could discuss for ever individual figures and what goes where at any particular time. However, we clearly benefit enormously from being in the EU. We have lost many markets that we had previously. For example, we are not in the same position as we were in the Commonwealth, and we rely much more on our EU partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056.1/2">There has been an anti-French aspect to our debate. Sarkozy is possibly being over-ambitious in his goals for when France has the presidency of the EU. We should not fall into that trap. The power vested in the presidency is not sufficiently significant to push things in the French direction in the way that has perhaps been suggested. It is ironic that Sarkozy has ambitious ideas about defence given that the Assembl&eacute;e Nationale turned down the idea of a European army in the 1950s. He may therefore be overstepping the mark, and we, too, do so if we suggest that his influence will be quite so great when France takes on the presidency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056.1/3">Clearly, the issue of enlargement is directly linked to that of budget. Adjustments will have to be made. One cannot simply move from six to 27 states and expect nothing ever to change. Sometimes, we, as one of the richer nations, will have to shoulder part of the burden. We need to be careful to ensure that the debate does not become anti-enlargement or focus negatively on specific countries. Turkey has been mentioned a number of times as a country that is not suitable for EU membership, but for quite the wrong reasons. There are huge concerns, which I share, about Turkey's human rights record, treatment of people in custody, attitude to minority groups, treatment of groups such as the Kurds and policy towards Cyprus. The argument that is often repeated, however, is that if Turkey joins the EU, we will be swamped by people from Turkey seeking economic benefit here. The economic and religious issues seem to drive a lot of the prejudice against Turkey, but neither are relevant. In 10 or 15 years' time, when Turkey joins the European Union, it will be better off than countries such as Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056.1/4">I accept that we have differences, but we must go along with the EU and vote the measure through.</p>

	<p pid="b.1057.0/1">It is a great pleasure to wind up today's debate. Those of us who deal with Treasury matters are used to Finance Bills, so a Bill with only one operative clause appears somewhat less daunting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/2">The debate has also been a pleasure because of the range of views heard. From Conservative Members, perhaps not surprisingly, we have heard forceful criticism of the deal facing us, and of the consequences that will flow from enacting the Bill. Such contributions were made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">my hon. Friends the Members for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase>, for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) and for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" name="John Redwood">my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)</phrase>. We also heard strong speeches making precisely the same point from Labour Members, particularly the hon. Members for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson).</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/3">We have also heard the counter view from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2025" name="Quentin Davies">the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase>. Until <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1692" name="Nia Griffith">the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase> spoke, I thought that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was going to be in a somewhat isolated and minority position in his own party on this issue&mdash;once again&mdash;but it was not to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/4">The simple question dealt with by the Bill is whether the deal obtained by Tony Blair in December 2005 was a good one and in Britain's interests. He went to negotiate with an objective to protect the rebate, to limit EU spending and to reform the CAP. He delivered on none of those. Our gross contributions are up, what we get back is down, and our net contribution is up. Moreover, our negotiating position for the next financing period has been horrendously undermined. The UK will therefore pay the price for this deal not just until 2013 but for the seven years after that. All that has occurred at a time when, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham made clear, we had a veto&mdash;we had an ability to block something that was clearly against our interests, and we failed to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/5">The argument is made that the deal is all about redistribution from the wealthy west to the poorer east. But let us look at the facts&mdash;the comparative data. What do they tell us about the winners and losers from the budget settlement and the own resources decision? The Government will not give us all those figures, but Open Europe has obtained leaked copies of working papers, and there is little link between spending and needs. The highest per capita spending is in the EU's wealthiest country, Luxembourg. In second and third place are two members of the original EU15, Belgium and Greece, not new accession countries. Ireland, one of the richest countries in Europe, will receive more per person than eight of the 10 accession states. To be fair, there is one western country that does do poorly. The country that does worst in terms of funding is the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/6">How is it spent, this money that will do so much for the eastern countries? Administration costs are rising by 28 per cent. between 2004 and 2013, to &pound;34 billion. Between 2000-06 and 2007-13, the common agricultural policy budget has risen by 12 per cent. The hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West made a good point about the need to return structural funds to member states, a point also made by the Prime Minister in the past, but that has not happened either: it is another failed negotiating objective.</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/7">The accounts, of course, have been rejected by the Court of Auditors for the last 13 years. I say that fearing that I may aggravate the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, who became very worked up about the allegations, saying that this was nothing to do with the Commission. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the European Scrutiny Committee report's summary of the statement of assurance produced by the Court of Auditors. It gave as an example of a reservation</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/8" class="indent">&quot;the incidence of omissions and double or wrong postings&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/9">in the Directorate-General for Education and Culture. It also referred to</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/10" class="indent">&quot;structural measures, internal policies and external action&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/11">and said that</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/12" class="indent">&quot;payments are still materially affected by errors.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/13">It expressed the view that the Commission and member states needed to make much greater efforts</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/14" class="indent">&quot;to implement adequate supervisory and control systems&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1057.0/15">That applies not just to member states, but to the Commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.1058.5/1">I want to make a little bit of progress. We are short of time, and the hon. Gentleman has not been present for much of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1058.5/2">The Government have made a great deal of the fact that we are closing the gap with France. What they have not acknowledged is that the United Kingdom will pay more than 20 per cent. more net per head of population than the French will. We also hear the argument that the rebate will rise, an argument that was advanced by the Chief Secretary. But why will the rebate rise? Again, the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West summarised it very neatly. Why do we have a rebate? Because we contribute more than we receive, and the rebate reduces the disparity to some extent. The bigger the disparity, the bigger the rebate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1058.5/3">The deal agreed by Tony Blair in December 2005 means that the disparity will get worse. Overall EU spending in cash terms is going up, but in the UK it is going down. Our net contributions increase, so our rebate increases. That is not a triumph for UK diplomacy; it is because our negotiating objectives were not achieved that the rebate is increasing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1058.5/4">The other argument that we heard, advanced by Tony Blair when he returned to the House of Commons following the Brussels summit, was that we would see reform of the common agricultural policy. Mr Blair said that President Barroso would begin a review of the EU's budget, including the CAP. He told the House of Commons that this would mean that</p>
	<p pid="b.1058.5/5" class="indent">&quot;it is then possible for changes to be made to this budget structure in the course of this financing period.&quot; &mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-19">19 December 2005</phrase>; Vol. 440, c. 1564.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1058.5/6">However, when the consultation document for the review was published in December 2006, there was no suggestion that we would see any budget changes by 2013; in fact, quite the contrary. The document stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1058.5/7" class="indent">&quot;It will take a long time horizon...to meet the challenges of the decades ahead. It will therefore not propose a new multi-annual financial framework for the period from 2014&mdash;this task will be for the next Commission&mdash;nor the overall size and detailed breakdown of the EU Budget.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1058.5/8">Not only will the review not address the budget structure for this financing period, as Tony Blair promised; it will not address the next one, either, which takes us to 2020. Indeed, the failure to reform the CAP in 2005 will make it harder to reform it in future because, in the course of the next seven years, dependency on the CAP will increase in the accession states, and the desire to reform will be reduced. To repeat a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase>, it was not just the press, the Conservative party or Labour Back Benchers who were critical of this deal, but the then Chancellor and current Prime Minister was also very critical. <i> The Sunday Times </i>reported how he was &quot;quietly fuming&quot;. It said:</p>

	<p pid="b.1059.3/1">Well, let us not then just take the words of <i> The Sunday Times</i>; why do we not take the words of the then Economic Secretary to the Treasury, now the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families&mdash;and probably next week the Chancellor? He told BBC radio about how the then Chancellor was going to flex his muscles. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1059.3/2" class="indent">&quot;What we will see is Brown the tough negotiator who will stand up for Britain's interests, who's willing to say 'no' when 'no' is the right thing to say.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1059.3/4" class="indent">&quot;There was a phase on the European budget where she stood up for Britain's interests and got a much better, fairer outcome.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1059.3/5">He also said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1059.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Going to an international meeting, the easiest thing to do is draft a fudge communiqu&eacute; and go home, but if you want to make change, that's not good enough&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1059.3/8" class="indent">&quot;the people who are banging the table and saying 'It's not good enough, we've actually got to do something', they're the change makers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1059.3/9">So what happened when that tough negotiator and change maker&mdash;the Prime Minister&mdash;went to Brussels to claim back some of the rebate? What did he achieve banging the table in order to get a fairer outcome? Nothing. The preparations had been made, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families was urging him on, battle was set to commence, and at the first sign of difficulty the Prime Minister bottled it&mdash;not for the last time. The fact is that for all his talk of being a tough defender of Britain's interests in Europe, this is just an excuse for briefing against the previous Prime Minister and now the current Foreign Secretary. He might invite Baroness Thatcher around to No. 10 and he might invoke her name before negotiations, but when it comes to defending British interests he is not fit to pour her tea.</p>
	<p pid="b.1059.3/10">This Parliament can defend our interests by voting down the Bill.

	<p pid="b.1060.3/1">No. We are entitled to vote this down. Under article 269 of the European Union treaty this deal constitutes a recommendation, which then needs to be adopted by member states. It is a bad deal for Britain: it loses us part of our rebate, it fails to reform the common agricultural policy, and it weakens our negotiating position for the next time. Tonight, we should take the opportunity to reject this recommendation and to defend Britain's interests by voting against the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.1060.4/1">We have had an interesting debate in which several Members, not least <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase>, have shown their true prejudices for all to see. I feel that we have been here before and that no doubt we will be here again. The highlight for me was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2025" name="Quentin Davies">the contribution of our new friend, my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase>, who gave an excellent speech. Opposition Members said they would not take him back; we are not letting him go as he is able, in a way that no one else is, to speak with inside knowledge about the Conservative party's sheer hypocrisy on European Union matters. He said that the Opposition parties' purpose was to defeat this Bill in order specifically to cause a constitutional crisis in Europe, which is what they want.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/2">We have heard a lot of facts and figures this evening, so let me start by explaining the true ones. This is a good package for Britain. The abatement is preserved<i> &mdash;[Interruption.]</i> Of course it is; it is in writing in the own resources decision, which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/3" class="indent">&quot;The European Council of 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-16">16 December 2005</phrase> concluded that the correction mechanism in favour of the United Kingdom shall remain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/4">I have it here in black and white. It continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/5" class="indent">&quot;However, after a phasing-in period between 2009 and 2011, the United Kingdom shall participate fully in the financing of the costs of enlargement, except for agricultural direct payments and market-related expenditure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/6">The rebate as a whole will remain. It has not been signed away and will remain in full on the common agricultural policy across old and new EU member states and on all spending in the EU 15. It is right that we pay our share towards reconstruction in eastern Europe and it is in our national interest to do so. Not only that, our abatement is worth more in this budget round than in the previous one. We will get back &euro;40 billion, which is an increase on the &euro;34.5 billion in the previous round. Over the period, Britain and France will contribute roughly the same, which Conservative negotiators never achieved. The net contributions of France and Italy will rise twice as fast as ours.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/7">Under this deal, the EU budget as a whole has fallen below 1 per cent. of European Union gross national income, which is a saving of &euro;160 billion compared with the Commission's original proposal. The deal that we agreed is 20 per cent. less than the last budget agreed when Conservatives were attempting to negotiate for the Government. In 1988, the then Government signed up to a deal that saw the budget grow by 17 per cent. over five years, and in 1994 they signed up to a budget that was shown to grow by 22 per cent. We have signed up to a budget for an enlarged EU that will grow by a mere 7 per cent., working in the national interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/8">We have secured a commitment to a fundamental review of the budget. The CAP, which was two thirds of the budget in the mid-1980s, will no longer be the largest part of the EU budget. The value of the CAP will start to fall in real terms from this year, from &euro;55 billion to &euro;51 billion by 2013. That has been negotiated by this Government. The budget now gives help to the new member states of eastern Europe, which need it most. It is in the national interest to pay our fair share of the cost of enlargement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/9">I want to refer to some of the questions and contributions in this evening's debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase>, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, said that she wanted a debate on EU membership. She accepted that CAP reform was going the right way, but then she confirmed that she will vote against the Bill. The Liberal Democrats are, as always, trying to face two ways at the same time. She said that it would have been better to have had no agreement than to have the agreement reached in 2005, and other Opposition Members tried to make the same point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/10">It was essential to have a December 2005 deal to allow the new member states to start preparing to use EU funds and to avoid the European Parliament, in the absence of such a deal, setting annual budgets under existing funding arrangements that, just to give one example, would have cost Poland about two thirds of its EU funds. Reaching no deal would have betrayed our support for enlargement. Perhaps the Opposition parties' support for no deal betrays their lack of support for enlargement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/11">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne said that Cornwall is still a very poor area. We are happy that it will continue to be supported. Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly will receive &euro;430 million in convergence expenditure in the current financial perspective.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> made a number of points. I do not agree with all of them, but I was grateful for his contribution. He said that the CAP and structural and cohesion funds should be nationalised. On the CAP, the Government's policy is the abolition of market support and direct payments. On structural and cohesion funds, as set out in 2003, it is our policy that wealthier countries should be responsible for their own regional policies. SCFs should be targeted on the poorest and, as a result of the deal that we secured in December 2005, 250 per cent. of structural and cohesion funding expenditure will go to new member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060.4/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase> succeeded in emptying the Public Gallery, and I lost the will to live at some points in his speech. He said that the House was having the chance to debate the Bill only as the deal comes into force. That is not the case: the own resources decision will not come into force until it is ratified by all member states, and I hope we will do so very shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1062.1/1">He did not do that. The own resources negotiations that took place after December 2005 implemented the deal. The hon. Gentleman should not believe everything that he reads in the newspapers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1062.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> asked why the UK should bail out countries including those in the Balkans, Ukraine and Georgia. Why should we give up the abatement, he asked, when public finances are stretched? I support enlargement&mdash;I am not sure whether Opposition parties do&mdash;and I am clear that the investment in new member states will be to the economic benefit of the UK. It will facilitate trade. In 2006, British exports to the countries that acceded in 2004 had risen by 36 per cent. in the first full year after accession. That means jobs and growth in the constituencies of all hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.1062.1/3">I listened with respect and interest, as always, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, although I did not agree with everything he said. He made the point that the CAP would increase in real terms, but that is not the case. A lot of erroneous numbers have been flying around this evening. As I have just said, in 2007 the CAP will be worth &euro;55 billion, but it will reduce to &euro;51 billion by 2013 in the prices of that year. I also do not agree with my hon. Friend that we would be better off out. With 55 per cent. of our total trade being with the EU&mdash;3 million jobs and inward investment&mdash;being in the EU gives us peace, prosperity and productivity growth.</p>

	<p pid="b.1063.1/1">I do apologise. The right hon. Gentleman made, as always, an eloquent speech, but one that was economical with the facts.

It is good for Britain to be in a market of 500 million consumers. British exports to eastern Europe are rising dramatically. Our firms are investing there, and as they grow we shall grow, too.</p>

	<p pid="b.1070.4/1">I beg to submit this petition, which it is an honour to present in the names of Gareth Dadd, Derek Adamson and Mark Robson. It expresses their concern about the proposed police funding formula review and its impact on policing in North Yorkshire. North Yorkshire is one of the most rural counties in the country and rural policing poses one of the biggest challenges. That should be reflected by an increase in the police funding formula. Any proposed cuts in rural policing to divert funding to urban, Labour-controlled areas, would be totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1070.4/2">The petition states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1070.4/3" class="indent">The petition in the name of the said Gareth Dadd and others shows that they fear that the proposed police funding formula will result in cuts. They wish to see their entitlement to fair and equitable funding for North Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.1070.4/4" class="italic"> Following is the full text of the petition:</p>
	<p pid="b.1070.4/5" class="italic"> [The Humble Petition of Mr G. Dadd of North Yorkshire County Council and Black Bull Inn, Thormanby, York, North Yorkshire and others of like disposition,</p>
	<p pid="b.1070.4/6" class="italic"> Sheweth</p>
	<p pid="b.1070.4/7" class="italic"> That they fear the proposed Police Funding Formula review will result in cuts of &pound;10m, &pound;16m, and &pound;19m in years 1, 2, and 3 respectively will mean cuts of 300 Officers or a massive change to local Council Tax payers. We wish to see our entitlement to fair and equitable funding for North Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.1070.4/8" class="italic"> Wherefore your Petitioners pray that your Honourable House urges the Government to withdraw the proposed Police Funding Formula review.</p>

	<p pid="b.1070.6/3" class="indent">The Petition of the residents of the Shipley constituency and the surrounding area,</p>

	<p pid="b.1072.2/1">I welcome this opportunity to raise in the House my constituents' concern about proposals for a new flight path into Southampton and Bournemouth airports. NATS&mdash;National Air Traffic Services&mdash;has proposed additional controlled airspace from Newbury to Romsey, where aircraft may fly as low as 5,500 ft. Flights would be permitted between 5.30 in the evening and 9.30 in the morning. At this stage, the proposal would only affect inbound flights from next April, but if approved it could be extended to outgoing and therefore noisier flights. Indeed, the document says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1072.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Bournemouth outbounds may also be positioned in this space.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1072.2/3">There seems to be no scope for limiting the number of movements using controlled airspace once it has been designated. The proposals have been opposed by Hampshire county council, Basingstoke and Deane district council, 18 parish councils, the council of partners of the North Wessex Downs area of outstanding natural beauty, New Forest national park authority and the Campaign to Protect Rural England. I am grateful to Professor Johnnie Johnson and Alan Cox of Ashmansworth parish council and to councillors Horace Mitchell and Clive Sanders for their work in challenging these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072.2/4">Despite those powerful objections&mdash;more than 500 were made&mdash;NATS has asked the Civil Aviation Authority to accept the proposals without amendment later this month. In a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="">2 October</phrase>, the Minister, whom I welcome to the Dispatch Box, told me:</p>
	<p pid="b.1072.2/5" class="indent">&quot;the change sponsor must submit a report to the CAA who will consider the proposal against regulatory requirements. As appropriate, this might include seeking the views of the Secretary of State for transport on environmental matters.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1072.2/6">I will show that those regulatory requirements have not been kept to. This evening's debate is apt because at the end of this month the CAA is due to take a decision, in which the Minister has a role, and today the Prime Minister sought to underline his Government's environmental credentials.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072.2/7">There are two questions. First, was the consultation process fit for purpose? Secondly, has the case for change been made? First, on process, what NATS did might have been appropriate some 20 years ago, when concern about environmental issues was lower, there was less commitment to consulting and getting feedback, and parish councils were less engaged in the planning process. We lived then in a less participatory society. But today, when there is a proposal such as this, that process is no longer fit for purpose. MPs should be offered a briefing in the House, NATS should write directly to parish and town councils, the document should be intelligible and conform to recent guidelines, and NATS should be prepared to put on roadshows for those who want them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1072.3/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend on securing this debate on a matter that affects large parts of his constituency and only a small part of mine, around the villages of Ham and Shalbourne, although the people there are very concerned. Does he agree that the real outrage about what is happening is that whereas a local planning authority can, as has happened in such cases, stop noise pollution in areas such as Ham and Shalbourne in relation to glider launches or motocross, when something of this sort is proposed there is no local control at all over what happens?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.1073.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" speakername="George Young" colnum="1073"  time="022:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0022.htm#0711208001308">
	<p pid="b.1073.0/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right. There is less protection for what may be a noisier development than there is for the developments that he has just described. Indeed, he has put his finger on a point that was in the Government's White Paper, &quot;A better quality of life&mdash;strategy for sustainable development in the UK&quot;. That proposed more openness, transparency and accountability in the decision-making process. I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/2">In May, a document landed on my desk, entitled &quot;Terminal control south west airspace development&quot;, which I nearly binned because I do not regard North-West Hampshire as being in the south-west. It came with a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="">4 May</phrase>, containing a list of organisations that the CAA had identified for consultation, which included MPs. It said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Identified organisations are requested to cascade this information to related groups as deemed necessary.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/4">In other words, responsibility for consulting the parish councils was subcontracted by NATS to local MPs. Although local authorities also had that obligation, none of my parish councils were notified by them, and NATS made no attempt to see if the cascade they asked for had taken place. Indeed, one parish councillor e-mailed me on <phrase class="date" code="">8 August</phrase>, two days before the consultation was formally ended, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/5" class="indent">&quot;It was only by chance, nearly two weeks ago, that a local resident, on browsing the web, discovered that consultation was taking place. On investigation, it was clear that no Parish or Town Councils, local residents, or even Borough or County Councillors in the area north of Ashmansworth had heard of the proposals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/6">The document flies in the face of the January 2002 Department for Transport guidance to the CAA, CAP725, which states that the formal proposal must include</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the options that have been considered, including the 'do nothing' option.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/8">But there was no assessment in the document of other options. That point was well made by Basingstoke and Deane borough council, which said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/9" class="indent">&quot;It would also aid our consideration of these proposals if you will please provide details of the alternative options that were considered by NATS. The CAA Guidance states that this information should have formed part of the original Consultation document. It would also be helpful to have further detail regarding the pattern and nature of the delays (current and anticipated) that are intended to be alleviated or mitigated by the proposed extension&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/10">That was written on <phrase class="date" code="">10 August</phrase> and it got no answer, so it wrote again, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/11" class="indent">&quot;it is disappointing that we have received either no further information at all (as regards the pattern and nature of delays that are intended to be alleviated or mitigated by the Consultation) or inadequate information (as regards alternative options&mdash;your response dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-17">17 August 2007</phrase> lists five other options that were dismissed&mdash;but there is no reasoning as to why they were dismissed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/12">On process, Hampshire county council was equally dismissive:</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/13" class="indent">&quot;We would also recommend an improved consultation process which sets out the alternatives and their implications for the matters of concern set out above. Until that time, the County Council is registering an objection to the proposed airspace extension.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/14">There is no appeal against CAA decisions&mdash;unlike the other planning matters to which my right hon. and learned Friend referred&mdash;so it is particularly important that guidance be adhered to.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/15">The document was not only incomplete; it was rather difficult to follow. Hampshire county council, a beacon authority, said this about it:</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/16" class="indent">&quot;The County Council and its local government partners are not resourced to determine specialist technical impacts in areas such as aircraft noise impacts, and this is a deficiency in the consultation documents. Equally the local community has been provided with little notice of the consultation and we believe that this is also a serious deficiency of the process.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/17">Basingstoke and Deane council agreed:</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/18" class="indent">&quot;As mentioned in our <phrase class="date" code="">10 August</phrase> letter, there is a very significant groundswell of local concern about NATS' failure to properly consult all Stakeholders and to produce a Consultation document written in plain English and readily understandable to those being consulted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/19">There is a map on page 5 of the document, in the section on noise impact, which implies that the land between Minstead and East Woodhay is flat, whereas some communities are 800 ft up, and are therefore closer to the source of noise from aircraft flying overhead.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073.0/20">The language used by NATS is at times impenetrable. Finally on the subject of process, the document is based on a rough estimate of the number of aircraft that might be directed down the new flight path, and on the current limited usage of Southampton and Bournemouth airports. However, both airports are scheduled for major expansion, and that fact is not reflected in the NATS assessment. Both airports currently have restricted night flying hours, which could easily change; in other words, flights might not stop in the new corridor at midnight.</p>

	<p pid="b.1074.0/1">May I bring my right hon. Friend's attention to a point that concerns <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1725" name="Desmond Swayne">my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne)</phrase>, and myself? The national park authority's briefing note on the issue says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.0/2" class="indent">&quot;NATS have repeatedly claimed that the proposed airspace is not associated with...expansion of services at any of the regional airports. This is contrary to their presentations to local authorities and the aviation industry&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.0/3">NATS previously stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.0/4" class="indent">&quot;one of the drivers for the airspace development is the anticipated growth at all the airports located in the South East region.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.0/5">There seems to be a certain amount of dissembling going on.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.1074.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" speakername="George Young" colnum="1074"  time="022:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0022.htm#0711208001310">
	<p pid="b.1074.1/1">I am glad that I gave my hon. Friend a slot, so that his intervention could land safely. It was well made, and underlines the point that the new flight path, once granted, could cope with a greater volume of traffic than the one on which the consultation paper was based.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/2">Those failures of process would be enough in themselves to invalidate the proposal for a new flight path. The Minister should make that clear tonight. However, when that is coupled with the second and substantive point&mdash;that the case for extending the airspace has not been made&mdash;the case for rejection becomes unanswerable. The consultation paper could not have been clearer:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/3" class="indent">&quot;This airspace change aims to reduce the level of flight delays caused by an area of complex traffic interaction in the vicinity of the Compton VOR (a navigation beacon near Newbury).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/4">It continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/5" class="indent">&quot;This situation causes the...airspace to be responsible for a high level of delay which in turn causes inconvenience... inefficiency...and...a negative environmental impact.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/6">Later on we are told that the delay attributable to that is 15,000 minutes. The consultation paper says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/7" class="indent">&quot;It is NATS' duty under the terms of its operating licence to address this situation and prevent excess delays being generated in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/8">That is the case for change, but all attempts to get behind those figures were rebuffed. Ashmansworth parish council pounced on that weakness:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The Consultation document claimed that the primary reason for the proposed changes was to minimise delay. We have requested a breakdown of these delays (such as extent and timing) to judge their significance, but have received no reply on this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/10">In a telephone conversation with NATS, one of my constituents was told that NATS was concerned with delays in flights going to Heathrow and Gatwick, as well as in those going to Southampton and Bournemouth. Fifteen thousand minutes sounds a lot; but it is the total delay for the whole year spread over every flight, which equates to about 10 seconds per flight. The proposals' impact on such delays might be even less, as the new flight path would operate for only part of the day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/11">That raises other questions. Could such delays be reduced in other ways, by altering the timing or sequence of flights? NATS has made no mention of technological developments that might well impact on aircraft spacing, allowing a higher density without changing the flight paths. Then there are some weasel words in the document. The proposals will not reduce the delay; they will</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/12" class="indent">&quot;reduce the potential for delay&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/13">We are not told by how much the delay would be reduced if proposals go ahead. On that shaky, unsubstantiated and unquantified edifice rests the whole case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/14">By the time we got to the end of the consultation process, with the &quot;Stakeholder Consultation Feedback&quot;, there was no mention of delays. In that document NATS shifted its ground and instead said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/15" class="indent">&quot;This proposed airspace development is aimed at reducing complexity within the TCSW region.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/16">Ashmansworth parish council has pointed out that</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/17" class="indent">&quot;the recent response from NATS makes no mention of delays and refers only to a desire to reduce complexity, which appears not to be a valid reason in CAP 725, without giving any figures for present complexity or how it compares with other regions of the UK.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/18">If the benefits are doubtful, the disbenefits are clear, and many are indeed conceded by NATS. The consultation document says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/19" class="indent">&quot;The worst case B747 aircraft in the airspace produced maximum noise levels of between 62 and 69 decibels. B737-300s destined for Bournemouth Airport will use this airspace several times per day&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/20">and they produce</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/21" class="indent">&quot;noise levels in the range 61-63 decibels. This...contrasts with what the Government have just said about Heathrow.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/22">This is what the Government said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/23" class="indent">&quot;One interpretation of this is that we could abandon the existing restriction on noise levels at Heathrow Airport of 57 decibels and above. But I believe it is right that we retain this as a safeguard for those most affected by aircraft noise.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/24">There are also the downsides of noise, loss of tranquillity and visual intrusion, and the impact in villages quite high up on the north Wessex downs from civil aircraft where there are none at the moment. The proposed flight path covers highly environmentally sensitive areas&mdash;not only the north Wessex downs but the Test valley and the New Forest national park. Those who represent the North Wessex Downs area of outstanding natural beauty have made it quite clear that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/25" class="indent">&quot;The proposed changes would be detrimental to the special character and qualities of the area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/26">What should happen now? I believe that the Minister should tell the CAA that he is not satisfied with this exercise, and that NATS should go back to the drawing board. There is no urgency about this, and no critical issue of safety. I do not see how the Minister can just tick this one through. Basingstoke and Deane council has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/27" class="indent">&quot;We would strongly recommend to NATS and to the Civil Aviation Authority that the Consultation be reopened&mdash;not only with a longer and more realistic time frame, but also with much more 'user-friendly' and understandable Consultation documents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/28">Hampshire county council agrees:</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/29" class="indent">&quot;In our view, the need for additional airspace has not been adequately proven since the benefits seem modest, and alternatives should be considered fully, including 'do nothing' and local stakeholders fully consulted on all the options. In considering these factors, NATS and the CAA should be mindful of the probable uptake of the available airspace by increased numbers of aircraft movements.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1074.1/30">I look to the Minister tonight to restore the credibility and integrity of the consultation process, for which he is ultimately accountable, and to say that this is not good enough.</p>

	<p pid="b.1076.0/1">I should like to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> on securing the debate, and to thank him for the leadership that he has shown to me and to communities in my constituency such as Inkpen, Kintbury, Coombe and West Woodhay, and others that are alarmed by this proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1076.0/2">I want to take just a few seconds to reaffirm some of the points that my right hon. Friend has made. The consultation was undoubtedly flawed. When I received the document, I contacted National Air Traffic Services and asked it to send the document to every parish council in my constituency that would be affected. In a letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="">24 May</phrase>, it refused to do so. I then contacted the parish councils and told them how to access the document via the internet. The problem was that the parish councils and members of the public had access only to the online document, and they could not read the last appendix, which details the estimated altitude of flights over their villages. The councils were therefore denied the full information that they needed in this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1076.0/3">My right hon. Friend mentioned that, according to the response document, 56 per cent. of responses were rejections and only 9 per cent. contained no objection at all. In the final submission, however, not one of the original proposals had been even slightly tweaked. There has been no real explanation of why this extra airspace is needed at night, or why there is a need for more flights. If flights do not have to go over the area during the day, there must also be an alternative for night-time flights.</p>
	<p pid="b.1076.0/4">My right hon. Friend made an important point about noise levels. The consultation document refers to the impact on people of the aircraft noise, which according to one appendix will be equivalent to that of a car travelling at 60 kph 7 m away. The document does not, however, distinguish between such noise occurring in an urban environment with a lot of traffic and in a tranquil, rural environment. Some of the villages that my right hon. Friend and I represent are also quite high above sea level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1076.0/5">I hope that the Minister will address the conflicting responses that we are getting, including in a letter from the Secretary of State about the effects on Heathrow. The 57 dB limit seems very important to her, and follows detailed analysis. We are now talking about a minimum of 61 dB, rising considerably higher with certain other aircraft. I hope that the Minister will respond to those points.</p>

Before I attempt to answer the points that have been raised, I would like to restate that sustaining economic growth and protecting the environment are at the heart of the Department's aviation policy-making processes. The policy that we set out in the 2003 air transport White Paper and reaffirmed in the 2006 progress report is in line with both the Stern report and the Eddington study. We recognise that a balance must be struck between tackling environmental challenges, enabling people to fly and allowing the industry to compete internationally. As a former distinguished Transport Secretary, the right hon. Gentleman will know that the role of any decision maker on airspace changes is to find the right balance in going forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.1077.0/2">Turning to the ongoing terminal control south west airspace change development, I would like to make it clear at the outset that that proposal is still subject to the Civil Aviation Authority's independent airspace change process. As part of the regulatory process, the CAA might consider seeking the Secretary of State's view on environmental aspects of the proposal and also seek her approval for the change. As such, it would be inappropriate and premature for me to offer comment on the specifics of the proposal while it is still subject to the rigours of this independent regulatory review process. I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman for not being able to offer the more substantive response that I know he wanted me to make.</p>
	<p pid="b.1077.0/3">That being said, I think that it would be helpful if I summarised the sequence of events to date and provided clarity on the process of airspace change. In May this year, National Air Traffic Services began a 14-week public consultation on proposals to extend a portion of airspace termed the terminal control south west airspace development. The consultation was undertaken in accordance with CAA guidance. I shall turn to the details of the CAA's airspace change process in a few moments, although I acknowledge that the right hon. Gentleman and his right hon. and hon. Friends have expressed strong views about the validity of the process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1078.0/1">I am sorry to arrest the Minister in mid flight, but would he be concerned if the guidance that his Department had set out, which needs to be pursued for proposals such as this one, had not been followed?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.1078.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="1078"  time="022:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0023.htm#0711208001314">
	<p pid="b.1078.1/1">I will express my view about the guidance in a few moments. At the moment, the best I can offer are the words that I have just used: I fully acknowledge the strong comments of the right hon. Gentleman and his right hon. and hon. Friends about the validity of the process. That is clearly on the record this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078.1/2">Following a large number of replies received near the end of the consultation period, NATS extended the consultation into the middle of September. That was done to ensure that all interested parties were given adequate opportunity to comment. NATS then undertook an analysis of all responses, which was forwarded to all who responded to the consultation and has been placed on the NATS website. That analysis, along with all consultation materials, was then submitted on <phrase class="date" code="">21 September</phrase> by NATS to the CAA for regulatory review. The CAA will give regulatory approval for the airspace change only if all regulatory requirements are met. I understand that the CAA's decision is expected in January 2008. If approved, the proposed change would be implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-10">10 April 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078.1/3">I have stated already that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of the proposal at this stage, but I would like to take this opportunity to restate NATS's aims for the development. NATS stated in its consultation materials that the proposed development aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of air traffic control procedures. I know that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that aviation safety must remain paramount. The UK air transport industry, and NATS in particular, has an excellent safety record, and accident rates have stayed low despite a rapid rise in traffic levels, although we must never rest on our laurels. That is why NATS constantly reviews its airspace management and makes proposals for airspace changes where it believes them necessary. In the case of terminal control south west, NATS believes its proposals will reduce air traffic control complexity, reduce the work load on individual controllers, reduce delay and bring efficiencies to all aircraft passing through the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078.1/4">It is important that I emphasise that the NATS proposal is not associated with, and will not enable expansion of, services at Bournemouth or Southampton airports or at any other airport in the region. I recognise, as I have already made clear, that the right hon. Gentleman has concerns about the consultation process, but the CAA, as owner of the airspace change process, has advised that the consultation process has been conducted in accordance with its guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078.1/5">I think that it would be helpful to set out the process for delivering airspace change. The CAA must manage the airspace to meet the needs of all users, having regard to national security and economic and environmental factors, while maintaining a high standard of safety. The process for making changes to airspace is governed by the CAA's airspace change process, known as CAP725.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078.1/6">Following review and consultation, a revised version was published in March 2007. The new guidance provides greater clarity on the roles and responsibilities of an airspace change sponsor such as NATS and of the independent regulator, the CAA. It also provides greater detail about the activities of a consultation exercise and the environmental assessment of any proposed change. A change sponsor is responsible for developing and consulting about a proposal and ensuring that it satisfies and/or enhances safety, improves capacity and mitigates, as far as is practicable, any environmental impacts in line with the Department's environmental guidance to the CAA.</p>

	<p pid="b.1079.0/1">Does the Under-Secretary agree that, when something that is so important for communities throughout the country is happening, it should not be for Members of Parliament to cascade information? We are not experts. One had to get to page 40 before reaching the meat of the document. I am sure that NATS followed the regulations, but the regulations are clearly at fault.</p>

	<p pid="b.1079.1/1">Later in my text, I will refer to the fact that lessons are always learned from each process. The comments that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have made this evening are now clearly on record and I would be surprised if they were not noted.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079.1/2">The CAA assesses a formal airspace change proposal against regulatory requirements, including environmental objectives, and either approves or rejects it. It is only when the CAA considers that a proposal might have a significant detrimental effect on the environment that it is required to advise the Secretary of State for Transport of the likely impact. It must also advise of plans to keep that impact to a minimum and to refrain from making the airspace change without first securing the Secretary of State's approval.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079.1/3">Let me be plain: airspace changes are made only when it is clear, after consultation, that an overall environmental benefit will accrue, or when the airspace management considerations and the overriding need for safety allow for no practical alternative.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079.1/4">The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire and his colleagues also mentioned aircraft noise. I recognise that, locally, noise is a significant issue. That is why the CAA's revised guidance on the airspace change process includes substantive guidance on a range of environmental requirements, including noise, air quality, tranquillity and visual intrusion. In practice, it would be impractical to prevent widespread over-flying of areas of outstanding natural beauty or national parks in the south of England or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079.1/5">I cannot offer comment on the terminal control south west airspace development while it remains subject to CAA scrutiny under its independent airspace change process. However, I emphasise that the consultation has been conducted fully in accordance with the CAA's guidance and that that guidance was recently reviewed and strengthened to provide clarity on roles, consultation activities and environmental assessment. However, as with all guidance, it remains a living document. That is why the CAA and NATS have welcomed comments on the current consultation to help their planning for any future such consultations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1080.0/1">I sense that the Under-Secretary is about to touch down. Surely if a national park authority makes representations against a proposal such as the one that we are considering, he would expect the CAA to touch base with a Department before ticking it through?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-19b.1080.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="1080"  time="022:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071119/debtext/71119-0023.htm#0711208001318">
	<p pid="b.1080.1/1">I have outlined as best I can the way in which the process works and that it is a matter for the regulator&mdash;in this case, the CAA&mdash;to make the assessment. It has to satisfy itself that the change cannot be practically done other than in the way that has been proposed for safety reasons, or that it does not impinge on the environment, as I described. Given the number of objections that Conservative Members have outlined and that have been submitted to the proposal, I would be surprised if the CAA did not fully take on board the strength of feeling and the objections raised for scientific, environmental or other reasons. However, it is not my job to pre-empt or anticipate the conclusion of the review of the regulator, who has the expertise, scientific advice, knowledge and experience to make those decisions. The structures were put in place long before I came to the Department. I have confidence that they will deliver the right results for UK plc and take into account all the issues that were raised in the consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080.1/2">I fully acknowledge the criticisms and concerns raised by the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen about the cascade process, and about other aspects of the consultation that they do not believe have been robust enough. As I said, I would be very surprised if those comments were not taken on board elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080.1/3">Finally, I want to repeat my reassurance to the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire that airspace changes are made only where it is clear, after consultation, that an overall environmental benefit will accrue, or where the airspace management considerations and the overriding need for safety allow for no practical alternative. I am sure that the record of this debate will be noted by all the organisations involved in, interested in or affected by the proposed airspace change process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080.1/4" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080.1/5" class="italic"> Adjourned accordingly at ten minutes to Eleven o'clock.</p>
