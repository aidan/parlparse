He will know that it recently conducted a survey showing that 80 per cent. of people want to know the origin of meat and poultry and 77 per cent. that of fruit. It is incredible and surprising to me that that is not mandatory on labelling. Will he push for that in the European Council?</p>

	<p pid="a.431.10/1">I am sorry that I have not met the Consumers Association, but I am aware of its survey and the one conducted by the Food Standards Agency, which came out with somewhat different conclusions. Country of origin is an important aspect for consumers, as are price and food safety. All those matters should be addressed in labelling to ensure that the consumer can make an informed choice.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.0/1">I am pleased to hear about the progress that has been made so far. We in Gloucestershire have excellent food and drink producers, and it is important for consumers to know where their food comes from.

	<p pid="a.432.1/1">We are in negotiations in Europe about the food information regulations, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware. Those discussions have been taking place for some months and will continue this year, with a view to producing regulations next year for implementation, I believe, in 2013. The Government are very much involved in trying to ensure that we have accurate country of origin labelling on products that the British consumer is interested in buying.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase>. However, several Government Departments and agencies have registered a fall in the proportion of British food that they buy. The latest figures that I can find are for 2007-08, when the Department for Children, Schools and Families, for instance, imported an awful lot of lamb and bacon and did not purchase many British apples. Can the Minister say why the latest figures have been delayed? Is he trying to bury bad news?</p>

	<p pid="a.432.3/1">Maybe it is only me, but sometimes answering these questions makes me feel that I am playing Jim Hacker in the episode of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; in which he defends the British sausage. He was, of course, attempting to save his own bacon at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.3/2">I assure the hon. Gentleman that the latest figures will be published shortly. Last year's figures showed a 2 per cent. increase in public sector procurement of British food products, and I hope that we will see the same this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.4/1">Britain's best breakfast cereal, Weetabix, is made in the Kettering constituency, and the wheat for it comes from farms within a 50-mile radius. Why cannot Weetabix proclaim on every box that British breakfast cereals for British breakfasts are the best in the world?</p>

	<p pid="a.432.5/1">I must confess that I was not aware that Weetabix is produced in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. However, that does explain why he has three Weetabix for his breakfast every morning in the Members' Tea Room-I have seen the latest advert for Weetabix in which the jockey beats all the horses. I am sure that Weetabix will be listening to the hon. Gentleman. It is for producers to determine what they include in the way of labelling, but we are trying to encourage accurate country of origin labelling at the same time.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.6/1">Will my hon. Friend give my greetings to the taskforce, and will he come shopping with me when I visit my local Sainsbury's, Aldi, Tesco and Co-op? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> If there were a Waitrose I would shop there, too. All those supermarkets now have on their shelves products across the whole range that have their origin on the label, in some cases including the county of origin. No discerning shopper these days can seriously claim that there is not a choice. The voluntary approach is the way to go, and it is working. Will he encourage the supermarkets even further down that route?</p>

	<p pid="a.433.0/2">I commend my right hon.

	<p pid="a.433.1/1">One difficulty shoppers have is avoiding illegally produced goods from Israeli colonies, often called settlements, in the west bank. What are the Government doing to ensure that that illegally produced and exported food either does not enter the United Kingdom or, if it does, is properly labelled so that consumers like me can avoid it?</p>

That means that consumers who buy food products that originate there will be able to distinguish between the produce of Palestinian farmers and that from the Israeli settlements. One of the largest retailers is already putting our advice into practice, and we hope that the rest will follow soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.1/1">Indeed. The Government have long taken the position that tourist-based whale watching is the only sustainable form of whale exploitation. To give a brief update, we are currently involved in a series of discussions, and we will not negotiate on anything that will weaken our resolve to end commercial whaling. No such package or deal is currently on the table in the reform discussions and, frankly, it is difficult to envisage one in the foreseeable future, particularly while it is unclear whether Japan is willing to restrict scientific whaling operations.</p>

We have not been able to get a European Union bloc to support that yet, but we are close. I am pleased that France has indicated in the past few days that it is moving its position towards a moratorium.

	<p pid="a.436.3/1">First, I do not accept for a moment that the Government have failed in what they are seeking to do. Secondly, as I have told the House on many occasions, sharing the responsibility and the cost is reasonable. That is what we did in tackling bluetongue, which was a model in my experience. There was no complaint that the farmers had to share the cost, because we had shared the decision making on tackling the disease. The farming industry has long wanted the opportunity to share responsibility for how we tackle disease. Is it unreasonable, in the circumstances, that there should be some sharing of the costs? I do not think that it is.</p>

	<p pid="a.436.4/1">Does the Secretary of State really consider it to be a success that over the past 12 years, 150,000 head of cattle in the south-west alone have been slaughtered, and that the number continues to rise? Does he really believe that his current policies have any prospect whatever of controlling the disease, let alone of reducing or eradicating it? As he well knows, until we have an oral vaccine in four years' time, any work with vaccine is bound to be on a trial basis only-no one envisages that an injectable vaccine, which is involved in the trials that he was talking about, has any real significant prospect of deployment, because for that to happen one must catch all the badgers. When is he going to get a grip of this matter? He quotes the ISG regularly, but its conclusions were never peer reviewed, even if the evidence it gathered was. Will he accept that he is drawing sustenance from conclusions that were not peer reviewed?</p>

	<p pid="a.436.5/1">We set up the ISG, which did its work and came to its conclusions. It has responsibility for what it recommended, and I accepted its advice-I know that that was not popular and that not everybody agreed. The issue is not whether we need to tackle the reservoir in wildlife, but what the most effective way of doing that is. With the badger vaccine deployment project, once the vaccine is licensed-I take the hon. Gentleman's point about practicality, and the purpose of the deployment project is to see how it works-there will be nothing to stop others using the vaccine, in addition to the six projects that we will be running. Understandably, farmers are saying, &quot;You say that culling does not work, but what other means do you have to help us?&quot; We at least now have the beginning of hope, but I agree that an oral vaccine would be much more effective, and we are working very hard, and providing extra funding, to bring that about as soon as possible.</p>

That would give time for the impact of the one-off sale to be closely monitored and assessed. That work is ongoing. The sale took place in late 2008, and the ivory arrived in Japan and China in early 2009.

	<p pid="a.439.2/1">The UK's response to the Commission's Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy sets out our objectives to achieve the prosperous and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks. The response makes it clear that there must be more regionalised decision making, genuine integration of fisheries with other marine policies, longer-term management planning, greater flexibility and certainty in the system and a mechanism to ease the transition to a sustainable and profitable future.</p>

	<p pid="a.439.3/1">Does the Minister agree that the two key elements are the devolution of day-to-day management to local and regional stakeholders and a land-all policy linked to a secondary market for fish that cannot otherwise be marketed to form a feed stock for the aquaculture industry?</p>

	<p pid="a.439.4/1">We are very supportive of that. In fact, we have been playing a leadership role in promoting the idea of a regionalisation of management, which would still involve ministerial accountability and the overarching strategy. The hon. Gentleman is right about the idea of a land-all policy. We need to consider innovative approaches, such as the agreement that we signed last year to look at electronic monitoring on vessels, with the agreement of skippers, to land more and kill less. That relates especially to the abhorrent issue of discards, which skippers, as much as anyone else, abhor.</p>

It is important in Scotland in particular, which has such a large fishing community, that they have a say in the strategy.</p>

I was contacted just today by the Thanet Fishermen's Association, which has been waiting since the beginning of last November for a reply on the transfer of unused quotas. Will the Minister give the fishing community and other organisations interested in CFP reform the firm assurance that they will be involved in negotiations on this important matter, even if they disagree with his Department's stance?</p>

	<p pid="a.440.1/1">Yes, absolutely, but that is not to say that we will always agree. In fact, fishermen often accuse me of over-consulting and over-engagement, which can make it difficult for them to get to meetings and to engage with these matters. I guarantee that we will do as the hon. Gentleman asks, but that does not mean that we should walk away from the difficult decisions on moving from where we are now to achieving a long-term sustainable future. I know that, in his heart of hearts, he agrees with that.</p>

	<p pid="a.440.6/1">This really is a matter for local authorities. The recycling rate in the hon. Gentleman's unitary authority, Torbay, is actually higher than he suggested, but it is still about 10 per cent. behind the average for local authorities in the west country. He certainly needs to talk to the local authority and ensure that it is getting the message that it needs to get on with this. It recycles five different forms of waste, which is to be encouraged-we suggest a minimum of two, but we want local authorities to go up to five-but it is clearly not doing as well as the best, and I suggest that he takes that up with the authority, as this is a local matter.</p>

Anaerobic digestion is an important issue. We want to minimise the amount of waste that is created in the first place, as well as encouraging reuse and recycling.

	<p pid="a.441.3/1">Is it not the case, however, that vast quantities of material collected for recycling cannot be recycled by industry, because the quality is not good enough? We are landfilling glass, which is completely recyclable, and exporting paper to China in order to meet our recycling targets, because there is not sufficient recycling capacity in this country. Will my hon. Friend meet representatives of the packaging industries to discuss these issues before our recycling targets are increased further?</p>

	<p pid="a.441.4/1">I am always happy to meet those who are worried about this issue. They are right to have concerns, and we will certainly continue to consult thoroughly on this. However, figures released only this morning show that recycling has gone up to 38.3 per cent., so we are well on the way to meeting our 40 per cent. target for this year. That is encouraging, but creating better quality waste makes it more valuable, and that should be an incentive for local authorities and others to work harder.</p>

	<p pid="a.444.9/1">Yes, indeed. The Faroes are not the only example in the world of the use of effort management. It can be used in different ways, and it has some benefits. From our point of view, however, it involves some difficult issues, including the question of how we can move from our present arrangements to an effort-management regime. We need to think about the conversion of effort management into fishing days in the context of our current quota, and about the ability of the system to respond rapidly to what is happening to species, particularly in mixed fisheries.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.9/2">We are already taking action. We do not need to wait for CFP reform in order to tackle discards. I believe that some of the on-board electronic monitoring systems that we are hoping to introduce later in the year will help to signpost the way forward.</p>

Pond Conservation acknowledges in its press release on the report that the news is not all bad. In fact, ponds close to rivers and other wetlands were higher quality, suggesting that there is something of a &quot;protective network&quot; effect when different types of freshwater habitats are close together. However, we, Natural England and other partners will work together to make sure that we can deal with this degradation, and Natural England is contributing &#163;6 million to help create new landscape-scale wetlands.</p>

DEFRA has a complete policy across the Department, and we are working across Government. We need to drive this down to local government as well, and to other agencies.

	<p pid="a.449.4/1">We have discussed the Rural Payments Agency a number of times in recent months. Its performance over recent years has improved year on year. It was able to meet its targets for this year six weeks ahead of schedule. I understand that it has concluded payments to 88 per cent. of farmers, which is more than last year. More money is also being paid out than last year. An improvement has been made, but some farmers have still not yet received their payments. I would ask the hon.

	<p pid="a.449.6/1">Very readily. We published very recently the information about the baseline survey, and we found that 85 per cent. of farmers were aware of the campaign. That shows that it has had a huge impact in a short space of time. Fifty one per cent. of farmers had some cultivable land out of production-that involved about 157,000 hectares-and a total of 174,000 hectares were managed under some form of voluntary environmental measure. That is really important, because it shows the huge amount of work that farmers are doing, and the purpose of the campaign is to encourage more farmers to do the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.450.1/1">I could not agree more with the hon. Gentleman. Obviously, the Department for Communities and Local Government has the lead responsibility on this matter, but all of us who care about food have an interest in getting more people to grow their own food. The demand for allotments is enormous. He will have seen in the food strategy published at the beginning of last month that one of the things we are working on is the production of the &quot;meanwhile&quot; leases, so that additional land that is not being used but could be used for growing food can, in the short term, pass to those who want to grow it. That would represent a big step forward.</p>

I am advised that to apply there is a one-off payment of &#163;135. The issue is simply about having confidence that what is taken out of the aquifer or river goes back in a form that does not affect the quality. I have looked into this matter and found that the Environment Agency is reviewing the arrangements, because we are keen to encourage the development of this kind of scheme. I know that a particular constituency case has given rise to this question, and the Environment Agency will do its best to respond in relation to that application.</p>

	<p pid="a.452.0/1">On culling, as the hon. Gentleman will have heard earlier, I gave the Government's response in the light of the trials that were conducted under the Krebs programme. The Independent Scientific Group's view was that it could not effectively contribute to the control of bovine TB. We will, of course, watch very carefully what happens elsewhere. I should just say one other thing. In the wake of my decision, we established the TB eradication group, which involved the industry coming together to recommend a range of measures, including tightening some of the controls. The group put its recommendations to me towards the end of last year and I have accepted every single one of them, because I am determined to work in partnership with the industry to try to beat this terrible disease.</p>

I know that that does not satisfy those farmers who are still waiting, but I can give him every assurance that we are making our best endeavours to assist them.

One thing that was very popular last year was setting off Chinese lanterns, which are absolutely beautiful when they go up into the night sky, but when they come down in farmland, the wires that are used to construct them get chopped up and added to hay and silage.

	<p pid="a.455.2/1">As the House will be aware, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-30">30 November 2009</phrase>, the European Union signed an interim agreement with the United States to permit the sharing of SWIFT data for the US terrorist finance tracking programme. As the European Scrutiny Committee noted in its response to the Government's explanatory memorandum on the subject, we believe that the programme is a valuable counter-terrorist tool. I have today written to the European Scrutiny Committee setting out that it has come to our attention that the agreement will be subject to an expedited conclusion, and that the European Council's intention is to conclude it once the European Parliament has voted on it. That will not permit Parliament the usual eight weeks to scrutinise the UK's decision to opt into the agreement. I deeply regret that, and can only stress to the House that that in no way represents a weakening of the Government's commitment-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>Allow me to finish. It in no way represents a weakening of the Government's commitment to allow Parliament full scrutiny of any opt-ins in the field of justice and home affairs. I would like to explain the reasons behind the UK's decision to opt in.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.2/2">First, the commitment given by Baroness Ashton during the passage of the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 was based on the fact that the UK would have a period of three months in which to decide to opt into any justice and home affairs agreement. However, in this case, the conclusion of the agreement is subject to an expedited timetable. The European Parliament may vote on the conclusion of the agreement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-09">9 February</phrase>, with the Council concluding it shortly thereafter. The expedition is necessary, as this agreement is crucial for global security. An interruption in the flow of SWIFT data would weaken the terrorist finance tracking programme, which would not be desirable.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.2/3">Secondly, the agreement is only an interim agreement. It will last for 10 months, when it will, I hope, be replaced by a permanent agreement. The permanent agreement will be decided with the full participation of Parliament at every appropriate stage in the negotiation. Thirdly, the agreement was negotiated before the Lisbon treaty came into force and, as such, on the basis of unanimity rather than qualified majority voting, as is now the case with justice and home affairs dossiers. Lastly, the final text of the EU-US agreement was taken by the European Scrutiny Committee and cleared by it in advance of the agreement being signed.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.2/4">I believe that it is crucial that the UK opts into the conclusion of the interim agreement, as the national security benefits are significant. However, I assure the House that the Government have made it clear to the European Union that this is an exceptional case in which there are compelling reasons for not having the full three months available to decide to opt in, and that the UK expects the full time in future arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.456.0/1">I thank the Minister for her reply. I think that we both agree that an important undertaking was given to Parliament on this issue. During debate on the Lisbon treaty, when I defended our case to ratify it, I was assured by Ministers, right up to the Foreign Secretary-and also in the Liaison Committee by the Prime Minister-that the undertakings that there would be proper scrutiny of opt-in decisions would be adhered to. During the passage of the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 through the House of Lords, a statement-printed in full in appendix 1 of the House of Lords European Union Committee's second report of Session 2008-09, HL 25-was circulated to peers debating the Bill. The relevant debate can be found at columns 374 to 377 of the House of Lords <i> Hansard</i><i> </i>for <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-09">9 June 2008</phrase>. In it, the then Leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Ashton, gave a binding assurance that Parliament would have eight weeks to look at any proposed opt-ins.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/2">Although the European Scrutiny Committee might find that the substance of the proposal was not contentious if it had a proper amount of time to scrutinise it, it is clearly in breach of the Government's undertaking to Parliament about the time scale and process for opt-in decisions. This is the first instance of the post-Lisbon treaty imminent opt-in decision, and the assurance given by the Government is on trial. This breach of that undertaking is therefore a very bad start to the new process.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/3">The original document has been with the Government since November 2001, and the explanatory memorandum was cleared by the Committee on the basis that the opt-in conclusion, whatever it might be, would come to us with proper time for discussion. It is clear that someone is treating this Parliament with disdain and contempt.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/4">The Minister said that the protocol regulating the opt-in &quot;generally&quot; permitted three months for the UK Government to be notified about a proposal, but I thought that it would always be permitted that amount of time. To say that the European Council is not required to give us three months is an abdication of the assurance that we were given. I think that Parliament is being treated with contempt, possibly by the Government. The European Council wants to sweep this issue aside, but surely the Government should say, &quot;No. This is a cast-iron guarantee we have given to our Parliament. We will not sign up to this until Parliament has had the proper eight weeks for scrutiny.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/5">It cannot be that much of a crisis, but we are worried once again that the EU will push proper process aside and that the Government will simply fall over and let it do what it wishes.</p>

It is in no way intended as a slight to Parliament, but we have to look at what the effect of not opting into the agreement would be. We believe that not opting in would not be in the interests of this country. There are significant reasons why we should opt in. Because the agreement was reached under unanimity, it is implied that all states will opt in. In coming into effect, this agreement bridges the gap, so to speak, between the previous unanimous procedure and the new qualified majority voting procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/2">We have, of course, the option not to opt into the agreement and to go through another period of parliamentary scrutiny, but I believe that that would not be in our best interests.<i> [Interruption.]</i> We fought very hard for this agreement, so that we could get the information that we need to track terrorist financing.

	<p pid="a.457.4/1">But Parliament was assured by Baroness Ashton, who is now the EU's High Representative, that we would have eight weeks to scrutinise opt-in decisions. Will the Minister explain: given that SWIFT was signed in November, why was it not referred to the European Scrutiny Committee until just days before the Government decided to sign up to it? Why did the Treasury ignore the assurances given by Baroness Ashton in June 2008 that Scrutiny Committees would be given eight weeks to look at these decisions? What steps did she take to ensure that there was proper parliamentary scrutiny of the agreement?</p>
	<p pid="a.457.4/2">Does the Minister accept that when assurances are given to Parliament about scrutiny they should be respected and Parliament should not be ignored? Does the Minister accept that this is a serious breach of an important undertaking by the Government and that it is vital to ensure proper scrutiny of decisions taken by the Government in this Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="a.457.4/3">Is there not a pattern here? Last week the Supreme Court quashed the Government's terrorist asset-freezing orders and in its ruling said:</p>
	<p pid="a.457.4/4" class="indent">&quot;the Court's judgement vindicates the primacy of Parliament, as opposed to the Executive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.4/5">As a consequence, from 9.45 am today until emergency legislation is passed next week, terrorist suspects can access their assets. Let us be clear. As we speak, there is no law in place to prevent terrorist suspects from accessing frozen assets, despite the Prime Minister's repeated assurances. As a result of their incompetence, the Government have failed in their primary duty to protect their citizens.</p>

	<p pid="a.457.5/1">I reiterate that this is in no way intended to be a precedent that parliamentary scrutiny will be overridden. I go back to the original question of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase>. We had to conclude agreement by <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November</phrase> because it was the last opportunity to adopt the agreement before the Lisbon procedures took effect, and we had unanimous agreement among member states. Otherwise, all the negotiations would have had to start all over again. That would have meant a delay of six months or more during which the programme would have been unable to function correctly. It was possible, within the time scale, for the matter to go through the appropriate procedure for Common's parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.5/2">I come back to the point that unanimity means that it is implicit that all member states will opt in. The question being asked today is whether we have parliamentary scrutiny over the opt-in, and of course, under ordinary circumstances, we would expect that to happen. Because we recognise that this as an exceptional case, we propose not to exercise the opt-out but to opt in.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.0/1">The Government gave a clear and unequivocal undertaking that they would allow Parliament eight weeks to scrutinise opt-in decisions of this type. The Minister now seems to be confusing, in her mind or her remarks, process and undertaking with outcomes. Will she turn her attention to the following points?</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/2">On civil liberties, my understanding is that Germany and Austria were concerned about sharing information with third parties, and along with Greece and Hungary abstained when the EU voted on the matter last November. So it is not as non-contentious as the Minister appears to imply. Furthermore, as I understand it, genuine concerns have been expressed that when so-called pin-point requests are made for data that cannot be acceded to, all relevant data are supplied, including names, addresses and personal identification numbers. Therefore, there is all the more reason to look at this case carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/3">Am I right in my understanding that the European Parliament was given only a limited time to undertake scrutiny on this process, and that it was signed off the day before the Lisbon treaty came into effect? Does that not further confirm, in my mind and that of every other hon. Member, that we should be given the full eight weeks to look at this matter rather than one week, which is a reneging on the undertaking given by the Government themselves?</p>

	<p pid="a.458.1/1">I want to address some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns about data protection. The European Commission designated the French counter-terrorism judge, Mr. Jean-Louis Brugui&#232;re, to the issue, and he produced a report which confirmed the accuracy of the US Treasury Department's representations to the EU on data protection practices. He concluded that the programme has generated significant security benefits for the EU. The new agreement improves the protection afforded to EU citizens compared with that under the previous programme, which was done under a US Treasury subpoena.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.1/2">Under the proposed agreement, the decision to authorise transfer of data to the US Treasury Department will be made by a European judicial authority, which must verify the legality of the request. The agreement provides for reviews of the way that it is operating so as to assess, in particular, compliance with data protection safeguards. While there were some concerns from other member states, that is the reason why the agreement has only a 10-month life, which means that there will be a new agreement that will have full scrutiny in all parts of this House and all parts of the EU. As I say, it is important in this case that we maintain the programme; that is why we have taken the decision that we will opt into the programme in the interests of national security and of protecting against terrorist financing.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.2/1">The Minister has just said that this is not intended to be a precedent, but does she accept that it is a precedent, and that it is a precedent to prove that the promises that were repeatedly made throughout the Lisbon treaty process that there would be an increase in the powers of national Parliaments have been completely jettisoned in the most ramshackle manner? Her windbaggery today, if I may say so, demonstrates the fact that there is no real respect for this Parliament and that the procedures are simply being washed to one side.</p>

Is it not therefore a disgrace that at this first test the Government have forgotten and breached their promises and are signing up to very sensitive criminal justice matters that go to the heart of parliamentary democracy without the promised parliamentary scrutiny? Does not this show not only that the public were let down by not having the promised referendum on that treaty, but that Parliament was misled during those debates and therefore voted under a misapprehension on assurances that the Government were not sincere in giving?</p>

I would also suggest that many people in this country have deep concerns about terrorism and how the financing of that terrorism goes around the world. Because the actual agreement has been scrutinised under Commons procedures, I feel that in this case it is acceptable to go to the opt-in, given that it is a temporary agreement and that it was agreed before Lisbon came into force, and given that the House will have ample further opportunity to scrutinise the new agreement.

	<p pid="a.462.3/1">The House is grateful to the right hon. and learned Lady for giving us the forthcoming business. I am sure that the House will want to return to the issue raised in the rather unsatisfactory exchanges that we have just heard. Members will have noted that in about half an hour, there was not one supportive question for the hapless Treasury Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.3/2">On Monday's business dealing with terrorist assets, may I ask why the Government had no contingency plan for what has just happened? Lord Newton's Committee warned the Government about the loophole six years ago, and the Government have known about the challenges to orders on terrorist assets since April 2008. Last week the Government had a 40-clause Bill, but now they have a three-clause Bill. There is no law to prevent terrorists from going to the bank between now and Monday and claiming their money back. Why were the Government so ill prepared?</p>
	<p pid="a.462.3/3">On political reform and the business for the first Monday back after the recess, may I press the right hon. and learned Lady further on the Government's disastrous handling of the Wright Committee report? She is wasting time next Tuesday on the alternative vote, but putting at risk progress on the recommendations of an elected Select Committee of the House. Two weeks ago she said that some Wright reforms could be</p>
	<p pid="a.462.3/4" class="indent">&quot;in operation before the House rises.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-01-21.449"><i> Official Report</i>, 21 January 2010; Vol. 504, c. 449</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.462.3/5">But on Tuesday at the Liaison Committee, the Prime Minister admitted that if proposals were objected to, there might not be enough parliamentary time for them to be implemented before an election. Is the Leader of the House aware that there is a growing feeling that people simply cannot take this Government seriously on reform? No fewer than seven constitutional campaign groups are urging her to look again at the procedure for the debate. Will she give a firm commitment that the House will have proper time to get changes made to Standing Orders, as the Wright Committee wished, before the election? Given the approaching recess, will she ensure that the motions that the Government intend to take forward will be tabled by next Monday at the very latest?</p>
	<p pid="a.462.3/6">May we have a debate on the chaos of the Student Loans Company? Many hon. Members will have had complaints from their constituents about the endless delays and inefficiencies of that body, and today we learn that two months after the Government said that the problems were being fixed, more than two thirds of students with disabilities or special needs have failed to receive the crucial funds that they need for their studies. May we have a full statement from the Government to explain what they are doing to remedy and mitigate that distressing problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.462.3/7">The Leader of the House will be aware that the findings on the Government's management of the out-of-hours contracts will be laid bare today by a report to the Department of Health and by the coroner's verdict following an inquest into the tragic deaths in Cambridgeshire. Will she ensure that a Health Minister comes to the House to make a statement on the review of the out-of-hours service?</p>
	<p pid="a.462.3/8">When can we have the annual debate on international development? It was postponed last November and was meant to be rescheduled for next Wednesday, but it does not appear in the business that the Leader of the House has just read out.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.3/9">Given that the right hon. and learned Lady has so far failed to meet my requests for a debate on the crisis in Haiti, will she now guarantee that that important debate will be held as soon as possible on our return from the February recess?</p>
	<p pid="a.462.3/10">I now turn to familiar territory. When will the Chancellor present his Budget to the House? Finally on dates, this is the last time we shall have business questions until <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-25">25 February</phrase>, and there is still no news of the Easter recess. [Hon. Members: &quot;Question 42!&quot;] Yes, it is question 42. Let me put to the right hon. and learned Lady a scenario on which I believe it might be sensible to proceed. I suggest that the Prime Minister will visit the palace on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-29">29 March</phrase> and announce the election, that the House will adjourn for the Easter recess on Maundy Thursday and not return, that Her Majesty will dissolve Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-12">12 April</phrase>, with a general election on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May</phrase>, and that some of us will return for swearing in on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-12">12 May</phrase>. Would the right hon. and learned Lady like to confirm or deny that?</p>

	<p pid="a.464.0/1">In relation to the Terrorist Asset-freezing (Temporary Provisions) Bill, which I have announced will have all its stages next Monday, subject to the approval of the House, hon. Members will be aware of the Supreme Court's decision on the vires under which the order involved was made. Clearly we have to set the law in order and ensure that we have the powers that we need to use against assets that have been built up for use in terrorist activity. We are ready to make it clear this afternoon what those provisions are. The Bill will be introduced tomorrow, and on Monday, subject to the House's approval, it will have all its stages and then go off to the Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/2">As will be seen this afternoon, we have made it clear that the Bill's application will be retrospective. It is obviously an absolute priority to ensure that terrorists do not have assets at their disposal to use against people in this country, and we will ensure that the powers are available, and made retrospective, to deal with the issue that the Supreme Court raised, which was simply that the order was ultra vires.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/3">I would make two points on how we are dealing with the Wright Committee recommendations. I have said at business questions that we hope the House will agree to more than 20 provisions in the report, and we intend to table them for approval after a full day's debate on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-22">22 February</phrase>. If we can approve some, if not all, of the motions that I will table then, that will be a good start. I will bring back those that, because Members object to them, are not approved. We will lay amendable motions, and then the House will vote on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/4">As there are more than 20 areas of consideration on which we propose to move forward, it will be helpful if some of them, if not all, can be dealt with after a full day's debate. We can get the debate dealt with so that the House can be heard, and then if there are motions to which there is no objection, they can go through straightforwardly by agreement. On some issues there will undoubtedly not be agreement, and those will then have to come back to the House in motions that are amendable and can be voted on.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman talks as though there were unanimity in the House on all the Wright reform issues, and as though somehow, only the Government stood in the way. He is fostering that impression, but it is a misapprehension. As shadow Leader of the House, he should know that on some substantial matters that the Government are in favour of, there is division in the House. For example, we support the idea of secret ballots for the election of Chairmen of Select Committees. He will know that last week the Liaison Committee was split down the middle on that, and voted to support it by only seven to six. So I would be grateful if he did not purvey the view that he and the whole House are reformers, and the Government are standing in their way. That is not true and does not reflect all the progress that the House has been able to make in the past 13 years on initiatives introduced by previous Leaders of the House. Reform has happened, and further reform, with the House's support, will be forthcoming under the Wright Committee recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/6">Inspection and tight regulation of the out-of-hours GP service are obviously important. All primary care trusts should ensure that the out-of-hours service in their area is in order.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/7">The right hon. Gentleman asked about a day of debate on international development. One of the Wright Committee's proposals is for all Back-Bench business and general debate to be determined by a Back-Bench Committee. The Government back that. If it were agreed, the right hon. Gentleman or other hon. Members would not be asking me why we had not had a day to debate international development, because it would be down to Back Benchers to decide when to have a defence day, an international development day or a Welsh day, and to determine the subjects of topical debates. Frankly, I look forward to the day when hon. Members can ask themselves rather than me why such a decision has been made. [Hon. Members: &quot;And in the meantime?&quot;] In the meantime, I use my good endeavours to draw on the will of the House and ensure that we get the debates right. The answer is: as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.0/1">Seventeen years ago this week &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was released-a film in which, hon. Members may remember, the major character was destined to relive the same day until he got things right. I wonder whether there is any similarity to business questions, when we ask exactly the same questions each week, and the Leader of the House has not quite got it right yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/2">I do not suppose that there is any point in repeating the question that the right hon. and learned Lady simply does not answer, about the date of the Budget. We had, quite properly, a debate on the pre-Budget report. May we now have a debate on the influential study that the Institute for Fiscal Studies issued yesterday-its so-called green Budget? It disagrees fundamentally with some of the Treasury's rosy assumptions about the UK's future. It says that long-term growth of 2.75 per cent., as forecast by the Government, is an absurd fantasy, that unemployment is likely to rise from 6 to 9 per cent. by 2015, and that the assumptions about Government revenue are entirely bogus. We should debate those assessments, which experts have made, so that we can gauge how deep a hole the country is in.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/3">Every week we discuss the conduct of parliamentary business, and every week we are told that the Government are committed to reforming how Parliament works. In reply to the urgent question that preceded business questions, we heard just how committed the Government are to allowing Parliament a say in matters that are properly parliamentary business. We have just heard from the Leader of the House how she intends to approach the Wright Committee's report. No one thinks that there is unanimity on the subject, but we would like the opportunity to debate and agree all, not just some, of the recommendations. She has yet to tell us even which recommendations she will allow us to discuss. Perhaps she would like to do that in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/4">One of the main criticisms of the House is that we scrutinise Bills so badly. Yet we continue to do it badly. As of this morning, the Committee considering the Children, Schools and Families Bill has scrutinised only 14 of the 50 clauses in that important measure, and the Leader of the House has just announced its remaining stages. Today is its last day in Committee, so the other clauses will not be properly scrutinised. When will we do the job properly? If we will not do it properly, we must give the other place a chance to do it instead. Does she accept that many of the Bills before the House will get no further than Second Reading in another place before we enter the wash-up process, and that that is not the right way to scrutinise business?</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/5">We had some discussion of dodgy crime statistics this week. I do not approve of basing arguments on crime statistics that are not right, but let me give some genuine statistics. The retail crime survey suggests that retail crime cost the sector &#163;1.1 billion this year-a 10 per cent. increase. That equates to 72,000 retail jobs. May we have a debate on retail crime so that we can ascertain whether there is anything that we as a Parliament can do to prevent such crime-and, ultimately, its cost to all of us as consumers?</p>

	<p pid="a.466.0/1">The hon. Gentleman raised economic issues, following the report of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. No one could accuse the Chancellor of purveying rosy assumptions. He has always said that it was going to be a difficult time for the economy, and that it would begin to start recovering only at the turn of the year-as has happened. We have been encouraged by the fall in unemployment in the past two months, particularly as unemployment usually continues to rise after an economy begins to recover. In the 1990s recession under the Conservative Government, because of an absolute absence of labour market measures and help for the unemployed, unemployment carried on rising for three years after the economy had returned to growth. In the 1980s recession, unemployment continued to rise for five years after the economy had started recovering. We are encouraged by the improvement in employment, but we make no rosy assumptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/2">We are not prepared to go along with cuts in public investment or taking money out of the economy, as proposed by the official Opposition, precisely because we regard the economy as still vulnerable. We will continue to support the economy and to support people who become unemployed to get back into work, and we have a clear plan for reducing the deficit by half in four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/3">It is also worth bearing in mind that the amount, as a percentage of gross domestic product, that the Government spend on servicing the debt, which has been necessary to support the economy, is less than the amount that the Conservative Government spent annually on servicing debt in all their years of government, except two. If it comes to a question of whether the debt is affordable, I stress that we are spending less as a percentage of our national wealth on debt than the Tories spent in all but two years. I know that is not what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> asked, but I am sure that he is interested in the answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.467.1/1">Yes. I am sure the hon. Gentleman wishes that he had asked that question.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.1/2">I hope that hon. Members will accept my good faith on the Wright Committee report, because I do not do devious. [Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!] I am trying to assist the House. We will have a full day's debate, when all the issues in the Wright report can be discussed. We will then consider a series of proposals. If there is no objection to them, they will go through and could be implemented. If there is an objection to them, they will come back to the House for decision, but we will not need to debate them all over again, because we will have done that. We will then get on with making decisions. At that point, the decision about what amendments are tabled will be in the hands of the House. We will cover the full range of the Wright Committee report. I sought to arrange things in the way that I outlined because with 646 Members, who all have a view, we could end up with propositions that would cancel each other out. I thought that it would be good to set a clear programme for approval on the first day we debate the report, and see whether we could get some things sorted and agreed, before getting into a position whereby a plethora of proposals, and more than a plethora of amendments, would be tabled, and we could end up with less than we might have achieved had we been able to proceed on the basis of a consensus, pulled together by me as Leader of the House. I hope that we can proceed by consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.1/3">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome mentioned the Children, Schools and Families Bill Committee stage. He cannot have it both ways. Either there is rigid timetabling, which ensures that every bit of a Bill is scrutinised in Committee but leads to protests about timetabling, or there is no timetabling, the debate is front-loaded, and the Committee does not get to the end of the Bill. How that scrutiny is carried out is really in the hands of the Committee. We all want to make sure that there is good scrutiny on Second Reading, in Committee and on Report.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.1/4">As for the crime statistics, we have to look to reduce crime across all areas, including both violent crime and acquisitive crime. One encouraging thing is that the fall in crime, both violent and acquisitive, has been so marked that it has not increased during the recession. I think that this is the first time that that has happened during a recession. Usually, a recession is accompanied by an increase in acquisitive crime. On this occasion, with the roll-out of neighbourhood policing, police community support officers and all the other crime prevention measures, we have not seen crime rising; indeed, it has continued to fall.</p>

	<p pid="a.468.0/1">I am deeply honoured, Mr. Speaker, to be the first of those 28. I know that my right hon. and learned Friend shares my view that it is wrong that religious organisations should be able to discriminate against, for example, gay people or women who apply for non-religious posts in those organisations. She will also know that a Government amendment on that subject was defeated recently in the other place. Will she therefore take this opportunity to clarify for hon. Members whether she will reintroduce such an amendment when the Equality Bill returns to the Commons?</p>

	<p pid="a.468.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for raising this matter. The Government's policy is clear and has not changed. Our view remains that religious organisations employing people should comply with the law that applies to all other employers, whether that is the requirement to have written contracts, pay sick pay or the minimum wage, or the requirement not to sack people unfairly or discriminate against them. However, our position has always been that for specifically religious work-as a vicar, priest, rabbi or imam-religious organisations would be exempt from non-discrimination law. A religious organisation cannot discriminate against gay people or women when it hires a bookkeeper, but it can when choosing a minister of religion.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/2">The amendment that we proposed in the House of Lords did not intend to change that policy position. What it sought to do was make the distinction between religious and non-religious jobs clearer. The Lords did not regard our amendment as helpful. We will therefore leave the law as it is, and not bring the amendment back to this House. The law will remain as it was: in anti-discrimination law there is an exemption for religious jobs but not for non-religious jobs.</p>

Member has in his possession a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-04">4 December 2009</phrase> from the UK Border Agency confirming that these two men 'will be allowed to continue with their employment in the United Kingdom, until a decision has been made on their outstanding appeals'; warns anyone seeking a job to steer clear of Bestway Northern Limited; and further warns possible customers and clients to have nothing to do with these duplicitous tyrants.]</p>

On Monday they told the 800-strong work force of distinguished international scientists, who protect this country against swine flu, ebola, green monkey disease, and emerging diseases and viruses-and who, incidentally, are involved in the response to terrorism-that instead of rebuilding the centre on site, they were going close it down and move the 800 jobs to Essex.

It is in the public interest because before Lord Ashcroft was able to take his seat in the House of Lords, undertakings were given in relation to his tax affairs. The question is whether those undertakings have been met. Has he done what he promised in terms of paying tax in this country and putting his tax affairs on a proper footing? There has never been a definitive statement from him on that point, and when the Opposition have been asked they have simply given a formulaic code, which has not revealed the situation in its true light. The Information Commissioner has said that that information must be put into the open so that everybody can be sure that Lord Ashcroft has complied with the undertakings he gave in order to get into the House of Lords.</p>

The current expenses system has been cut right back, and in future all expenses will be set and administered independently. On the basis of today's report, it is now clear which Members need to pay back and how much. Obviously, we expect all Members to make arrangements to repay and it is clear from the report that most already have. In any event, I will bring to the House a resolution to authorise the recovery from Members' salary or allowances of any amount outstanding after <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-22">22 February</phrase>. All repayments will have had to be made-or firm arrangements to do so entered into-otherwise the recovery process will start after that date.

	<p pid="a.474.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. We never sought to, or indeed even unintentionally, propose non-discrimination laws covering bishops, rabbis, archbishops or priests. In the 2003 non-discrimination employment regulations, we explicitly allowed for an exemption for those involved in religious ministry, so I am sorry that he has taken the opportunity to spread a misapprehension. There was never an intention-and nor is there an intention-to apply the provisions to those involved in religious ministry. However, if a church, synagogue or mosque is hiring a cleaner, bookkeeper or finance officer, it will have to comply with the normal, non-discrimination provisions of employment, like all others. I hope that, instead of spreading misapprehension, he will reassure those who raised that concern with him that it never was the Government's intention to make that change. The amendment simply clarified the difference between a religious and non-religious job, and whatever the criticisms of the drafting, which I do not accept, nobody could think that it would say that being Archbishop of Canterbury was not a religious job.</p>

Gentleman strongly supports his local Royal British Legion, and I commend the work that he has told the House about and which Mr. Lyons is doing in his constituency. Obviously, those in the armed forces regard their work as very rewarding, but we all recognise that it requires selfless duty and places many restrictions on the lives not only of our service personnel, which they willingly accept, but of their families. As he will know, the Ministry of Defence has produced a Command Paper setting out our commitment to our armed forces, their families and veterans. That is a cross-Government initiative. Furthermore, he mentioned stress and mental health issues. There are six ongoing mental health pilots within the NHS and throughout the country, and they will continue and be evaluated.</p>

I know that the Treasury wants to be fully and openly accountable about this country's contributions to Europe, against the background that working with Europe is important in regard not only to security and climate change but to the economy.

In the week in which the Townswomen's Guild published the results of a survey of its 34,000 members which showed that over 95 per cent. were concerned that Britain was losing its national identity as a result of the scale of mass immigration that the country is currently having to put up with, it is important that politicians in this place should be seen to be discussing the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.478.0/1">Indeed. Those same points were made against the background of Irish immigration. They were also made in respect of Jewish immigration, and of those immigrants who came here from the Caribbean, particularly to work on London transport and in our health services. This country has great traditions from those who have been here for generations, and it has become great on the back of the work of many successive waves of immigrants over the centuries and in the past decades. It is important to ensure that we recognise the contributions of immigrants, and that we have a fair society in which everyone feels that they get a fair crack of the whip.</p>

Given that the Government had ample warning of the potential loophole in the law but took no steps to plug it, and given the amount of time that will have elapsed before it is eventually plugged, how much money belonging to terrorists or terrorist organisations does she think will be left in the country to be captured by the retrospective legislation that she is introducing next week?</p>

Planning and preparation have been under way, and now that the Court has made its decision, which it did yesterday, we have told the House how we are going to deal with this matter.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1623" name="David Willetts">the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts)</phrase> by way of a freedom of information request to the Student Loans Company. The same requests were made through a number of parliamentary questions that I tabled to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in December. Unfortunately, those questions remain unanswered. This morning, my office spoke to the office of the Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1936" name="Patrick McFadden">the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden)</phrase>. Following that, and my giving notice that I was going to raise this point of order, I have now been told that those questions will be answered today. Is it not outrageous that, while answers can be obtained as a result of freedom of information requests, parliamentary questions on the same topic can remain unanswered for nearly two months? What can be done to ensure that this gross discourtesy to the House does not recur?</p>

The provisions have major positive implications for those whose vehicles are clamped by cowboy clampers, but they also have financial implications for Government expenditure, as well as raising questions about any legal fees that might flow from them and about what the public might have to pay. There is also a possibility of local authorities having to spend money in this respect.

	<p pid="a.480.7/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely valid point.

I have no doubt that when I have concluded my remarks-I have many points to make-the Minister will take the opportunity to explain herself and explain the Government's rather haphazard way of dealing with this matter, so that we can decide whether it is appropriate for the House to approve this motion today.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.1/2">Of course, Her Majesty's Opposition welcome the provisions in the Crime and Security Bill to license businesses that engage in vehicle immobilisation. This change to the law is, I believe, long overdue, and I have no doubt that this will come as good news to motorists up and down the land, who are heartily fed up with being stung by cowboy clampers who charge exorbitant sums of money to all our constituents when they unwittingly park on private land, not realising the extent to which they could be fined. This, of course, has financial implications for the Government, for local authorities and, most importantly, for the constituents we are elected to represent. The Minister will need to answer these points.</p>

	<p pid="a.481.3/1">I will certainly endeavour to do so, but the points I am making have implications for the costs at local level. Until I can explain my arguments to the Minister, it is hard to see how she will be able to respond in a meaningful way.</p>

	<p pid="a.481.5/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The motion on the Order Paper seeks to authorise &quot;the imposition of charges&quot;, and I would like to focus on the word &quot;imposition&quot;. Why has the Minister not explained how these charges are to be imposed? Who will administer this measure? Will the Government make adequate provision to ensure that it is done in a practical and meaningful way that will work? I would be most grateful if the Minister would outline the cost implications in greater detail. What overall costs for the appeals process are envisaged? What assessment have the Government made of how many people are likely to use this service? How much would each appeal cost on average? These are important questions that simply must be answered.</p>

	<p pid="a.482.0/1">I think it is important to establish at this early stage whether the Minister intends to come back to the House and answer some of the very important questions that have been raised. The word &quot;charges&quot; is very broad and very vague, so I wonder whether my hon. Friend will be able to tempt the Minister to come back and give an assurance that she will make a substantive response as to what sort of charges are proposed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-02-04a.482.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1786" speakername="Andrew Rosindell" colnum="482"  time="012:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100204/debtext/100204-0008.htm#10020466000902">
	<p pid="a.482.1/1">I think my hon. Friend makes a valid point. I hope that the Minister has got the message at this stage-that those present in the House today feel that more detail should be given. How can we, as the House of Commons, make a judgment when so little information has been provided? I understand that the basis of the motion is financial, but to assess whether any financial motion should be approved, we need to understand how it will work in practice. The Minister will take the opportunity, I hope, to answer these questions and allay the concerns that many of our constituents may have.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/2">May I also ask the Minister how much will be paid into the Consolidated Fund? How does she expect to recoup any of these costs? This involves taxpayers' money, so we need to know the answer to that question. Who, indeed, would pay the legal fees of those clamped but found innocent? Where would the money to deal with all of this come from?</p>

	<p pid="a.482.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is very important to have clarification of the payment of fees? Will the charges apply to the separate parties or will they also include payment of the adjudicator and the adjudication process, which will have incurred some costs? Is this to be a system under which costs will be paid between the parties alone and what will the rates be? For example, if legal advice is provided, will all the attendant costs be covered or will there be a scale-based rate? It is highly important to clarify whether or not adjudication fees will be paid. Again, will they be paid at the proper cost rate or will there be fixed charges and a scale rate?</p>

	<p pid="a.482.3/1">Once again, my hon. Friend makes extremely valid points about how this whole system will work, what charges will be imposed, who will pay the bills for the adjudicators and the legal costs when things go wrong and how the system will operate in practice. We are being asked to approve the financial implementation without being given the full details of how the whole system will work in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.3/2">Will the Minister clarify whether there are any financial implications for local authorities? Will the same rules apply to private operators as to local councils that are responsible for parking enforcement on the public highways? Will she also explain how the system will work without a code of practice? Her Majesty's Opposition agree that there is a need for adjudication-</p>

	<p pid="a.484.0/1">That is a good question. We shall have to see what the Minister's explanation is before the House decides whether or not to divide. I hope that she will come clean and reveal everything.

	<p pid="a.484.0/2">Important details are hidden behind the motion. The whole issue of wheel-clamping is of great concern to our constituents, and we want financial provision to be made to ensure that the Bill will work effectively. We are all fed up with cowboy clampers. I assure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that Her Majesty's Opposition will do all that they can to support any sensible measure, practical or financial, to ensure that there is an end to cowboy clamping in our constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.484.1/1">What a meal <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1786" name="Andrew Rosindell">the hon. Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell)</phrase> has made of the Ways and Means motion. Having said that, however, I should like to make a couple of brief procedural points.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/2">Let me say first that the motion is before us because-yet again-substantial new parts of the Bill were introduced in Committee. Given that this is one of the criminal justice Bills with which we deal every year, it was to be hoped that Ministers would think a little about what they wanted to be in it before publishing it. The motion is before us because they did not, and they have now decided to add a couple of provisions. I do not know the merits of the provisions. I suspect that they are a very good idea-I should certainly like to see proper control of clampers and proper compensation for overseas victims of terrorism-but they should have been in the Bill from the start.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/3">My second procedural point concerns the timing of the motion. The matters involved are still before the Committee, which has yet to report to the House. It is always helpful for the House to be aware of what has been determined in Committee, and, before Report, to deal with the appropriate Ways and Means motion in order to authorise expenditure that is at present entirely hypothetical, because it is based on consideration in Committee of matters that the House as a whole has not yet had an opportunity to discuss.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/4">A Ways and Means motion is not the occasion on which to judge the merits of proposals such as this, far less to ask for details of the operation of a scheme. A Committee stage is the occasion on which that should be done, and the Report stage-if we reach it-will provide an opportunity for Members to have their say and for Ministers to explain the consequences of their proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/5">As you pointed out, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a very narrow motion whose purpose is to authorise payments if, and only if, the proposals are found to be satisfactory on Report, pass through another place and receive Royal Assent. There is a scrutiny process and we do need to examine the details, but this is not the right time to do that. I have my doubts about the procedure as currently constituted. I do not think that even the limited consideration that we can give the proposals during the debate makes this an appropriate time to examine them.</p>

I entirely agree with what he said about the procedure. I think it is generally accepted that dealing with money motions is one of the things that Parliament does very badly. The question of how we spend money is not debated properly.

	<p pid="a.485.6/1">I disagree. I think that Ways and Means motions should always be debated in full. The spending of money is a very important aspect, but I do not think that the fact that we are in a financial mess of unique magnitude makes any difference to the fact that we should always discuss ways and means. However, I do not know how we are to do that without having been given even an estimate of the amount involved, and without knowing whether the Minister is going to tell us more. Perhaps little notes are being passed to her; I do not know.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.6/2">I do not want to detain the House for long, but I am trying to make a serious point. We know about the principle, which was a matter for the Committee and will be decided on Report. However, we debate Ways and Means motions very rarely. We normally nod them through, saying, &quot;Oh yes, it is all right to spend that amount of money.&quot; That is where our Parliament fails and the American House of Representatives, for instance, succeeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.6/3">Given the furore that is undoubtedly going on outside this place today about the importance of Parliament, it is sad that, yet again, the Government have in a sense taken Parliament for granted, and have not given us more detail on a specific Ways and Means motion. The merits of the issue are not important; what is important is how much we are, or are not, going to spend. When I decide how to vote, or whether to divide the House, I want to be in a position to know that. I have a feeling that if the Minister does not tell us, the Division Bells will ring.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.1/1">The Minister has said there will be a consultation. Can she assure the House that it will not be the usual type of Government consultation, which is a sop to public opinion with decisions already having been made but a consultation taking place for the sake of it? Will she give an assurance that genuine consultation will take place, and that the views of those consulted will be taken into account before decisions are made?</p>

	<p pid="a.487.2/2">The Private Security Industry Act 2001 places a requirement on individual vehicle immobilisers who operate on private land-questions were asked about the impact on local authorities, but this applies not to local authority land, but to private land-carrying out the clamping of vehicles and the associated activities of towing or impounding. They must hold a licence issued by the Security Industry Authority if they charge a release fee.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.3/1">I fully appreciate that the Bill does not apply to local authorities and their land, but does the Minister not accept that it is bound to have a financial impact on local authorities, because the public always go to the local council when there is a parking problem? Even when that takes place on private land, they still go to the council, so this will still have an impact on local authority spending.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is straying into rather more substantive issues to do with the Bill more generally, and they will, of course, be dealt with in Committee. This measure refers specifically to private land, and the action people might take and who they might approach if their vehicle has been clamped cannot be addressed in respect of it.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.5/1">The excellent Minister is being most helpful, but I must be being extremely thick today.

	<p pid="a.487.6/1">Well, the hon. Gentleman must decide whether he wishes to call a Division, and thereby take a step that his constituents-or mine, for that matter-might decide was simply challenging the substantive issue itself and seeking not to allow the usual procedures to take place that would ensure this important measure makes progress through the House. That is a decision for him. I have said to him that questions of charges and fees will be considered, to some extent, in Committee, and also in consultation. I can only reiterate that this is a Ways and Means motion and that therefore it is about not the cost of provisions or the finer detail, but the charges and payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.2/1">I certainly will. The Minister is doing an excellent job in trying to persuade the House not to call a Division on this matter, but does she accept that there is so much concern in the House today because of both the poor explanation at the beginning of the debate and the muddled way in which the Government have handled our discussion and the issue of introducing further motions? There will be another Ways and Means motion in respect of this Bill next week. It seems to me that the whole Bill is more about the forthcoming election than actually achieving results for the British people.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.3/1">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that these are important matters, which is why the Government are responding to the views that have been expressed to us by bringing forward these measures. In respect of the resolution that is required for the overseas victims of terrorism scheme, that is a complicated scheme and given that it has been a difficult task, I believe the Government have done all we possibly can to ensure that we bring forward this legislation as soon as possible and in the most appropriate fashion.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/2">Clause 39 of the Bill amends the 2001 Act to provide for vehicle immobilisation businesses to require a licence issued by the SIA in order to carry out these activities. Regulations will specify the conditions that businesses will have to meet in order to qualify for a licence. These will include maximum release charges and other rules governing clamping, towing and impounding.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/3">A Government amendment to the Bill provides for a scheme to be set up so that motorists can appeal to an independent tribunal or adjudicator in respect of release charges. Appeals can be on either the principle of the charge-for example, if the signs were inadequate-or the amount charged, if it exceeds the maximum to be set. The detail of the appeal arrangements and rules will be set out in regulations to be made for the purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/4">The appeal scheme will be funded largely by the vehicle immobilisation industry. The fixed costs of running an appeals system would be met by businesses as part of their business licence fee. It is proposed that vehicle immobilisation businesses will also pay a set sum in respect of the total variable running costs of adjudications, covering costs such as the adjudicator's time and the costs of accommodation for hearings.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.5/1">The full details of the costs of the scheme will be considered in Committee. Let me simply say today that we are making provision through the Ways and Means motion to ensure that this procedure can be debated thoroughly in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.5/2">Businesses will only pay the sum to which I have just referred when they lose an appeal. As a result, the payment will reflect the variable costs of all adjudications. It is also intended that the motorist will be required to pay a modest fee for each appeal made, irrespective of whether that appeal succeeds. The intention is not to burden appellants unduly, but to discourage speculative appeals without foundation.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.5/3">Since the payment made by losing companies will contribute to covering the costs of other cases where the vehicle immobilisation business has won the appeal, and it will be based on averaging out the costs over all appeal cases, there is an element of cross-subsidy. The Home Office believes that this is the fairest approach; the bulk of the overall cost is met by those companies that lose appeals, but a modest fee will discourage motorists from speculative appeals. In general, a Ways and Means resolution is needed if people are required to pay out money other than for a service or other benefit that they are receiving fairly directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.5/4">The House will be aware that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on Second Reading that we would table amendments to the Bill to provide for the establishment of a victims of overseas terrorism compensation scheme. As with the legislation governing the domestic criminal injuries compensation scheme, the amendments to the Bill include provision for compensation to be repayable in circumstances specified in the scheme. The criminal injuries compensation scheme of 2008 provides for compensation to be repaid where the beneficiary subsequently receives a payment in respect of the same injury from another source-for example, following a civil claim for damages. We envisage that the overseas terrorism compensation scheme will include a similar provision. As with the domestic scheme, new clause 14 tabled to the Bill provides for any such repayments to be paid into the Consolidated Fund. Provisions in legislation about the use of receipts must be authorised by a Ways and Means resolution, hence the second paragraph of the motion before the House today.</p>

	<p pid="a.491.4/1">Indeed; that is not the first time that I have made that mistake. The three of us took part in a rather different discussion yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.4/2">This Bill rewrites a range of corporation tax provisions, including provisions about the computation of profits, small profits relief, losses, group relief and distributions. It also rewrites some provisions that are more specialised-for example, those related to UK real estate investment trusts and others related to avoidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.4/3">The Bill has been produced by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs' tax law rewrite project and continues the project's work to modernise direct tax legislation so that it is clearer and easier to use. Last year, the project completed the first part of the task of rewriting corporation tax when the Corporation Tax Act 2009 was enacted. This Bill completes that work and means that, substantially, the whole of the legislation relating to corporation tax will have been rewritten.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.4/4">Let me remind the House about the work of the tax law rewrite project. It was set up in 1996 by the then Chancellor-the current shadow Business Secretary-following a defeat for the then Government in the Finance Bill Committee, of which I was a member, on an amendment moved by the then hon. Member for Beaconsfield, Tim Smith. The project has, on the whole, continued to enjoy support from across the House since its establishment. Its principal aim is that the rewritten legislation should be far more accessible to users than the source legislation, some of which is dense and difficult to follow. Its success has been widely acknowledged and confirmed by independent market research.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.4/5">To date, the project has rewritten the capital allowances and income tax legislation, and completed the first part of the task of rewriting corporation tax legislation. This Bill is the sixth produced by the project. The project takes great care to ensure that the legislation's effect is essentially unchanged by rewriting, but it can make minor changes in the law where they improve the legislation-for example, to remove ambiguity, to repeal obsolete provisions or to correct minor, unintended anomalies. There are 66 such changes set out in the explanatory notes to this Bill. Major changes will always be matters for a Finance Bill. All proposed changes in the law are considered by both the project's committees, and no minor changes are included in the Bill without the approval of both.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.4/6">The work would have been impossible without considerable input from tax specialists and others, and I express particular thanks to them and to the members of the project's consultative committee, chaired by Miss Robina Dyall, who have ensured that the consultation has been detailed and thorough. The consultative committee includes representatives of small and large businesses, accountants, lawyers and other tax specialists. The time and commitment they have all invested are greatly appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.4/7">The strategy of the project is set by its steering committee, chaired by the noble Lord Newton of Braintree, which includes Members from both Houses of Parliament and members of the judiciary, of business and consumer groups and of the accountancy and legal professions. I am particularly grateful to Lord Newton, who took over from the noble Lord Howe, for his commitment and guidance, and to the members of his committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.4/8">The Joint Committee of both Houses, of which I was a member, chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>, considered the Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-11">11 January</phrase> and noted the extensive consultation process to which it had been exposed. It paid close attention to the reasons for rewriting recently enacted legislation, the impact of the rewrite changes proposed in the Bill, and the powers in the Bill to amend the legislation. It also considered all the amendments to the Bill. The Joint Committee concluded that the Bill is a welcome clarification of the existing law, which, as a result, will be easier to use and more accessible. The Committee was satisfied that the changes to the law were of very minor significance and it accepted the amendments, all of which were technical.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.4/9">This Bill is the second of two Bills that rewrite corporation tax legislation. Some of the corporation tax rules in it originally applied to both income tax and corporation tax, but as the tax law rewrite project's previous Acts provided a separate set of provisions for income tax, the income tax provisions have been in the rewrite style, whereas the corresponding corporation tax provisions remained in the original form. The Bill finishes the process of bringing the drafting of corporation tax back into line with that for income tax where the provisions share the same source legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.4/10">The Bill is a worthwhile contribution to modernising direct tax legislation, making it clearer and easier to use, and it maintains the project's excellent record in improving current legislation and has been welcomed by those who use it. I am very grateful for the support that has been shown across the House throughout this exercise, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.492.0/1">It is pleasure to speak on Third Reading. This is very nearly the end of the process-we have another Bill to discuss this afternoon-but it is a good opportunity for us to thank those who have been involved in it over the past 14 years. As the Minister said, it all began in 1996 when my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, set up the tax law rewrite project. He went on to Chair the Joint Committee on Tax Law Rewrite Bills. Those are two of the many contributions-both past and future-that he will have made to public life.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/2">By the time a tax Bill reaches its Third Reading, an Opposition Front Bencher has usually devoted what feels like weeks of their life to addressing the matter. The tax law rewrite project process is unusual, in that an Opposition Front Bencher's involvement tends to be on Second Reading and Third Reading. The Minister has a slightly greater role as a member of the Committee, but I am sure that he would be the first to accept that it is not quite as demanding upon his time as a Finance Bill would normally be.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/3">None the less, for many people this has been the most enormous project, and one should pay tribute to those who have been involved in it: the independent steering committee, which is chaired by Lord Newton and, as the Minister said, was previously chaired by Lord Howe of Aberavon, who has had a long-term interest in the making of tax law; Members of both Houses who have been part of the Joint Committee; members of the judiciary, and of the legal and accounting professions; and business and consumer groups. I particularly wish to thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase> for his service as Chair of the Joint Committee. In its report, which I read through, he acknowledged that he was new to the process, but he handled the proceedings with the skill that one would expect of him.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/4">I also wish to thank the consultative committee, which consisted of members of the main tax and business representative bodies, and the many consultees involved in the process, both in the professional organisations and businesses, and in Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. They responded to the project by devoting a great deal of their time to it, without any compensation as such, and they played an important role in developing this law.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/5">Of course I also wish to thank the tax law rewrite project team for all its efforts over many years in developing this legislation. The first bit of legislation was the Capital Allowances Act 2001. It was followed by three Acts relating to income tax: the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, ITEPA; the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, ITTOIA; and the more simply-named Income Tax Act 2007. In this context, one should also mention the Income Tax (Pay As You Earn) Regulations 2003. The legislation on corporation tax is: the Corporation Tax Act 2009, this Bill and the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Bill, which we will debate subsequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/6">I have set out my thanks to all those involved in the process; the level of professionalism has been very high. I now wish to raise a query that the Minister will anticipate, and it is not, in any way, meant to take away from anything done by those who have been involved in the process. Does the process go far enough? It has required a great deal of expertise, it has placed great demands upon the consultees and it has cost &#163;37 million, which is not an insignificant sum.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/7">It is worth citing the remarks made by John Whiting, the tax policy director of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, with whom those of us who have anything to do with tax tend to be familiar. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The Rewrite has done a good job but our concern has always been that it has not really been the right job. The new law is certainly clearer but it would have been better to put the effort into simplifying the system rather than just the wording.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/9">He went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/10" class="indent">&quot;the Institute believes that bringing the Rewrite to a close is correct, as we have previously said. We would hope that more effort can now be put into simplifying the tax system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/11">We fully endorse those remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/12">The importance of the project has not just been about the rewriting of the legislation and the provision of greater clarity in the wording-that is important; we can build upon a lot of the work that has been done, because we can use some of the structures that exist. For example, the Joint Committee involves parliamentarians making use of outside expertise to scrutinise technical legislation with perhaps more thoroughness than we normally achieve through the Finance Bill process. I have had the honour of being part of that process for the past four years, but I wonder whether, in this complicated area of tax law, a committee that can inquire more than debate and that has access to expert advice is able to provide greater scrutiny than the traditional parliamentary process.</p>

	<p pid="a.494.0/1">There is a general demand, which I think we all accept, from business to have corporation tax simplified. However, the paradox is that when one starts talking about removing a specific allowance that affects a specific business, the tune changes somewhat. Thus, it is rather difficult to conduct the process in a universally agreed way.</p>

	<p pid="a.494.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly good point; the losers tend to make more noise than the winners-that is inevitable. I was coming to the issue of simplification, which relates to the argument that John Whiting has been making. Two elements are worth exploring, the first of which is the possibility of a greater degree of scrutiny. The tax law rewrite project has involved scrutiny, but the project has had a very limited remit: to focus on rewriting the language. We will discuss the conclusions that have resulted from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.1/2">The second element is the push towards simplification, and I take on board fully the remarks of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> about that. None the less, the view of my party is that simplification is worth pursuing. All this, whether we are discussing the clarity of language, which is what this Bill is about, or simplification, fits into the issue of the competitiveness of the tax system. I will not digress at any length into corporation tax rates, for example, but this is obviously a Bill on corporation tax and it would be remiss of me not to mention the fact that we used to have a corporation tax rate that was lower than the OECD average in 1997, whereas it is now higher. In 1997, the UK had the 11th lowest corporation tax rate in the world, and now has the 23rd lowest-</p>

	<p pid="a.494.3/1">I am grateful for that guidance, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/2">I certainly shall not pursue the issue of corporation tax rates, but clearly the intention behind the Bill is to improve the clarity of corporation tax law. That is an important element in improving-or trying to improve-the competitiveness of the UK tax system. Our argument is that we should go further and that simplification would do much to improve our competitiveness. The process that we have seen in the tax law rewrite project is a valuable guide to how we could go further. I shall not dwell on our proposal for an office of tax simplification, which would make use, as this project has, of the expertise in the tax professions, in businesses, in HMRC and in HM Treasury to ensure that we develop our tax law in an attractive way.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/3">It is worth stressing that we live in a very competitive world. The UK, in many respects, should be well placed to benefit from a globalised world, but it needs a competitive tax system. May I briefly highlight the fact that in 1997 the UK was fourth in the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness report's ranking for having the lowest tax burden? According to a measurement that is not exactly the same but is the closest equivalent, it is now ranked 84th for the extent and effect of taxation. That is a substantial decline, not because of the tax rewrite project but despite it, of course. None the less, we need to go much further. We believe that an office of tax simplification would be a huge step forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/4">Let me raise another query with which the Minister might be familiar, as he briefly touched on it in his remarks. The argument was often made that making legislation clearer in the context of income tax was very important. Income tax is relevant to nearly all of us, whereas companies tend to be advised on corporation tax. It is an area that inevitably involves some specialist expertise. Is it quite as necessary to pursue a rewrite project in that context?</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/5">Of course, the first point to make-the Minister touched on this-is that there is an interrelationship between income tax and corporation tax, and having reformed income tax, it makes sense to follow with this corporation tax Bill. The second point is that existing practitioners are often somewhat dubious about the project, because they already know where everything is. They are familiar with the existing law and the various sections and schedules, and they know their way around. There is a complication when a new Act that changes things around is introduced. Of course, one must have a degree of intergenerational fairness to tax advisers in this area, and it might well be easier for future generations to find their way around with this new legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/6">Sometimes it is recent legislation that is being amended-again, the Minister touched on this point. In particular, he highlighted the legislation on real estate investment trusts. The regime for REITs was introduced in 2006, and it is substantially rewritten in the Bill. I was struck by the remarks of John Sellers, the head drafter of HMRC's tax law rewrite project, in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-11">11 January</phrase>. He referred to the substantial recasting of REIT legislation and went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/7" class="indent">&quot;the legislation had been passed, I think, at a point when policy was still being developed and in those circumstances it was difficult to achieve the optimum arrangement of the material.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/8">A couple of points can be made about that. First, I would be interested to know from the Minister, with his vast experience as a Treasury Minister, how often legislation is passed while policy is still being developed? Perhaps naively, I thought that the policy came first and the legislation followed, but possibly that was not the case. Perhaps that was a peculiarity of the Minister at the time, who, if I recall correctly, is now the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families. None the less, that is somewhat surprising. We will always face the need to improve the clarity of legislation if we do it that way round-if we do the legislation first and the policy second. That is somewhat surprising in this context because, if I recall correctly, the REIT legislation was in gestation for some time. It was not rushed. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us why it has been necessary to recast it.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/9">Let me return to the limitations of the tax law rewrite project. There is quite a strong argument for reconsidering the REIT legislation, not just in terms of how it is structured and drafted, but on its merits, too. In the proceedings on the Finance Bill last year I tabled amendments on the restriction on distributions, for example. At least 90 per cent. of property income must be distributed in the year in question, and currently that has to be done in cash. There was an argument about whether shares should be allowed too, given that there should be no tax consequence. I do not want to go outside the scope of the Bill, but perhaps the Minister will say something about whether the Government are considering the REIT regime, which has cross-party support, more widely. I know there have been difficult economic conditions for REITs, but there is an argument about whether the regime could go further and whether reforms will be necessary. I would be interested to hear his views.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/10">None of these debates would be complete without my briefly mentioning the order-making powers in clauses 1178, 1179 and 1180. The Minister customarily reassures us that those order-making powers, which enable primary legislation to be changed by regulation, will be used only in exceptional circumstances. The Bill restricts them somewhat. I would be interested to know to what extent those powers have been used for previous tax law rewrite Bills. One point that was raised in Committee-it would be helpful if the Minister could address it in this debate-was whether a negative resolution is sufficient or whether the affirmative procedure should apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/11">My final query-I apologise: I have two final points; I am sorry to disappoint the Government Whip-relates to whether some of the changes will involve more or less tax being paid. The Minister has said that no major changes are contained in the measures, and rightly so, because they do not involve the same level of parliamentary scrutiny. However, I should like to know whether there has been any assessment of the revenue implications of the changes in the Bill, and whether there is a rough and ready test to determine whether a change constitutes a major change-one too significant to be contained in a tax law rewrite Bill. I should also like to know how that assessment is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/12">Finally, some of the amendments made in Committee, particularly those to schedule 1, relate to Northern Ireland, and I wonder why those issues were missed earlier. When the Minister responds to this point, will he say something about the process when new issues arise in Committee? Where do they come from, who identifies them and are they part of the consultation process? We would like to get a better idea of the point at which weaknesses and omissions are addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/13">Subject to those queries and questions, we welcome the Bill. The tax law rewrite project might not be perfect and might have too limited a remit, and there is more to be done to move towards simplification, but we should none the less acknowledge the enormous efforts that have been made by many people to improve the clarity of our tax law. That is an important objective. A start has been made, and we hope that a future Government will take on the project and do more to simplify our tax system, not just to clarify it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-02-04a.497.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="497"  time="014:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100204/debtext/100204-0011.htm#10020466000957">
	<p pid="a.497.0/1">I have not had the advantage, or indeed the pleasure, of being on the Committee, but I pay tribute to all the people who have laboured long and hard to bring the Bill before the House. This kind of legislation takes me back to my days as a council leader when members were annually shown for comment long papers on treasury management that were full of algebra, rather like pages 13 to 16 of the Bill. They were always passed without undue comment, and I note in passing that hon. Members have not exactly been fighting to get into this debate. If the truth were told, only a few pointy-headed people in the Treasury have complete mastery of the entire legislative feast that confronts us-and that includes the Minister, whose knowledge is encyclopaedic, so I assume that he understands it. There is a real case, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> said, for expert advice in certain areas in which Members' background knowledge is deficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/2">The measures before us are, in part, highly technical, and largely uncontentious. The document is one for tax lawyers to work with as much as one for politicians to mull over. It is largely a tax rewrite and consolidation, rather than ground-breaking, innovative legislation that we need to get excited and argumentative about. It is, however, important, and it would be wrong and foolish of us to pretend that we could do justice to it all here in the time available, so I shall content myself with probing the Minister simply about the general thrust and shape of the legislation, bearing in mind that I wear another hat as a member of the Public Accounts Committee. The Committee recently did an excellent report on corporation tax, which is an odd tax because research shows that raising it does not necessarily raise the total take and that lowering it does not necessarily reduce the take. I think that we can all conclude from that observation that it is easily avoidable.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/3">One point that the Committee made in its report follows from what the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire has just been saying. Conclusion two of the report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Businesses in the United Kingdom can legitimately reduce their Corporation Tax payments by claiming a range of reliefs and allowances. In some cases, the liability may reduce to zero, even though the businesses have made profits. The amount of tax foregone is likely to be substantial, but is not visible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/5">I cannot tell whether the Bill has been crafted to do what the Committee wants the Government to do, which is ensure that a proper balance is achieved between allowances and overall liability, but I welcome the Minister's assurance that he is mindful of that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/6">The Committee also pointed out that the Department does not have</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/7" class="indent">&quot;a robust measure of the Corporation Tax gap&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/8">by which we mean the difference between what large businesses pay and their theoretical liability. The report makes another point that is worth making now, given the long evolution of the legislation-that, in a change from recent times, about half the growth in global trade now comes from transactions between subsidiaries of multinational companies. However, recommendation eight states:</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/9" class="indent">&quot;In the United Kingdom, groups of companies are not required to prepare consolidated Company Tax returns so the Department cannot assess the effective Corporation Tax rate across a group of companies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/10">It then cites Australia and Canada as counter-examples of where things are done a little better. I do not suppose that the legislation was crafted to resolve all those issues, but can we have an assurance from the Minister that those anxieties require a legislative response, and will he ponder whether vehicles such as this Bill provide an appropriate opportunity for that?</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/11">I have other concerns, including concerns about the development of bespoke tax avoidance schemes. The Minister is acutely aware of those concerns, and I know that he is working hard to close loopholes where and when they appear. Corporation tax matters are generally controversial, and no issue to do with taxation and this Government is simple. However, corporation tax is a valuable piece of the fiscal jigsaw, and we have to hope that this legislation has got things right.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-02-04a.498.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" colnum="498"  time="014:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100204/debtext/100204-0011.htm#10020466000958">
	<p pid="a.498.0/1">I welcome the constructive comments from the hon. Members for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and for Southport (Dr. Pugh), and the broad support that the Bill enjoys. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire suggested that the work should go further and the underlying tax rules should be simplified, but I remind him that the Government have already committed to simplifying the tax system, and we are working with a wide range of interested parties through the tax simplification reviews. The rewrite complements that commitment. I also draw his attention to the fact that the UK compares very favourably internationally, ranking first among G7 countries for ease of paying taxes. The World Bank &quot;Paying Taxes 2010&quot; survey is well worth a read. It makes the point that in the UK it typically takes 110 hours for a company to comply with paying taxes, whereas in Canada, France, the United States, Germany, Japan and Italy it takes a great deal longer. In Japan and Italy, for example, it takes more than 300 hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/2">Ease of compliance is what really makes a difference for businesses. For the reasons that we have discussed, more pages of legislation are appropriate for this issue, because although income tax and corporation tax legislation have been placed in separate locations, ease of use and clarity have been improved. I am happy to repeat the assurance that I gave on Second Reading and in Committee that the powers cannot be used to change the law in relation to periods before the Bill comes into force, so the powers are time-limited. As with previous rewrite Acts, I can confirm that the powers will not be used unless the tax law rewrite project's consultative and steering committees both agree that they should be so used.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/3">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked me about the rewriting of the real estate investment trust legislation. That reflects the fact that when the REIT legislation was introduced by the Finance Act 2006, there had not been time fully to work out how it should apply in certain cases, particularly in relation to joint venture companies and groups. Powers were therefore taken in that Act to enable those gaps to be filled using regulations, but the resulting regulations are considered to be equal in importance to the legislation in the Act. So I think that it is appropriate for them to be addressed as they have been.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/4">The hon. Gentleman asked about the powers to correct the legislation. The five rewritten Acts so far include more than 4,500 sections, but a total of only 97 errors have been corrected either by using the powers or by primary legislation. That is a great credit to the extensive consultation process and to those who gave their time and expertise to review the draft clauses. Most of the errors have been corrected in primary legislation, rather than by using the powers that we have discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/5">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Southport for the points that he raised, and I can give him the assurance that he sought. We certainly bear the concerns that he raised in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/6">I pay tribute again to the work of the team led by Robina Dyall. This Bill does not reform tax law, but it is important and has cross-party support. It will make things easier for everyone using tax legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/7">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/8" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>

	<p pid="a.500.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">This Bill has two themes. First, it rewrites international provisions such as double taxation relief, transfer pricing, advance pricing agreements and tax arbitrage. Secondly, it helps users of tax legislation by relocating and, where appropriate, rewriting provisions that would otherwise have been left unhelpfully in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 or in one of the Finance Acts.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/3">As we have just discussed, last year the tax law rewrite project completed the first part of rewriting corporation tax legislation when the Corporation Tax Act 2009 was enacted. A second Corporation Tax Bill, the sixth Bill produced by the project, has just received its Third Reading. As a result, the whole of the legislation relating to corporation tax will have been rewritten.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/4">This is the seventh and final Bill produced by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs' tax law rewrite project. As with the Bills produced by the project in the past, this one continues the work to modernise our direct tax legislation so that it is clearer and easier to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/5">There is a further point that I want to make about the approach taken in this Bill. In rewriting the international provisions, this Bill, unlike previous rewrite Bills, does not separate them for income tax and corporation tax purposes. This different approach was agreed in consultation with users represented by the independent committees that oversee and support the work of the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/6">The project takes great care to ensure that the effect of the legislation remains the same, but it can encompass minor changes in the law when they improve the legislation. There are 15 such changes detailed in the explanatory notes to this Bill, although of course major changes will always be matters for a Finance Bill. All proposed changes in the law are considered by both the project's committees, and no minor changes are included in the Bill without their approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/7">Again, I should like to express particular thanks to the UK tax specialists, and others. My gratitude also goes to members of the project's consultative committee, chaired by Robina Dyall, who have ensured that the consultation has been detailed and thorough. The consultative committee includes representatives of small and large businesses, accountants, lawyers and other tax specialists. They have been very generous with their time and energy, for which we are very grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/8">The strategy of the project is set by its steering committee, chaired by Lord Newton of Braintree, which includes members from both Houses of Parliament, the judiciary, business and consumer groups. I am particularly grateful to Lord Newton for his commitment and guidance, and to the members of his committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/9">As we debated previously, the Joint Committee of both Houses was chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>. It considered the Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-11">11 January</phrase> and concluded that the Bill is a welcome clarification of the existing law, which as a result will be easier to use and more accessible to all users. The Committee was satisfied that the changes to the law were of very minor significance, and it accepted the amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/10">This Bill is a worthwhile contribution to modernising our direct tax legislation so that it is clearer and easier to use. It maintains the project's excellent record in improving current legislation and has been welcomed by those who use it. Once again, I am grateful for the support that has been shown across the House throughout this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/11">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.501.0/1">It is almost tempting to deliver essentially the same speech that I delivered a couple of moments ago, but that would break the heart of the Government Whip and I would hate to do that. I am also very tempted to say, &quot;I refer the House to the speech I gave some moments ago,&quot; but perhaps that would go to the other extreme.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/2">The international aspect of taxation is hugely important for an outward-looking economy such as the UK's. We witnessed great difficulties in 2008, when a number of companies moved their head offices out of the UK because of concerns over international taxation, in particular the Government's consultation with regard to controlled foreign companies that was published in 2007. We touched on that point on Second Reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/3">We welcome progress towards greater clarity in this respect, but we touched on the issue of controlled foreign companies in the Second Reading debate of <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-15">15 December</phrase>. The Minister made it clear then that a consultation document was to be published in the new year, which would lead ultimately to legislation that I presume will be incorporated in this Bill when it becomes an Act. The consultation document was published in January, and the early indications that we have seen are encouraging. The Government are moving towards a more territorial system, and it is worth putting it on record that the Opposition believe that that is something that we need to pursue.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/4">Of course, the real test will come when we see the details in the consultation document and what will follow from it. It might be useful to mention that one of the points raised with us is that we need to know how the new user-friendly motive regime contained in the consultation document will operate in practice. The outcome must avoid causing difficulties with HMRC and placing an administrative burden on multinationals that are looking to locate in the UK. It is important that we have a competitive tax system that encourages business to locate here.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/5">Many of the remarks that I made earlier also apply equally to this Bill, and I should like to add my thanks to the various organisations and individuals that the Minister mentioned in his remarks, but I want to make a final point that I could also have made about the previous Bill. That is that witnesses at the Committee stage observed that the engagement by consultees seems to have fallen away slightly. As I noted in the earlier debate, the tax professions and businesses want legislation that goes further than merely clarifying and simplifying the language. They want something that starts to address the substance as well. I make that point again but, those comments apart, we support this Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.502.0/1">If the re-committed Corporation Tax Bill was opaque, this is doubly so, and I say that as a veteran of several double taxation statutory instruments in my time. I want briefly to commend the Government and the Minister for the seriousness of their intent in this matter. I note the updating of tax avoidance legislation. When 82 per cent. of central London commercial properties are owned by companies registered outside the UK-that is the figure from the chief executive of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs-when companies exploiting the developed world's resources choose to base themselves largely in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Isle of Man and pay little if any tax, and when our biggest retailer put its property portfolio in Liechtenstein, there is a problem, but it is one that the Government have endeavoured to square up to.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/2">Tax avoidance and double taxation are two incompatible evils, and any Government who recognise the reality of international finance need to strike the right balance between them. The Government, and the Financial Secretary in particular, have been resourceful and persistent in their efforts in this regard, and have accelerated the work in this very complex field, using what coercive and persuasive powers they have. I know that the Financial Secretary has had discussions with Crown dependencies' many tax havens and we see now a panorama of treaties around the world, and statutory instruments in this place are multiplying similarly. It is an important point. In a depressed world, it is important that all pay their fair share of tax, and an aspect of this Bill, at any rate, is part of the long, painful, not unrewarding task of making that happen, in which the Financial Secretary has played a conspicuous part.</p>

	<p pid="a.502.1/1">Once again, I welcome the helpful remarks made by the hon. Members for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and for Southport (Dr. Pugh). I was particularly interested in and grateful for what the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said in passing about the discussion document that we have published recently on the reform of controlled foreign company rules. I agree with him about the importance of this key issue for the UK's tax competitiveness and I welcome further discussion with him and others in the House and with the large number of companies and organisations that will be taking a close interest as work on this goes forward with a view to legislating-I hope, in the finance Act next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.1/2">I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Southport for his comments about the seriousness of the Government's intent in tackling tax evasion and avoidance. This is an area that he has taken a close and helpful interest in and I am grateful to him for what he said. Over the last year we have made more progress on tax information exchange than was made in the previous 10 years. The interest that he has shown is a helpful addition to making the progress that is needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.503.0/1">May I take this opportunity to reiterate the remarks that I have made in some of those double taxation treaty statutory instrument committees? I know that there is potentially a backlog in getting through some of the treaties, such is the number that have been entered into in recent years, and the Opposition are willing to co-operate with the Government to ensure that we can get through as many of those as possible. We think that that adds to the attractiveness of the UK as an economic proposition, as well as addressing some of the concerns about tax avoidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.504.2/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the issue of rail services on the east coast main line from stations in Northumberland. I am particularly pleased to be doing so in the early afternoon rather than at the usual time of 6 o'clock, because the last train to Berwick is at 6 o'clock and that is my only opportunity to get there before my surgery tomorrow morning. That illustrates one of the weaknesses in the present service, but I will say by way of preface that over the 36 years that I have been a Member of Parliament we have seen significant improvement in the service-not massive improvement, but significant improvement-particularly from Berwick and Alnmouth, achieved by stopping some more of the fast through trains there. That has paid dividends in terms of the number of passengers using the trains, which I will come back to.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/2">In a relatively short time we have had, or will soon have had, four operators running the east coast main line service, and that is not counting British Rail, which ran it previously. We had GNER, which was an adventurous and innovative company, determined to provide good passenger service, and its departure was lamented by many travellers on the line. Then we had National Express, and while at first people were fearful of what would happen with a new operator, it made some changes, but generally achieved other things to compensate for them, including greater punctuality, and people were sorry to see it go. Now we have East Coast, which the Government own, so the Minister runs the trains on our line, indirectly, and so far it seems to be doing a reasonably good job of it, so much so that many travellers on the line, myself included, would rather have some stability and see the East Coast, Government-owned company running it for some time rather than rushing into another operator quickly. To lose one operator seems careless, but to lose two seems downright incompetent, and were we to lose three, I do not know where we would be. It goes back to the problem of trying to exact too big a premium for the system in general from the operator of the profitable east coast main line. The closed auction process-the bidding war-led companies that really wanted to run the service to overbid, and when events came along, including recession, they were unable to continue, and it has been a messy story.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/3">But now, as I say, we have a Government-owned company running the East Coast service. However, that is not the only involvement that the Minister has because the Government determine what services will be run under the franchise system, and both the East Coast and the CrossCountry franchises are set by Government in considerable detail. This is one of the occasions when Ministers cannot say that these are all matters for somebody else; there is close ministerial and departmental involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/4">My focus this afternoon is on the stations that lie in the county of Northumberland, particularly Berwick, Alnmouth and Morpeth, the first two being in my constituency, and Morpeth being one that serves a considerable area of my constituency. They all depend on east coast main line services and CrossCountry services. The local service to those stations is very limited, except in the case of Morpeth. The local service also serves Widdrington, Acklington and Chathill in my constituency, and we are working to improve it. We are also working to reinstate a station platform at Belford because of the absurdity that a train goes there twice a day and cannot collect any passengers. I will say something about that later. We are making real progress on that, and it may be the first station reopened in our part of the world since Dr. Beeching. If we achieve that, which I believe we can, we shall all be delighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/5">I would like to see improvements to that local service, but for the moment I want to concentrate on the express mainline services. There would be no adequate train service at all from Berwick and Alnmouth were it not for stops for East Coast and CrossCountry trains-stops for fast trains. Berwick depends on those entirely, and Alnmouth very largely. Over the years, we have achieved some more stops for these trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/6">We saw a particularly good improvement when Chris Green was running Virgin Trains. I was keen to demonstrate to him that there was considerable scope for getting more passengers at Alnmouth station, so I had him to tea here in the House of Commons and sent him up on a trip to look at Alnwick garden and the features of the town. He came back full of interest and excitement, and introduced several new stops on CrossCountry trains through Alnmouth on business grounds. At the same time, we made some improvements to the station. A real business dividend came out of that. Additional custom came on to the trains because the timetable was more viable. People would get a train in the morning because they knew there was a train in the afternoon that they could get back on. The timetable became viable-not as viable as I would like it to be, but much more so than it was. We need to maintain those improvements; they must be continued, not thrown away in careless timetable planning. That is a key point to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/7">The background to rail use in my constituency, first and foremost, is that we have the A1, which is a very dangerous road, only parts of which are dualled. During my time in Parliament I have helped to achieve some additional dualling, but we are not there yet, and much more improvement is needed. People who live locally recognise the road to be very dangerous, and that is one of the many reasons, apart from the environmental ones, why it is better to travel by rail if possible. I have raised that subject in Adjournment debates on other occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/8">Berwick station is a railhead not only for north Northumberland but for the whole borders area. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" name="Michael Moore">the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore)</phrase> is keenly interested in what happens at Berwick, and he and I are going to see the Minister shortly to talk about that in more detail. The station serves a very large area of southern Scotland in which there are no railway stations at all. That is easily noticed on the station platform when we see so many people coming from Scotland. Whole school parties from Scottish schools catch trains from Berwick, as well as all the people from Berwick itself and from Northumberland. Because Berwick is 55 miles from Edinburgh and 65 miles from Newcastle, rail travel is very important. Things such as major hospitals, many people's work, shopping and major entertainment facilities are all a long way away, and therefore a train journey is the logical, and only really comfortable, way for many people to make such journeys. That makes the Berwick area quite different from many other parts of the country. A lot of people have settled there on the basis that they can work from home but travel occasionally to meetings in London or in other centres. That is an important developing pattern in our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/9">Alnmouth station serves much of mid-Northumberland and has close links with RAF Boulmer, whose service families are big users of the rail service there. It has nearby Alnwick garden, which is attracting vast numbers of tourists. Its management has just been taken over by somebody whose past experience has been in Disneyland, and he expects to increase tourism in the Alnwick area on a very large scale. Alnmouth has a lot of regular commuters and a very active rail users' group, which has contributed enormously to the pressure to maintain and improve services there.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/10">Morpeth station, which serves the southern part of my constituency, has local services, many of which terminate there. However, it is also extremely advantageous for people who are travelling direct to London or on longer journeys to use Morpeth, because that saves them driving into Newcastle. That is an environmental benefit, as well as a benefit in terms of coping with the traffic congestion on the north side of the city. However, there are only a few direct trains from London to Morpeth in the current timetable, and they are popular and well used.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/11">Against that background, let me take a look at what is going on with rail timetables. The first thing that hit us was the Network Rail draft timetable for 2011. It is called, curiously, the &quot;Eureka&quot; timetable, which is more or less what I exclaimed when, after a very long period, I at last found it on the computer. It was extremely difficult to locate; how the public are supposed to take part in the consultation that has been launched, I do not know. At the moment there is no weekend timetable. I looked again yesterday, and we still have only a Monday to Friday timetable accessible on the internet. The draft timetable apparently contains mistakes. I understand from operators that certain trains that they expected to be in it were not included, so we hope that they will be reinstated.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/12">This ongoing process is very difficult to engage with. The only people who are doing so successfully are a very limited number who have a lot of specialised knowledge because of their past employment in the railway industry or because they take a close interest in railway matters. A few of those people have done sterling work in identifying changes that people might otherwise not have discovered until the day they went to get a train and found that it was no longer in the timetable.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/13">At the same time as that consultation, the Secretary of State has launched the franchise consultation for a new operator to take over the east coast main line. That consultation does not contain a timetable, but it does contain commitments and proposals for the pattern of the service, both short and long term. It is quite difficult to understand how the one relates to the other. I have said to the Secretary of State that I hope he will take all the representations on Network Rail's draft timetable as indicating what people want to see in the franchise as well. Because the franchise contains some new ideas, people will want also to make comments on those. The process is complex.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/14">What is wrong with the draft timetable? Let me start with Berwick. The first train to London from Berwick on the draft timetable, instead of getting in at 10.10 am, as under the present timetable, will not get to London until 10.40 am, half an hour later. That is a serious deterioration in one of the most important services that is provided. Given the pattern that I described earlier of people who work from home going to meetings in London, and given that a lot of people who are on national bodies of various kinds in our industries such as farming travel to London for meetings, that deterioration in service will lead to people taking the alternative of driving to Edinburgh or Newcastle airport and getting a plane from there. The later arrival in London is a serious failure. There is an easy to answer to that, which is that the 5.20 am train from Edinburgh in the new timetable should stop at Berwick, and the 6 o'clock train could stop at Alnmouth and Morpeth, to which I shall come in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.2/15">Another gap in the timetable is that there are no southbound trains between 8.10 and 10 o'clock in the morning, which is a huge loss. The CrossCountry train to Penzance, which stops at Berwick at 8.52 am, will not stop there under the new timetable. That is a valuable train to long-distance customers travelling to places such as Birmingham and other stations along the way, and it is much used by students and shoppers travelling to Newcastle. I have a feeling that CrossCountry did not intend to drop that train from the timetable.</p>

	<p pid="a.507.0/1">I hope to be able to reassure the right hon. Gentleman on the question of Penzance trains not stopping at Berwick. That was one of the omissions in Network Rail's early timetable work that have since been remedied, and Berwick will have a two-hourly CrossCountry service to the midlands and the south-west.</p>

	<p pid="a.507.1/1">That is very helpful, and I am pleased to hear it. It is just that kind of thing that I hope to get out of today's debate, to clarify where it is already recognised that the service needs to be maintained and where work must continue to ensure that it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.1/2">The next gap that I wish to mention is also a southbound service, and it is the main commuter train from Edinburgh. The most obvious time that people leave work is about 5.30 pm, and there is a 5.31 pm train. I use it myself sometimes and it is very well used, but under the new timetable it will not stop at Berwick, which will be a serious gap for regular commuters.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.1/3">The East Coast service running through to Glasgow from Berwick is to be almost entirely withdrawn. In its place, a new CrossCountry service to Glasgow will be provided. Far more of the CrossCountry trains go there, but those new trains will not stop at Berwick under the draft timetable. A lot of people travel between Berwick and Glasgow, as many organisations that have branches in Berwick are headquartered in Glasgow, so a lot of people make trips to Glasgow as part of their work, and the removal of that service is a loss.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.1/4">As I mentioned at the start of the debate, the last departure from King's Cross to Berwick is at 6 pm. The new timetable actually suggests that the 7 o'clock will run through beyond Newcastle every day, instead of just on Fridays as it does at the moment. I am so suspicious about the timetable exercise that I cannot believe that is for real-I suspect that &quot;Fridays only&quot; has been missed off the timetable rubric. I would love to be wrong, because I have argued for several years that the earlier removal of that daily 7 pm service to Edinburgh was a serious loss, and a potential loss of business because it was another reason for people to use the plane rather than the train.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.1/5">On the draft timetable, Alnmouth gains four trains, but loses 13-a net loss of nine. The service at that station is not hourly, but broadly two-hourly. From London, there is now no train between 11.30 and 3.30, and the 3.30 is the last train, except on Fridays, instead of 5.30.</p>

	<p pid="a.508.0/1">I assure the right hon. Gentleman that that, too, is an omission from Network Rail's early work and it has subsequently been remedied. Subject to consultation, the 7.13 train from London will call at Alnmouth and on Fridays, there will be an extra service at 19.30.</p>

	<p pid="a.508.1/1">I wish all my debates were as productive as this one has been so far. I want to consider that reassurance more carefully afterwards, but, again, it sounds hopeful.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/2">Travelling to London, there is an enormous gap in the first draft of the Alnmouth service between 9 am and 3 pm. There are no direct trains from London to Morpeth at all in the draft timetable, whereas two evening trains currently stop there. I hope that that is covered by the reassurance that the Minister has just given. For the reasons I gave earlier, the direct service from Morpeth, although more limited, is extremely valuable and should be retained.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/3">One of the timetable's oddities is that it is almost impossible to travel between the stations in Northumberland. That is partly a consequence of something that I consider helpful-the sharing of trains along the line. Some trains stop at Alnmouth and not Berwick, whereas others stop at Berwick and not Alnmouth. I recognise that some of that has to happen, but the timetable planners should pay some attention to improving the possibilities for people to travel between, for example, Berwick and Morpeth, or Alnmouth and Dunbar. That is currently not a feature of planning. Indeed, one of our problems is that all the timetable planning is dedicated to services between major centres, such as London, York, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow, and the stations in between seem to be an afterthought, which is not governed by an examination of what sort of service each station needs and how it can be provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/4">I should like another gap in the service to be filled in future. According to the new timetable, the last train from Edinburgh leaves at 8.30 pm. That is too early; there is almost nothing one can do in Edinburgh in an evening that will be over by 8.30 pm. I understand that CrossCountry is to run a late train from Edinburgh to Dunbar at around or after 11 pm. Perhaps that service could be extended to Newcastle or at least Berwick, instead of terminating at Dunbar. It is rather complicated to terminate a train there because of the track layout. Some years ago, a service ran through to Newcastle in the summer months. GNER ran it late at night and it was very popular among Edinburgh festival-goers and others visiting Edinburgh in the evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/5">The franchise document refers to increased frequency of services between Newcastle and Edinburgh, with no mention of Berwick, Alnmouth or Morpeth. Anyone from the latter places reading the franchise document immediately thinks, &quot;There's nothing in this for us.&quot; There is no attempt to specify that there should be an adequate sharing of those trains among some of the stations in Northumberland.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/6">There is scope for a stopping service from Newcastle to Edinburgh. The Scottish Government have been interested in that for some time. They have been considering options such as opening one or two new stations on the Scottish side of the border at, for example, Reston, and having a service that would come through from Scotland and stop at Morpeth, Alnmouth, Berwick and Dunbar, and perhaps some of the intermediate stations such as Acklington or Chathill. I hope that the door is not closed to that possibility, although whether it can be profitable or would require subsidy is not clear. If there is a possibility of a decision in Scotland to offer some element of subsidy to a service, which seems necessary on the Scottish side, I would like to grab hold of the possibility for the English side, too. As I said, as far as train travel is concerned, people do not stop at the border-people who live in Scotland use Berwick station extensively and travel across the border is a great feature of life in our area.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/7">My primary aim in this debate is to get the Minister to make it his business to ensure that services to Berwick, Alnmouth and Morpeth are not reduced, and that they get a net improvement, in both the 2011 timetable and the franchise negotiations and specifications. The Secretary of State has taken a genuine personal interest in the future of the east coast main line, and I want him and the Minister to ensure that that includes the stations in Northumberland.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/8">I should like to talk about two wider issues that are part of the franchise document. First, on ticket prices, even regulated fares and many cheaper fares are uncompetitive with car and plane for many customers. I quite often get letters from customers saying, &quot;I looked into the possibility of making my business trip by train, but then I found I could drive 50, 60 or 70 miles to an airport, catch a plane and pay significantly less than I would be paying even for a reduced-price first-class fare on the train.&quot; Many such offers are made, but the price has crept up in recent years. Unless we ensure that ticket prices are more competitive than air travel, we will continue to encourage people to make long car journeys, which they must do in my part of the world to get to an airport, which is inconsistent with general Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/9">Secondly, there have been significant station improvements over recent years, including to Berwick station-I had the odd experience of opening the lifts for the footbridge over the station a few years ago. Celebrating the opening of a lift with a glass of champagne is a variant on the many duties of a Member of Parliament, but the facility was much needed by disabled people and people with heavy luggage. The absence of lifts at Alnmouth has been a serious problem. People with disabilities have been told that if they arrive from London in the evening, when there are no staff at the station, they will not be able to leave the platform-they cannot use the bridge and there is nobody to supervise crossing the track. That serious problem is being dealt with, but it is long overdue.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/10">Such improvements are very important, as is parking, at both Alnmouth and Berwick. The county council is pushing ahead with plans for increased parking at the former, but the plans for Berwick have proved difficult. My original hope was that Network Rail would give up its land, because it could be stationed somewhere else-it does not have to be based right by those stations. That would open up more parking spaces.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/11">There is a possibility of getting more parking spaces, the need for which is obvious from the amount of parking in roads round about. I happen to live in one such road. I do not mind people from Scotland parking their cars outside my house to go to the station-I am glad they are using the train-but that has created some problems, and traffic management changes have had to be made to accommodate them. Continued station improvements are very important to the franchise and the future of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/12">The oddity with Belford station is that the only local service that goes into north Northumberland beyond Morpeth goes twice a day to Acklington, Woodrington, and Chathill, and then turns round at Belford, but there is no platform there-there used to be years ago, but not now. Therefore, a train goes to Belford twice a day, but people cannot get on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/13">A great deal of effort by local people, with genuine co-operation from rail operators such as Northern Rail and from Network Rail and the county council, is enabling things to be moved forward, and I hope the Department for Transport will also co-operate. The executive of the county council is currently recommending that the council spend money on installing the platform. We have had many battles over how long a platform must be and the greatness of the risk of someone getting out of the wrong door and such things. At times those have seemed absurd, and they have perhaps led to higher costs than necessary. However, I believe we are in sight of achieving that objective, and I hope the Minister continues to offer his encouragement.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.1/14">There is a lot of scope for transfer to rail travel in Northumberland and a great need for rail travel because of the distances involved. Not many people have to travel 50 or 60 miles to get to a main hospital, to go to a theatre that is not a small local arts centre or to visit all the main chain shops, but that is the situation in north Northumberland. Rail travel is very important, so it is also important that we retain a good service. The timetable drafts left people very worried about losing the gains that we had made in recent years, when we should instead be improving the service, and I hope that the Minister's initial indications that some of those worries are being addressed will be backed up by more restoration of trains to the timetable and some additional stops.</p>

	<p pid="a.510.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> on securing this debate and providing an opportunity for the House to discuss rail services on the east coast main line in Northumberland. I know that this is a subject of interest to many hon. Members, and I will discuss points of detail further with the right hon. Gentleman if I do not successfully address them in my response this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/2">The east coast main line is an exceptionally valuable asset in the national transport system. It provides the fastest surface transport between London and the Yorkshire and Humber region, north-east England and Edinburgh. It also provides key links between Scotland, the north-east and routes to the midlands and north-west. It is also of vital importance for freight, particularly as part of the link from major ports to distribution centres in large conurbations, and to coal-fired power stations. Further, it supports the long-distance passenger services provided by the public sector train operator, East Coast Main Line Company Ltd, which pays a substantial premium to Government, thereby reducing the level of taxpayer support needed for the railway as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/3">The challenges faced by the railway industry on the east coast route are principally associated with the volume of traffic, and the reliability of the services. Growth over the next 10 years, despite the present financial difficulties, is expected to be substantial in almost all the markets served by the route. Passenger demand for rail has been growing strongly over recent years. That is due to a combination of several factors, particularly economic growth and increasing road traffic congestion. On many routes, including the east coast, the growth has been stimulated by additional services and ticketing initiatives that have been developed by the train operators to encourage off-peak travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/4">The most significant use of long-distance passenger trains is for business and leisure travel to and from London. The high number of passengers travelling between London and cities such as Leeds, Newcastle and Edinburgh is due to the size and significance of those major conurbations, and transport links among them are of national economic importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/5">In Northumberland, stations at Berwick-upon-Tweed, Alnmouth and Morpeth are used by long-distance passenger services. As well as serving their immediate towns and surrounding areas, those stations act as railheads for large parts of Northumberland and the Scottish borders that do not have the benefit of rail connections. In addition, stations at Chathill, Acklington, Widdrington, Pegswood, and Cramlington are used by local services, providing important journey opportunities to Newcastle.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/6">Long-distance passenger services at Berwick-upon-Tweed, Alnmouth and Morpeth are provided by East Coast and CrossCountry train operators. East Coast provides direct trains from those stations to London King's Cross and to principal intermediate stations on the east coast main line. CrossCountry provides direct trains to east coast main line stations as far south as York, then stations towards the midlands and south-west including Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Bristol, Plymouth and Penzance. East Coast and CrossCountry also provide direct trains from Morpeth, Alnmouth and Berwick-upon-Tweed to Dunbar and Edinburgh, some of which are extended to serve other stations in Scotland, including Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen and Inverness.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/7">The current east coast main line timetable does not have a regular repeating pattern and, consequently, train times at stations in Northumberland are at irregular intervals. Broadly speaking, Berwick-upon-Tweed has an East Coast London train most hours and a CrossCountry train approximately every two hours. Alnmouth has six London trains per day and a CrossCountry train approximately every two hours, and Morpeth has three East Coast and three CrossCountry trains per day. Those levels of service reflect relative numbers of passengers travelling from each of those stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/8">In 2008 Network Rail published its route utilisation strategy-colloquially referred to as RUS-for the east coast main line. The RUS, which was compiled with the assistance of industry parties and other key stakeholders, considered the current and future passenger and freight markets, and assessed the future growth in each. It then sought to show how growth could be accommodated effectively and efficiently, and proposed measures ranging from the lengthening of trains to the provision of additional infrastructure. It recommended that additional long-distance high-speed passenger services should run to and from King's Cross both in peak times, with up to eight trains an hour, and in off-peak times, with six trains per hour. That strategy is expected to cater adequately for forecast growth in passenger demand at least until the end of the RUS study period in 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/9">In the longer term, increasing train capacity through the use of new high-capacity, super-express trains and increasing network capacity by rolling out 21st-century signalling technology, in the form of the European rail traffic management system, might create the potential to double capacity. However, it will be several years before those enhancements can be delivered, so the Government believe it necessary to develop and implement an improved timetable in the shorter term, essentially using the current infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/10">We recognise that any increase in service frequency in advance of infrastructure enhancements is likely to be limited to off-peak periods, when the performance impact of such an increase can be largely offset by improvements to the structures of the timetable, including through adopting a regular repeating service pattern. Additional services to accommodate growth are likely to be necessary first at the southern end of the east coast main line, where traffic volumes are greatest. North of Newcastle, trains are generally less crowded and additional services less likely to be justified in the short term.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/11">The Government have adopted a three-stage approach to the development of east coast main line train services. First, the timetable will be changed to provide some additional trains south of York and to adopt a more regular pattern of services, with improved average journey times. The new timetable will be introduced by East Coast in May 2011. Secondly, through their high-level output specification for the rail industry, the Government have specified a package of infrastructure enhancements to increase the effective capacity of the route. Those enhancements have been included in Network Rail's funding from 2009-2014, and will enable additional peak and off-peak passenger services to run after 2014, while preserving capacity to accommodate important freight flows. Thirdly, the Government are leading the procurement of a new generation of super-express trains for introduction to the east coast main line from about 2014. Those trains will have greater carrying capacity and better performance than current trains, allowing services to be speeded up and additional services to run.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/12">Although the most critical capacity issues are likely to be south of York, the stations in Northumberland will benefit from each stage of the Government's strategy to improve east coast main line services. The new May 2011 timetable will adopt a more regular pattern of station calls in Northumberland, and average journey times will be reduced. Berwick-upon-Tweed will be served each hour by a fast train between Edinburgh and London, calling at Newcastle, Darlington and York. The journey time between Berwick-upon-Tweed and London King's Cross will be about three hours and 38 minutes northbound, which is six minutes faster than today, and three hours and 40 minutes southbound, which is 23 minutes faster than today. That is because the southbound trains from Berwick-upon-Tweed in today's timetable call at many intermediate stations, whereas in future they will be fast trains normally calling only at Newcastle, Darlington and York. Other stations will be accessible by convenient connections, at either York or Newcastle.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/13">Berwick-upon-Tweed will continue to be served by a CrossCountry train on alternate hours, giving through-journey opportunities to Leeds, Sheffield, the midlands and the south-west. Alnmouth will gain a significantly improved service, with a train each hour provided alternately by East Coast or CrossCountry, and running alternately to London or to the midlands and south-west. The total number of long-distance trains per day will increase by 30 per cent., from 27 to 35. At Morpeth the service will increase from six to seven long-distance trains per day in each direction, providing a greater choice of journey times while retaining the current commuting and business travel opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/14">I know that the right hon. Gentleman is concerned about the timing of the first train of the day between Berwick-upon-Tweed and London. At present the first train from Edinburgh to London calls at Berwick-upon-Tweed at 06.29 and arrives at London King's Cross at 10.11. The Government believe that there are significant benefits to be gained from providing a very fast business service between Edinburgh and London, to encourage the use of rail rather than domestic air travel. My noble Friend the Secretary of State for Transport has therefore challenged the industry to provide a morning train with a journey time from Edinburgh to London of less than four hours and an arrival time before 10 o'clock. To achieve that demanding target, the first train from Edinburgh will be given special priority in the timetable, and will call only at Newcastle. Consequently, the earliest service from Berwick-upon-Tweed will be provided by the following train, which is planned to arrive in London at 10.41.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.0/15">I recognise that that change is undesirable from the point of view of travellers from Berwick-upon-Tweed, and options to provide an earlier arrival time are being examined. However, it is an unfortunate fact of railway timetabling that the large overall benefits arising from a major timetable change are sometimes deliverable only by making compromises for some of the smaller traffic flows.</p>

	<p pid="a.513.0/1">I hope that the alternative options for an earlier arrival in London will be pursued vigorously, because many of the people who now get that train will otherwise transfer to air travel. That would be inconsistent with what the Secretary of State is trying to achieve by establishing the early departure from Edinburgh. Air travel would be more attractive, and provide a shorter journey, for the people travelling from Berwick.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-02-04a.514.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1653" speakername="Chris Mole" colnum="514"  time="014:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100204/debtext/100204-0013.htm#10020466000972">
	<p pid="a.514.0/1">I take the right hon. Gentleman's point, but I ask him to accept that in this instance a later arrival time might be unavoidable. However, we will explore all possibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman has expressed concern about the widely misreported plan to withdraw through services between the east coast main line and Glasgow. I would like to set the record straight on this matter. At present, East Coast services between London and Edinburgh are extended to and from Glasgow Central at two-hourly intervals throughout the day. In the May 2011 timetable it is proposed that most of those trains should run only between London and Edinburgh. Instead, CrossCountry services between Edinburgh, Yorkshire, the midlands and south-west England would be extended to start and finish at Glasgow Central at two-hourly intervals. There would be no withdrawal of services-simply a change of train operator-and there would continue to be opportunities to make through journeys between stations in Northumberland and Glasgow.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.0/3">The East Coast train operator has recently commenced consultation with passengers and other stakeholders on the details of the May 2011 timetable proposal, and I am sure that many Members of the House will wish to contribute their views. I take the right hon. Gentleman's point that some of the consultation documents were not easy to find. The rail regulator's documents were perhaps more technical in nature, and therefore not intended for widespread access. However, the Department for Transport's franchise consultation is available on our website and as a hard copy, and the Department will be holding stakeholder events on the proposed franchise arrangements, including one in Newcastle. With regard to the information provided by the East Coast train operator on its ambitions for the timetable, I will draw the right hon. Gentleman's comments to the attention of the company.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-02-04a.514.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" speakername="Alan Beith" colnum="514"  time="014:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100204/debtext/100204-0013.htm#10020466000973">
	<p pid="a.514.1/1">The Minister has said some very encouraging things this afternoon, but they are so far from the draft timetable originally produced that I hope that he can secure some means by which a realistic timetable, incorporating some of what he has described, can be made available so that it can be examined by the public. If he has a good story to tell, it would be better to tell it, rather than the weak story that the present draft timetable represents.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-02-04a.514.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1653" speakername="Chris Mole" colnum="514"  time="014:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100204/debtext/100204-0013.htm#10020466000974">
	<p pid="a.514.2/1">I honestly take the right hon. Gentleman's point, but I fear that for some individuals looking at the information, a little knowledge was a dangerous thing, as they were reading more into it than was perhaps justified. Because of the extent of the proposed timetable changes, the Office of Rail Regulation will need to approve amendments to the track access agreements that enable the train operators to gain access to the railway network. This will require the ORR to be satisfied that the trains and train operators granted access to run on the route are those that will make the best use of it and make the greatest contribution to the economic health of the regions it serves, as well as to the financial health of the railway system. I understand that the ORR will publish its decisions within the next few days.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/2">I should explain that, in addition to the proposed changes to East Coast and other franchised passenger services in May 2011, the ORR received a number of other applications for additional access rights on the east coast main line from open access passenger and freight train operators. The total demand for train paths exceeded the available network capacity, so it has been necessary for the ORR to determine which applications for track access it will approve and which should be rejected.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/3">In reaching its decisions on the best use of capacity, the ORR has a statutory duty to balance a large range of factors, including promoting use of the network for the carriage of passengers and goods, protecting performance levels, encouraging competition and having regard to the available funding for the railway system. There are some difficult trade-offs here. For example, while new open access passenger services generally increase the overall number of passengers travelling, and compete with established operators, they often require non-standard train paths, which could be a performance risk, and much of their revenue is abstracted from franchised operators, thereby increasing the cost of the railways to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/4">In addition to providing its own economic and financial analysis, the ORR asked Network Rail to report on the extent to which the competing applications for capacity might be accommodated. In accordance with its usual policy of transparency, the ORR published on its website Network Rail's reports on associated timetabling work, which is what we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/5">Unfortunately, this preliminary timetabling work, which was carried out purely to inform the ORR's decision-making process, has been misinterpreted by some as a final timetable. That is particularly unfortunate in the case of East Coast and CrossCountry services at Berwick-upon-Tweed, Alnmouth and Morpeth, which had not been fully specified when Network Rail's preliminary timetabling was carried out, as they were not directly relevant to the key capacity allocation decisions for the route south of York. Specification of these services is now complete and, subject to the ORR's final decisions and any adjustments arising from consultation, the May 2011 timetable in Northumberland will be as I described it a few moments ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/6">Although the May 2011 timetable will be implemented by the public sector train operator, East Coast, it is the Government's policy that passenger train services should be provided by the private sector through franchising agreements with the Department for Transport. Thus, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-21">21 January</phrase> my noble Friend the Secretary of State for Transport announced the start of consultation on the specification for a new inter-city East Coast franchise to commence in autumn 2011. The consultation document is available on the Department's website; I encourage hon. Members to read it and to let us have their views on the proposed specification.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/7">The right hon. Gentleman asked specifically about Friday services. I can assure him that the 19.00 service from London will run every day and that the 19.30 from London to Newcastle will be extended to Edinburgh on Fridays only, calling at Morpeth, Alnmouth and Berwick-upon-Tweed.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/8">At its inception, the new franchise will operate the May 2011 timetable and will continue to provide the services at Berwick-upon-Tweed, Alnmouth and Morpeth, as I described earlier. We intend to invite bidders to make proposals to utilise the additional infrastructure capacity, to be provided by Network Rail by 2014, and, subject to the usual value for money and affordability assessments, we would hope to be able to procure further train service improvements in that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/9">Bidders for the new franchise will be expected to demonstrate how they will achieve improvements in service levels and facilities at stations where the franchisee is the station facility owner, and that includes Berwick-upon-Tweed. They will be required to address safety and security, accessibility and improvements to car parking and cycle storage, along with other concerns that the right hon. Gentleman raised. The Department will expect bidders' plans to be informed by the recent review entitled &quot;Better Railway Stations&quot; carried out by station champions Chris Green and Sir Peter Hall, whom the right hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/10">Reopening of the former station at Belford was mentioned. I know that this has been a local aspiration for some time. Although potential passenger numbers are probably quite modest, a limited service could be provided with minimal additional operating costs, because local trains between Newcastle and Chathill must run north to Belford before changing tracks to return south. I understand that Northumberland county council is considering as early as next week the case for reinstating a platform at Belford, and the Government would welcome that initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/11">The right hon. Gentleman spoke briefly about ticket prices. Let me remind him of the need to strike a balance between the interests of the fare payer and those of the taxpayer. I am sure he will appreciate that the east coast train operator will want to promote increased use of its services while protecting its revenue.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/12">The new inter-city east coast franchisee will also be able to undertake the introduction of the new super-express trains, which are expected to be available from 2014 onwards. The Department is leading the procurement of those trains, which will be designed, financed, built and maintained through a private finance initiative. We expect the new trains to give the franchisee an opportunity to make further improvements to the east coast main line timetable, including further journey time reductions and frequency increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/13">I cannot make any precise commitments about the details of the super-express timetable at this stage. An initial outline will be prepared over the next few months as part of the specification for the new franchise, and more detailed development will be undertaken at the appropriate time by the new franchisee in conjunction with Network Rail and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/14">I thank the House for the opportunity to explain the Government's plans for improved train services on the east coast main line, with particular reference to services at the stations in Northumberland. They illustrate the Government's ongoing commitment to improving Britain's railways.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/15" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.2/16" class="italic"> House adjourned.</p>
