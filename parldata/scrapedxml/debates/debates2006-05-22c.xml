	<p pid="c.1183.6/1">I am sure that the whole House will join me in sending condolences to the families of Private Joseva Lewaicei and Private Adam Morris, who were killed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-13">Saturday 13 May</phrase> north of Basra city. Our thoughts are also with the soldier injured in that incident, with the two soldiers who were injured in the incident at the weekend in Basra, and with their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.1183.6/2">Although insurgents continue to pursue a policy of violence and intimidation with the aim of disrupting the political process in Iraq, the majority of attacks are confined to four of the 18 provinces. However, their efforts have not precluded the formation of a new Government of national unity in Iraq. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said this morning, that is a huge step forward which deserves international support. In Basra, and across Multi-National Division (South-East), despite recent tragic events the security situation remains relatively calm.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-22c.1268.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" colnum="1268"  time="019:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060522/debtext/60522-0014.htm#06052329002661">
	<p pid="c.1268.1/1">I recognise the concerns raised by Conservative Members. When the hon. Member for Aldershot raised the matter in Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-20">20 March</phrase>, I sought to assuage his concerns by discussing the relationship between the director of service prosecutions and the commanding officer:</p>
	<p pid="c.1268.1/2" class="indent">&quot;We acknowledge that in such cases a commanding officer may have valuable information that could assist the director in the tests that he must apply before proceeding to charge individuals. A commanding officer will have to be made aware of such a case, because it will affect one of his people and the operating efficiency of his unit.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March 2006</phrase>; c. 78.]</p>
	<p pid="c.1268.1/3">I went on to discuss the written guidance, which was pooh-poohed a moment ago. My point in Select Committee was that under the proposed guidance the service police would be obliged to act in a certain regard. I sought to assuage the concerns of Conservative Members by pointing out that there would be a positive and important link between the role of the commanding officer and the service police in any investigation. We cannot wipe out the role of the commanding officer in that respect.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-22c.1302.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" speakername="Keith Vaz" colnum="1302"  time="021:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060522/debtext/60522-0019.htm#06052329003173">
	<p pid="c.1302.2/1">I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to discuss detention without trial at Guantanamo Bay. I am pleased to see the Minister for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" name="Kim Howells">the Middle East, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)</phrase>, on the Front Bench tonight, and I am glad that so many other Members of the House have taken such a strong interest in this subject. I am particularly pleased to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">here, and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> hopes to join us later.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/2">This is the fourth such debate to be held in the four years since the detention facility was established in early 2002, and the first since the release of the remaining British citizens a year ago. It takes place at an appropriate time&mdash;on the back of recent comments made by my right hon. and learned Friend Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General, and of the publication last Friday, just in time for this debate, of the United Nations convention against torture's critical report on Guantanamo.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/3">Also on Friday, I was sorry to hear of reports by the BBC and other news agencies that four detainees attempted to commit suicide, and that the efforts of prison guards to stop those attempts were met by violent resistance from other inmates. Sadly, it now appears that prolonged exposure to the conditions within the facility have caused the inmates to look to suicide as the only alternative. With that in mind, the recent speech of the Attorney-General deserves even greater consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-10">10 May</phrase>, the Attorney-General used a speech to the Royal United Services Institute to make clear his opposition to the continued detention without fair trial of those imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. Lord Goldsmith stated that the camp should be closed</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/5" class="indent">&quot;as a matter of principle&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/6">Although he made it clear that on this issue he was speaking in a personal capacity, as he is one of this country's foremost and most respected legal experts&mdash;and, indeed, the Government's chief legal adviser&mdash;his speech's significance cannot be underestimated. We all know of his intellectual prowess and determination. When he spoke, he meant what he said.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/7">The Attorney-General's opinion is the most recent development concerning this subject. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-17">17 February</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and for Wales, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" name="Peter Hain">my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain)</phrase>, said that he would like to see the camp at Guantanamo Bay closed. Our Prime Minister, who has fostered an excellent relationship with the United States, has gone so far as to call the detention centre an &quot;anomaly&quot;&mdash;a view that he repeated at Question Time last week. Those three statements clearly reveal that the Government have not yet developed a coherent position on how the current situation should be resolved. Now is an excellent time for them to make such a statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/8">Only two weeks ago, President Bush, during a visit to the United States by Chancellor Angela Merkel, stated his desire to end detention at Guantanamo and to get the detainees into court. As everyone appears concerned, why is Guantanamo still open? The opinion of such figures clearly shows that the arguments about what has become known as Camp X-Ray are progressing in the same direction. Guantanamo cannot continue. Detention without trial at Guantanamo is not a necessary part of the global fight against extremism and fundamentalism&mdash;also known as the war against terrorism. Rather, it is counter-productive to the efforts of the international community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/9">The tragic events of <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> clearly demonstrated how vulnerable open and democratic societies are to the threat of organised terrorist networks. The subsequent military campaign in Afghanistan&mdash;fully supported by this Government, NATO and the United Nations&mdash;resulted in individuals suspected of belonging to the al-Qaeda network being captured by the American military forces. More than 600 of these alleged terrorists have been received in the detention facility since 2002. Although some 270 have since been released without charge, almost 500 still remain. These include 220 from Afghanistan, 119 from Saudi Arabia, 94 from Yemen, 57 from Pakistan and smaller numbers of men from 35 different countries. Although all eight British citizens have been released, there remain another eight men who claim to have long-term British residency permits.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/10">I consider the United States to be a great friend and ally of this country, not merely through historical ties or present circumstances, but because of the very real values and interests that our countries share. As the Attorney-General remarked, the US is a great beacon of freedom, liberty and justice. That is the basis on which the strongest arguments can be made against the detention camp in its present form. Every day that those men are made to wait to face justice is a day that degrades the reputation of the US.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/11">That reputation for fairness and equal treatment, whatever one's race, religion or ethnicity, is one of the greatest tools we have in the battle for the hearts and minds of millions across the world and in the face of propaganda by such organisations as al-Qaeda. In that context, the existence of Guantanamo Bay damages the efforts of the American and British Governments to isolate the terrorists and prevent them from recruiting further converts to their cause. It helps extremists to fuel perceptions that the US, and the west in general, targets Muslims and denies them their human rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/12">The agenda of such extremist groups is obvious and can be discounted. What cannot be ignored is the list of independent and respected Governments and non-governmental organisations that have made clear their opposition to the camp's existence. The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has called for the camp's closure. Organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have been consistent in their condemnation. Amnesty is concerned at news of hunger strikes and suicide attempts by inmates and has called Guantanamo &quot;a moral disgrace&quot;, an &quot;emotional abyss&quot; for those affected and &quot;a legal black hole&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/13">As I said earlier, it can be seen from the number of hon. Members in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" name="Diana Johnson">their places, including my hon. Friends the Members for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson)</phrase>, for Tooting, for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry), for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington and for Brent, South (Ms Butler), that this issue is of real concern. The legal arguments surrounding Guantanamo have become complex and polarised, with no consensus existing. None the less, it is a popular view, at least outside the US, that the basis for the detention camp rests on shaky legal foundations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/14">The right to fair trial without prolonged detention is a fundamental and well-established tenet of international law, which is explicit in articles 10 and 11 of the universal declaration of human rights and articles 14, 15 and 16 of the international covenant on civil and political rights. If it is argued that the laws of war apply, the Geneva convention has strict criteria governing the treatment that prisoners of war should receive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/15">The US Government argue that those prisoners are not in legal limbo but, pending a decision by the US Supreme Court, are nearing the time at which they will face trial before the military commission. Within the judicial process, it is claimed, the accused will have two opportunities to appeal to a fully civilian federal appeals court. However, that is not a reason to believe that the transportation of hundreds of individuals thousands of miles from their homelands and families and their imprisonment for years before trial is in any way justifiable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/16">Unfortunately, whatever the legal basis for the detention, the damage has been done. It is now a popular view in this country and other countries that the US Government have operated outside international law, with a clear disregard for the concerns of the international community and its closest friends.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/17">In a series of statements from the State Department and the Department of Defence, the US has condemned the use of torture or inhumane techniques and pledged to prosecute any citizen found to have committed such acts. However, last week the United Nations committee against torture published its report on the detention policies of the US and judged them according to the convention against torture that the US ratified in 1994. The report concluded that the conditions for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay constituted torture and called for the camp to be closed as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/18">Allegations of torture must be taken seriously. The right not to face torture or inhumane or degrading treatment is an absolute right. After the appalling images of torture at committed by soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, it is essential that the United States and our Government make every possible effort to make it clear that any such abuse is unacceptable and should not take place. Unfortunately, in the case of Guantanamo, the closed nature of the camp, where even UN officials were prevented from meeting detainees without first signing a confidentiality agreement, has ensured that serious allegations about treatment proliferate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/19">What we know comes from the American Army's Schmidt report, which details techniques also known as &quot;torture lite&quot;. Many of sections of the Schmidt report are still censored, but it details techniques such as 18 to 20 hours a day of questioning for 48 in 54 days, blasting prisoners with strobe lights and ear-splitting rock music, the use of snarling dogs, threatening to hurt detainees' families and sexual humiliation. On that basis, I propose that a delegation of British parliamentarians be allowed to visit the detention complex in Guantanamo to assess the treatment of detainees. I should be grateful for the Minister's support for such a visit. If that is not possible, he should consider arranging a visit by our excellent Attorney-General so that he can assess the conditions of the detainees, as he has made his interest in the matter clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/20">Sir Winston Churchill noted that America always does the right thing after exhausting every possible alternative. In the case of Guantanamo, our ally is running out of alternatives and I am sure that, in the fullness of time, Washington will indeed do the right thing. I call on the Minister and his Department to help to ensure that that happens sooner rather than later. In particular, will the Minister clarify his position about the continued imprisonment of eight individuals who claim to hold British residency?</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/21">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-05">Thursday 5 May</phrase>, representatives of two of those men lost a bid at the High Court to force the Foreign Secretary to intervene on their behalf. A Foreign Office spokesman said that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was unable to provide consular assistance to</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/22" class="indent">&quot;those who are not British citizens&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/23">which is a very strict interpretation of the Foreign Office remit. British diplomatic influence is not solely limited to the protection of British citizens; it also applies to British interests, which include upholding the principle of inalienable human rights. For example, Abdul Rahman is an Afghanistani who, on conversion to Christianity, was threatened with the death penalty. At the time, the Minister was on the record as deeply troubled by the case and he sought urgent clarification from the Afghan authorities. I commend him for having done so. Mr. Rahman was not British; indeed, he was on the other side of the world at the time. Surely, that is a common precedent whereby the Government can represent our concerns about the men with British residency held at Guantanamo. Will the Minister make such representations?</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/24">The Prime Minister will be meeting President Bush later this week. I hope that he will use that visit to state the Government's concerns about the situation in Guantanamo Bay. Will the Minister confirm that that will happen?</p>
	<p pid="c.1302.2/25">I also ask the Minister whether he would consider positioning the UK in the role of co-ordinator for those countries that still have detainees imprisoned at Guantanamo. The UK's relationship with the United States and its experience of having a number of citizens detained at that facility for years would allow the Foreign Office to operate in that much-needed capacity. However, such measures would be only half a solution. The problem with Guantanamo Bay is the existence of the detention facility, the way that it operates and the image that it presents to the world. It runs counter to the fundamental values that we hold dear and wish to protect: the right to fair trail, the right not to be tortured or treated inhumanely and the belief in the strength of openness, transparency and accountability. I call on the Minister to support the view of the Attorney-General&mdash;Guantanamo Bay must close, and it must close now.</p>

	<p pid="c.1306.2/1">No, I am afraid not. If my hon. Friend will allow me, I have not much time in which to answer a very big contribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/2">As my hon. Friend has reminded us, almost 3,000 people were killed during the terrorist attacks on<phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>. As the Foreign Secretary told the Foreign Affairs Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March</phrase>, if September 11 had happened in this country rather than the United States, it would have changed our politics and security parameters just as it has changed those of the Americans.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/3">It is also important to recognise the dilemma faced by the US Government in considering Guantanamo's future&mdash;how to balance collective security and respect individuals' human rights at the same time. More than 270 detainees have been moved from Guantanamo back to their home countries or their country of origin. Many more are being considered for the same, under arrangements designed to ensure that they will be treated humanely on their return. That is not an easy process; it will take time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/4">We expect the United States to be an example of fairness and justice, where civil liberties and human rights are protected and cherished. Sadly, they are not protected and cherished in some countries. Indeed, there are places where they hardly exist at all. The question is what happens to those who are left. One obvious answer&mdash;we have heard from some quarters&mdash;would be to release all the detainees at Guantanamo. I fear that that would not be entirely wise. It would hardly serve not only the US Government's own citizens but everyone else in the world if the Americans were suddenly to release people who could return to terrorism, as some of those already released have.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/5">My hon. Friend's question raises a number of detailed issues that I am happy to try to address this evening. First, on the legal aspects of indefinite detention, it is useful to understand the US Government's legal position, even if one does not necessarily agree with it. The US Government believe that they are in a continuing state of at least potentially worldwide armed conflict with al-Qaeda&mdash;that is, at war. They believe therefore that the laws of armed conflict apply to those whom they detain. The US Government's view is that under the laws of armed conflict, they are entitled to detain people until that war is over, as they did, for example, during world war two, when again no one knew how long the conflict would last.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/6">The British Government's view is that, whatever the status of the so-called global war on terror, the detainees at Guantanamo are entitled to humane treatment and, if prosecuted, to a fair trial. We have made that clear to the United States authorities. The United States is well aware of the UK's opposition to the death penalty under all circumstances. In private diplomatic discussions, at both ministerial and official levels, the UK has made its views known to the US Government and has made representations to them about the circumstances in which, and conditions under which, detainees are held at Guantanamo.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/7">After a lengthy series of discussions with the US, which were led for the Government by the Attorney-General, in 2004 the Government concluded that the military commissions process would not provide sufficient guarantees of a fair trial according to international standards. That eventually led to the release and return of the British detainees at Guantanamo. I am sure that hon. Members will be aware that most of the military commission's proceedings have been stayed, pending a US Supreme Court decision in June on the right of the detainees to challenge the legality of their detention.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/8">My hon. Friend raised the question of torture and other allegations of abuse at Guantanamo. Let me make our position on torture absolutely clear. The United Kingdom condemns unreservedly the use of torture and works hard with its international partners to eradicate that abhorrent practice. We abide by our commitments under international law, including the UN convention against torture and the European convention on human rights, and we expect all other countries to comply with their international obligations. We are active in pressing them to deliver on those human rights commitments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/9">The US Government have given repeated assurances on this matter and on the treatment of detainees. Those assurances include the detailed public statement made by the US Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase>, which confirmed that the US respects the rules of international law, including the UN convention on torture. Dr. Rice stated that the US does not authorise or condone the torture of detainees, and that torture and conspiracy to commit torture are crimes under US law wherever they may occur in the world. In addition, the US Detainee Treatment Act, which was enacted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase>, provides that no individual in the custody or under the physical control of the US Government, regardless of nationality, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. That legislation makes a matter of statute what President Bush has made clear was already US Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/10">My hon. Friend has reminded the House of a report submitted on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-15">15 February</phrase> by five holders of mandates of special procedures of the UN Commission on Human Rights. A number of serious criticisms about the reported situation of detainees in Guantanamo Bay were made in that report. In their formal reply on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-10">10 March</phrase>, the US Government strongly objected to the report both in terms of process and of substance, and argued that factual and legal assertions in it were inaccurate and flawed. It is clearly important that the US Government and the UN continue to engage on those issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/11">My hon. Friend listed some of the techniques allegedly used at Guantanamo. Those allegations have surfaced previously in relation to UK nationals. I want to make it clear that, we take allegations of abuse and mistreatment made by UK nationals previously held at Guantanamo very seriously. In respect of the British detainees, we raised concerns about issues including isolation, lack of access to daylight, lack of exercise and delays with mail. We pursued those concerns with the US authorities and secured a number of improvements in the physical conditions of the detention of the detainees, as well as improvements to the exercise regime and mail service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/12">The nine visits made by Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials to check on the British detainees' welfare showed us that, overall, the detainees appeared in sound physical health. The families of the detainees were given read-outs of the visits and statements were made to Parliament. Our visits found that medical facilities at Guantanamo were of a high standard. On each of the nine visits, we gave the British detainees the opportunity to express concerns about their treatment. None of them alleged to us that they were systematically mistreated at Guantanamo.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/13">Over the past few months, several right hon. and hon. Members have raised the circumstances of the former UK residents who are detained in Guantanamo. It is the longstanding policy of the UK Government not to offer consular assistance to non-British nationals, except in cases in which a specific agreement to do so exists with another state. My hon. Friend spoke of exceptions to that rule, such as the case of Abdul Rahman, the Christian convert in Afghanistan who faced the threat&mdash;it was a remote possibility&mdash;of the death penalty.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/14">Hon. Members will no doubt be aware of the recent judicial review of the former Foreign Secretary's decision not to make formal representations to the United States Government for the release and return to the UK of three of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay who were formerly resident in the UK. The court held that there was no duty on the Foreign Secretary in domestic or international law to make the formal request sought by the claimants. The claimants have been granted leave to appeal, so it would not be appropriate for me to say any more about the case at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/15">The court also recognised that the Government have made informal representations on humanitarian grounds to the US Government in respect of the detainee claimants. In 2005, my predecessor, Baroness Symons, agreed exceptionally to meet the families and representatives of those detainees who we knew were formerly resident in the UK, but were not British nationals, on a humanitarian basis. We passed on the concerns expressed to us by the families to the US authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/16">I fully agree with my hon. Friend that there needs to be greater understanding of how Guantanamo operates. A visit by, say, the Foreign Affairs Committee would clearly help to achieve that. I understand that the Committee is already in touch with the US Administration about visiting the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/17">As I have said, it is important that we never forget the context in which Guantanamo came about: the slaughter of 3,000 innocent people on <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase>. That was followed by atrocities in Madrid, Bali, Sharm el Sheikh, Amman, Istanbul, Riyadh and Moscow, and then last summer by the attacks on the London underground. The intent is clear. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the terrorists want to destroy new-found freedom and democracy and to kill people. I was in Baghdad when al-Zarqawi's suicide bombers murdered hundreds of innocent Shi'a Iraqis in just a couple of bloody days. Understandably, I suppose, the fate of those poor people has not been the subject of intense legal and human rights scrutiny in the way in which the detaining of terrorist suspects at Guantanamo has. We do not expect civilised behaviour from al-Qaeda henchmen, but we should not forget that those people had human rights, too. It is right that Britain should stand firm with our friends and allies against such evil.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306.2/18">All of us who care for the cause of civil liberties and human rights should pause and recall that those who were so brutally murdered in London on <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> and in many other atrocities had human rights. Self-appointed executioners took those rights away from them, so we will continue to pursue those who commit acts of terrorism. At the same time, we shall maintain absolutely our commitment to civil liberties and human rights.</p>
