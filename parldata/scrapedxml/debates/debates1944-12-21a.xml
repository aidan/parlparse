<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he will reconsider the position of small builders who, because of war conditions, were forced to close their business and who subsequently became liable for direction under D.R. 58A; and whether he can now allow them to leave their present employment in order to reopen their business.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour why the number of accidents in the metal and engineering industries as between 1938 and 1943 has shown an increase at least 10 times as great as the proportionate increase in the number of women employed in those industries.</p>

<p>I am afraid I do not follow the calculations in the Question, but I am advised that, in spite of counter-measures, the number of accidents to women in these industries would naturally be expected to increase under war conditions by a substantially greater percentage than the percentage increase in the numbers of women employed, owing to a combination of accident-producing factors, such as have been referred to in the annual reports of the Chief Inspector. I am glad, however, to say that, as mentioned in the Report for 1943, there was in that year a fall in the accident rate for women employed in those munition industries which are the chief sources of accidents to women.</p>

<p>With the permission of the House, I would like to make a statement in regard to an alteration in Government policy on the posting of members of the A.T.S. which has just been decided upon.<br/>
In this stage of the war it is more than ever necessary that we should make the best possible use of our available manpower in the Services and in industry. In the Services the chief aim is to ensure that the maximum number of men are released for operational duties and in order to effect this completely men are replaced by women wherever the nature of the work permits. The A.T.S. have given great assistance in this way at home and now the time has come when their services are urgently required overseas to release able-bodied soldiers from the kind of duty which they can perform. Some A.T.S. auxiliaries are already serving overseas but substantially increased numbers are now required. The Government have, therefore, decided to post certain A.T.S. auxiliaries, as required, overseas and are confident that this decisoin will be welcomed as a necessary and expansive deployment of available resources. The Government have, however, decided not to post auxiliaries to India except as volunteers. It is not proposed to send A.T.S. to Burma, or West Africa, either compulsorily or as volunteers.<br/>
As heretofore, volunteers will be welcomed and encouraged, and priority will be given to them in the compilation of overseas drafts. The conditions governing the acceptance of A.T.S. volunteers for overseas service are that the auxiliary must be recommended by an A.T.S. officer not below the rank of Senior Commander, and must be of the requisite medical category. Volunteers are not accepted if they are under 19 years of age, or if they have children under the age of 14. Apart from those who volunteer, no member of the A.T.S. will be posted overseas to any theatre unless she

is 21 years of age or over, unmarried and medically fit for service abroad.<br/>
Accommodation for A.T.S. auxiliaries overseas will be of the best possible standard. In winter they will be accommodated in huts or billets; in the summer months tents may be used, but certainly not in winter. The Government recognise the need for welfare amenities and recreational facilities on a generous scale and the utmost care will be used to make every possible provision. The A.T.S. overseas will receive the same medical attention as at home including their own women doctors and accommodation in their own special wards. They will be eligible for leave on exactly the same terms as soldiers.<br/>
The work which A.T.S. overseas will be doing will be similar to that which they have performed, with such success, at home; in particular, signal personnel and clerks are required. The majority will be employed at the larger headquarters and installations in the rearward areas which may of course at any time come under the same kind of bombardment as London. Here their work will be invaluable. The mixed batteries of anti-aircraft artillery and other associated formations will be strictly confined to volunteers, and will of course be employed in any circumstances or stations in which the High Command may require them.<br/>
The Government know that the A.T.S. on whose services so many calls have been made, will welcome these opportunities of making a further vital contribution to the war effort, a contribution on which will depend in no small degree the maintenance of Britain's war strength in the successful and unrelenting prosecution of the war.</p>

<p>I do not think it is a very grave departure, because at any rate in the case of the W.R.N.S. they are already posted abroad. It is not a very great departure, because the practice is already in existence. "Wrens" are posted abroad as well as going abroad as volunteers. I made my statement this morning in order to cover as many of the points as possible and there will be opportunities for hon. Members to raise the subject, but the question asked by my learned Friend should be addressed to the Leader of the House.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the Adjournment for the Christmas Recess, I desire to raise the question of the terms under which the railways are being operated by the Government as controlled undertakings. I am raising this question on behalf of a group of Members of this House who are interested in the railways and those who own railway securities, the proprietors or stockholders. Perhaps I should say that the group which I represent does not include any Members of this House who are directors of railways. They, I understand, have their separate Committee, and I am in no way speaking on their behalf. There are, I believe, well over a million persons who hold railway securities of different kinds, and railway securities form the largest aggregate of capital of any British industry. The majority of the holders of these securities are comparatively small people who hold comparatively small amounts.<br/>
The existing Control Agreement has operated from 1st January, 1941. This superseded a former Agreement which was in force for the first 16 months of the war. I should like, for a moment or two, to remind the House of the history of railway control during the war. The railways were taken over on 1st September, 1939, and the financial arrangements were published as a White Paper in February, 1940. The main terms of the first financial arrangement were (1) the revenue receipts and expenditure were to be pooled, (2) the average of the net revenues for the years 1935, 1936 and 1937 were to be guaranteed by the Government and paid over to the railways&#x2014;this guaranteed sum was estimated to be somewhere about &#x00A3;40,000,000&#x2014;and (3) any further balance of net revenue in the pool, up to &#x00A3;3,500,000, was to be paid to the railways. Then comes paragraph 4 of the first Agreement, which I should like to read to the House in order to remind them of what it says. It says:
<q>If the net revenue in the pool exceeds &#x2026; &#x00A3;43,500,000 then, until the sum paid to them"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the railways&#x2014;
<q>reaches &#x00A3;56,000,000, being the estimated sum required to bring the net revenues of the

controlled undertakings up to their standard revenues, one half of the excess over &#x00A3;43,500,000 will be paid to the Exchequer and the other half will be paid to the controlled undertakings &#x2026; so that in any case the total net revenue accruing to a controlled undertaking shall not exceed its standard revenue.</q>
Any balance of net revenue left in the pool was to be paid to the Exchequer. There were one or two further points in this first Agreement to which I would like to refer. There was provision for maintenance and renewals. It was provided that the cost of war damage, up to &#x00A3;10,000,000 in any full year, was to be charged to revenue expenditure. It was provided that freight charges were to be adjusted to meet working costs, and, then, paragraph 11 said:
<q>The Minister of Transport or the railway companies &#x2026; may, after the end of the year 1940, propose revision of these arrangements for any cause of a major character and, if agreed, the arrangements shall be revised accordingly.</q>
This first Agreement was the result of long negotiations dating back, I believe, to a very considerable time before the war, and in anticipation of the possible outbreak of war. It bore the stamp, in my view, of free negotiation and it amounted, in effect, to a partnership between the railways and the State.<br/>
In the course of the year 1941, the Government decided to take advantage of paragraph 11 of that Agreement, and they gave notice that they desired its revision for a cause of a major character. As a matter of fact, they gave two causes for revision. The first reason they gave was their decision to introduce legislation placing all public utilities on the same basis as regards war damage, and their second reason was their announced policy of minimising the impact of increased costs of transport upon prices of essential goods and services. In other words, they decided to employ a policy of subsidising the cost of living&#x2014;in this case transport&#x2014;as we know has been carried out in many other directions.<br/>
These negotiations resulted in a second Agreement being concluded which was presented to Parliament in a White Paper in September, 1941, and discussed in this House on 22nd October, 1941. This second Agreement swept away all the paragraphs of the old one savouring of a partnership, and, in their place, it provided for a guaranteed rental to be paid to the railways of &#x00A3;43,000,000&#x2014;in round figures&#x2014;the whole of any excess in the


pool over that amount going to the Government. There were paragraphs dealing with the provision of sums to cover maintenance and renewals and abnormal wear and tear, but that is really all there is to the second Agreement&#x2014;a rental, and the whole of the balance going to the Government.<br/>
The Government must have thought, when they made this Agreement, that it was a pretty good bargain at the time, but it has worked out tar more profitably for them than they could ever have imagined. In the three years 1941, 1942 and 1943, the Government received just under &#x00A3;130,000,000 in excess of the guaranteed rental. The proprietors of the railways feel that they have had a pretty unfair bargain. The principle of partnership has been abolished, the Government now appropriate the whole of what I may call the equity, and there are at present &#x00A3;78,000,000 worth of London and North Eastern Railway Ordinary Stock which is receiving no dividend at all, and something over &#x00A3;60,000,000 of London and North Eastern Railway Second Preference Stock which is receiving just 2&#x215D; per cent. in place of the full 4 per cent. to which, in my view, it should be entitled. The London and North Eastern Railway are very particularly affected and badly hit by this existing Agreement because, during the years before the war, as we well remember, so many of the areas in this country which they served were subject to very special depression. They were the depressed areas, the special areas, and so on.<br/>
To bring the story of railway control up to date, I must tell the House that at the annual meetings of the various railway companies at the beginning of this year, 1944, resolutions were passed by the shareholders complaining of the injustice, in their view, of the present control arrangements, and they asked their directors to convey these resolutions to the Government and to try, if possible, to secure a revision of the Agreement. As a result of that, the Railway Companies Association wrote to the Minister of Transport asking for revision of the Agreement for two causes of a major character not contemplated when the negotiations took place. These two causes were, first, our declaration of war on Japan and, second, the entry of the United States

into war with Germany. These factors, particularly the second, meant an immense expansion of the work of the railways in this country and an enormous amount of traffic, both passenger and goods, which could never have been contemplated at the time the existing Agreement was concluded, which was, of course, before either Japan or the United States had come into the war.<br/>
The Minister of Transport would not agree to any revision of the present Agreement, and that is how the matter stands at the present time. In my view, the reasons put forward by the Railway Companies Association why this Agreement should be revised were very potent and pregnant reasons, whereas neither of the contingencies which the Government feared in terminating the first Agreement has materialised. The bomb damage which has actually happened would have been easily taken care of by the terms of the first Agreement, and there has been no rise in transport costs since 1941, and the Government have not had to subsidise transport in any way since that year. Not only have they not had to subsidise transport, but they have received a subsidy, if I may so call it, from the railway companies, as I mentioned a short time ago, of &#x00A3;130,000,000.<br/>
So much for the present situation with regard to railway control. I would like to refer to one or two points which were made by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport, when he was replying to a Debate on this matter on the Adjournment on 1st August last. The matter was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Sir J. Mellor). Unfortunately, there was only half an hour for that Debate, and my hon. Friend was not able to conclude his speech. He did, however, make the following point in justifying the present Agreement. He said that nobody should make profits out of the war, least of all the railways. I entirely agree with that, but Parliament has laid down, in its wisdom, regular statutory machinery for preventing people making excessive profits out of the war. We have established an Excess Profits Tax, and under the regulations governing Excess Profits Tax it is provided that where businesses have had very low profits&#x2014;unduly low profits&#x2014;in the years immediately preceding the war,


they can put forward a substituted standard, which is based on the interest on their capital, which shall be the standard above which they must pay over excess profits, and below which they can keep those profits. Why is it that, among all the businesses of this great commercial country, the only kind of enterprise, so far as I know, which has been singled out for this specially harsh treatment is the railways? They have not been allowed to come under the ordinary statutory provisions Which relate to those who have made high profits, or excess profits, out of the war.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary said, in the course of the speech to which I have referred, that a great public service like this was different from an ordinary munitions business. In some respects, of course, it is different, but, so far as I know, other statutory undertakings, such as gas companies and electricity companies, and controlled businesses such as shipping companies, all come under the ordinary law with regard to excess profits and have not been adversely differentiated against in this way, as have the railways. There is, of course, a difference; the profits of public utility companies or statutory undertakings are very drastically controlled already, but while the Government control their profits and therefore make it practically impossible&#x2014;and quite rightly&#x2014;for them to earn high excess profits, the Government have always encouraged them to be in a position to pay reasonable interest on the capital employed in those industries. In my contention, that has not been the case with regard to the railways.<br/>
There are two other points on this question of Excess Profits Tax that I should like to make, to show where the railways are further prejudiced. Under excess profits law, there is to be a refund after the war of 20 per cent. of the amount paid by businesses in excess profits. That will not, I presume, apply to the railways, because they have not been allowed to come under excess profits law. There are also provisions for repayment of duty if there have been deficiencies, but in so far as it might operate, it, too, will not be available for the railways. Another point that my hon. Friend made was with regard to the question of the standard revenue, to which I have already referred, because it was dealt with in the first

Agreement which was concluded at the beginning of the war. He rather scoffed at this question of standard revenue and treated it very lightly. He said it was based on the best year the railways ever had in recent times, the year 1913. He said that it was 31 years old. He gave the House an impression that the standard revenue was not a matter of any great importance and should not be emphasised at all strongly.</p>

<p>If I might interrupt my right hon. Friend, may I say that I am moderately confident, without looking up what I said, that I arrived at the conclusion that my noble Friend could not possibly have taken the standard revenue as the basis on which he made the Agreement?</p>

<p>I was not really dealing with that point. I have read my hon. Friend's speech very carefully and I thought he did definitely deal with this question of the standard revenue rather lightly. I would remind the House that the standard revenue which the railways are allowed under the Act of 1921 is still the law of the land. Not only so, but the first Agreement, concluded in 1940, after the outbreak of the war was based upon that standard revenue. I have read out Article 4 under which the railways were to be partners with the State until they reached their standard revenue. That standard revenue has actually been attained since by the railways, and the revenues are now enormously in excess of it.<br/>
There is one other point as regards standard revenue which the House ought to remember. It is true that it is based on the year 1913, but we ought not to forget that, in 1913, the &#x00A3; sterling was worth just about double what it is worth to-day. If the permitted standard revenue of the railways has anything to do with the kind of remuneration which the stockholders ought to receive, one would think that, if anything, the standard revenue ought to be higher. I do not make any great point of it but I am merely pointing out that the sterling was worth very much more in 1913.</p>

<p>It was certainly very much lower.<br/>
The other point which he made was that the rental of &#x00A3;43,000,000 in round figures is far better than the maximum pre-war revenues of the railway companies. That obviously is a fact which cannot be disputed. Figures show it, but I would remind the Govvernment that the great slump which the railways were experiencing for many years before the outbreak of this war was mainly due to the tremendous competition of road transport. That increase of road transport competition had been evident for at least 15, and even 20, years before the outbreak of this war. Though many promises were made by various Governments during the pre-war years, nothing was ever done about it. Governments admitted that the railway companies had a very strong case. Their plight and their low revenues before the outbreak of this war were therefore due to a very considerable extent to Government inaction and Government procrastination on this question of a fair system of rates and fares as between road transport and railways.<br/>
Therefore, when my hon. Friend says that the rental now being paid to the railways by the Government is larger than the average of the immediately pre-war years, my answer is that the low revenues of the immediately pre-war years must largely be placed at the door of the Governments of the day&#x2014;not the present Government&#x2014;who did not take up this matter with the strength and purpose which it deserved. I hope that I have said enough to show that the proprietors of the railways have good cause for just complaint and that, in justice and in equity, they have a strong case for asking for a revision of the present Agreement.<br/>
Before I conclude I should like lo ask my hon. Friend one or two questions. Article 11 of the existing, the second, Agreement says&#x2014;a previous Article had dealt with maintenance and renewals&#x2014;
<q>No other charge shall be allowed in respect of the said items of maintenance except so far as the Minister, in respect of wear and tear which is shown by the undertaking to be abnormal as compared with the base period, may agree to its inclusion.</q>
In a letter which the Minister of Transport wrote to the Railway Companies' Association on 16th June, he stated that the Government were prepared to consider this question of abnormal wear and tear with the railway companies, and I believe

they have been in negotiation since then upon this matter. If my hon. Friend has any information to give the House in regard to how those negotiations are proceeding, I am sure that Members would be glad to have it.<br/>
The other point about which I should specially like to ask my hon. Friend is the period during which control is to operate. Article 33 of the present Agreement says:
<q>Control will be continued for a minimum period of one year after the cessation of hostilities. Before control comes to an end"&#x2014;</q>
that is, in regard to statutory rights and obligations&#x2014;
<q>time will be given for the operation of any statutory machinery governing the level of charges.</q></p>

<p>I am reading paragraph 33 of the existing Agreement of 1941. Apparently, control is to last until "the cessation of hostilities." Exactly what that means we cannot say. I imagine it will have to be defined by Parliament, whether it means hostilities with Germany or the end of the war as a whole. Anyhow, this provision of time will be given for settling rates and charges and it is a very essential point indeed. When the time comes to settle rates and charges I most strongly suggest that both road and rail should be included and that the opportunity should be taken which, as I have said, was missed before the war, to bring about some general settlement as between road transport and rail transport. Without that, I do not see how the future can be anything but dark and difficult.<br/>
Whatever the future structure of transport in this country is to be after the war&#x2014;and it can hardly be the same as it was before&#x2014;it is of paramount importance that our transport undertakings should be handed over to whoever is to manage and operate them, in a condition in which they will be able to stand on their own feet as prosperous concerns, which will conduct efficient service and provide a reasonable return on their capital, neither receiving subsidies nor paying large revenues to the State at the cost of the ordinary citizen. If the war has proved anything, it has proved that the railways are an absolutely essential service, strategically and in every other way. They have done splendid


work in the face of almost overwhelming difficulties. The management has been efficient, and railway workers, both men and women, have been magnificent. All have faced dangers and hardships with courage and endurance. In view of that fact, I can say with confidence that railway transport deserves the brightest future which the country can give it.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend who has just spoken, and his associates, are certainly persistent. This same question was raised on the Adjournment Motion last August. I hope it is not going to become a habit of my right hon. Friend and his friends to raise this question on every possible occasion. He stated, at somewhat greater length, the argument which the hon. Member for Tamworth (Sir J. Mellor) put forward last August for the revision of the Agreement. I do not think that the answer will be very different. I have taken a very great interest in the various railway agreements ever since the war, and I should like to say a few words about the original Agreement with which my right hon. Friend dealt at the outset of his remarks and which he regards apparently with longing and affection.<br/>
The House will remember that there was very considerable criticism of the original Agreement. It was felt by many that it was grossly unfair to the general public. Among other things, it enabled the railway companies to increase fares if their expenditure increased, even though, at the same time, their revenue also increased. It permitted the railway companies to earn a grossly inflated revenue, even though the bulk of their traffic was Government traffic, brought about by the exigencies of the war. No one spoke in stronger terms about this agreement than the present Home Secretary, and in March, 1941, there was a Debate on the Agreement, one of many, in which I had the privilege of taking part. Looking back on what I said then, I believe I was justified in saying that the Agreement was one which ought to be revised without delay. In reply to my speech, the then Minister of Transport, Lord Brabazon, said the more he looked at this Agreement the less he liked it. Therefore, the House was not surprised when, shortly afterwards, a new Agreement was entered into. This

new Agreement, the one which is the subject of the present discussion, was freely negotiated. No pressure whatever was put upon the railway companies, although a suggestion has been made to that effect, but it was quite rightly repudiated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of War Transport last August.<br/>
May I draw the attention of the House to paragraph (2) of the outline of the revised financial arrangement in which it is stated:
<q>The Government and the four amalgamated railways and the London Passenger Transport Board have agreed that the existing financial arrangements should be modified and, as a result of negotiations, the arrangements have been revised.</q>
There has never been a suggestion from any responsible quarter since then that this Agreement was not freely negotiated, and that it was not, at the time it was made, a fair and reasonable Agreement. My right hon. Friend said that new circimstances had arisen which, although there was no provision in the revised Agreement for further revision, justified a revision on moral grounds. The points he made were that since the Agreement was made America had entered into the war and we had made war against Japan. But I would like to draw attention to the observations of the hon. Member for Bolton (Sir C. Entwistle) at the last annual general meeting at the Great Western Railway Company. The hon. Member is the Deputy Chairman of the company, and the question of the revision of the Agreement was raised at that annual general meeting. This is what he said:
<q>My own personal view"&#x2014;</q>
and I would suggest that the personal view of the hon. Member is of more importance than the personal view of other hon. Members, even though they may be members of an organisation&#x2014;
<q>is that any approach to the Government now for revision would be premature, and contrary to the spirit in which we accepted that agreement.</q>
At the time when the Deputy Chairman of the Great Western Railway made those remarks, we were already at war with Japan, and the United States had already entered the war. Those facts were no doubt well within the knowledge of the Deputy Chairman of the Great Western Railway. Obviously, therefore, he did not consider those facts justified the


revision of the Agreement. In fact he said he thought that
<q>any approach to the Government now for revision would be premature.</q>
The House will, I am sure, accept the views of the Deputy Chairman of the Great Western Railway rather than, with great respect, the views of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Antrim (Sir H. O'Neill).</p>

<p>Yes, I am very well aware of that. I should disclose that I have a personal interest. I have shares in the Great Western Railway. I agree that some shareholders thought that approaches should be made, and like a good democrat the hon. Member for Bolton accepted the view of the shareholders and made an approach. I am saying what his own personal views are, and I think they are of some importance.<br/>
Is the Agreement unfair? I suggest it is not only unfair, but, as I remarked at the time when it was made, it is very generous to the railway companies. My right hon. Friend brushed on one side the fact that it gives to the railway companies considerably higher revenue than their average earnings for the previous ten years. Having gone into the figures I would suggest it gave them a considerably higher revenue than their average revenue for the previous 20 years. On possibly no more than one or two occasions since the last war have the railway companies earned as much as &#x00A3;43,000,000, which is their present revenue. I agree that difficulties have arisen because of conflict with the roads, but I would respectfully suggest to my right hon. Friend that that is a factor one cannot get away from, and no action of the Government, short of a subsidy, could have given the railway companies a greater revenue. After all, they were entitled to go to the Railway Rates Tribunal before the war and ask for higher rates, since they were not earning the standard revenue provided under the 1921 Act. Why did they not go? I submit to the House they did not go to the Tribunal because they were aware of the law of diminishing returns, that if the fares and rates were increased it would not necessarily mean an increase in their

net revenue, but might mean the reverse, because fares and rates were already sufficiently high. The railway companies were well aware of that, and did not make any application to the Railway Rates Tribunal, though the 1921 Act would have permitted them to do so as they were not earning the standard revenue.<br/>
I submit to the House that the Agreement was not only fair, but even generous. My right hon. Friend referred to the London and North Eastern stock, some of which was not receiving a dividend, but which, in fact, has not received a dividend for many years. There is no reason why, because the Government require the use of the railways through war circumstances, because the nation requires the use of the railways, stocks which had for many years not received a dividend, should suddenly receive one. I cannot see the equity of that. But in fact my right hon. Friend also quoted the preference stock which was to-day receiving a mere 2&#x215D; per cent. But one can buy the stock on the Stock Exchange at the present moment at a price which will give one 8 per cent., not 2&#x215D; per cent. dividend. But that stock before the war was only receiving a fraction of 1 per cent., and I would submit that they have done very well indeed to be now getting 2&#x215D; per cent. against a fraction of 1 per cent. If one takes what the Stock Exchange thinks about the Railway Agreement, it is a fact that many of the stocks have doubled in their quotations since the Agreement was made. That shows what the public really thinks about the Railway Agreement.<br/>
I submit that my right hon. Friend has made no case for an upward revision of the Agreement in favour of the railway companies. If anything, though I do not press the point, there might be a case for a revision downwards. It is true that the Government have done very well out of this Agreement, but after all the Government are the biggest customers of the railways at this time, and the charges made for railway traffic are purely arbitrary. I suggest that by varying very slightly the charges which the railways make at the present time for Government traffic, these big profits could be converted, into a loss. After all, these profits are being made very largely at the expense of the traveling


public, because the travelling public are not getting the comfort and convenience for the fares they pay, and which they are entitled to expect; and if the profits are high it is not the railway companies which should receive more. There might be a case for a rebate for the travelling public. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be firm, and give no hope to my right hon. Friend of any upward revision in the Railway Agreement. On the contrary I hope he will look into the matter and see if something more can be done for the travelling public.</p>

<p>I must say that I find myself in a very large measure of agreement with what the hon. Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) has just said. I ask myself what purpose my right hon. Friend thought he might be serving in raising this matter again to-day. I feel absolutely certain that he is really aware of the fact that he is beating against a door which is not only closed, but barred and bolted. I believe that quite a number of approaches have been made to the Ministry of War Transport for a revision of this Agreement, and from what I have been able to ascertain I should have thought that the answers given to those approaches would have left my right hon. Friend in no doubt that he was not likely to get any of the advantages he claims.<br/>
I wish to look into the assumptions he made, and see what was in his mind, and what he thought he might be able to get. The first assumption was his argument that if the railways had been treated as other companies had been for Excess Profits Tax, they would have had a more advantageous position than in point of fact has been the case. I think that is a very broad assumption, and one with which it is difficult to agree. In the first place my right hon. Friend said that had they been treated in the normal manner their standard revenue would probably have been taken as the revenue for the standard period. I do not think there is any evidence to show that would have been the case. It seems much more likely that the revenue for the three preceding years would have been taken, and that is the revenue on which the present Agreement is based. He said there was a special claim in view of the particular effects of road competition, but though that is an undeniable factor it is very

largely hypothetical, and would be impossible to measure in terms of pounds, shillings and pence. I do not think he is correct in his assumption that a higher or substituted standard would in fact have been accepted for the railways had the normal procedure regarding E.P.T. been adopted in their particular case.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend appreciate that the substituted standard is based on an assessment of capital, not revenue.</p>

<p>Yes, but the railways' standard revenue is very much the same as the return on capital to which my hon. Friend referred in his interruption. I am quite certain there would not have been sufficiently strong grounds to be able to convince the Inland Revenue that a different standard than the earnings prior to the war should have been taken had the railways been on the ordinary E.P.T. basis. Another point which escaped my right hon. Friend's observation, which I think must be kept in mind, is that the railways, under the existing Agreement, are in point of fact enjoying terms that are advantageous to them regarding their renewals. If the railway companies had been treated for E.P.T. in the same way as other companies, they would have been allowed only to put aside money for renewals based on the cost of the articles&#x2014;rolling stock, rails, and the like&#x2014;at the time they were purchased. At present the railways are enabled to base their renewals fund upon the cost of replacement, which is in most cases 50 per cent. above pre-war cost. I think that that advantage would largely set off the ultimate refund after the war of 20 per cent.&#x2014;less Income Tax of course&#x2014;which they might otherwise have enjoyed. I have attempted to dispose of the argument that they would have been more fairly treated, or would have gained financially, if looked upon as ordinary companies.<br/>
The second point that my right hon. Friend referred to&#x2014;and it was referred to by the hon. Member for Peckham&#x2014;is the special case of these L.N.E.R. stocks. It is right to point out that they amount to &#x00A3;78,000,000 out of a total railway investment of &#x00A3;1,100,000,000&#x2014;a very small proportion of the whole. Even if the railways were allowed by the Government to enjoy a higher amount than &#x00A3;43,000,000 it could not in any way be right that that balance should go to the L.N.E.R. If


the companies were allowed to retain a larger amount that additional balance would have to be divided equitably between the four companies, according to an agreed scheme. I think that a very great increase on the &#x00A3;4,000,000 would have to be guaranteed to cover this deficiency of &#x00A3;78,000,000 on L.N.E.R. stock. It seems to me that unless the L.N.E.R. were themselves in a position to earn very much more, they could not establish a claim to a larger share than the present agreed quota between the four railway companies.<br/>
There is one point on which I support what my right hon. Friend said, and I hope that the Minister will be able to say something about this matter&#x2014;I hope that he will forgive me if I am not able to be in my place to hear his reply. I am referring to the question of costs. We were told that the second Railway Agreement, which stabilised the position and did not allow any sliding scale to the companies in the share of profits, was made because the Government said at the time that it was their intention to control prices and, as far as possible, to avoid any rise in prices. They have done a great deal in that direction, and very large subsidies are paid to maintain price levels. But it has not operated all in one direction. The railway companies have had to pay something like 100 per cent. increase in the cost of coal since the outbreak of the war, and almost as great an increase since the second Agreement was made. I would ask my hon. Friend if he could say something to justify the statement, which was made at the time of the second Agreement, that the object of fixing the share of the profits to the railway companies was to prevent any rise in costs. Otherwise I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Peckham. There could be no question, I think, in the mind of the House, or in that of the country, that, after what has happened in the last two years, there is no likelihood of a revision being granted at the present stage; and I think that the quotations of railway stock on the Stock Exchange make it amply clear that the position is regarded, by the public as being absolutely satisfactory at the present time.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member for South-East St.

Pancras (Sir A. Beit) said, the capital value of the railway companies as a whole amounts to something over &#x00A3;1,000,000,000. That &#x00A3;1,000,000,000 contains some "water," and part of it represents a number of assets which have ceased to possess any value at all, as hon. Members will remember, from a recent correspondence in the columns of "The Times," initiated by the hon. Member for Newport (Sir R. Clarry).

<p>I come back to the point I was making, that at no time have Stock Exchange values ever been as high as the nominal figures of the holdings. It is not surprising, therefore, that some of this capital has been drawing no interest, and some very little interest, for many years. It is a strange argument that stock which has very seldom been able to earn interest in peace-time should be able to take advantage of war to earn money. My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) described this Agreement as generous. Nobody has explained the exact extent of its generosity. The Agreement provides for a guaranteed &#x00A3;43,000,000. That is to be paid to the


railway companies as a certainty, not affected in any way by increases in costs or increases in wages, not affected by any cost of replacement; and there is more in the replacement provision than the hon. Member for South-East St. Pancras said, because the maintenance fund is replenished at the cost of replacement, assessed at the time when the money is put into the fund. It may be that if you were to build a railway engine to-day it would cost twice as much as it did before the war; but that sum is put into the maintenance fund. It is not spent now; it is invested, and retained. It may be that, after the war, when the time comes to rebuild engines, they can be rebuilt at a good deal less than the pre-war price. Therefore, the maintenance fund contains a great deal of clear profit to the railway companies.<br/>
Let us compare the &#x00A3;43,000,000 with the position in 1938, to see whether there is any real ground for complaint. In 1938, the last complete year before the war, the shareholders of the railway companies of this country had available for distribution &#x00A3;33,500,000, and it was a very uncertain figure at that. Nobody could have predicted with certainty that they could have maintained that the next year if the war had not come. They are getting to-day a certain &#x00A3;43,000,000, as certain as the interest of any Government security. That is sufficient, I should think, to convince the House that the term "generous," used by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham, is amply justified.<br/>
What then is the complaint? What could have been extracted by way of revenue, if the railway companies had only been given their heads? I have no doubt they would have extracted considerably more revenue to themselves. But is that the proper approach? Supposing the attitude of getting what you can in war had been generally followed, what wages the servants of the railway companies could have extracted under present circumstances. They, like the railway stock itself, cannot be replaced in war-time. If the railway workers were to hold up the community for the full limit they could extract, this country could not have faced all these troubles and tribulations during the war. I do not see why any different principle should be applied to those who hold stock. We

cannot approach these problems on a purely commercial basis. If what the railway companies want is commercial treatment, the Government could easily give it without disagreement. The Government are by far the biggest customers of the railways, and those who are more familiar with the ways of commerce than I am know that when one concern is the overwhelming customer of another the serving firm is soon under the domination of the big customer, which can exact such terms as it likes. But this House has not, the Ministry has not, and the Government have not, approached this matter on that purely crude commercial basis.<br/>
Why, then, is this approach being made? That question has been asked by more than one speaker. I think I know the answer. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Antrim (Sir H. O'Neill) and his friends know well that the railway companies of this country are never going back to private control. There is ample evidence of that in the propaganda which the railway companies are disseminating. Our postbags contain a number of brochures, pamphlets, and documents actively trying to prevent nationalisation. I am being very careful, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. I am not advocating in this Debate the policy of nationalisation, which we are awaiting. I am only dealing with propaganda in which the railway companies themselves object to nationalisation.</p>

<p>With respect, I agree, but we are discussing the financial Agreement, and the railway companies under the terms of that Agreement are entitled to have their costs as a first charge upon the revenue they collect. Part of that money is expended by the railway companies in resisting the nationalisation which they know is coming. I therefore suggest that it is within the terms of your Ruling, Sir, if I deal, not with the merits of that, but merely with the fact that they are spending money to try to prevent it. It would be money spent in vain&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I bow to your Ruling, Sir. I take it that it is within the terms of that Ruling for me to mention that the nature of that propaganda is directed against the nationalisation of the railways. I think they show, in this regard, some undue concern. Nobody has suggested the continuance of the type of control that we have to-day for peace-time purposes. Certainly, no one would fancy that the efficient administration of the railway companies in peace time would flow from a system under which they now have to obey directions from the Ministry of War Transport. I think it is as well, in the running of this Agreement for the control of the railways, that the House should know that the railway companies have no discretion in the running of their rolling stock, and that the management of the companies, the people who know how to run trains, have no discretion without reference to the Ministry of War Transport, and that that very nearly resulted in a serious state of affairs this year.<br/>
The House will recollect that, with the onset of the flying bomb, there was, naturally, a considerable and encouraged exodus from London. It appears, from subsequent events, that there was ample rolling stock available within the control

of the railway companies, and, from inquiries I have made subsequently, that it could be used without interference to any movement of essential war materials or troops. Pressure was brought to bear upon the railway companies to provide these additional facilities, and I assume that the railway companies expressed their willingness to do so, but were unable to do so, because they were refused the permission of somebody in the Ministry of War Transport. Things got so bad that, in the end, the Noble Lord, the Minister of War Transport himself, had to go to see what was actually happening, and it was some time after that, before the trains were eventually provided.<br/>
Nobody has advocated a system for the perpetuation of an organisation of that kind, and, therefore, again I say that a good deal of the money expended on this propaganda is misdirected. Why do we have this return, again and again, of additional claims of the stockholders? It is a realisation, I think, that the net earning capacity of the railway companies for future purposes will be taken as the &#x00A3;43,000,000 provided for in the existing Agreement, and this recurrence of that attempt to-day is really an effort to put up the price of the railways against the time when they may be acquired by someone other than their existing legal owners. That, I think, justifies, in the minds of those who advocate it, the policy of coming again and again to get the net return under the Agreement increased.<br/>
I join wholeheartedly with my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham in saying that the railway stockholders are getting not only just but generous treatment, and I urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary not to give way by as much as a whisper when it is suggested that that return should be increased.</p>

<p>I think the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Antrim (Sir H. O'Neill) was perfectly right in raising this matter to-day, however often it has been raised before, and I hope he will go on raising it in future. When we see a persistent injustice, as we believe this to be, I think we must persist in our protest. I should very much like to follow on what several hon. Members have said, but, if I did so, I should either cover the field already covered by my


right hon. Friend or the ground I myself covered on 1st August. Therefore, I will limit myself to two points.<br/>
On 1st August, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of War Transport said:
<q>It is sometimes argued that the Agreement bears with particular injustice on the holders of the junior railway stocks which, for some reason which I do not understand, are alleged to be the property, not of 'big business interests,' but of 'little men.' This view has evoked some little sympathy. In fact, it is without foundation of any kind."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th August, 1944; Vol. 402, c. 1352.]</q>
That is what the Parliamentary Secretary said. In my submission, it is most clearly well founded to say that the junior railway stocks are very largely held by small people, and that has been proved in a very conclusive and clear way by a publication called "Who Owns the Railways" by Mr. Hargreaves Parkinson, which is a reprint of articles which have been published from time to time in the "Financial News."</p>

<p>I accept my hon. Friend's explanation, and I am very glad to see that he is not making a false point. I drew attention to this publication, because it is very important, and it does show, for instance, that, in the case of the L.N.E.R. junior stocks, the Preferred Ordinary and the Deferred stocks, actually over one-half of the holdings are less than &#x00A3;200 each in nominal value.</p>

<p>I am not concerned with that.

<p>The other point to which I wish to refer is with regard to the substituted standard appropriate to Excess Profits taxation, which, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Antrim suggested, should have been applied in the case of the railway companies. I pressed the Parliamentary Secretary upon this point on 1st August, and interrupted him, when making his speech, to ask him to deal with the point. What he said was this:
<q>That is a very hypothetical matter I cannot argue now. It is extremely doubtful whether on any standards they would come out better."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st August, 1944; Vol. 402, c. 1352.]</q>
I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take the opportunity of dealing with the matter when he replies, because I really think it would be absurd to say that the railway companies would not come out better if they were treated on an Excess Profits Tax basis, instead of treating them as they are under the present Agreement. As I said just now, the actual real value of their assets to-day is probably in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;2,000,000,000 but even taking their book value, which is somewhere about &#x00A3;1,100,000,000, they would come out very much better on substituted standard. That is more certainly the case because their finance in the past has been extremely conservative. Before the war, at all events, when there had to be replacement of an asset, and it had to be done at an enhanced cost, the value of the asset as it stood in the books was not written up. It was maintained at the existing value and the increased cost was provided out of revenue, and so a large amount of revenue was ploughed back into capital.<br/>
That is one of the reasons why these junior stock holders have not seen dividends for such a long time. If the financial policy of the railways had been less conservative, then perhaps these junior stockholders would have enjoyed dividends, but if that had been the case the railways would not have been in the fine fettle in which the Government found them at the outbreak of the war and they would not have seen us through this war in the magnificent way they have. We ought, therefore, to recognise that the great national asset which the railways have proved to be in this war has been partly due to the sacrifices accepted by the junior stockholders before the war. I do most earnestly wish to support the plea

put forward by my right hon. Friend the Member for Antrim and I beg of the Parliamentary Secretary to take this opportunity of giving us a very full reply.</p>

<p>I do not wish to take up the time of the House by joining in the general discussion. I intervene only for a few moments to refer to two statements which I believe to be somewhat incorrect. The first was made by the hon. Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin), who stated very definitely that the Railway Control Agreement was freely negotiated. It was not. It was negotiated in the shadow of an assurance&#x2014;I will not put it stronger than that&#x2014;that if it was not accepted, something much worse would be imposed. I do not want to exaggerate or over-state the case. The other point I wish to correct is this. My hon. Friend the Member for South-East St. Pancras (Sir A. Beit) laid great stress upon the statement which he made that the arrangements for renewals were exceedingly favourable. I do not think they were. The Clause in the Summary of the Agreement, which I have here, says:
<q>The maintenance charges, including renewals, are standardised on the basis of the average pre-war charge, adjusted to variations of assets concerned and to price levels.</q>
I do not suggest that they were unfair, but I do not think that a case can be made out for exceptionally favourable treatment of railways in that Clause.</p>

<p>Last week a number of hon. Members put Questions to the Ministry of War Transport about the refusal of that Department to alter the Construction Order relating to public vehicles. Those of us who asked the Questions received a most unsatisfactory answer and I gave notice then that I would raise the matter on the Adjournment at the earliest possible moment. I am, therefore, grateful to you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, for giving me the opportunity of catching your eye so early after this matter was raised, because the refusal by the Minister of War Transport to make an alteration in this Construction Order may just make all the


difference between the life and death, in the next two years of our export trade, of an industry which; if helped instead of obstructed, can well bring added employment to many thousands of our people.<br/>
The matter is now one of extreme urgency. The history of it is as follows. An application was made on a significant date&#x2014;5th November, 1943&#x2014;by the motor trade for a review of the Regulations affecting public service vehicles. That request has been frustrated just as effectively as another form of application was near this place some centuries ago. But there is an important difference, however, between that plot and this plan. That plot was to the public disadvantage, but this plan put forward by the motor trade is to the great public advantage. On 5th November, 1943, just over a year ago, a Memorandum was sent to the Ministry of War Transport. I will read a few lines from this Memorandum, which sets out fully the purpose of it. The Memorandum reads:
<q>Before the war, the design of road passenger vehicles was severely hampered by the restrictions imposed by the Road Traffic Act of 1930 and other legislation. The organisations which now submit this Memorandum to the Ministry of War Transport represent virtually the entire road passenger transport of the country, covering both the operating and the manufacturing sections. This Memorandum represents the unanimous proposals of the industry for the revision of the dimensional regulations which affect public service vehicles.</q>
So the House will see that this is a unanimous request of both operational and manufacturing sections of the motor industry. A number of requests were made, but I am only going to deal with the two main requests; of the number made there were two of outstanding importance. The first one was that the maximum permissible overall length for all public service vehicles, single or double-deck, with two or more axles, should be 30 feet. The second request was that the maximum permissible overall width for all public service vehicles should be eight feet. On 19th April, 1944, a further additional Memorandum was submitted to the Ministry of War Transport at that Ministry's request amplifying the details of the first Memorandum. This request was turned down by the Ministry of War Transport on 20th November, 1944. I must make it clear that this very reasonable request was turned down without any discussion what-

soever with any of the interests in the motor trade mostly concerned. They submitted their Memorandum, but I am informed that there was no discussion of it with them.</p>

<p>When a Memorandum is submitted surely it is the duty of the Government Department to go fully into the matter, and the substance of my complaint is that the Government Department has failed in its duty and has not gone fully into the whole matter. Before I give the reasons for turning it down, I will give the reasons which the motor trade put forward for this alteration in length and width. There are two main reasons. One concerns the home position and the other concerns the foreign position, that of our export trade. I will deal with the home position first. By altering the length and the width in the way required of public passenger vehicles much additional comfort would be given to passengers. They would be of greater convenience and not only that, there would be much easier working conditions for the conductors. The extra six inches of width would make quite a substantial difference to the comfort or otherwise of passengers. Conductors have to go up and down the gangway and it would make it easier for them, in a crowded bus, to get to the end and ensure, therefore, greater safety in stopping and starting omnibuses and in passengers getting on or off. Therefore, there are convenience, comfort and safety concerned in this required alteration.<br/>
The second point I wish to make is that of safety. By altering it in the way required there would be greater stability in passenger vehicles. With a wider chassis, wider brake-drums could be fitted, and there would be better facilities generally for brake-layout. Wider vehicles would be safer and less accident prone. There is another very important consideration which has recently developed in connection with the safety of public service vehicles. The Tyre and


Rim Association of the United States of America, an effective world authority on these matters, has increased the width of tyres and rims and the spacing between tyres. A wider vehicle is required to accommodate them and, as a result of experience which has been gained, better lay-out and less road friction result. Furthermore, it is not possible to provide tyres made of synthetic rubber which will carry the normal weight of a bus within the size which is now available.<br/>
These are powerful arguments and due and proper consideration has not been given to them by the Ministry of War Transport. I want to put this point to the Parliamentary Secretary. If the 7 feet 6 inches maximum width now allowed is not increased to 8 feet, it will be necessary to reduce the width of the chassis frame. This will mean a reduced safety tilting angle and a greater danger, therefore, of vehicles overturning. The public ought to be made aware of this danger due to the deliberate refusal of the Ministry of War Transport to discuss this matter with the manufacturers and with the operators, who are really much better qualified to judge these things than anybody in his Department.<br/>
The Ministry refuses to increase the length to 30 feet for a two-axle vehicle, although a 30 feet 3-axle vehicle is permitted. No explanation has been forthcoming as to why there should be this differentiation. As far as safety is concerned, it is purely a matter of adequate design and nothing else. The refusal of the Ministry on this matter is quite a mystery. The answer given to the motor trade was, "General consideration as to road safety and traffic congestion in urban areas." Now how a two-axle vehicle 30 feet long can cause any more traffic congestion than a 30 feet long three-axle vehicle, exactly the same length, or why a single-deck vehicle, again exactly the same length as a double-deck vehicle, should cause more congestion, is really one of those mysteries that emerge from Government Departments which the plain man in the street cannot understand. With regard to the request for an increase in width&#x2014;most important, most necessary, most vital&#x2014;the Minister just brushed aside that request in the most autocratic manner possible. This is what he said about it, that, having regard to

road conditions in this country, he was not going to allow it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will explain why, because there have been no reasoned arguments put forward in support of this refusal about the width&#x2014;just a blank wall of refusal. There have been no discussions, so far as I can make out, with technicians, with the experts who are very fully informed on likely developments, new progress being made, new materials coming into use&#x2014;all those things which must be studied and discussed now which affect future production many years ahead. Now, so far as I am aware, no discussions on all these technical matters took place with the home and the export industry. I am informed by people who are in touch with various organisations that the London Passenger Transport Board technical people do not know anything about it.<br/>
A number of city engineers who have been approached do not know anything about it. Some chief constables have had some requests sent to them, I believe; in the case of the Lancashire County Council, which covers a very wide urban area, it was put to their war emergency committee. I do not know what that war emergency committee knows about it. Were


any members of the public, any consumers, the users of these buses, asked their opinion of it? I think the House ought to know what the Minister asked, whom he asked, what were the replies sent to him, what questionnaires were sent out, who were consulted. Why was not the motor trade given an opportunity to discuss this matter with all these objectors, whoever they may be? I think it was reasonable to assume that the motor industry would have their request granted, and, if it were not possible to grant their request, would it not be decent and right to say, "We do not think we can accede to your request, and, in consequence, will you please come and discuss the various objections raised with us?" Would that not have been a reasonable and democratic thing to do instead of adopting the autocratic attitude that was taken up?</p>

<p>Yes, by Question on the-Floor of the House. I raised it again on the matter of export trade, and again last week by Question, and I have seen the Parliamentary Secretary as well. It is not for me to put words into his mouth. I am raising these grievances, which are felt by a large and very important section of the manufacturing community of this country, in order to give him the opportunity of making a reply.<br/>
That is the substance of our complaint. We want to know why there is all this secrecy; why there is all this hush-hush policy, this hole-in-the-corner business, no reasons or arguments given but just blank refusal. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary this. Is he aware that there are many eight-foot vehicles running on the roads now and for some years past, that there are many American vehicles of all kinds running on our roads quite satisfactorily? Does he not remember that about seven years ago permission was given for certain vehicles, produced prior to 1932, to run on the roads in excess of the width of seven feet six inches, provided that the original solid tyres were converted to pneumatics? Some of those wide vehicles are still running in congested dock areas with no ill effects. I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary, if there is congestion on the roads, then widen the roads; do not make the people suffer, and cause loss of our export trade, instead of giving employment on the roads and in our factories.<br/>
Now I come to the most serious aspect of this refusal, that is, the irreparable damage which is being done and will be done to our export trade. In the Gracious Speech many of us were encouraged by the words that His Majesty's Ministers
<q>&#x2026; will try to create conditions favourable to the expansion of our export trade and the re-equipment of our industry.</q>
Heartening words those were, especially when it is remembered that the Prime Minister, and many other Ministers as well, have impressed upon the country the need for increasing our export trade


by at least 50 per cent. if we are to maintain our standard of living. I want the Parliamentary Secretary to take that extract from the Gracious Speech to heart, because the policy that his Department is pursuing is precisely contrary to those words in the Gracious Speech. There is no help whatsoever, but hindrance being given to our export trade by the policy he is pursuing.<br/>
Why is damage being done to our export trade by this refusal of the Parliamentary Secretary to alter this Construction Order? First of all, if we are to compete in the markets abroad, it is essential that as far as possible mass production takes place. It is obviously going to be much more costly to jig and tool up for one kind of vehicle for the home trade and to jig and tool up for another kind of vehicle for the export trade. There is increased need for assembly in foreign countries and, where fabrication takes place, it is obvious that all parts wherever possible should be interchangeable. If we are to get our export trade, we must be able to compete in price. Now, Sir, foreign countries want the greater width because of its greater safety and because of the greater comfort which extra width and greater length give. I want to point out to the House that the Americans build only eight feet and above. American manufacturers are under no such handicap as are the manufacturers in our country; they are a bit more progressive in the United States of America than we are here. Unless we build in quantity, and with all the comforts that the greater width and the greater length give, we cannot get the business, and unless adequate care is taken to take full advantage of the new materials now coming on the market and fresh and new designs, again we cannot get the business. About a week ago, at the time when I was raising this matter in the House, I received from a foreign country a telegram, and I think it may be of interest to the House if I read it because it is very relevant to this export trade business:
<q>Consider necessary have British Government's final decision on essential specifications for road vehicles especially buses before approaching Government. Can you urge Ministry of Transport&#x2014;</q></p>

<p>I really do not know. It arrived out of the blue. I had no expectation of receiving it at all, but it arrived about the time that my Question was due to be answered. It came as a surprise to me. It just happened. That is why I quoted it, because clearly this


refusal of the Department to help the export trade is having an adverse effect. Future planning is held up and preparation is at a standstill until a fresh decision is made. Prototypes of the types required for our export trade will not be forthcoming. The export trade is in jeopardy and the position is tragic. I do not believe that the Minister of War Transport gives the export position adequate consideration. The matter was referred to in the recent Debate on the export trade and the President of the Board of Trade knew very, very little about it. I have written to him very fully on the position and he now knows all about it. At any rate, there has been very considerable activity amongst his officials, who are running around wanting to know what all the fuss is about and why it should be necessary to alter the Construction Order in order that the export trade may be assisted. I hope I have shown how serious the position is and that much more careful consideration ought to be given to the request of the motor trade.<br/>
I should like to ask whether the Minister will receive a deputation from the trade, led if necessary by Members of Parliament, in order to reconsider the whole question and, if their proposals do not meet with acceptance, which I think quite unbelievable, that there should be a public inquiry, with all relevant documents made public, so that the public may really get to the bottom of this obstinate refusal to study their comfort and provide for their future employment. Congestion on our roads can be overcome by widening them, thereby causing employment. Congestion on our unemployment queues can also be caused by the loss of our export trade. Let the Minister prevent both by speedy action. If he does not, I warn him that grave consequences will follow.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Member's statement is more eloquent for what he has not said than for what he has said. He made a point about six inches greater width for public coaches and stressed the convenience and comfort of passengers and greater space for the conductor to go up and down. That six inches divided out means an inch per seat&#x2014;almost negligible. What I think he really wants, though he has not said it, is greater width for lorries and

heavy commercial vehicles. They want greater and greater vehicles for carrying commercial goods on the road. In this little island of ours the roads are not built for that purpose, neither are our towns. At some of our pleasure resorts, many of which are old-fashioned towns, when a lorry or coach turns a corner all the traffic in every direction has to be stopped. The time has not come when we can put bigger juggernauts on the road. As an old motorist, I think the average driver would be terrified to get behind these juggernauts that will be built, because directly they get permission they will build to the full extent.<br/>
The argument as to our export trade is all very well but there are two sides to it. The trade would not be a one way trade. If we sell lorries abroad in great numbers they have to be paid for with something, and that something will be in the form of goods. Does it mean that goods that will come in will be different from the goods which come in now, and that people who might be taken into the motor building trade would be supplanted by people of other trades who are put out of business because of the new imports? I suggest that the whole matter has been put forward in the interests of the motor building trade, but that in the interests of thousands of drivers who will come on to the roads after the war we should not permit this extension of size until our roads are made fit to receive the bigger vehicles.</p>

<p>The question of the design of public service vehicles for the export trade is very important to Britain at the moment. I found when I was in India, a long time ago, America had more or less cornered the market for what were called "Continental models," which were high horse-power cars which had a greater clearance than ours. I wish to raise again, however, the question of right-hand driving which, I suggest, should be introduced now. Most certainly, America will not change to our way, although I would like to say for their benefit, in case they are interested, that it is actually historically right to drive on the left. Nevertheless, I do not think there is any possibility of persuading them to change to our method. We have now come to the time when we ought to change because there are not


many vehicles on the roads of Britain at the moment, and most of our troops abroad are now driving on the right hand side of the road in vehicles which have a left-hand drive. It would also be a good opportunity for the few taxis which remain in London to start to drive on the right of the road, as there is now plenty of room for manoeuvre.<br/>
Whatever the design of vehicles should be, I should like to say that by far the best truck in the Western Desert in the early part of this war was the British Morris 15 cwt. truck. It was far better than any American vehicle, as I think anyone who has served out there will agree. I have nothing to do with the motor trade but I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this matter again. At the same time, I think it would be admirable to change to the decimal system with regard to mileage. It does not matter whether they are miles, rods, poles or perches&#x2014;they ought to be dividable by 10. When you buy a public service vehicle it would also be much easier to introduce the decimal system with regard to the purchase price. The pound could be divided into, say, 20 florins&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Forgive me, Sir, but it is a good point all the same. To return to the question of the right hand drive, I very much doubt, from the observations which the motor trade have made to me through the post, whether they support me in this matter, but I think this is a good time to help them to help themselves because many people depend for their livelihood, or will do after the war, on a flourishing motor trade and, through that trade, on our export trade. I also think it would be a good thing if street names were lowered, especially for the benefit of drivers of public service vehicles so that it would not be necessary to use a bright torch to read them.</p>

<p>I do not intend to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield (Mr. Bull) in his very interesting theories concerning the decimal system, a matter which is perhaps a little irrelevant to the discussion

The transport, comfort and safety of the public are undoubtedly of paramount importance, and that was no doubt also exercising the mind of the hon. Member for Swindon (Sir W. Wakefield). I do not know whether I should have said "the hon. and gallant Member," but if I should I apologise for the omission. If that is his objective I think that his speech was not very helpful to that end, and it appeared that he was very confused in his argument. He gave way courteously on several occasions to enable some of us to clear up points, but at the end of his speech I was not at all clear about what he intended to say. In the first place, he said that the Ministry concerned had refused to discuss this matter when it was brought forward by the appropriate authorities and a little later we elucidated that when that memorandum was put in no request was made for an answer to be given to it. It seems difficult to reconcile those two statements. Perhaps there was some very bad staff work. I hope that if the hon. Member had anything to do with that his staff work in Marylebone, for his sake, will be better.<br/>
Now we come to another matter. The hon. Member gave us reasons why there should be increased dimensions in public vehicles, with some of which I was in agreement, but he also admitted at the same time that in order to do this it would be necessary to widen the roads of this country. That would have been all right had he not suggested that, first of all, we should widen public vehicles, that is to say putting the cart before the horse, which would be absurd. Then he went on to tell us why this was so important to the export trade. He did not mention though that road transport conditions in our Dominions and Colonies were often very different from those in this country. In the Dominions they have long wide roads and straight streets in many towns. We to-day have first to consider what are the conditions in this country. I agree that the export trade is very important, indeed, but I do not think we should lose sight of another important factor, namely, the growing death-rate on our roads. Before we proceed to


widen public service vehicles what we ought to do is to tackle our roads. Having done that, the hon. Member's speech, although somewhat confused, would be appropriate. Until that time I would suggest to the Minister that we should put first things first.</p>

<p>I regret that the House and I should have to perform mental acrobratics in changing with great rapidity from one highly technical subject to another, and I regret still further that some of those who were interested in the first part of this Debate are not at present in their places but they will, no doubt, return in time to hear me talk about the second part. I hope these hon. Members will not think, when they read HANSARD, that I am dealing in a perfunctory way with their speeches by not making lengthy or detailed answers co many things which were said about the Railway Control Agreement. I listened to the speeches with the greatest care, but with all respect I think they brought out very few new points about the merits of the Agreement and that it is not an exaggeration to say that they brought out none which has not been dealt with adequately on a previous occasion. I dealt with this matter fairly fully in the Debate on the Adjournment as recently as 1st August last. Nothing that has happened since, none of the public discussion which has taken place&#x2014;and there has been a good deal in the Press&#x2014;has in any way affected the validity of what I then said.<br/>
I will, therefore, try to summarise as briefly as I can the main arguments about the merits of the Railway Agreement. I do not at all accept what was said by the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Rye (Sir G. Courthope), that the Agreement was not accepted as a voluntary Agreement between the parties. He repeated the charge that it was made under duress, with the threat of something worse. That is often said, but no evidence has been produced and it has never been maintained by any responsible person who has dealt with the subject. I would like to repeat again what was said by my predecessor, my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Colonel Llewellin), who is now the Minister of

Food. He said in a Debate in this House in October, 1941, that revision of the original Agreement was required, for reasons which he specified, and went on to say:
<q>I would like to emphasise that the Agreement to revise the former arrangements was a voluntary matter, and not imposed upon the railways."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd October, 1941; Vol. 374; c. 1813.]</q>
I should have thought that that had settled the matter for good and all, but if any further assurance is required I would like to tell the right hon. Gentleman, or any other Member of the House and others who may be interested, that my Noble Friend the Minister of War Transport will be ready to give any further assurances of any kind that are required. I, therefore, hope that this baseless charge will not be made again, either inside or outside this House.<br/>
On the merits of the Agreement and whether it is just or not to the stockholders, I venture to repeat what I have said on several occasions in the House, that His Majesty's Government believe that the Agreement negotiated by my noble Friend, with the help of my right hon. and gallant Friend, now the Minister of Food, is fair and just. I quote again a letter from the Treasury written when Sir Kingsley Wood was Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which it is pointed out that the annual payment "exceeds by a considerable amount the average net revenue of the controlled undertakings in the period immediately before the war." One of my hon. Friends, I think it was my right hon. Friend the Member for Antrim (Sir H. O'Neill), who opened the Debate, spoke of certain London and North-Eastern stocks. He mentioned the &#x00A3;78,000,000 worth of stock which received no dividend under the Agreement. That is true, but a large part of that stock received none for 16 years before the Agreement was made and the rest received no dividend for if years before. Is it really supposed that, because we are in the middle of a war, we have to make an arrangement that will give dividends to people who have not received them for all that time?</p>

<p>Has not that happened in the case of a large number of companies, and have they not been able to pay during the war dividends on stocks which had not received dividends for many years before the war?</p>

<p>I shall be glad to receive from the hon. Baronet any information on that point which he likes to send me. I hope he will also deal with the question of the nature of the stock. I turn to the London &amp; North Eastern 4 per cent. The last year in which it received 4 per cent. was 1929. Including that year, the average for the last 10 years before the war was 1.2 per cent. In five of these years it got no dividend at all. The highest year was 1&#x00BE; per cent. in 1937, while in the three years of this Agreement the average has been 2 7/16 per cent., which is more than twice as much. I venture to think that on the individual stocks, or on the payment as a whole, no case for injustice can be made out.<br/>
One of my hon. Friends raised the question of the Excess Profits Duty. I think it was the hon. Baronet the Member for Tamworth (Sir J. Mellor), who said he hoped I would be more explicit than I was in August. I am in the same difficulty now as I was in in August, namely, that this is primarily the responsibility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and, therefore, I must speak with caution. Broadly, I am in agreement with the admirable speech of the hon. Baronet the Member for South-East St. Pancras (Sir A. Beit). I think it extremely doubtful, as I said in August, whether under any substituted standard the railway companies would do as well as in fact they do under this Agreement. I still hold that a great public service like this, which is of the nature of a monopoly, is in a very different position from an ordinary munitions business. But the real and conclusive answer to the hon. Baronet is that this Agreement was made by the railway companies, and it was voluntarily made. Its purpose was to settle the question of remuneration. It was made for the whole period of control and, therefore, the question of a substituted standard really does not arise.</p>

<p>Has my hon. Friend tried to work out a substituted standard for anything that would be allowed on the basis of the pre-war years? Has he got an answer? I shall be glad to see it,

for I have never seen one yet. I have tried to get one, but I cannot reach any result which leads me to think that he is right and I am wrong.<br/>
I turn to the question of the standard revenue. My right hon. Friend the Member for Antrim recited a number of facts about standard revenue. I do not remember if he said that it had never been earned before the war. I do not remember if he said that it could not be earned and that the Railway Tribunal had examined the matter and had arrived at the conclusion that an increase of charges would not lead to an increase of revenue. He spoke of the competition from road haulage. Of course, that affects the earning capacity of the railways. It is a very important fact, but that does not mean that, because the general economic position of the railways has been changed by new competition, we should allow for that in this Agreement and adjust the matter. I arrive at the conclusion, which I ventured to put forward in August, that the facts are enough to show that my Noble Friend could not possibly take standard revenue as a basis for the Agreement. If he had taken it as a basis, he would have admitted a claim for greatly enhanced profits as a result of the war, a claim which nobody puts forward and which nobody in this House or outside would admit. To that conclusion the Government adhere.<br/>
There is one other point which I did not put in our previous Debate. It relates to the general policy of the Government about transport. During the operation of this Agreement we have been driving traffic off the roads and pushing it on to the railways. By our decisions, we have been cutting down train mileage. We have been increasing very greatly the loading of goods wagons, beyond any standards that existed in time of peace. We have prevented the construction of new motor vehicles. We have prevented the increase of bus services, and abolished coaches. We have virtually prohibited private motoring except for certain purposes. We have cut out cross hauls on the railways. We have cut out clerical and other work which in war conditions could be avoided. We have reduced expenditure in many ways. A vast amount of the additional traffic is military and other Government traffic. The revenue which comes to the Government now


comes out of the traffic which the Government themselves put on the railways. In view of that is it not plain that the Agreement is right? Is not that general background of Government transport policy a matter to which serious consideration must be given when the justice of the remuneration allowed under the Agreement is taken into account? I end this part of what I have to say by repeating that I think the Agreement is fair and just, and by giving an assurance to my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Moelwyn Hughes) that my Noble Friend has no intention of making the changes for which we have been asked.<br/>
Three other points were raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Antrim; of which he was kind enough to give me previous notice. The first relates to abnormal wear and tear. It is common ground that the calls upon the lines and the rolling stock have been heavier than they have ever been in times past. The Government have not been able to allow to the railways all the labour, skilled and unskilled, which the railways needed for maintenance, repairs and new construction. If you cannot keep up with the normal programme of repairs and new construction, the effects inevitably tend to be cumulative. There will, therefore, be arrears of maintenance. That is why the railway Agreement contained Clause 11 which deals with the matter. Among other things, the Clause plainly makes provision for an allowance for abnormal wear and tear of maintainable assets if it is agreed to be justified over and above the basic figure for maintenance. The Minister met the chairmen of the railway companies last summer, and discussed the whole matter with them. He wrote a letter to Lord Royden, Chairman of the Railway Companies Association, on 16th June, and he then said that, while he could not commit himself in any way&#x2014;I must repeat that&#x2014;until the matter had been fully investigated, he was prepared to examine it with the chairmen without delay. My Noble Friend has begun his investigations without delay, but plainly no final arrangements can be made until the period of control is ended. The effects of wear and tear must be surveyed over the period as a whole. Any other plan might be unfair to one side or the other;

we cannot now say which. In my hon. Friend's investigations he is bearing in mind the possibility that some interim or provisional arrangement might be come to, which would be taken into account when, at the end of the period of control, the final settlement is made. I hope that my right hon. Friend will think that that statement gives him, at least, some satisfaction.<br/>
That brings me to his second point, the duration of the control. The Agreement deals with that point also in article 33, which provides that
<q>control will be continued for a minimum period of one year after the cessation of hostilities. Before control comes to an end, that is, before all statutory rights and obligations as they exist at that time apply to the controlled undertakings, time will be given for the operation of any statutory machinery governing the level of charges.</q>
On that text, two questions arise. First, as my right hon. Friend asked, what is meant by the "cessation of hostilities"? When the Agreement was made it was not contemplated&#x2014;at least, it was not certain&#x2014;that there would be two wars, although it was contemplated by farseeing persons on all sides of the House, including, I humbly submit, myself. The phrase "cessation of hostilities" occurs in a great many other official documents, Acts of Parliament and agreements of all kinds, and it will be necessary for the Government to make a general ruling as to what is intended to be understood by the phrase. I have no doubt that that general ruling will govern this particular case, and it is clearly impossible, and it would not be proper, for me to attempt to speak with authority on that point to-day. Perhaps, however, I may say this. The Agreement lays down a minimum period for which the control is due to last. Under these terms the period must be at least one year after the termination of hostilities. It may be more but it cannot be less. None of us can forsee the future and anything may happen, but if I had to make a guess, I think I should guess that the control is likely to go on, with the general agreement of all concerned, longer than one year after the cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>May I remind my hon. Friend that after the last war, in the interests of all concerned, control was continued for nearly three years?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-12-21a.2043.0" hansard_membership_id="9813" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18920" speakername="Mr. Noel-Baker" colnum="2043" time="">
<p>That is true, and what my hon. Friend says is reinforced by the special technical reasons which arise under article 33. Under that article, as I read it, time must be given to the Railway Rates Tribunal to operate the statutory machinery, to look at the probable level of traffic which there will be under post-war conditions, and then to proceed to fix the charges which they think should then be made. That might mean an increase in charges; it might even mean a decrease. In any case, it is extremely unlikely that the process can be fulfilled within a single year. For that reason, and for the other general reasons to which my hon. Friend has referred, I should say, if I had to make a guess, that control is more likely to last two years than one year after the end of the war. I think that, if that were done, it would be done with the full agreement of the railway companies. In any case, it is a point on which we can hope for friendly discussion with the railway companies at any time they like.<br/>
The probable duration of the Agreement has an obvious bearing on the third point put to me in his letter by my right hon. Friend, whether there has been any further decision on general policy concerning the future of inland transport. My right hon. Friend said that in the arrangement made we ought to include both road and rail, and that, unless some arrangements were made for co-ordinating and, as I understood him, for eliminating the competition, or controlling the competition, between road and rail, the future must be dark and difficult for all concerned. He said he hoped we should have prosperous concerns, standing on their own feet.<br/>
I think there is general agreement that we cannot, in inland transport, whether on the roads, railways or waterways, go back to the conditions of 1939. I do not think anybody wants to do so, but as to definite, final decisions of general policy, I must frankly say to the House that my Noble Friend has not yet been able to make them. He has, as the House knows, a very heavy operational task. He is pushing on with the technical study of the re-organisation of inland transport which will certainly be required after the war. But he has not yet been able to make, in spite of the discussions he has had and the studies he has made, new decisions which I can now announce to my right hon. Friend, or to the House. 
I turn now to the second subject which has been raised, namely, the Regulations concerning new road vehicles. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Swindon (Sir W. Wakefield) made it very plain that a grievance is felt in some quarters&#x2014;if in none other, then certainly by himself&#x2014;about the way in which this matter has been dealt with by my Noble Friend and the Ministry which he controls. [<i>Interruption</i>.] I hope I shall satisfy all the critics, including the hon. Lady. I think the hon. Lady herself said, in the Question on the Paper, that the Ministry had taken a very long time to reach a decision, that it had not consulted the proper people&#x2014;indeed, perhaps, had not consulted anybody, I do not quite remember&#x2014;and that the decision which was taken neglects very important interests relating to the development of our export trade; and my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Swindon said that my Department had gravely failed to do its duty. He will forgive me if I say that I resent the charges which he made, and, when I have explained the facts, I hope he will withdraw them.<br/>
I will begin by stating the history of what occurred. Last November, the 5th, as he said&#x2014;I do not know whether there is any significance in that&#x2014;we received a letter from five organisations, the A.R.O., the C.M.U.A., the Municipal Passenger Transport Association, the Public Transport Association and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. They sent us a request in general terms for the revision of Regulations for the post-war period relating to public passenger vehicles. We did not take immediate action on that request for two reasons, first, because, with all our optimism, we did not feel, in November, 1943, that the war was as yet very near its end. We thought we still had time. Events have proved that we were all too right. In the second place, we expected&#x2014;and, as I shall again show, with reason&#x2014;that other similar requests might be received from other organisations, and, therefore, we waited for a little while before we made a move.<br/>
But, in February, we did ask these five organisations, who sent us the original memorandum, to send a full statement of what they wanted, and the reasons on which their requests were based. We asked them to put everything they had to say on paper. They did so.


Their reply came in April, and we thought that they had put forward all their reasons with the precision and the clarity which such great organisations would normally have used. We thought there was no obscure point in the memorandum at all, that we understood exactly what they wanted, and exactly why they wanted it. They ended their memorandum with the words:
<q>In conclusion, the five organisations would repeat that they are prepared to appoint a deputation to meet officials at the Ministry of War Transport to discuss the matters dealt with in this Memorandum.</q>
We did not think there was anything we needed to discuss. We understood it. If they wanted to discuss with us on any point, it was open to them, at any time, to make a request either to officials, or to my Noble Friend or to myself. Any one of us would have been delighted to meet any of them for discussion for as long as they desired. We never heard another word until the decision had been made.<br/>
We did not answer the memorandum immediately. Why not? Because, again, we expected, and as I shall show, with reason, that further requests would in fact come in. So we waited till June. In June, we decided that no more requests were coming in, not, at any rate, at that stage, so we then proceeded to apply the provisions of the Road Traffic Act of 1930, by which we are bound. That Act obliges the Minister, when he is drawing up Regulations&#x2014;and, of course, that means making changes in Regulations which already exist&#x2014;to consult representative organisations whom he thinks it desirable to consult. That is a statutory obligation. The Minister, and his predecessors, have always interpreted that obligation very widely. In consequence, he communicated with organisations varying in character from the Home Office to the Pedestrians' Association, from the Regional Transport Commissioners to the Standing Joint Committee of the A.A., the R.A.C. and R.S.A.C. and the Road Transport Organisation Joint Conference, Half a page of them. My hon. and gallant Friend asked whom we consulted. We consulted all of them.</p>

On 20th November he made his decision and communicated it to those who had submitted the original Memorandum.

<p>It has been my experience that people are not very backward in asking for deputations when they want them. I would not like to say how many I have a week, but it is a considerable number. These organisations said they were
<q>prepared to appoint a deputation.</q>
They did not ask for it, and we did not think it was necessary, because we understood every single point that was made in their Memorandum.<br/>
Now let me come to the merits of the requests which were made by those five organisations and with which my Noble Friend has had to deal. There were four and they related to the length, width, height, and weight of road passenger transport vehicles. My hon. Friend only dealt with two of the four and he skated very lightly over the remaining two. I will tell the House why; because my Noble Friend agreed to the requests which were put forward with regard to height and weight. He accepted the requests that the height of single-decker vehicles should be increased from 10 ft. 6 in. to 15 ft. and that the weight should be increased from 12&#x00BD; tons to 14 tons, with certain technical elaborations. Therefore, 50 per cent. of those demands had been accepted.</p>

<p>I do not think we can fight the next General Election on this occasion. I only mention that we accepted two out of four of the requests which were put forward, and I think my hon. and gallant Friend would have acted more fairly if he had mentioned it too. I come to the other two requests, and, first of all, to the request in respect of length. They wanted the permitted length of buses to be increased from 26&#x00BD; ft. to 30 ft. for four-wheeled, two-axle vehicles. Let me deal for one moment with the point which my hon. Friend made about the three-axle vehicles, the vehicles with six wheels. He said that we had of course permitted 30 ft. for three-axle vehicles, and that nobody but a civil servant could have thought out the ingenious plan of allowing that while refusing 30 ft. two-axle vehicles. In fact, the relaxation was made because it was desired, at that time, for military reasons, to increase the production of three-axle vehicles. The thing was very closely watched, and in London those vehicles were restricted to certain routes. If the numbers had been greatly increased for normal civilian passenger traffic we should have had to control the whole thing, and, quite probably, we should have had to stop that relaxation altogether. There was a perfectly good reason, and the policy was justified in full.<br/>
What would happen if we increased from 26&#x00BD; ft. to 30 ft. the permitted length of all public service passenger vehicles? On what ground is the request made? It is not made for the comfort of the passenger, not at all. It is not made to meet the needs of the conductors. The trade unions are all unanimously and vehemently against it. It is made to increase the pay-load, and to add to the number of passengers which can be taken by a single vehicle.</p>

<p>Would not that be of considerable assistance in avoiding the congestion, which was one of the reasons for not allowing these vehicles on the road?</p>

<p>Not in the view of those who have to deal with the traffic, the highway authorities and the police. On the contrary; the great weight of opinion of those whom we have consulted


takes the view that it would increase congestion and would add to road accidents. Consider, if every bus that travels London were 30 ft., what would happen in the big congestions, for example, in Piccadilly or around Piccadilly Circus. What would happen when the buses with the three extra foot swing round a sharp corner and when they come to a narrow place to turn at the end of their routes? All those are very important considerations to which we are bound to give attention. The overwhelming weight of opinion of those whom we consulted was against this change. If Parliament in 1930, when it passed the Road Traffic Act, intended Ministers to consult those people it must also have intended that Ministers should take a little notice of what they said.</p>

<p>I think my hon. Friend will agree that they greatly add to the congestion when they pass, and that war-time traffic is on a far smaller scale than peace-time traffic. I should not have liked to see a "Queen Mary" going down Piccadilly in the days of peace.<br/>
In regard to the request for greater width, I think the proposers made out a much stronger case than that concerning length. This proposal is one which affects the comfort of the passengers. In spite of what my hon. Friend says&#x2014;and it has all been subject to very close technical examination&#x2014;I understand that six inches extra width inside the bus would make a real difference. At present the seating allowance for each passenger in a bus is 16 inches. The average width of the passengers, at the relevant part of their anatomy, is 18 inches. Therefore it is evident that there must be an eight inch overlap into the corridor, which is already far too small. I think it is plain that to seated passengers, to standing passengers, and to conductors, the extra six inches would be of value. I admit it. It is also true that this would be of advantage for the export trade. We discussed the matter with my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of

Trade, and he has told us that in his view and so far as it goes the change would be to the advantage of the manufacturers in the export market. My Noble Friend has taken very full account of these representations in making the decisions he has announced. But he has decided that all the same he must reject the request, and he has done so on what seem to me to be very strong general grounds indeed.<br/>
Broadly, the case is this: Our roads both in town and country have been designed for vehicles not wider than seven foot six inches overall. Many thousands of miles of our roads in town and country&#x2014;I have got a great deal of detail from our Divisional Road Engineers, but I will not weary the House with it&#x2014;would be much less adequate for their job if there were a six inch increase in each of the vehicles which go along them. If every vehicle at Piccadilly Circus were six inches wider it would be a serious matter by the time one got across to the other side of the road. In many country roads two vehicles eight feet wide would have much greater difficulty in passing without collision, than they have to-day. My hon. and Gallant Friend says, "Widen the roads." I agree with the hon. Member who spoke last, who said we had better widen the roads before we widen the vehicles.</p>

<p>I wish to meet my Scottish Friend's desire to get on with that Debate, but I have had a great number of matters put to me, some of which I did not expect, and as they are important, not only to my Ministry but to a very large public, I thought it was right for me to deal with them as adequately as I could. But I will now bring my


remarks to a conclusion. I think that the highway authorities, the police authorities and the others who urge that a widening of vehicles would cause increased congestion and would increase the number of accidents, have reason on their side.</p>

<p>I think I probably travel in buses as often as my hon. and gallant Friend. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Springburn (Mrs. Hardie) private cars are not seven foot six wide, and I have never heard of any manufacturer who asked leave to increase them to a greater width than that.</p>

<p>My point is that private cars cause congestion on the roads more than the buses do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-12-21a.2051.4" hansard_membership_id="9813" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18920" speakername="Mr. Noel-Baker" colnum="2051" time="">
<p>That is certainly true, and private cars are relevant to the discussion in another way which I shall mention. The decision was made by my Minister on a request relating to omnibuses alone, and I think I have satisfied the House that he was right. But as we expected, no sooner was the decision made than an organisation known as the British Transport Vehicle Manufacturers' Association came forward, at the beginning of December, with a demand that this should be given to all heavy vehicles including lorries. If my Noble Friend was right in relation to buses alone he is surely trebly right when the demand is made for an enormously increased number of vehicles. The hon. Member said that there were in the country many vehicles 8 feet wide, and that they are doing very well. There are 81 such passenger vehicles, mostly working in restricted areas under conditions of far less traffic than normal. If the hon. Member is quoting American vehicles, he must also admit that certain difficulties have arisen.<br/>
He also said we were doing irreparable damage to the export trade. But it was in the private car trade that our manufacturers did so badly in the world markets

before the war, and that trade is quite unaffected by this decision. In passenger and goods vehicles our manufacturers did incomparably better in the way of overseas markets. In their own memorandum they said to us that they were building up "a most valuable overseas market" before 1939. I think they may still have hopes of an overseas market, in spite of the decision my Noble Friend has made.</p>

<p>This is very important. Does not the Parliamentary Secretary realise that American competition in this field will be very much greater, and it will be a good deal more difficult for our manufacturers, handicapped as they will be, to meet this competition? That is the whole substance of bringing forward this export trade difficulty.</p>

<p>Of course I have realised that. I have said that other things being equal this concession would be an advantage to the exporter, but other things are not equal. I say that, in spite of the Regulations the export trade will probably go on.<br/>
In reply to the hon. Member for Enfield (Mr. Bull) I would say, on right hand drive, that I agree with him about the attitude of the motor manufacturers. The change might help their exports, but they have made no request, and there is nothing else that I can say.</p>

<p>I wish to raise on this, the last day on which we shall meet this year, a question which I am perfectly certain my Scottish colleagues agree with me in regarding as not an important one. I make no apology of raising with the Secretary of State for Scotland to-day the question of Scottish housing. In these days one is apt, and possibly quite rightly so, not to give the same care and attention to domestic problems that would be given in a normal peace-time Parliament. Issues of war and peace are always with us, and because of their importance they outweigh our domestic issues. I wish to say at the outset that I doubt very much, speaking for Scotland as a whole, whether there is any issue, even in some respects the gravest issue of the war, rivalling in importance to the Scottish people the question of the provision of housing accommodation. Let any hon. Member go where he likes in Scotland. Let him discuss, if he cares, international policy, the treatment of Germany&#x2014;all things that may be terribly important, and issues which played a dominating part in the election which followed the last war. But whether it be an industrial city or a country district he will find that to the Scottish people the dominating issue, the most appealing issue, is the issue of the housing situation in that country<br/>
I want to say a word or two about the background of the problem. I may be accused of repeating what is known, but in this Debate we have to make an appeal, not merely to the Scottish Members but to the larger part of Britain, to understand our situation; to make them realise why we feel so deeply about it, why we feel so bitter about it, why we ask for special treatment. Broadly speaking, among Scottish Members there is no difference of opinion about the clamant need. In Glasgow alone the need now is for at least 100,000 houses. When one recognises that to-day in the city of Glasgow, more than half the population&#x2014;one citizen out of every two&#x2014;has no lavatory accommodation but what he shares with other people&#x2014;usually with four or five other families&#x2014;and no bathroom accommodation, the position can be understood. Most of the families in our great cities, except for those who have been fortunate enough to get into municipal houses, bring

their children up to manhood without knowing the luxury and decency of having a bath at home. Consider our tenement dwellings; consider that in our cities, and in our towns and mining villages, and indeed in our agricultural areas, the single-apartment house abounds&#x2014;one small place, without a lavatory, for a man to house his wife and family.<br/>
I am not going to quote a lot of cases to-day, but one of the things which remains in my mind is an experience of my brother during the last war. He was in the Navy. He had a single apartment for himself, his wife, and two children. When he was at sea, one child died, and in that little apartment his wife, for three days, was shifting the body from the bed to the floor, and from the floor to the table. The woman and the other child had to live with the dead body for three days. That was not in a slum; it was in a good district&#x2014;God knows what happens in the slum districts.<br/>
I am serving on a Committee dealing with rents. When my colleagues were in the City of Glasgow I took them along a street called George Street, within three minutes' walk of our great City Chambers, to view our housing. One man who fought in the last war said that the horrors of that war were not any greater than the horrors of those housing conditions. That is the background, and it is growing steadily worse. Bear in mind, whatever may be said about the English problem and how we were able to grapple with it before 1939, that in Scotland our house-building, before 1939, was making little inroad. All that was being done was to keep up with what was passing out of use. There was little or no provision for modern needs. Five years of war have passed, with little or no new construction sanctioned, and the situation grows steadily worse. Every Member of Parliament ought to feel proud and happy when he goes to his Parliamentary division. I do not know if I am different from others, but when I walk down the streets of my division, I almost feel that the people are shrieking at me, wanting to know when they are going to get houses to live in.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Scotland must face the issue. It is not enough for him to say, "We are faced with a war, and with labour shortage." I say, frankly, to him that no man who ever occupied his office has received from the


House of Commons or from his Scottish colleagues the indulgence, almost kindness, that he has received. He has been treated to hardly a harsh term or hostile word. It is not like the old days, when he and I both sat in Opposition, almost tearing Secretaries of State limb from limb, in a political sense. He is favoured as few men have been. One reads of such Members as the hon. and gallant Member for Argyll (Major McCallum) pleading with him to reconsider his decision not to fight his seat again, one reads of the benevolence shown by almost everyone in the Conservative Party about his future welfare; and one reads how the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan), in the Scottish Debate a year or so ago, was almost fulsome in his praise. Those of us who dare even to look the wrong way at him, are looked at askance by our Scottish colleagues. That will not save him, despite his popularity, despite even the backing of the Press&#x2014;although that backing is not too sure now, because the "Glasgow Herald" the other day, in a leading article, made a powerful plea for something more than has been done for Scottish housing&#x2014;despite all I say to him, and despite what my colleagues may say and feel, despite all our niceness to him. Indeed, if this situation goes on, it will not save any of us.<br/>
The situation is ghastly, and something has to be done. The Secretary of State answered a Question the other day by the hon. Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil), which I apologise to the hon. Member for using. His answer showed how lamentable the position is. The hon. Member for Greenock asked how many houses have been built and occupied out of a programme of several hundred which were sanctioned for the beginning of 1943. Since then the whole of 1943 and 1944 has gone. Not 300 houses have been built and occupied&#x2014;250 is the total. That is the total production after all this time. It is true that he mentioned, what I feel terribly, the flying-bomb attack on London; but, at the worst, the flying-bomb attack began only a few months ago. The right hon. Gentleman may produce other houses, and I am not going to take part to-day in a miserable quarrel as to whether he is right or the local authorities are right. I am not going to be the arbiter. All I know is that Scot-

land is not getting what it needs. If the local authorities are also to blame, the right hon. Gentleman must shoulder that responsibility, and come to the House and tell us. You get a situation in Glasgow, in which a miserable correspondence takes place about the right of two or three tradesmen to build a house. The Corporation writes letters to the Secretary of State for Scotland and there are consultations with other Ministries&#x2014;a miserable correspondence without any relevance to the situation.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Scotland may say "What would you do?" Frankly, I am not too inclined to answer that question. After all, I am only a back bencher, I have never been entrusted with a trip abroad, but have only been entrusted with miserable committees, on which I am always having to fight. I once asked permission for my wife to go to Northern Ireland, and even that could not be granted. I do not know therefore that it is my responsibility, but I will try to answer the question if I may. What should be done? Two things need to be done now. One is to plan for the housing situation to-day, and the other is to plan to deal with it in the period immediately following the peace. What would I do now? I do not know if it is the job of the Secretary of State, but, first of all, I would say that priority No. 1 for labour, ranking with the most urgent public and Government work, should be house construction. As regards the transfer of boys, I say to the Secretary of State that I would put house-building in the same relation as the coalmines to the recruitment of labour. That is what I would make priority No. 1 now.<br/>
We are hearing a lot, and having deputations, about redundant workers in factories. Let me make this clear beyond a shadow of doubt. I would not make one shell more in this country than the country needs merely in order to keep men in work. Let us be frank about it. I would not keep a factory open merely to make shells. If redundant factories are being closed, even for a temporary period, even for a week, a month, or two months, during that period of redundancy transfers of labour ought to be made to the building of houses and articles required for the building of houses. If it is said that it is difficult, what happened to the difficulties in the war, the changes in shipbuilding and the transfer of men


backwards and forwards every day? Surely it can be done here? If my information is correct&#x2014;and it has been published in a West of Scotland newspaper&#x2014;one factory, in three months, has had 4,000 workers declared redundant. I say to the Secretary of State that he should lay claim to whatever labour he can get from that source for the purpose of building houses.<br/>
One other factor is that, for good or ill, men are returning home from the Forces. I think immediately of housing, and I say that every key-man in house building ought to be brought back as soon as possible to this country. He is valuable, apart from his own production and labour, because I want to see a great intensification of apprentice labour in the industry.<br/>
I speak of Glasgow because I know it best. Glasgow gets sanction for 300 houses, and, within a week or two, is given sanction for 400 or 500 more. What is this idea of the miserable parcelling out of little numbers of houses like this? As a matter of fact, there ought to be no limit to what Glasgow should build, even during the war. The Secretary of State should say to Glasgow, "I am placing no limit on you. If you can get materials and men, go on and build as many as you like." That is what the situation should be, but the right hon. Gentleman merely parcels out the houses in small numbers, and what happens? In house building certain classes of the work come to an end sooner than others. One man's job ends quicker than another's. If the man knows that there are only 300 to be built he does not hurry. He knows what is coming. In house building, of all occupations, you ought to be saying to the non-employed that there is another job ready to take its place as soon as the one is finished, and, in addition to that, you should always have a constant stream of houses to be built, ready for the transfer of men from one place to another, as their work finishes. This miserable parcelling out is no help to the situation.<br/>
I would say to the Secretary of State that, apart from better organisation and greater mechanisation of the industry, the two over-riding things in house building are labour and materials. I am going to ask the right hon. Gentleman what is being done now in Scotland to provide a greater pool of materials than

there is there now. Everyone knows in Scotland that the pre-1939 industry could not turn out the houses required, What is being done to increase the pool of materials? It is no use us discussing here how it is to be done unless we have some idea what is to be done to increase both the pool of labour and that of materials. What steps are being taken now by the right hon. Gentleman? Have there been any negotiations, and at what stage is he going to increase that pool? What effort is being made to release materials?<br/>
What I am about to say may anger people. I am as fond of the good things of life as ever a man could be, if I can get them. I have never got very many and I am envious of others who do. I see that shiploads of oranges are coming over. I am not against them coming over but with the Scottish housing situation as it is every available ton of shipping space should be used for the importation of timber for the building of houses.</p>

<p>The few oranges that working class children will get will make very little difference to them. As far as Scotland is concerned, the first thing to do is to get the material required for building houses. Nothing else can compare with that. I am not against temporary houses and I think that the right hon. Gentleman the Minister of Works&#x2014;whom I am pleased to see present at this Debate&#x2014;helped to kill the Portal business. This was said to be a quick, easy way of getting houses and we thought that within a few weeks of the end of hostilities these houses would have been put up. None of us was very anxious about them, but the situation with regard to Scotland is becoming so serious that, although I do not want to see housing standards lowered, standards hardly matter. I would have taken on the Portal house, though not because I liked it. I knew that if it came to Scotland it would not be a temporary but a permanent house, but I had to accept it because the public made me, but even that is not to come now. We have been told that by the end of 12 months some of these houses might be built.<br/>
The Glasgow Corporation are going to carry out an experiment for the building of what are called foam-slag houses. They have asked for permission to erect a small factory and that permission has now been granted. The building of that factory ought to be a matter of urgency. If it had been required for the making of shells it would have been built within a week. The same urgency in the building of this factory should be shown now. I do not mind even temporary houses. I see that the Glasgow Corporation have produced a memorandum in which it is stated that a committee is to consider what open spaces or parts of the town can be used in connection with the erection of temporary houses. I think that, in that connection, something more might be done.<br/>
Just before the war they had one of the most stupid and useless things in that city called an Empire Exhibition, which occupied Bellahouston Park for years. It was one of the greatest wastages of public money of which I have ever heard in spite of what has been said by the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) and one or two others. It served little useful purpose. Surely to goodness if they could hand over one of the public parks for a stupid and useless venture like that, the same public park could be used in connection with the temporary housing of the people. The challenge to start building houses now is with the Secretary of State for Scotland. I am told that the war is in a serious stage, and I do not deny that fact. The war is with us and, like the river, it goes on. We cannot stop it, but some day a climax will be reached. But there is no man in Scotland who does not know that, if this housing position continues, its effect on the morale of the troops will be serious. The Government cannot afford to neglect it. The most pleading letters in one's postbag are from men in the Army pleading for homes in which to live after the war. I have sent one of the cruellest cases I have received to the Under-Secretary, who has acknowledged it with his usual courtesy. He is always courteous and so is the Secretary of State, and that is a thing which makes it difficult. In unessential things, they are kind; it is only when you ask for essentials that they say "No." This poor chap was in a military hospital, having lost an arm and a leg in Italy.

He is the father of three children and they all live in a single apartment, three storeys up, in the City of Glasgow.</p>

<p>This man minus one leg and one arm has to live in a single apartment and has to go up three storeys. He is more a prisoner there, than he would be in the hands of the Japanese. That is the sort of thing to which men are coming back. Their morale is being undermined. You have to do something; you have to do more than you are doing. It is no good saying that the Minister of Labour or some other Minister is to blame. There is only one Minister to blame, if blame has to be allocated. There the right hon. Gentleman sits. He is our Parliamentary representative; under our Parliamentary constitution, he is answerable. It is not for us to say anything about others. If others are to blame, he has a constitutional duty to perform. He must undertake it and I hold him responsible in these dark days. It is hard for those of us who live in the great miserable parts of the city. We have read of a miserable ballet written about Gorbals and how we live produced at a West End theatre. May I in conclusion say this. We have our faults and we have our failures but to-day in France, in Burma, in Italy, these folks are there with the others. If Scotland is worth anything, if this House of Commons is worth anything, it will not be judged in the future years by our victories abroad or even in war. The permanent test will be how happy and how decent we make the home lives of our people.</p>

<p>I am sure that the House has listened, as it always does, with the greatest sympathy and attention to the case presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) because he speaks of that which he knows and of his own city and his own country. It is a city which is well known throughout the world, and which, in spite of its grime, and in spite of its dirt, and in spite of its black furious quarrels, is very dear to those of us who, like myself, were brought up there and spent nearly all our lives there. But the case which is put to-day is not, of course, a case purely about Glasgow or purely about the West


of Scotland, and I and hon. Members from other parts of the country wish to put forward their claims. Therefore, I will do my best to limit what I have to say, although I do not think anyone could have wished the speech of the hon. Member for Gorbals to be shorter, short as is the time before us.<br/>
Since the Minister of Works is here and the Under-Secretary, who has spent so much time in the work of building, both practically and in theory&#x2014;I would like to put to him one or two figures about the relative position of Scotland. Of course, those who are presented with the immediate problem of bombed London must feel that that takes a precedence from which there can be no escape, that the immediate damage of the destroyed cities in England, and more particularly the capital, far transcends the need for housing in Glasgow and in Scotland generally. I would like the Minister simply to consider this single figure&#x2014;if I can have his attention for a moment&#x2014;that if we compare the worst position in England with the position in Scotland, it will be seen how infinitely worse is the Scottish position than even those parts of England which suffered under the industrial revolution and which are bywords for slums. Take the great city of Liverpool, or places which have laboured long under a heavy depression, such as the county of Durham. To take the simple test a overcrowding, in Liverpool 7.4 per cent. of the houses are overcrowded according to the English standard; the percentage in Glasgow is 30 per cent.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, the last year for which we can get figures. Take the county of Durham, which is a colliery county, poor, and suffering very heavily from depression; the figure of overcrowding there is 12 per cent. The figure for the county of Lanark, similar in size and population and in industries, is 37 per cent.&#x2014;three times as bad. That is the background from which we start, and I think that when a plea is being made that special attention should be given to the problem of Scottish housing, both in the allocation of labour and in the allocation of materials, we should say that even despite the great bomb damage in England, there are many ways in which the

Scottish housing situation, even without so much bomb damage, compares still very unfavourably with the position of England as a whole.<br/>
There is, of course, a very serious war situation, and nobody would suggest at the moment that you could diminish the Fighting Forces. I do not suggest that a comb-out of the Fighting Forces should be made, for this reason, that since the war began, a house in Britain has been destroyed or seriously damaged every half minute from September, 1939, until now, counting in the "phoney" war, counting in the absence of blitz over many parts&#x2014;every 30 seconds from the beginning of the war until now a house has been destroyed or gravely damaged and, what is more, every half minute that the war goes on, that average may go on too. We shall never build houses as fast as that, and the first business of the Government must be to advance the end of the war. Just before the war broke out I said&#x2014;and I remember people quarrelling with me then&#x2014;that if the war came, it would make grave inroads upon the standard of living of the people of this country. That prophecy did not receive any very favourable reception anywhere, either in my own party or in the party of the right hon. Gentleman opposite. But it is true, terribly true, and the first necessity is to do everything we can to shorten the period over which that enormous wastage and destruction are going on, because no scheme of building that we can possibly plan will compare with the rate of destruction that the war is able to inflict upon the social standards and the amenities of our people.<br/>
But, having said that, then one must say that the position in Scotland is not a position which can be allowed to remain where it is. This is the sixth winter of the war and this winter is at the turn of the year. You cannot build any more for this winter. What I am worrying about is next winter. What we live in next winter will be what we build next summer. That certainly means that we shall have a very big problem before us in the allocation of manpower and materials during that time. Like the hon. Member for Gorbals, I am certainly not going into an argument between one local authority and this House. Certainly I have no reason whatever to tolerate the proposals which the Glasgow Corporation has made for dealing with this problem,


and I shall have no mercy upon them when it comes to be argued in the City of Glasgow or in meeting-places up and down the streets there. I think that the programme brought forward is paltry. I think that a programme of 5,000 houses a year with 30,000 suitable people clamouring for houses now, is a mockery to put before the people of this country. However, I think that the time for arguing that will be later, and in its proper place.<br/>
I say to the Secretary of State for Scotland that he has great administrative powers not merely over the recommendations of the normal programmes but over abnormal programmes. He has the Special Housing Association and it is supposed to be within its programme to build 100,000 houses. If it is a matter of persuasion and desire, if he has to ask, "Will you take some of these houses; will you give us sites on which to put them down?" people should not be asked to listen-in to a discussion of that nature. Glasgow has asked for 2,500 of these steel houses, yet there are 30,000 fit and suitable tenants for these houses, people with small families, newly married people. Ten thousand such houses would not be at all an unreasonable requisition to make in such case. Ten thousand houses would be something, and we show, at any rate, that the local authority were thinking big, thinking of something worth while. If the local authority does not make such an indent I think the Secretary of State must, and put those houses under the Special Housing Association, whether the local authority are concerned with the matter or not.<br/>
The hon. Member for Gorbals said, as was said by Members in the Debate on the English housing situation recently, that the question of the provision of steel houses had been killed by the suggestion that none would be provided until a certain number of months after the end of the war. The reason for that surely is that at the present moment there is an outpouring of shells and guns and steel plant of one kind and another, the potential of which will not become available till the end of the war and which cannot be used in any other way and which could be used for priority No. 1 which, as we all agree, is housing. Everything that can be got to reduce the terrible shortage of houses in Scotland should be used. Having been given the great weapon of the

Special Housing Association it is the business of the Secretary of State to ensure that it is used to the full whether a local authority says, "Aye," or, "No." The hon. Member for Gorbals rightly said that people would look to us here to see whether we have made adequate provision. If we say that we have refrained because of the <i>amour propre</i> of a local authority they will at first break into roars of laughter which will turn into a storm of curses.<br/>
These Debates tend to turn on the question of the long-term position. I am not so anxious about that because, frankly, we cannot see the long-term position. Yet the necessity for preparing and servicing every site we can in Scotland is very strong. There is at present an actual surplus of labour available for servicing sites in Scotland, which is not all being used by local authorities. That is a reproach; it is very nearly a scandal. I suggest that under the auspices of the Special Housing Association it might be possible to arrange an auxiliary servicing programme which could be used to take up a temporary slack which will not last for ever but which will be available, for a short time, and to deal with any area in Scotland where servicing is required. Servicing should go on whatever happens. It should never be possible for the Secretary of State, or anyone else, to say that there is a man available in Scotland at the present moment not being used to trench and prepare a site for a house. Let us hope that we shall be able greatly to enlarge the head of material that can be turned to the task of erecting houses on these serviced sites as soon as we can rid our hands of the very heavy commitments and mortgages of the war.<br/>
The hon. Member for Gorbals also spoke of the labour position and of the necessity of dealing with this matter as though it were a war problem, with which we all agree, in matters such as the extension of skilled labour which could be utilised for the purposes of construction. In the last Debate on housing the hon. Member used the word, "dilution." On that, the Secretary of State, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works and right hon. Gentlemen and hon. Gentlemen opposite, are in the position of peculiar strength. They can bring forward proposals for dilution without the suspicion which would attach to them if


they were put forward by Members of other parties. There is a long history of industrial quarrel in Scotland and such proposals are looked on with frowns and suspicions. I did my best, as Secretary of State, to enlarge the labour potential which could handle these programmes, but I did not succeed. Here is a chance.<br/>
I have seen from the Press that the Secretary of State brought forward proposals that some use might be made of the skilled labour which is available in Scotland to-day, to deal with this problem on an auxiliary, a part-time basis, as a war emergency. This method has been used in Russia, and elsewhere, where great damage has taken place. In Greenock it has been proposed that skilled craftsmen&#x2014;and many workers in that town are skilled in crafts analogous to the building crafts&#x2014;could be utilised for the purpose of additional housing and be allowed to utilise their skill in those functions. What has happened about that? I would like the Secretary of State to give us an answer. Is there any prospect of that experiment being carried to a successful conclusion? I read that stormy arguments have taken place between my right hon. Friend and some of the authorities. The Secretary of State, as I remember in the old days, when he sat on the opposite side of the House, has a very rough side to his tongue, like any true Scotsman, and his powers of invective are as powerful as those of any of his formidable colleagues from the Clyde. I have suffered under the lash of all of them, and I am well acquainted with his power. The Press says that there was a stormy debate. But what was the result of that stormy debate? Have any auxiliary staff at all been put on to the great task of housing in areas like Greenock which are not merely short of houses, but which have suffered a great deal of bomb damage?<br/>
In conclusion, I would first urge my right hon. Friend to use his utmost endeavours to press the claims of Scotland in every possible way both for labour, material and any share of prefabricated houses that may be obtained. Such houses might be obtained in Europe or America. For instance, the Kaiser shipyards in California, the first of which was built, incidentally, by British money, are surrounded by a township holding at one time 90,000 people, nearly all of whom were housed in prefabricated houses.

Surely it might be possible to obtain a supply of prefabricated houses from there and elsewhere. Certainly, the need for prefabricated houses for the shipyards of Scotland, as well as other houses, is as great in Scotland as in any other part of the world where such houses have been erected.<br/>
Let me assure my right hon. Friend that he will have the unanimous and vociferous support of his colleagues in Scotland in any demand or request he makes upon the pool of labour or of material which is available. Secondly, I urge that we should not run a mile race as if it was a 100 yards race. This is the sixth winter of the war and next winter, whenever the conclusion of the war may be, will be the seventh under war conditions. A seven years war is a long war and you cannot run it on the basis of a sprint. Thirdly, I hope it will be possible for him to continue to press upon all concerned the present urgent need for some relaxation of the conditions under which the great peace-time organisation of labour was accustomed to operate and lastly, to say to local authorities that the House of Commons is deeply dissatisfied with the present position. In so far as local authorities can tackle it the House of Commons says "Go on, we put the responsibility on you." But also, you, the Secretary of State, must help and you must take a share in doing this yourself.<br/>
All these things are subject to the over-riding consideration of not weakening the Armed Forces or diminishing the number of men in the field&#x2014;on this day of all, when we are told that girls have to be called up for service overseas. I will certainly be no party to calling up a girl of 21, sending her to France and bringing a soldier out of the line to weaken on balance the war effort, because every 30 seconds a house is being destroyed or seriously damaged since the war began. On all these grounds, our task is to make the utmost use of all available resources, and we look to the Secretary of State to see that a fair and adequate share is directed towards the country of which he is the Parliamentary representative.</p>

<p>No one will differ from the burden of the argument


that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman has made, but I do not think we could accept his premise that you will necessarily lengthen the war by taking men from the Services. It is surely plain that we have reached a stage at which production of the essentials for making war is being impaired by the appalling housing conditions. The right hon. and gallant Gentleman said that next winter we should be in the seventh year of the war and that we could not continue sprinting for seven years. He might have added that we have been extremely fortunate in the matter of the weather in the last four winters, and extremely fortunate that we have not had epidemic conditions in any part of the country. If we did have them, in the gross overcrowding which we know in the West of Scotland it would be a dreadful blow at our war effort. When we plead that men should be withdrawn from the Forces for this essential job, we, too, are thinking of the most effective way of shortening the war.<br/>
Could the Secretary of State tell us how far the allotment of temporary houses which he made some five or six weeks ago to local authorities is affected by the later statements that we have had in relation to Portal houses? It is incomprehensible to me that the right hon. Gentleman should have made these allocations and that within five weeks another Member of the Government should tell us that the Portal houses are right out of the reckoning. It is difficult to understand how, in such a short time, such a big difference could have taken place. There are, I know, five other varieties of temporary houses. I hope we may be told when, and in what proportion, we must expect these temporary houses to be delivered to local authorities.<br/>
Secondly, can we be told how the servicing of sites is going along? My right hon. Friend last Spring stimulated some of us, and I hope local authorities too, with his enthusiasm for the grouping of sites and transferring the engineering potential released from the air fields on to these sites. My impression&#x2014;I hope it is hopelessly wrong&#x2014;is that relatively little is being done after a great deal of talking. If it is the fault of the local authorities, the House should be informed whose is the fault. As far as Members on this side can aid him in his approach

to local authorities,I should not think he has any right to doubt the response. I hope I am wrong in my impression but I should like to hear factually the progress that has been made there.<br/>
Thirdly, can we be told a little about the attempts that have been made in temporary housing in my division and in Dumbartonshire? I believe from my own observation that it has been a complete failure. In my division 200 temporary houses were authorised some 15 months ago. So far, we have not got one house fit for occupation. It is very difficult to believe that this is a speedy way of solving our difficulties. I am told that the actual construction has been faulty and that makeshift repairs are now being attempted. I am also told that some non-ferrous pipes which were used have been a complete failure and have had to be replaced. Can we be told who was responsible for authorising the construction of these houses? I should like to be assured that the man who made such dreadful mistakes, is not the man who is authorising the other types of temporary houses with which I understand my right hon. Friend means to go ahead. I am not cavilling at any one person. I am only interested to ensure that a similar failing will not be repeated. To find after 17 months not a house fit for occupation makes it difficult to believe that this is a speedy method of creating temporary houses.<br/>
I now turn to the construction of permanent houses. I cannot overstress the importance of the confession which the Secretary of State makes in the figures that he gave us this week. It is not only that after 20 months only 167 houses are fit for occupation. It is worse than that. If I read the answer correctly, my right hon. Friend failed after 20 months to tell us what had happened about 58 houses of the first programme which do not yet seem to have been started. What has happened after 20 months that apparently tenders have not been made for 58 of these houses? Moreover, after nine months there are still 370 houses in the second programme not mentioned in the answer which my right hon. Friend gave.<br/>
I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) in saying that I do not want to embarrass my right hon. Friend. I have frequently been in his debt and experienced a great deal of


kindness from him, and I have publicly admitted my admiration for him, but no one can be spared in an examination of this kind. There is nothing more important than that we should have these houses. There are, therefore, few things more important than that this House or, at any rate, this part of it, should understand the explanation behind the appalling failure to build houses in Scotland in the last 20 months. There are really only four elements concerned-contractors, local authorities, material and labour. There is no reason to believe that contractors are lacking in the sense of having an organisation. If the local authorities are failing in their job, we must be told. We have not been told that there is any shortage of material that cannot be overcome.<br/>
We are, I expect, to be told once more that labour is short. The last time we debated this and I pressed my right hon. Friend, he said that the question I had asked should be addressed to the Minister of Labour. I protest that that is not so. When my right hon. Friend urged Scottish local authorities to go ahead with their allocations under the first emergency programme and under the second emergency programme which we have had this year, either he had seen that the necessary labour was being made available or he was perpetrating a cheap, cruel fraud on the people who are waiting for houses. I do not say that heatedly; I say it measuredly. When my right hon. Friend came to the House last year and told us that we were going to have an emergency programme of 1,000 houses, I repeat that he ought to have satisfied himself that the labour was available for the programme, or he was not behaving with the administrative honesty which is usually associated with him. At Question Time, he pointed to the flying bomb, but I submit that that is not a sufficient excuse. That was not visited upon us until June this year. In my absence, following a representation from my division, my wife wrote to the Ministry of Labour on this subject, and in a letter dated 9th November, the Ministry of Labour said they had taken no people off the labour engaged on maintenance for bomb repairs in London. There may be a reason why Greenock should have been singled out for extraordinary treatment, but I imagine that the position is no worse there than it is in Clydebank or any other part of

Glasgow. I can understand the reluctance of the Ministry to transfer labour.<br/>
I ask my right hon. Friend to look again at some remarks I have made about the lag between the authorisation of a programme and the approval of tenders. I am certain&#x2014;and I have already gone at some length into this subject&#x2014;that this period, which is never less than three months, can be shortened. My right hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has, I know, done some work on this subject, and perhaps we can be told now at what stage the work is and what progress has been made in persuading local authorities to accept a standard plan. If a standard plan is accepted could we have a standard schedule? What saving in time would this mean? My own impression is that, if we got a standard plan, the Secretary of State should be prepared to allot all the work direct to the contracting capacity available at the time, and that price should be agreed upon later.<br/>
May I add my plea to those of the two hon. Gentlemen who have already spoken upon the utilisation of labour which is now being labelled redundant? I am delighted to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour here. I have already had an informal discussion on this subject with him. In my division women are being taken out of factories which we understood were being engaged on work of a high priority. They are now being directed outwith my division to work which I am prepared to discuss more fully and which, I am certain, is not of such a high priority. Why cannot these women be used to release male labour from marine engineering and from shipbuilding so that such labour could be turned onto house building? I know the difficulties and I sympathise with my right hon. Friend, but is he persuaded that no ancillary use can be made of this skilled and eager labour, labour which has already offered itself in such districts as my own, for this purpose?</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) and the hon. Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil), who are respected by the House for their sincerity, have painted a strong picture of the seriousness of the housing position. I do not think that they have exaggerated it in


any way, because the situation in the east of Scotland is every bit as bad as that in the west. I could mention many cases in my own constituency of the same sort as the hon. Member for Gorbals put so forcibly. I have taken tea with a family of 14 people living in a two-roomed house, with no bathroom and with only the joint use with other tenants of lavatory accommodation. While we have a situation of that sort, how can we have family decencies and families growing up with the chances that every citizen ought to have? I would endorse what the hon. Member for Greenock has said, that the situation is of the first priority and, I believe, is more important than the problem of employment. History will repeat itself, and after the war, for a time at least, there will be employment. There will be maladjustments in the turning over from war-time to peace-time work, but, taking it by and large, the troubles of unemployment are not likely to reach us for several years after the war.<br/>
What is the growing problem now, and what is the problem that will become the most urgent We have ever had to face in peace time? It is the problem of what we are to do with our people when they come back from serving us so well abroad. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Works, whom we are all glad to see here, and who has taken on an extremely difficult job, in which we all wish him well, put the problem the other day in his speech in the Debate on the Gracious Speech. He then said:
<q>We have got to produce the largest number of dwellings of a reasonable standard, if not in time at any rate, in the shortest possible time; because in the face of this situation, I do not think we can 'kid ourselves' that we can solve this problem, with all the arrears we have to make up, in time."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 7th December, 1944; Vol. 406, c. 815.]</q>
My right hon. Friend has taken on an extremely difficult job. He has not, by any means, exaggerated the position, and what the House expects of him is to see that steps are taken at once to solve this problem. Lord Kelvin used to say that you had first to measure a problem and that that was more or less easily done; the real trouble and difficulty arose when you came to solve it. I agree with my right hon. Friend who has just said that we must use every type of house and every type of building method. You

must stop at nothing. You must be prepared even to do patchwork, when you would very much rather make a unified scheme. This House still has the duty of pressing upon the Secretary of State for Scotland that he should choose the type of house which will best help towards reaching a solution more quickly. Upon that matter, I would say that, like many other hon. Members, I paid a visit to Northolt the other day and I was very much taken with one class of house. I think my right hon. Friend's Ministry is to be congratulated both upon that exhibition and upon that extremely good publication called "Demonstration Houses." It shows how the houses that we saw differ in the time they take to build.<br/>
Time is much more of the essence of this problem than is finance at the moment. I would draw the attention of the House to the particular type of building which is called the Northolt Block. I think it is No. 7. The tables of figures which I have here set out the facts that it occupies 900 square feet and that it takes 900 building-labour-hours to put up. That is much less than any of the other houses. The house is strongly spoken of in this book, but it is regarded only as an example of those which are multiple-produced. Could not this form of house be made use of in order to cope with the acute shortage of labour which will face us at the end of the war? The cost of the house compares favourably with that of the others. I notice that the no-fines concrete house and the slag concrete house each has only 850 square feet, costs more and requires more than double the building labour hours to put up.<br/>
That is the type of house which the Secretary of State for Scotland ought to bear in mind. Hon. Members will recall that it is a two-storey building, with two flats. The bottom floor has three bedrooms and a dining sitting room and in the top floor there are four bedrooms and a dining sitting room. That sort of house will be exceedingly useful. I believe that is the sort of house which will be suitable for Scotland, and I ask the Secretary of State to give his full attention to adapting it. The House will remember that the Minister of Works told us on a recent occasion that there will be no pressed steel available for the Portal house till the end of the war. Will it be possible for us to have the steel framework for the houses


I have described, and to start putting up some of them before the end of the war? We cannot leave this thing as though it were something which we can afford to leave. It is one of the most important war priorities. The struggle of this country will not be terminated by the end of the war with Germany. We shall have our difficulties and we must give priority in some way to this matter.<br/>
Something has been said about the Tarran house. I was not in the House when the Minister gave an answer to a Question on the subject and if it appeared in HANSARD I have missed it, and I apologise. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Tarran houses are being built in Scotland. I support what has been said about the urgency of the Tarran house. There are three economies&#x2014;I use the word in its widest sense&#x2014;which we all have to watch. There is the financial problem, which is the essence of the matter. Local authorities ought to know as soon as possible the extent of the subsidy they are to have and what the plans of the Government are. Free enterprise ought to know also. I am very hopeful that free enterprise, even in Scotland where conditions are more difficult than in this country, can still play a useful part, if given a chance. I expect that whoever is Secretary of State will give free enterprise a fair chance to co-operate in this urgent problem, which affects us all. It ought not to be a party matter at all. Just as when we are faced with a national emergency in war-time we all try to work together for the national good, so with the housing question. We should put it above party altogether. Those who are deeply interested in the national welfare should be willing to co-operate in every way to get forward with the solution of this problem.<br/>
I would like to say a word upon another important matter. Houses have been condemned much too often in the past, and demolished when they might more easily have been restored, have been made quite as good as new houses. I can give an example from my own experience. I had a small cottage on the farm which I have at home. It dated from the year 1715. Our factor told me it was thought to be in a very bad condition and that he was going to condemn it. I took the first steps to see what could be done to that house. With reasonable expenditure, it was made serviceable again. Then I was

told by the local authority that it was a better house than any which had been built in recent years. I believe that too much demolition has been going on, and I would ask the Secretary of State to see that, at this juncture, no houses are condemned until the situation is such that everyone has a roof, or until no other way can be found.<br/>
I believe in a high standard. I liked the Portal house, not because I thought it was a particularly high standard of building but because there were gadgets in it which will make for the comfort of the housewife and the family. I should like to see that sort of gadget put into all the houses that are built. I think we shall have to face up to building flats, rather in the American way. The situation will be so grim that it will be a question, not of having just what everybody would like but of tackling the real problem. If larger blocks could be put up, there would be many conveniences which would more than make up for the loss of such benefits as there are in isolated houses. It would save an enormous amount of land and modern systems and arrangements could be made possible, such as the supply of hot water and heating facilities, all at a very moderate cost. I think they would commend themselves to the people of this country, many of whom prefer, particularly in cities, to live near their work. Considerable economies will be possible in connection not only with the building sites but the houses themselves.<br/>
Like the hon. Gentleman the Member for Gorbals, I am a back-bencher. We feel responsible for the situation. We realise that the House of Commons cannot, even if it wanted to, get away from its responsibility. We shall continue to press the present Secretary of State, and any Secretary of State, that justice should be done to the people of our country of Scotland, and that we shall let nothing go by until we have achieved comfortable houses for all.</p>

<p>Any stranger listening to this Debate would wonder where he was, because every speaker on both sides of the House is desirous of seeing houses built in Scotland, and of bringing pressure to bear upon the Secretary of State, who after all is the prime mover in this matter, and who must, as stated, take his share of


responsibility for any lack of houses. The right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) told the Secretary of State that he had great responsibility and great power. But the housing problem in Scotland is not of to-day's making. It was an acute problem when we had no labour problem. The only labour problem we had in those days was to get people work, and there was no scarcity of materials.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Member really wish to contend that? We have had this out before, but if he thinks there was no shortage of housing labour in Scotland before the war, then he will not find any confirmation of that from the right hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary who sits there.</p>

<p>I was merely making a passing reference. There was certainly an abundance of labour and material, but no houses.<br/>
It is not long since we last had a Debate on housing. If we could produce houses in conformity with the number of Debates we have we should settle the housing problem in a very short time. During the last Debate we had the Secretary of State told us a sunshine story, which I hope he will not repeat, because in doing so he is merely, as the hon. Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil) has already said, raising hopes in the minds of the people outside which will evidently not be justified. I remember the right hon. Gentleman opening the Debate by stating that overcrowding in Scotland was six times higher than in England; that infantile mortality was very much higher than in England, and that tuberculosis was gravely on the increase. He attributed at least a fair share of this to the state of housing in Scotland. He then went on to raise the hopes of the people of Scotland that this housing problem would be tackled in earnest.<br/>
Whatever else may accrue from the Debate this afternoon it has been abundantly proved that there is no prospect whatever, if things remain as they are, of the housing problem in Scotland being tackled. Local authorities are very anxious about the matter. They are perturbed about the position. They have lists of applicants on their books, and

they are telling applicants, "Do not come near us, because we have no room for you." The burgh of Ayr has made it clear that there is no chance whatever of houses, and I think Glasgow Corporation has said that nobody with less than 10 years' residence in the city need make application for a house. That is a very serious position, a very serious problem indeed, and I hope the Secretary of State will be able to tell us something about the prospects of housing the people.<br/>
My own experience is general to every Member. I had a letter this morning from a man in Burma who is anxious about the position of his wife, who is dependent on relations to house her. Every Member is having the same experience. What reply can we give them? What answer can we make? One is afraid to sit down to write a letter because one does not know what answer to give to the people. Before I left Ayrshire at the beginning of this week I had a deputation of three women who were forced to go into a house that had been cleared. They still had to pay rent, and rates are again to be charged. Water is running down the walls, and when the Afton rises, the floor is flooded. They step out of the bedroom in the mornings into two or three inches of water on the floor of the house. What answer can I give to such people? They go to their local authority member, they come to Members of Parliament, and the difficulty is to know what kind of answer to give them. One does not know what to say. All one can say is that there is not the slightest prospect of providing them with a house for many years to come.<br/>
The Secretary of State must accept his responsibility in this matter. I am beginning very much to doubt this power of the Secretary of State for Scotland. I am beginning to doubt very much whether this present organisation of ours is any use at all, because we always come at the tail end. We have an English housing Debate in this House, and every principle is settled. Then we come on at the tail end and have a sort of rehash of what has taken place in the English Debate. But whether it be England or Scotland, this is a problem that must be faced. I am not at all convinced that we cannot find labour to build houses. If we want labour for anything connected with the war we get it. The Minister of


Labour directs, and, willy nilly, people have to go and do the job. Housing ought now to become a first priority, and there should be the possibility of people being directed to house building by the Minister of Labour.<br/>
Like the hon. and learned Member for North Edinburgh (Mr. Erskine-Hill), I have looked at the demonstration houses at Northolt, and I also paid attention to the house which he has already mentioned that can be erected in 900 man-hours. Surely here is a practical demonstration of what can be done in 900 man-hours. We must not under any circumstances allow our housing to be dealt with as it was formerly&#x2014;to be unable, after the scheme has been undertaken, to get the workmen out of it or to get the people in. Some method must be adopted whereby the house building will be done very much more speedily and effectively, so that we shall be able to march a little way along this very wearisome road. I would like to draw the attention of the Secretary of State, and the Minister of Works also, to the present type of house that is on view. A mistake was made in the construction, and it was erected with an eight-feet instead of a 7ft. 6in. roof. Surely this mistake must have been an act of Providence. With all the difference in the cost that there can possibly be, consideration should be given to the raising of the roof by this extra six inches. If you go from one type of house to another, the difference is so great that I cannot understand why the Ministry persists in having the 7ft. 6in. roof as compared with the eight-feet roof.<br/>
The arguments that have been used are all very well, but, unless we are going to have some active progress, some determination behind this housing drive, by a nation which has spent &#x00A3;25,000,000,000 on war, and not scrupled to spend the few million pounds which are necessary to build houses, we cannot deal with the problem. A nation that has gone into so much research in order to produce the best implements of war, that has had no hesitation about scrapping instruments if they failed to meet the situation and to put the scientists, the back-room boys, on the job, should not hesitate to put the same amount of drive into housing. In Ayrshire, we are faced with a terrible position. I can see the difficulties of the large towns. I have no doubt that the cities, with their teeming millions,

have serious housing problems. When one sees the horrible slums, one can understand the feelings of people coming from those areas; but let us not forget that the rural districts also have their problems, that the villages and small towns have their problems, that in the County of Ayr we have serious problems that we do not know how to solve unless there is to be a great drive forward in the erection of houses. I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to tell us what progress he intends to make and that he intends to give instructions to the local authorities as to how they shall proceed, and the result will be that many houses which are so badly needed will spring into existence.</p>

<p>I always enjoy listening to people who know what they are talking about, and I think that that can be said of every hon. Member who has spoken in this Debate. Each of them impressed me with his profound knowledge of the chronic disease we are discussing this afternoon, a knowledge which is derived only from long experience and close contact with it. In dealing with the countryside I cannot hope to reach the same high standard, but, after having lived for over 20 years in my constituency, I know that we in the countryside have our terrific housing problem also. It is perhaps not so obvious as that of the towns; and the reason very often is that our cottages are camouflaged by the wonderful beauty around them&#x2014;at any rate, in the part of the country where I happen to live. But it is no exaggeration to say that our problem is just as acute, and just as urgent, as that of the towns. In the two counties where my constituency lies, Perth and Kinross, there are scores of miserable hovels, I am ashamed to say, which are quite unfit for human habitation. Many of them are completely hidden, and it is only after close investigation that one discovers them at all. But they are a menace to the health of the people and an almost insuperable obstacle to agricultural expansion and to rural well-being. There is no need to attempt to over-paint the picture. Anyone who has read the excellent report of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Rural Housing will find, on page 42, the statement:
<q>No section of the population is compelled to live in such consistently bad housing con-conditions as farm servants.</q></p>

<p>That was the report in 1937. If that was true in 1937, what the position is to-day can only be imagined, because we have had nothing done since the report was issued. There is before the Secretary of State the most prodigious task, both in town and country, which has ever confronted any Secretary of State for Scotland in our history. As the hon. Member said just now, the people are bitter. I know that in my constituency that is so. As a nation we have paid a stiff price in disease, bad health and rural de-population. It is often said that the deplorable conditions of our rural housing is due to the wilful neglect of the private owner. Here and there, I admit, that is true; but the main cause, undoubtedly, is the prolonged agricultural depression over the past half-century. You cannot have a live housing policy in a lifeless and hopeless countryside&#x2014;which is what we have had. Everyone who knows the land will admit that, except in war, agriculture has never had the opportunity to prosper, never had the opportunity to achieve maximum efficiency; and until it gets that opportunity, it is no good talking about good efficiency. For half a century it has laboured under a policy of restriction. Cheap food has not meant the abolition of want, the abolition of unemployment, the abolition of malnutrition, or the abolition of bad housing. I do not think it would be difficult to argue that it has aggravated all four.<br/>
We are told&#x2014;and I see that the Under-Secretary who deals with agricultural affairs is in his place&#x2014;that the countryside after the war is to be given its opportunity. That means more cultivation. Cultivation means more labour, and, if we are to see the enormous expansion of the milk industry, which seems to be almost the only certain thing in the agricultural field at the moment, we shall need still more labour there, too. It is not only a case of replacing existing dwelling for rural workers, but also of building new dwellings to cope with the extra labour required after the war.<br/>
I will put, in the form of questions, one or two points which the right hon. Gentleman may care to answer when he comes to reply. First, what are the total rural

housing needs in Scotland? I have never seen a figure quoted, and, if the right hon. Gentleman has that information, and will go a litle further, perhaps by publishing it and showing the county distribution, I shall be very much obliged. The second point I wish to make rather follows upon a remark of one of my hon. Friends on the other side. It is this: What is being done about sites? We know, in the country, that land is being acquired, but is that all? What about the servicing of the sites with roads, drainage and electricity where it is available? I do not know of anything in my constituency that is being done towards the servicing of these sites. I do not know whether that is the fault of the local authority or of the Department of Health, but I would like my right hon. Friend, if he can, to make available to the county councils the necessary labour to get on with the servicing of these sites.<br/>
My third question is in connection with the small country builder. In my part of the world, we are very anxious about him, because we believe his services will be vital to the solving of the housing problem in the rural areas. He has lost most of his labour, which has been directed into the army or elsewhere, and I would like an assurance from the right hon. Gentleman that these small builders, who have a very big understanding of local conditions, are going to be given their opportunity to co-operate in this attack upon housing. With all the priorities in the hands of the State, what chance is the private builder to have?<br/>
My last point is in connection with the policy of the tied house, or, as some hon. Members may better understand it, the siting of farm cottages. I understand that it is Government policy as far as possible to build these cottages in existing villages. There are strong arguments in favour of this policy, and anyone who knows anything about agriculture will realise that the tied house has very great disadvantages. Although the landlord is responsible, the farmer really controls the house, and the worker does not like kicking up a fuss with the farmer because he thinks he may lose his job. Another reason is the lack of social amenities and educational facilities in rural areas. We know that, in England, the tied house system is fast disappearing, but I would like to throw out a word of caution. Scottish condi-


tions are vastly different from English ones. Our farms are not as close up to the villages as is the case in England. They are strung out over great stretches of country, and we have a far more rigorous climate. Men do not like cycling, on a winter morning with snow on the ground, several miles to their work, and they do not like remaining wet all day. In the case of certain houses built in the county of Perth for agricultural workers there is difficulty in letting them. Workers do not like this business of travelling long distances to work. Sometimes in planning we tend to forget the feelings of those we plan for.<br/>
The most important argument of all in favour of caution in regard to the elimination of the tied house is that of the future of the agricultural worker. Anyone must know that, when children are reared upon a farm, they get to know many things about farm work. The small child, going out with his father, gets to know about cows and cultivation. He learns many other things, and these children are the future agricultural workers of Scotland. If you take them away and put them in the villages, even though they may gain certain other facilities, my experience is that they are lost to agriculture. So I throw out the warning to my right hon. Friend to be cautious in his policy about building cottages far away from the farms. Surely it should be possible for the local authorities to build these farm cottages on or near the farms where they are required.<br/>
I hope the right hon. Gentleman, when he replies, will give an assurance to those of us who live in the rural areas that these people, who have done a very good job in this war&#x2014;a drab and not very spectacular job, but, nevertheless, a very sound job&#x2014;are to receive the same treatment as the people who live in the towns and cities.</p>

<p>I do not think it necessary to tell the Secretary of State for Scotland the effect of evil housing conditions, either in Glasgow or any part of the country, because he receives individual complaints, and the information conveyed in accumulation of those complaints, and by hon. Members in every part of the country, is supported by his Department's medical advisers. I think there are two elements in this

Debate. There are those who demand speedy and effective action art once, and there are those who are acting in a little stage play, and are attempting to ride two horses at the same time.<br/>
The right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) gave his case away in one little sentence. There are two points on which I would like to cross swords with him. The right hon. and gallant Gentleman said, in regard to the neglect of housing in the past, that there was not the labour. There was a shortage of plasterers. If there was a shortage of labour then, what is the position now during a war? If there is a shortage during a period of peace, surely there must be a much more effective scheme for a period of war? But there were many houses constructed in Scotland that required no plasterers at all. They were the steel houses. I say that all the previous Secretaries of State have failed in their duty to solve this problem of housing, and also that the free enterprise and the private interests we hear so much about, are in the dock for all time as being responsible for that lamentable failure and are the cause of the present tremendous housing shortage in England and Scotland.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member has challenged me, would he also say that the local authorities stand in the dock, including the Socialist majority on the Corporation of Glasgow, where housing failed as well? If so, that would include the hon. Member himself being placed in the dock, for the period before the war.</p>

<p>The right hon. and gallant Gentleman can shift his responsibility on to somebody else, but I say this&#x2014;I would have been prepared even to have forgiven the Labour Party majority on the Glasgow town council for any other failure, if they had gone ahead energetically to solve the housing problem, which strikes at the root of almost the whole of the evils of working class life to-day. However, I am not here to give advice. The only thing we can ask the Secretary of State for Scotland is, What information is he going to give to the House to-day? The right hon. and gallant Member for Kelvingrove said that he would not take away one single building trade worker if it would weaken the war effort. Surely,


he is giving away the whole case for an immediate drive for the construction of houses. We are told now, or the public are made to believe, that the only person who is responsible is the Secretary of State for Scotland. All the parties and all Members are demanding house construction now, and he is said to be the only man standing in the way.</p>

<p>I got it from the fact that various parties have been demanding immediate action in the construction of houses. I am not in this at all. The nation and the political parties have taken the view that it is more important to kill Germans and Japanese, than to save Britons. I do not hold that view. I think that housing is more important than war, and that war is only a consequence of the lack of decent conditions among people all over the world. Free enterprise and private interests over a long period of time, have given us this tremendously evil thing of slums and of bad houses, which are tumbling down in thousands in various cities because they are too bad to be propped up in a decent manner. Bugs and rats and all kinds of vermin are destroying the opportunities for people to live in decency.<br/>
It is no good members of the Tory Party coming here, as one Member said in this House, with faces like prostitutes at a christening, and trying to make us believe that they are the people who have been striving all the time for the improved housing of the people and that we have been standing in the way. Toryism is to be condemned in regard to housing as well as war, and every problem that humanity has thrown up at the moment. The Secretary of State for Scotland, if he is to be perfectly honest in his statement, has to show whether he is the man who is holding persons back in this country from constructing houses. Here is a letter from a doctor in my own area. The Secretary of State has placed one tubercular patient in an institution during the last week or two. This letter says that Miss Margaret Fisher, who has been suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, has been waiting for a bed for two months. Her sister died a year ago after waiting at home for six months. The doctor says the position is scandalous and that it is

not an isolated case by any means. This is in my area&#x2014;two members of one family in a small house. That is the result of Toryism, which had no concern for the people in the last century, and of people who lived by high rents and scandalous exploitation of the hovels that these people lived in.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Member aware that, in Glasgow alone, there were 19,000 empty houses in 1914, whereas to-day there is a shortage of 100,000, and that that shortage is a result of private enterprise being put out of the market altogether?</p>

<p>The opportunity for the State to go into housing only came when private enterprise could not make a profit out of it, and when people could not pay high rents. The landlords held the nation by the throat, and it then became the job of the nation to subsidise houses to enable people to live in decency. I could give a very long discourse this afternoon, if time permitted, on housing and the putting into the dock of people who are responsible for the present tragic state of affairs. But I intend, at this late hour, only to say to the Secretary of State for Scotland, that the people want houses to be constructed. If the local authorities are straining at the leash, why is he stopping them all from building houses? And why should he accept responsibility for all this? The hon. Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil) talked of some political fraud. He is about as great a political fraud, going about as a young man who does not put on the uniform that many of his constituents have to don. That is the kind of humbug to which the hon. Member's constituents have to listen.<br/>
I would ask, What kind of houses, and how many, are to be built within the next year? I know many in the Forces who have been five years in the field and will have to come back without a house to accommodate them. I would like to see the houses constructed and the end of talk. If there is a possibility of the houses being built, when are they to be begun and when will they be ready for occupation?</p>

I would like to see him come back here to see the job through. He could put his time to no better use.

The Secretary of State for Scotland has appealed to those of us who are Members for Scottish constituencies to do our utmost to establish unity if we really want to get things done. Everyone of us has given lip service to and has a sincere appreciation of the truth of that remark. He also said, "Let us make up our minds upon subjects on which we will not enter into a welter of party politics."

<p>I cannot see any reason whatever why any hon. Member should suggest it is a dispute between private enterprise and municipal enterprise. No one on this side has said it. All that there would be any dispute about, as far as I know, is why all those who can and will build houses should not be given an opportunity to do so. That is all we want&#x2014;as many houses as we can get&#x2014;and we want to employ every resource that we can possibly mobilise for that effort. Therefore, to suggest, from political prejudice, the ruling out of one particular agency for producing houses is, in my opinion, gravely to jeopardise the future housing problem in Scotland.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear the hon. Member say that, because that is my whole contention to-day. I feel rather strongly about this, and I have a feeling that this House is in danger of placing too heavy burdens upon the local authorities in connection with housing. I am becoming increasingly worried about it. We are giving them tremendous responsibilities and placing the heaviest possible burdens upon them, and there is a feeling that we have to some extent shifted the burden from our own shoulders on to theirs. If that is so, it is not "fair do's". We are in some danger, in my humble opinion, of breaking the backs of the local authorities over this problem and then of turning round and trying to blame them. We ought to use every agency that we can, not only because we want all the houses we can get, but because we do not want to put too heavy a burden upon the local authorities on whom, at the moment, all our legislation is concentrated.<br/>
Let us remember that all subsidised houses, I think I am right in saying this, are at present to be built for the working class&#x2014;which has never been properly defined. We are now utilising, thank goodness, another agency. I want to congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secre-


tary of State for Scotland, who has not had too many bouquets this evening, upon the enthusiasm which he has put into developing, strengthening and encouraging the Special Housing Association. I set great hopes by that organisation, because I believe it can do a lot to build houses for the working classes. We have now agreed to a subsidy for the Special Housing Association, we have given it almost equal facilities with the local authorities, and I am glad that the Secretary of State is, as it were, a godfather to that organisation, because it will supplement the work of the local authorities.<br/>
I would urge my right hon. Friend to sympathise with my argument that we are in danger of breaking the back of the local authorities. With the best will in the world, with all the enthusiasm they can muster, they have no direct, special qualifications for this task. It is a vast undertaking and there is the temptation, to some of them at any rate, to recollect that they will be adding to the burden on their rates. I want to use all resources, all agencies. Let us encourage the Special Housing Association. I would like the Secretary of State to spare a moment or two in his reply to say what he is doing to facilitate the Special Housing Association to an even greater degree than in the past. I hope it will have compulsory powers, because, as far as I can understand it, it may ask permision of a local authority to put other houses in the area and, if difficulties are raised by the local authority, that area may not get those houses. I hope that the Secretary of State will ask us, if necessary, for still greater powers for the Special Housing Association, whose work for housing is of the greatest possible importance.<br/>
I do not see how the local authorities, the Special Housing Association, private enterprise and the Building Trade Association come into this picture at the present moment. I have a feeling that all the priorities for labour and materials are going elsewhere, and that would be a pity. We hear a lot from public platforms of equality of opportunity. Let us have it here too&#x2014;equality of opportunity for all who are able to build houses. That is not a bad motto and I suggest that it be taken into consideration seriously by all who have to deal with this great

problem. Equality of opportunity in priorities for labour; equality of opportunity for priority in materials; equality of opportunity in subsidies too, provided the subsidies are used in the right way for the benefit of the poorer classes of the community, who otherwise would not be able to pay the normal economic rents.</p>

<p>Is the hon. and gallant Gentleman suggesting that the Special Housing Association, which is a non-elected body, should have compulsory powers to override the decisions of an elected local authority?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-12-21a.2088.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Major Lloyd" colnum="2088" time="">
<p>I think my hon. Friend is trying to drive me further than I intended. I want to suggest that if there was any reason of prejudice, if, for instance, the Secretary of State were thoroughly dissatisfied with the reason given for refusing the Housing Association the right to build in any area, he should be empowered to authorise the Association to build there. That was really what I meant by compulsory power.<br/>
Another point I want to mention is in connection with the building trades organisation. They, I gather, feel rather strongly that during the temporary emergency and the great restriction of labour and materials all house-building operations could be expedited if competitive quotations were temporarily suspended and standardised schedules of prices were fixed by agreement with all concerned, not merely among themselves but with the local authorities and the Secretary of State in conference. It should not be difficult to reach agreement on a schedule of prices. If that were done, so the Building Trades Association believes, it would mean that many small builders would be able to participate in the housing programmes of local authorities and others to a degree which, at present, they fancy they may not, as they feel they may be ruled out by the big man being able to quote somewhat lower than the standard price. I understand they have asked the Secretary of State whether he will consider the proposal. I quite appreciate that it could not possibly be considered except in the light of complete agreement amongst all the parties, but it seems a reasonable proposal, at least for consideration, and I gather that they await a reply.<br/>
I think we have had a helpful discussion to-day, and that we are fortunate in having a Secretary of State who is in such complete sympathy with all our points of view. He is doing his utmost with this terrific problem, and it would be unfair to rend him because progress is extremely slow. Further, I hope that because things are slow unscrupulous people will not bring party politics into the consideration of this problem of housing our people in Scotland.</p>

<p>It is something the hon. Member does not wish to understand. I know that my hon. Friend's constituents and my constituents would not be pleased if we gave up our responsibilities here in order to go into uniform. If we had been in other employment earlier in the war we would not have had any choice in the matter; we would have been in the Forces. However, let me pass from that and say how glad I was that my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sloan) said something on behalf of the local authorities on this matter of housing. It

seems to be common form these days to apportion responsibility, and here let me say that I agreed with the hon. Member for Shettleston when he discussed apportioning responsibility. Local authorities are certainly not responsible for the deplorable housing conditions in Scotland. The local authorities, given the responsibility, labour, materials and sites, are quite able to do the job as well as the Secretary of State himself, should he assume complete responsibility. They are no less able to do it than the Special Housing Association. Members of local authorities in Scotland are just as much alive to the need for housing as any of us in this House. Indeed, they are more alive, because they are more closely associated with the needs of the people and the deplorable housing conditions in which many of them live.<br/>
I have talked over this matter with my local authorities. I discovered that in Hamilton sites for 2,000 houses have been approved. Our housing needs, before the war, were estimated at some 3,500. We are awaiting man-power and materials in order to go ahead with the job. I am sure that the local authorities are just as competent to do the work as the Special Housing Association, or any other centralised authority. I discovered that a similar situation existed in Lanarkshire, although I regret to say that there more sites have not been approved.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock asked for an assurance that the allocations of temporary houses, made by the Secretary of State, would be honoured and not affected by the statement made the other day by the Minister of Works. I, also, would like the assurance from my right hon. Friend that the allocations made up to the present are only the first instalment of the programme. I say that not because I am particularly keen on temporary houses but because, like Other Members, I appreciate that we have to have them, that we cannot have permanent houses within the next five, six or ten years, and that we must do all in our power to get the greatest number of houses built at the earliest possible moment.<br/>
If I refer to conditions in a part of my constituency I do so only because I think they are applicable to vast industrial areas in the West of Scotland. I received some figures the other day concerning an indus-


trial village in my division, in which there are 150 houses. Overcrowding in that village is deplorable. I asked a good friend of mine to take a census and he said it was ridiculous to do so by ordinary standards as the result would be 100 per cent. overcrowding. I then asked him to go into the matter on the basis of three units, adults, per apartment. He was able to tell me that there is still 75 per cent. overcrowding in that village. Of the 150 houses 84 are sub-let, most of them being two-apartment houses. That, surely, is the answer to those who argue that a temporary housing scheme is no solution to the problem of overcrowding. Much of the overcrowding in that village, as in any other village in the West of Scotland, is attributable to the large number of sub-lets. There are dilapidated houses, nearly 100 years old, in that village for which the local authorities are not responsible. We have been pestering the factor, the local authority, all responsible authorities, to make the houses more habitable, but nothing has been done yet. The other day when a deputation of house-holders went to the factor he made them an offer.<br/>
He offered to sell them the houses at &#x00A3;3 per house. Not one of the house-holders accepted the offer. That will give some idea of the state that they are in. The people go on paying rent for them though the water comes in at the top and at the bottom. They cannot be put into a fit state. It may be that something could be done to tide them over another winter, but something must be done to provide alternative accommodation at the earliest moment.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) said something about taking men out of the Army. He said it was not only the labour and the skill of these people that we were losing. There are no apprentices being trained, and so long as these men remain in the Services, as long as the building trade personnel remains at its present low level, we cannot have apprentices trained. There are many building trade workers in the Forces and in war industries who could be released. I plead with the Secretary of State to make the necessary representations to the Minister of Labour to have these people used to the best advantage, not only because of their own skill and industry but because of the advantage that they can

be to us in the years to come in the training of these young people. I cannot agree that only the Secretary of State is responsible in these matters. I think the Ministry of Labour and the Minister of Works come into it.</p>

<p>The constitutional practice, which I hope will continue, is to fix a Minister with responsibility. Once you vary that, you can never challenge any matter at all. It may be true that others come into it but the Parliamentary responsibility must always be fixed on one man, and that man is the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>I appreciate my hon. Friend's observation, but there is a tendency to ignore the responsibility of other Departments and to fix our attention on one. These Scottish Debates always trail behind the English Debates, when attention is properly focused on the responsibility of other Departments. It is not unfitting that we too should be fully aware of the responsibility of other Departments in these matters. The war hitherto has been used as an excuse for not going on with house building. I agree that it is a very legitimate excuse, but let it also be recognised that the war, and the fact of the part the people have played in it, should be used, not as an excuse for not having houses but rather as a reason for leaving no stone unturned to have houses provided as early as possible.</p>

<p>When the time comes for me to hand in my ticket I shall have to look back on many sins of omission and commission. But one which I think I can honestly say I am free from is lack of appreciation of the magnitude of the housing problem. I am glad to say, too, that outside bodies with whom we are in pretty close contact, and who know something about the administrative difficulties, appreciate the efforts we have been making in very difficult circumstances to prepare the way, when conditions are a little more favourable, for a great attack upon the horrible housing conditions in our country. Several hon. Members have said there ought to be no politics in this. I am happy to say that the Communist Party take that view too. They have sent me a letter of thanks. [An HON. MEMBER: "For what?"] They know


the efforts that we have been making with the very limited opportunities at our hand to deal with the problem. The Scottish Labour Party executive and the local authorities say the same thing.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sloan) that this is a problem which the present generation has inherited. This generation did not create 400,000 houses without an internal water-closet. This generation inherited great responsibilities, though they inherited great opportunities too, and it must be remembered, in fairness to this generation, that we rebuilt about one-fifth of the housing in our country in the period between the two wars. Between 1919 and 1943 local authorities, with subsidy, built 241,535 houses. They built others without subsidies. The Special Housing Association have built houses and the first and second National Housing Companies built houses and, if you take four to a family, that means a million people rehoused by this generation. Since the war we have completed 35,000. They were started by local authorities before the war but they have been completed.<br/>
When I hear some people refer to the quality of the labour supply that we have now, I do not forget that many who have been building these houses are older men, that the young fellows are very largely away at the front, and that the number of men&#x2014;I do not think this figure has ever been given publicly before, but I am authorised to give it&#x2014;under 31 in the industry in the United Kingdom before the war was 200,000 out of roughly 1,000,000. That is, about one-fifth of the whole were under 31. The corresponding figure to-day is 7,000, or roughly one-fiftieth of the whole. The burden has been borne by these men, and the 35,000 houses they have completed are a tribute to their work. I pay a tribute also to the local authorities who, under great difficulties, have on the whole done a magnificent job. There is a job that nobody would have if it could be avoided, and that is the job of convener of a local housing committee.<br/>
Many points have been raised in the discussion to which I will not be able, in the time at my disposal, to reply adequately. So far as I cannot cover the ground, I propose to send letters to hon. Members dealing with the points they have put. When I said that 35,000 houses

had been completed since the outbreak of war, that is only a part of the story.</p>

<p>We have built 1,500 houses in one Glasgow area for the Air Ministry. Emergency houses, some of them not quite satisfactory, have been built to the number of 600. Hotels, hostels and camps have been converted into houses, and we have built some houses for the Ministry of Fuel and Power. Here are the facts about the labour force. Pre-War, there were in the building industry in Scotland 106,000 men. These are what are called skilled and unskilled. This figure included skilled, unskilled, navvies, labourers and workmen of all kinds. Of this number, 61,000 were scheduled as craftsmen and 45,000 as unskilled workmen. To-day we have fewer than one-third of the total, and this one-third is engaged in building of all kinds, aerodromes, camps and harbours; some of them on ship-fitting, and many of them on maintenance of existing fabrics. We have at the moment, according to the latest figures, only 3,100 engaged in building houses.<br/>
I have been asked repeatedly to-day what are the prospects of temporary housing. One hon. Member said that the Minister had killed the Portal house in the recent Debate. That is not so.

<p>I think it is land which is completely serviced. We are doing our best to increase that figure. No doubt a large number of sites are in process of being serviced. If we have land for 90,000 and if we get the land serviced, and that means first of all technical skill, engineers, lay-out officers and so on, if we can get that, and can then get the temporary houses, the next stage is the allocation of these temporary houses. We invited the local authorities to tell us what they wanted of these temporary houses. We got their requests, and we allocated a proportion of their demands. We received 56,000 applications and we made a first allocation of 33,000. The types we hope to provide initially are what are called the Ph&#x0153;nix house, the Arcon house, and the Tarran house. Some hon. Members asked about the Tarran house. The Controller of Temporary Houses says that two representatives of Messrs. Tarran yesterday said that they have a factory in Dundee for the manufacture of their houses. The Minister of Works, I am further informed, is negotiating for factory space for the manufacture of two other types of temporary houses in other parts of Scotland&#x2014;it may not be the Tarran house, but other types.</p>

<p>I take it from what my right hon. Friend has said that we can look upon it as a certainty that the Tarran house will be the first temporary house to be proceeded with?</p>

<p>No, I think the Phoenix house will be an early starter too. That


is a tubular steel scaffold frame, with a concrete cover. That is what is called the Phoenix type. I believe that will be an early starter in the race for the provision of temporary houses. We have then to face how many sites will be serviced. That is a difficult problem to answer. My endeavour is to secure that by the end of June next year the local authorities will at least have sites for over 20,000 temporary houses. If that be so then I hope, again I put it no higher than that, that by the summer of next year, we will have somewhere about 15,000 to 20,000 temporary houses erected in Scotland.</p>

<p>That is what I am saying as plainly as I can put it. I cannot put it more plainly.<br/>
We come to the question of what is called the permanent house. In the last two years we allocated 2,000 in two separate allocations of the so-called permanent houses. Recently, as some hon. Members have said, we have made further allocations on a small scale to Glasgow to enable them to keep their labour supplies in continuous employment.</p>

<p>A very important point has been put by the hon. Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil). My right hon. Friend said, in reply to the hon. Member, that there would be 20,000 temporary houses by the summer of 1945. Just before that he had been speaking of sites. Is it quite clear that by the summer of next year we are going to have in Scotland 20,000 more houses?</p>

<p>I was trying to explain that we must have sites serviced. We are endeavouring to have sites serviced, by the middle of the summer of 1945, to cover 20,000 houses. [<i>Interruption</i>.] I am talking about sites serviced. I cannot make myself any clearer.</p>

<p>I took the view that we were going to get 20,000 houses by the

summer of next year. In his own interests, the right hon. Gentleman had better make it clear, because we were all going out of this House to-night thinking that at the end of next year Scotland would have 20,000 more houses than it has this year.</p>

<p>That is wrong. I say that we have the land in local authority ownership now, and we must get it serviced. It is no use having allocations of temporary houses unless we can put them on serviced land. By the summer of next year we hope to have land available to accommodate 20,000 houses, and by next spring we shall have a trickle, growing gradually larger, of these temporary houses, which we can plant on these serviced sites. The precise date by which the Phoenix house or the Tarran house, or any other type of house, will be ready, I cannot say.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-12-21a.2098.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McNeil" colnum="2098" time="">
<p>My right hon. Friend told us that he had sites serviced for 9,000 houses. What gain is there if you are going to use labour for servicing another 11,000, when presumably you might use the labour to erect 9,000 houses on the sites that we have?</p>

<p>That is obviously a different type of labour altogether. The next point I must deal with is the effort we are making to speed up the necessary administrative arrangements. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil) made, as I thought, some rather unnecessarily offensive remarks about our intentions. [<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend must listen to me now. My reply is that, so far from there having been any delay on the Greenock houses, on the first allocation, tenders for houses were submitted on 15th July, 1943, and were approved on the following day. The second tenders were submitted for approval on the 5th July, 1944, and were approved on the 14th July. On the question of saving administrative time, we have asked the local authorities to give their powers over to their housing committees. Secondly, we have arranged with the Incorporated Society of Architects for the production of standard plans which we will offer, though not compulsorily, to local authorities, and we hope, by these two means, to do something to abolish the time lag in the preliminary administrative arrangements for houses.<br/>
Some hon. Members have asked about the Scottish Special Housing Association. This is a public utility corporation, operating without profit, on which all parties are represented, and proposing to build 100,000 houses. The local authorities knew about this fact and also that the 100,000 houses will be granted to the neediest areas, and that they will attract rates to the local authority, which will not be required to make a grant contribution. The local authorities are aware that, by and large, arrangements are in process with their concurrence and good will to get every aid and assistance that a centralised organisation, such as the Special Housing Association is, can give them.</p>

<p>No, I do not say anything about it, because they may have made that decision under a complete misunderstanding, and it may quite well be that they may see fit to change their minds, and there is no reason why we should go about causing unnecessary ill feeling and trouble.<br/>
I was asked a question about Greenock by the right hon. and gallant Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Col. Elliot). He asked if anything had happened about the efforts already made to get the use of the works department and the labour that was otherwise engaged on shipbuilding, sometimes at heavy overtime rates, in the port of Greenock. I do not know that the discussions were very animated. There were at first misunderstandings but, finally, I persuaded the Corporation of Greenock to listen to the Scottish Building Trade Operatives Federation. I will say this for the Federation. They went down to Greenock and told their men that it was quite within their permitted powers and the rules of their organisation for them to

complete a scheme where the contractor had thrown in his hand. I do not know the precise nature of the arrangements entered into recently but I will get the facts and take some means of letting my right hon. and gallant Friend and others interested know. There is no trouble whatever between the building trade craftsmen's organisations and the producers of the Weir steel houses. I have them sitting round the table and agreeing. Rules and arrangements have been made and I have great hopes that we shall get 2,500 houses&#x2014;and splendid houses they are&#x2014;per annum out of that Weir organisation. There are other types in addition which I hope we shall be able to secure, but the inescapable fact, as the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern) said, is the war, the shortage of labour. The labour is not there and it is no use blaming local authorities or anyone. The war situation has demanded that large drafts should be made upon the young men in the building trade industry and as long as the country wants that to be, so long must we be prepared to face the inevitable consequences, at a time like this, in house building.<br/>
I must apologise for the seeming inability to reply in detail to the many points, some of them interesting and some of them relevant, which have been raised here this afternoon. Rural housing, which my hon. Friend the Member for West Perth (Mr. Snadden) raised, has not been forgotten; it cannot be forgotten. But the whole housing problem is so appalling that it is going to require the good will of everybody and every interest&#x2014;there is nothing that can be barred here&#x2014;if we are going to meet within a reasonable time the great difficulties with which we are confronted. All I can say in conclusion is that there is no one at the Scottish Office but who is fully seized of the urgency of this problem. Tuberculosis is an appalling problem and my hon. Friend had better be made aware that there are as great difficulties there as there are in regard to the shortage of houses. We are willing to try everything in our power and within our competence to prepare the way and have everything ready whenever there is a labour allocation sufficient to allow the local authorities to start housing again. Private builders will be encouraged. No private building interest need be afraid. Every one can get a job, every skilled


man, and the 200,000 dilutees who are being arranged for in consultation with the building industry. There are plans for 25,000 apprentices being trained.</p>
