<p>None, Sir; both sides of the industry were represented at the meeting of the National Advisory Council for the Motor Manufacturing Industry on 7th March, and I have been informed of the views then expressed about the present situation in the motor industry. I doubt whether the industry would be able to add to the points so recently expressed but, as the hon. Member is aware, I am ready at all times to hear their views.</p>

<p>I was very glad to have the opportunity to welcome the French Prime Minister here.<br/>
The House will have seen the joint statement which was issued after our talks together. I do not wish to repeat it. There are just two comments I should like to make.<br/>
The first subject which we discussed was disarmament. We found ourselves in full agreement about the need to make progress in this field and welcomed the opportunity which is provided by the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Sub-Committee on disarmament. Our ideas on this subject were indeed very close together and we hope for British, French and United States collaboration in a common policy.<br/>
The other main subject we discussed was the economic policies of the free world, with special reference to economic action in certain areas which we mentioned in our statement. Here also we found ourselves in agreement on the broad lines of policy, and on the need to develop the economic side of the regional organisations to which either of our countries belongs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-03-15a.559.5" speakerid="unknown" speakername="The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. D. Heathcoat Amory)" colnum="559" time="">
<p>Yes, Sir. The statutory Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry has been concluded. The Government have made their determinations on the guarantees to the industry in the light of the Review. These are set out in a White Paper which is now available. The White Paper also sets out the results of the Special Review which was held concurrently with the Annual Review.<br/>
The general production policy of the Government continues to be to foster the highest level of net output that can be achieved economically and efficiently, by encouraging in particular beef, mutton and lamb and the production and use of home-grown feedingstuffs. Until markets can be extended or costs reduced, it is desirable to avoid stimulating further the production of milk, pigs or eggs.<br/>
The net output of the industry in 1955&#x2013;56 is forecast at 55 per cent. above pre-war as against 51 per cent. for last year. Falls in the tillage area and in pig production have been offset by record yields of cereal crops, a better hay harvest and more milk and eggs. I am sure the House will agree that this reflects credit on everyone concerned during the past year&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]&#x2014;following the adverse conditions of the previous year.<br/>
The actual net income of the industry, which is forecast for 1955&#x2013;56 at &#x00A3;299 million out of a gross income of about &#x00A3;1,400 million, is recovering only slowly from the setback of 1954&#x2013;55 when it fell to &#x00A3;285 million. There has also been a substantial further increase in costs of about &#x00A3;37 million in a full year for review commodities. I am confident that the industry will help itself to meet these costs by continuing to increase its efficiency, mainly through improvements in husbandry and farm management. This will also help the nation by keeping down the total subsidy bill and the volume of feedingstuffs imports<br/>
The Government's conclusion is that a further increase in the value of the price guarantees and production grants is necessary to ensure that the industry has the resources it needs in order to play its full part in meeting the requirements of the national economy. The determinations now made have the effect of increasing the total value of the guarantees in a full year by &#x00A3;25 million.<br/>
It has been decided to increase the price guarantees for fat cattle, fat sheep, and milk for 1956&#x2013;57 and for oats, barley, potatoes and sugar beet for the 1957 harvest to leave unchanged the price guarantee for hen eggs; and to reduce by small amounts the price guarantees for pigs and wool for 1956&#x2013;57 and by a more substantial amount the price guarantees for wheat and rye of the 1957 harvest.<br/>
We have also decided to increase the fertiliser subsidies, the marginal production grants and the subsidy on steer calves; and to make provision for grants for silos for the conservation of silage. The Government have had particularly in mind the position of the smaller farmers in reaching the decision to increase the price guarantees for milk by &#x00BD;d. a gallon and oats by 1s. 6d. a cwt., and in making additional provision for production grants.<br/>
The Government have also given careful thought to the form of the fatstock guarantees. They have decided to discontinue the individual guarantees for all classes of fatstock. These were a feature of the guarantee scheme introduced in 1954 after the end of control. But the risks for individual producers in the restoration of the auction markets which these arrangements were intended to meet


no longer justify the complications and the elaborate machinery involved.<br/>
This will not only enable the fatstock guarantee system to be simplified considerably, but it will also save about 300 staff. A single guarantee payment will be made in future for each group of fat-stock. But to provide greater stability, this guarantee payment will be adjusted as and when necessary to ensure that the average total return to producers each week remains within a predetermined range on either side of the standard price.<br/>
I regret that on this occasion agreement has not been reached with the Farmers' Unions. I understand that, while in the prevailing circumstances, they would not have wished to dissent from the total increase in the guarantees, they feel unable to agree to the price determinations or to the changes to be made in the fatstock guarantee system. The Government are, however, satisfied that their determinations are fair and just and take a full and balanced view of the needs of the agricultural industry and of the national economy.</p>

<p>Is the removal of the individual guaranteed price for livestock consistent with Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, which distinctly states that guarantee prices and assured markets should be provided? Does the Minister think that an imposed settlement, for the first time, will help in our balance of payments problem? Although it is difficult at such short notice to make figures clear, if the profits of the industry for 1955&#x2013;56 have increased by &#x00A3;14 million, compared with 1954&#x2013;55 and as there has been a recoupment of &#x00A3;25 million out of the &#x00A3;37 million extra expenditure, leaving the sum of &#x00A3;12 million, does that not mean that profits increased over the low figure of 1954&#x2013;55 by only &#x00A3;2 million? Did the right hon. Gentleman expect to get agreement with the National Farmers' Union in the light of those figures.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-03-15a.561.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="561" time="">
<p>I will do my best to answer the three very reasonable questions which the right hon. Member has asked. I am sorry that we have not succeeded in getting agreement, particularly as the discussions this year have been held in a very friendly and temperate atmosphere. However, as the right hon. Gentleman himself knows, there is no obligation under the Agriculture Act,

1947, necessarily to reach an agreed settlement.<br/>
The individual guarantee was introduced as a special measure of protection against the uncertainties of reopening the free markets. It was never intended to be a general floor price. It served its purpose in those circumstances, but today it is very doubtful whether, on balance, it is helpful. I have had a good many criticisms that the system, including the individual guarantee, is so complicated that it is difficult for producers exactly to understand where they will be. It is important to have a simple system which is understandable and I believe that the new arrangements which we have made, with the special provision for stabilising adjustments, will prove popular.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman next asked me about the effect on the net income of the industry. This settlement has not, as settlements never have in the past, been made on a cost-plus basis. As against the &#x00A3;37 million which it is estimated the Review commodities will have increased in cost, we are making an increase in the guarantees of &#x00A3;25 million, but, fortunately, the industry shows every sign of continuing its steady improvement in productivity year by year. When that is taken into account, the effect on the net income of the industry of this settlement should be very beneficial indeed. Also, the industry has not yet received in full the benefits from the increases that were made in the Price Review last year. Some of these will be accruing during the next six months.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me a third question&#x2014;</p>

<p>Now that the collective guarantee for fatstock has been shown to provide a reliable support, would my right hon.

Is the right hon. Gentleman further aware that his statement must be considered together with the Chancellor's statement and that it means that the price support of the British farmer is being directly paid by the consumer and that the reduction in subsidy is being used directly this time for the increased price support?

I would remind him and the House that the forecast for the present year is of a net output at a level reached only once before&#x2014;in the year before last&#x2014;and which has never been surpassed. As to the effect on the industry, I am sure that when agriculturists consider it they will decide that in present circumstances an additional contribution to their resources in the form of additional guarantees amounting to &#x00A3;25 million will provide them with a very sure base on which to continue their increase in efficient productivity.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman's reference to increased production was cheered by hon. Members opposite, but is he aware that he is relating his figure to production last year and that last year's figure was comparable only to what it was in 1951? Is it not alarming that the increase in agricultural production since 1951 has been at the rate of only 1 per cent.?</p>

<p>For the year 1950&#x2013;51, which was the last completed year before the Labour Government went out of office, the net output was 145 per cent. above pre-war. It is now 155 per cent. In the next year, the year ending May, 1952, which was six months after the party opposite went out of office, it had risen 4 points to 149 per cent. Between the last completed year under the Labour Government and this year there has been an increase of 10 points in the output over pre-war.</p>

<p>I am sure that hon. and right hon. Members would like to have correct figures. What my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Peart) put to the Minister was whether it was not the case that output between 1951 and 1956 has increased by only 4 per cent. If the right hon. Gentleman takes the year 1951&#x2013;52, when the party opposite had been in office only for a few months and all the work had been done before we on this side of the House had left office, he will find that the figures are almost the same. In four years, output has gone up by only 1 per cent. per annum during the term of office of the party opposite.</p>

<p>There are two or three points which I want to raise with the Under-Secretary on Vote 1. The first concerns Service pay and pensions, which are dealt with in the White Paper. I will not go into the details of the merits of the White Paper again, because I do not think that would serve any useful purpose, but there is still one point that needs to be cleared up.<br/>
Would the hon. Gentleman be good enough to tell the Committee whether the new rates of pay apply to officers on short service commissions? This is a major point of doubt in the minds of some of us, and it may well be that the Government have given thought to it. I think they would be serving their own interests if they cleared up that point, and, while on the subject, would the hon. Gentleman also be good enough to clear up any other points of doubt?<br/>
Reading the White Paper for the first time, I was struck by a point which it would not be in order to pursue now&#x2014;the question of the Territorial Army&#x2014;and the Secretary of State was quite unable to clear it up. It may well be that, with the hon. Gentleman's greater interest and knowledge, there are some further doubts which he would like to take this opportunity of clearing up.<br/>

Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes), have a common interest in seeing that the policy of this White Paper should succeed because if it does not the problem faces the entire country. It is not merely a question of embarrassing the Government. We want to give the policy our good wishes and a good start, so if there are any points of doubt which it is advisable to resolve. I urge the Under Secretary to take this opportunity of doing so.<br/>
Having blessed the White Paper, I now turn to the question of the proof of the pudding being in the eating. Over the last few years we have depended on the competent and admirable duplicated returns which are available in the Vote Office, and which give those of us who are interested in this matter a considerable amount of information about the Services. Although this is primarily an Army matter, it concerns all the three Services. These returns could be amended to show the annual enlistments which take place under the new engagements.<br/>
By this I mean that whereas, in the past, these returns have been in terms of men coming from civil life with no previous service, those with previous service, enlisted boys, those on short service engagements and normal Regular

engagements, if we want to calculate how the new policy is progressing, the numbers under the heading "Total Regular Engagements," would need to be divided into new engagements of three, six, nine, twelve years, and so forth.<br/>
There is one further piece of information, which has been the cause of dispute between myself and the Secretary of State for War, and which goes to the heart of the policy of the Government. We want to know the number of extensions and prolongations. On 22nd November last, I asked the right hon. Gentleman whether he would make available to the House regularly, presumably through the Vote Office, the number of men serving on the new three-year engagement who extended their service. In view of the new policy, however, we now need to know more than that. We want the quarterly return available in the Vote Office to be amended to show the extensions in the three Services. Of course, it is out of order to pursue the question as regards the Air Force and the Navy, so I will concentrate my remarks upon the Army.</p>

<p>In my day these were called extensions or re-engagements. I do not know the modern jargon. However, the hon. Gentlemen knows what I am after.<br/>
This should be a regular feature and should be available in the Vote Office to enable anyone who wishes to form an accurate view of how the policy of the Government is progressing to be able to do so without referring to the Order Paper, which sometimes gives us more heat than we want but not as much light as is needed.<br/>
My next point arises under Vote A. In November last year there was a meeting of the Army Advisory Council for West Africa, at Kaduna, and at its conclusion the Chairman, who was the Nigerian Minister of Transport, stated that, in view of the general constitutional advance in the West African territories, the four West African Governments, together with Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, had agreed that Headquarters, West African Command, should cease to exist on 1st July, 1956.<br/>
From that date the Royal West Africa Frontier Force will be in three separate


commands for the Gold Coast, that is, for Nigeria, for Sierra Leone and for the Gambia respectively, each having its own commander and staff. Since that time we have had the Memorandum from the Secretary of State for War, paragraph 48 of which states that there will be an administrative change in the West Africa Command on 1st July, 1956. In other words, the right hon. Gentleman has repeated the conclusions reached at the meeting of the Army Advisory Council for West Africa.<br/>
It would be out of order for me to go into the question of the present political atmosphere in the Gold Coast, but it is tied up with this question. I have not the slightest doubt that the changes envisaged by the recommendation of the Army Advisory Council were extremely limited. They were tied up to the administrative changes and to the changed financial contributions from the Colonies, they certainly did not involve the handing over of the operational control of these Forces from General Herbert, G.O.C. West Africa to Mr. Kwame Nkrumah. I do not know whether the political opponents of Mr. Kwame Nkrumah see him as Field Marshal Nkrumah taking the field against them at the head of the West African Forces but some of them talk as if they believe this is going to happen.<br/>
I should have thought that there is a great advantage in this for the Government provided they can make up their minds about what they are going to do; if they could say that it is only an administrative change, that the statement made after the meeting of the West African Army Advisory Council was limited, and that it just happened to be that the War Office and the Colonial Office could not jointly make up their minds as to the changes involved. In other words, this is an administrative change, which is happening quite naturally as a result of the West African Colonies moving towards independence, and that it is being blown up into a matter of major political importance simply because the Government have not said specifically what the decision taken on 4th November really means. Therefore, in the interests of the wellbeing of the Army, and still more the peace and security of the Gold Coast, I hope that

the Government will say what is in their mind.<br/>
I now turn to another aspect of the colonial forces. It is true that when the Government were in opposition they dreamed of vast colonial forces which would take the place of the Indian Army. That did not work out. It was one of the discoveries made by the present Secretary of State for War, when he reached the War Office, that what he said in opposition was absolute nonsense. The right hon. Gentleman found that there were no vast African forces to be raised, and that even if there had been, the cost would have been prohibitive. He found that even if we had the financial resources available they pre-empted on just that range of N.C.O.s and officers of which we stand in the greatest need. So the realisation was much less ambitious than the policies which the right hon. Gentleman used to put forward with such charm and innocence when he sat on this side.<br/>
One thing the Government did was to hold a joint conference in Lagos in 1953 between West African Ministers and representatives from the Colonial Office and the Services, and they put forward proposals to deal with officer shortage. As these countries move towards self-government and are concerned about raising their own forces and their efficiency, they have a natural pride in the past achievements of those forces and are concerned about the raising and training of their officer corps. The Government recognised that there was a limit on the number of places available at Sandhurst. The Colonial Office Paper recognised that it is difficult at present to get even the 20 candidates necessary to fill the existing places, but expresses the hope that this may be only a temporary phase.<br/>
If there was to be Africanisation of the officer corps of the Royal West African Frontier Force, something new would have to be done about the training of West African officers. The Colonial Office Paper realises that even if a West African Sandhurst were established, it would be difficult to find sufficient instructors from this country. I congratulate the Government on the most valuable and imaginative proposal that an attempt should be made to loan instructors from Commonwealth countries, thus fulfilling


the first-class idea of an African Sandhurst in which the instructors would be drawn not only from this country but from all parts of the Commonwealth, turning out the young men to serve in the commissioned ranks of the West African forces.<br/>
Nothing has happened since that time. I am quite sure that the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, General Herbert, who has a responsibility for the efficiency of these forces, not only in their security r&#x00F4;le but for any part they might play in a future emergency, must be concerned about this problem. I should very much like to know from the Government what, if anything, they intend to do about it.<br/>
I was appalled to read the report of a statement by the General Officer Commanding, East African Command, in Nairobi on 26th February, when General Lathbury paid tribute to the important part played by African warrant officer platoon commanders, many of whom, he said, had commanded platoons throughout the emergency. He went on to say that, as a reward for the splendid part they had played, their status should be raised. It was to be raised, not by sending them to Sandhurst or arranging for them to get further training as part of the policy of increasing the numbers of Africans holding commissioned rank.<br/>
What General Lathbury proposed&#x2014;presumably, with the authority of the War Office&#x2014;was the thoroughly reactionary step of going back to the state of affairs which existed in East Africa up to 1932, when there was a special rank called "effendi" for African platoon commanders. I am sure that the idea was kindly meant, but this is the kind of thing that adds fuel to the violent African nationalism. When the men who have done the job and who have commanded platoons in the field during the emergency in Kenya get something which both we and they know to be second best, brave, courageous and well-disciplined warrant officers become thoroughly dissatisfied with their treatment.<br/>
I do not underestimate the difficulties, but I should very much like to hear what the Under-Secretary has to say about the proposal to introduce the rank of effendi in East Africa. Are we to take it that, in view of the contents of the Colonial Office Paper (Colonial No. 304), the Government have one policy for East

Africa and another for West Africa or that they bracket the two together? Is there one policy on paper and none in practice?<br/>
Without attempting to follow the Secretary of State into his grandiose conception of vast colonial forces, I have always thought that under both Governments&#x2014;this was true not only when the Labour Government were in power, but it is even more true today&#x2014;a great deal more could be done for the well-being of the Colonies by a planned and gradual method of making the best use of the reservoir of manpower which is certainly available in all the British Colonies.</p>

<p>I wish to raise only one or two detailed and, possibly, dull points. First, I should like to refer to Subhead J of Vote I, which deals with lodging and London allowances. One would normally expect a subhead of this nature to move in sympathy with Vote A, which, this year, has gone down slightly, whereas, in Subhead J, provision is made for an additional &#x00A3;100,000. I should like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State to look into this at the War Office and to make sure that we do not expend more money under this subhead than is actually necessary. Similarly, there is a rather more substantial rise in Subhead K.<br/>
I raise these questions on the Army Estimates because they are being taken first and, unfortunately, I cannot be present later for the other Estimates, but what I have to say applies equally to either of the two other Services.<br/>
The reason for the local overseas allowance, which I have never been fortunate enough to draw during my service, is clearly stated in page 23, which informs us that it
<q>is issued at various rates in aid of the extra expense incurred by officers and other ranks serving in certain countries abroad where the essential expenditure from pay, marriage allowance and lodging allowance is greater than comparable expenditure in the United Kingdom.</q>
In other words, it is a kind of colonial national assistance paid to officers and men to help them maintain a reasonable standard.<br/>
That being so, I should have expected the rates of the allowance to be reduced after the very substantial rise in the basic


rates of pay which is provided for under Subhead A. In other words, in view of the rise in the rates under Subhead A, I should have expected to find an inverse movement under Subhead K. Similarly, one would also expect Subhead K to move to some extent in sympathy with Vote A.<br/>
I do not ask my hon. Friend to give a reply this afternoon. I recognise that these are points of detail, but I would be glad if he could give an assurance that the matter will be looked into on the principle that we wish to run the Services as economically as possible.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg), I welcome the recommendations on pay and pensions. In their Memorandum, the Government state that they have two urgent aims: to increase the number of Regular recruits and to increase the number of those who elect to undertake longer engagements. We are told that the pay code announced in the White Paper and embodied now in Vote 1 of the Estimates is designed to achieve both those objects. On the whole, they are very good. We hope sincerely that they will achieve the Government's aim of strengthening the Regular content of the forces and raising the numbers in the forces to such an extent that eventually we can do without the National Service content.<br/>
We hope that we will be given an adequate yardstick by which to judge the success or otherwise of these measures. Can we have an assurance from the Financial Secretary that next year we shall know exactly how many men have taken on longer service and how many extra recruits have been obtained for Regular service at the end of twelve months as a result of the introduction of the new pay code? That is the only way in which we can form an opinion. We do not want the figures lumped together. We want to know the exact result of the pay code on recruiting for the Regular Army and on the extension to long service by men now in the Army on short service.<br/>
I also want to say a few words on National Service grants under Subhead H. I notice that there is an overriding limit of &#x00A3;3 a week on the National Service grants. Those grants, we are told, are issued under certain conditions to National Service men to relieve cases

of financial difficulty where ordinary Service emoluments are insufficient to enable them to meet the obligations of their families and other dependants, or because of exceptional personal commitments. We have to be careful that the National Service man does not lose in one direction what we grant him in the other.<br/>
The National Service man is to receive increased pay and will also be eligible for marriage allowances for which he was not eligible previously. I should like an assurance that the National Service grants will still continue and that increased pay will not be used as an excuse to do away with them. I hope that the National Service man, with his slightly increased pay and marriage allowance, will not be told, "You have these extra emoluments and, therefore, you are not now eligible for a National Service grant."<br/>
Let us look at the position of the married National Service man. On entry he will receive 31s. 6d. plus 35s. marriage allowance, a total of &#x00A3;3 6s. 6d. At the age of 21, he will receive, so far as I can discover, 52s. 6d. plus 35s. married allowance, a total of &#x00A3;4 7s. 6d. Most of the National Service men are young but people now marry at an early age. Marriage at the age of 18 is nothing today. We may have a National Service man who has applied to continue his apprenticeship and enter into National Service after his apprenticeship is finished. By that time he may be aged 24 or 25 and a married man with one or two children. He will get &#x00A3;4 7s. 6d.<br/>
No one will tell me that a married man, even without children, can live on &#x00A3;4 7s. 6d. a week. He is in the Army and his wife is at home, so he will go to the N.A.A.F.I. occasionally or to the wet canteen, although I understand that today the N.A.A.F.I. is more popular than the wet canteen. He will want money to spend as he would do if he were at home, but he will have only &#x00A3;4 7s. 6d. for himself and his marriage allowance.<br/>
If this man has entered into the ranks of the Tory property-owning democracy and purchased a house, he may have very heavy commitments by way of interest and sinking fund charges. If he has purchased a house, he will be furnishing it and he may also have heavy hire-purchase commitments. These are burdens which he will find far too heavy for him to


bear, even with his emoluments under the new pay code and with marriage allowance. I hope that the fact that the National Service man's emoluments have been increased and that he has become eligible for marriage allowance will not be made an excuse for doing away with the National Service grant.<br/>
There is, in fact, a case for a considerable raising of the overriding limit of the National Service grant of &#x00A3;3 a week. A man with all those commitments, if he receives the full &#x00A3;3 on top of &#x00A3;4 7s. 6d., which is only &#x00A3;7 7s. 6d., will have a very hard time while doing his duty by his country. He may be serving an apprenticeship and have to go back to that work when he has finished his Army career.<br/>
Under Subhead O, there is a small item in respect of Korea gratuities of &#x00A3;80,000. Of that sum, &#x00A3;10,000 is for officers and &#x00A3;70,000 is for other ranks. Are we to imagine that there is one officer to seven other ranks in Korea? How is the money divided up? Why are officers getting &#x00A3;10,000 and other ranks &#x00A3;70,000? Is that a fair proportion? I should like to have a reply from the Under-Secretary.</p>

<p>In the discussion on the Estimates today and the discussions which have taken place on other Estimates, I have been horrified to find that there is always a demand for more and more expenditure. In other debates hon. Members have said, in effect, "Why not build a couple of aircraft carriers or provide a new parachute regiment?" No one on either side of the Committee asks for the expenditure in any way to be cut down.</p>

<p>Not at all. I will come to that in a minute.<br/>
With that in mind, I should like to follow up with one or two practical suggestions. The Government have recently made very generous pay increases which, for Regular long-service men, will mean,

in my submission, that they will be in receipt of good pay fully in line with, if not above, that which they would get in civilian life. For instance, a fitter tradesman aged 20, if living away from barracks and receiving allowances for food and lodging, will be getting about &#x00A3;692 a year, or &#x00A3;13 a week. He is quite generously paid.<br/>
Similarly, a 25-year-old married captain, on the same basis will receive &#x00A3;1,185 a year, which is every bit as good if not a good deal better than he would get in trade or industry. A 36-year-old married lieutenant-colonel, on the same basis, receives &#x00A3;2,008 a year. There again, I suggest that he is generously paid and probably rather better paid than his equivalent in trade or industry.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
With these generous payments in mind, I wish to ask my hon. Friend whether certain services in Army life are justifiable. For instance, can we still justify the expenditure on servants in married quarters, or private houses for officers? Can we afford assisted house-renting schemes which, I think, still obtain in the Army? Again, there are certain home to duty travelling allowances which, I believe, are given on a certificate that an officer is trying to find a house near the point of duty but is unable to do so. I wish to ask whether that sort of thing is being abused now?</p>

<p>I thought that the assisted house-renting scheme would come under this Vote. However I have made the point which I wished to make. Having introduced generous pay


scales, ought not we to economise in the provision of things which are not provided in civilian life? A man in civilian life receiving &#x00A3;2,000 a year would not expect servants and married quarters or assisted house-renting schemes, and so on, and I would ask my hon. Friend to examine that sort of thing.</p>

<p>In Vote 1 we are asked to vote &#x00A3;100,380,000, which, as was said by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke), is a very large sum, and an increase of &#x00A3;35,979,930. I am glad that the hon. Member put in a plea for economy. He made the apt remark that we are liable to forget all about economy during these debates on the Service Estimates. When we have voted this money, we shall go back to talking about our economic troubles, but for about three weeks we have forgotten them, and I am indebted to the hon. Gentleman for reminding the Committee.<br/>
I wish to make some practical suggestions about how this large sum can be reduced. I am not boggling at the rise in the standard of life of the ordinary soldier. I agree with the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) that if we have to have soldiers, if we propose to conscript them or ask them to join voluntarily, we have to pay them a reasonable wage. I do not for one moment suggest that this large sum could be reduced by cutting the rate of pay. My practical suggestion is that the number and the pay of officers under Vote A could be considerably reduced if we reduced our commitments, and as I see&#x2014;</p>

<p>I should like to ask a question on Vote 1. On page 17 of the Estimates is an explanatory paragraph which states:
<q>The appropriations in aid include provision for contributions from the Federal German Government towards the support of the British Army in Germany. Expenditure on all supplies and services for the British Army in Germany is borne on the appropriation Vote.</q>

<p>Like my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes), I am entirely in favour of a proper and decent rate of pay for the men in the Army. I have always taken that point of view, and I think it should be the prior consideration of the Committee when we are discussing these Estimates. At the same time, I am not in favour of a policy of bribing men into the Army. I am against a policy of offering rates of pay which prove, in relation to rates of pay for other jobs, that the Government may be considered to be bribing men into the Forces.<br/>
The rates of pay we have to consider in relation to these Estimates and which will involve a substantially increased expenditure are outlined in the White Paper Cmd. 9692. They reveal that the Minister is compelled into this action by the failure of his recruiting policy. The first thing we should note in relation to these Estimates is that the Government have come to the conclusion that the previous pay policy has failed, that the previous recruiting policy has failed, and that the Minister has now adopted an entirely different policy regarding pay which is a complete departure from the policies adopted since the end of the war.<br/>
In previous discussions of these Estimates, two general principles were accepted. One was that the pay codes should be as simple and as uniform as possible. That need has often been stressed. In their redrafting of the pay codes, and their attempt to relate it to industrial rates of pay, the Labour Administration endeavoured to move in the direction of simplification because of the justified past criticisms of the complexities of the pay system of the Army and its unintelligibility to large numbers of soldiers. The second principle was that of equal pay for equal work; that, broadly speaking, rates of pay should be the same for soldiers of the same type.<br/>
The new pay codes, which involve this increased expenditure, depart from

both those principles. We are now moving in the direction of a greater multiplicity of codes which will be more difficult to understand. The Secretary of State for War is now introducing a series of complicated differentials. One of the results is unequal pay for equal work. Rates of pay are now to be related not to the kind of work undertaken by a soldier but to the period for which he has signed on. This will result in soldiers who are working side by side upon exactly the same jobs receiving different rates of pay because they happen to have signed on for different periods.<br/>
As the White Paper on Service Pay and Pensions says, the War Office has at last discovered that:
<q>To man the Services on a basis of short engagements is both inefficient and uneconomical &#x2026;</q>
The Secretary of State for War may regard himself as having got off very lightly in respect of the criticisms which have so far been made upon this question. When we consider all the previous debates upon the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates which have been connected with the introduction of the three-year engagement period, it is somewhat startling to find that the Army has now discovered that to man the Services on the basis of short engagements is inefficient and uneconomical, and that all the pay codes must now be reshaped in order to provide special incentives to persuade recruits to sign on for the longer period.<br/>
4.45 p.m.<br/>
We now discover that all the hullabaloo about the tremendous increase in the number of recruits which would result from the introduction of the three-year engagement period was unjustified, because it did nothing to provide the Army with sufficient additional manpower to enable conscription to be dispensed with. It must be remembered that that is the main field in which we must economise. Economy can come only from a reduction in manpower on this Vote, and all the expenses in connection with pay and accommodation which go with it, and that must mean a reduction in conscripted manpower.</p>

<p>I thank you, Sir Rhys, for directing me back to the specific subject of the pay codes, which is so closely related to the subject of recruiting policy&#x2014;because it was the need for additional recruitment which caused the Government to introduce the new codes. I entirely support the offer of better rates of pay to men in the Army, and I agree that an increase in the rates was necessary anyway, but I am extremely critical and very concerned about the departure from previous policies which is involved in the new pay codes.<br/>
In the first place, they must mean that the War Office will have to take special steps to make these more complex pay codes thoroughly intelligible to the men in the Forces. It will not be easy to explain the differentials which are involved. It is unfortunate that we must have a great multiplicity of pay codes. They can be justified only if, as a result of their introduction, more recruits are persuaded to sign up for longer periods of service.<br/>
We should be kept continuously informed about developments in this direction. From time to time hon. Members on this side of the Committee are compelled to utter their great dissatisfaction with the War Office's policy in regard to the three-year engagement system. I can only regard it as a policy of concealment, arising from the guilt complex which developed in the War Office over this matter. We shall be continuously scrutinising the recruitment figures and the extensions of engagements which result from the introduction of these new pay codes. Reasonable success in this direction will be the only justification for passing this increased Estimate this afternoon.<br/>
We warn the Under-Secretary of State that we shall watch this policy very carefully and critically. He must not expect us to swallow it easily. Since the principles upon which we have been acting hitherto are being abandoned, the War Office will have to prove that these new pay codes will produce extra recruits, and that the production of those recruits will enable it to pursue a more economical manpower policy in the future. Only if it can do so will it escape the most violent criticism in future Estimates debates.</p>

<p>I associate myself wholeheartedly with the remarks which have been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) about the colonial forces. The extent to which our colonial forces can be increased will reduce the liability of the War Office for sending British troops to colonial stations, on which a considerable amount of the expenditure envisaged in this Vote is incurred.<br/>
I advised the Under-Secretary of State that in the course of the Committee on the Army Estimates I proposed to raise the position of British troops serving in Hong Kong and Singapore. I hope that he is in the position to announce the result of the discussions that we were promised would take place between the War Office and the Colonial Office on the subject of these troops who, when they get into trouble with the civilian authorities&#x2014;</p>

<p>We are asked to provide for National Service grants. In the circumstances to which I have alluded a greater demand would be made for National Service grants to provide for the dependants of the soldier who found


himself in such a predicament.

I am respectfully suggesting that soldiers may, in certain circumstances, find themselves obliged to ask for National Service grants.<br/>

<p>You have ruled on this Vote, Sir Rhys, that what we get from the soldier in addition for his pay is not relevant, so we are precluded from referring to the counter-attack which has already developed against the Government's undertaking to abolish what its war minister has described as "bull" in the Army.

<p>The new pay arrangements in the Army are much more realistic, but we should not consider them in the exaggerated form in which they have appeared in the Press. A private soldier with less than six years' service gets &#x00A3;5 19s. He is not the millionaire that the Press represents him to be in view of the fact that he has to give up his liberty and sign away his freedom for six years to earn it. He is at the beck and call of the Army for 24 hours, so we should not consider that money as too great a payment. That comment applies to other rates of pay in the new pay code.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I was led astray by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke).<br/>
I want to raise a point about the National Service man who, under the new Service pay and pensions code, has been treated most shabbily. Prior to the introduction of the changes he joined at four shillings per day or 28s. per week. He is now given the magnificent sum of 6d. per day extra. That does not help to make a boy of 18, 19 or 20, who has probably been earning &#x00A3;7 to &#x00A3;9 in industry, very happy in the Army, to say the least. The proposals should have been much more generous. An increase of 3s. 6d. per week is rather absurd.<br/>
To say that he will get another 3s. 6d. added to his pay when he reaches the age of 21 does not make the pay any more generous. I still cannot understand why no marriage allowance is paid before 21. Young men do get married before they are 21; who are we to say that they should not? Many marriages under 21 turn out to be quite happy and good marriages and nobody can complain about them. We fail to recognise that a man is married and we penalise him for it.<br/>
There might be an argument for giving no marriage allowance until 21 to a volunteer, because he volunteered on those conditions. National Service men are not volunteering, but are taken into the Army. They are probably married and enjoying a good income in civilian employment. They get married because they are earning enough to settle down and make a home. They are taken in the forces and paid the magnificent sum of 4s. 6d. a day. They may reach 5s. or 5s. 6d. There is nothing for their wives. They can, of course, apply for an assessment and for a National Service grant, and then they can get up to &#x00A3;3. If they have to apply in that way it is putting them in a strange position. Following an application, visits are made to the home and inquiries are made as to income. I should not have thought it would have cost any of the forces very much to have paid these marriage grants to men over 21.</p>

<p>I have gone into this and find that a man and wife actually get less from the Army than they would on National Assistance. This is not a very

generous way to treat the National Service man. I cannot see why the day before a man is 21 he is not entitled to the full marriage allowance but on the day after that he is so entitled. If a man joins the Service of his own free will I can understand that there might be some case&#x2014;although I would not necessarily accept it&#x2014;but the position of the man who is conscripted is entirely different, and I am profoundly disappointed that the new pay code did nothing to rectify his position.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might begin by giving what I hope will be a satisfactory answer to the first question asked me by the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg). He asked whether the new rates of pay applied to officers on short service commissions. The answer is that they do. He and other hon. Members asked how we intend to present future recruiting figures and figures of prolongations. As he knows, that is something which affects all three Services and the Ministry of Defence&#x2014;although I think that perhaps the other two Services do not get quite as much of the benefit of his advice and interrogation as do we&#x2014;</p>

<p>Oh, yes, they do. The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. I have done my best for all three Services; but of course the Army is my chief love, if I may so put it, and the Secretary of State for War has my particular attention because of his past misdemeanours.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman intends putting on his other two hats later today&#x2014;and no doubt he will do his stuff.<br/>
All three Services and the Ministry of Defence are at the moment trying to work out the best way of presenting those figures so as to give the maximum information, and particularly to show ourselves and everyone else who is interested what are the effects of the new terms of service and the new rates of pay. It is, therefore, not yet possible for me to make a definite statement. I must say that I think there is every advantage in the suggestion put forward by the hon. Gentleman that as far as the Army is concerned we should show the different engagements and break down the figures into engagements of three, six, and nine years, and so on.<br/>
As to prolongations, as the hon. Gentleman knows better than anyone else, we have since April of last year been giving him figures of these, but I understand that he would like them issued as a regular statement&#x2014;</p>

<p>Quarterly, yes. I think that that is a reasonable suggestion and I see no reason why we should not do it. In any case, I hope that he will no longer find it necessary to generate quite so much heat over these questions.<br/>
I should like to take up a point made by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Swingler), who is, I think, being very unjust in accusing my right hon. Friend of concealment with regard to the three engagements. Our reason for not giving the figures sooner was that sufficient time had not elapsed to judge results. As soon as sufficient time had elapsed we produced those figures as he knows. That was in April of last year.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dudley asked several questions about West Africa, and I will deal first with the future of the West Africa Command. As the hon. Gentleman indicated, that Command will cease to exist on 1st July, 1956. The troops in West Africa will then divide into four separate Commands&#x2014;the Gold Coast, where the Governor will assume responsibility, and Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Gambia, each of which will have its own commander and staff, who will come under the War Office.</p>

<p>Yes, I think so, but I will let the hon. Member know. I noticed that fact and noticed also that in another place there were four Commands mentioned.<br/>
Each of those Commands will come directly under the War Office. Of course, there will continue to be problems common to all four&#x2014;or, if the hon. Member is right, to all three. For that reason close contact will be kept between the Commands, and the way in which that can best be done is still being worked out between the respective Governments and Governors and between the War Office and the Colonial Office. Another measure to ensure that the overall picture is kept in view is the retention of the Army Advisory Council for West Africa. That will, of course, remain in being.<br/>
The question of the proposed West African Military Academy was discussed by the Advisory Council last November, when it was agreed that further consideration of proposal for the Academy should be postponed for the time being. That was largely on grounds of what it would cost to set up a separate establishment. Instead of that, for the time being&#x2014;and I emphasise "for the time being"&#x2014;the intention is that every encouragement should be given to the sending of suitable cadets to Sandhurst for training. I was asked about the vacancies there. At the moment there are ten West African cadets at Sandhurst, and up to now we have always been able to find vacancies for all applicants. If there is a great increase in the number of applications, the other projects will obviously become more urgent, but at the moment the problem is looked after very well by the present arrangements. One must go gradually in these matters; it is no good trying to rush them.<br/>
The hon. Member spoke of the rank of effendi which is being introduced. An effendi will be a warrant officer. It is felt that by the introduction of this rank a gradual transition can be brought about smoothly and efficiently. I can assure the hon. Member that there is no intention of putting West African officers on a lower level. These people will be warrant officers.<br/>
I was glad to find that such an old soldier, if I may so describe him, as the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Simmons) approved, on the whole, of the new pay code. He asked for more information to show results and, as I told his hon. Friend, that will be forthcoming. I hope that when they have studied this


information we shall have even better-informed speeches from both of them than we have had in the past.<br/>
The hon. Member asked whether it was our intention to abolish National Service grants. It is certainly not our intention to do that, otherwise we should have made no provision for them in the Estimates. The reason the sum provided is slightly lower is that there has been a falling off in the number of applications for them, presumably because the need has been less, but I am surprised to find how many hon. Members do not know about these grants. I am continually having to write to hon. Members to remind them of the existence of National Service grants. I am not referring to the hon. Member for Brierley Hill, who knows all about them, and about a lot of other things, too.</p>

<p>Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what information is given to recruits about National Service grants, because often when I hear of hardship cases and tell men about these grants, that is the first they have heard about them? There ought to be a much more effective publicity service to men when they join and to their parents. Sometimes the men do not make an allotment to their parents. They should be told that they are entitled to National Service grants.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. Gentleman raised that point because, in addition to what I consider to be the very adequate arrangements which exist for informing soldiers about them, some months ago we drew up what I believe will be a useful pamphlet addressed not to the soldiers but to their parents, putting all these matters in clear and simple language. We have taken a great deal of trouble with it and I believe it will be very useful. I hope hon. Members will direct the attention of their constituents to it. We cannot do more than publish these documents, but hon. Members can sometimes help to get people to read them.</p>

<p>During the summer I went to the dep&#x00F4;t of the Worcester Regiment about which my hon. Friend the Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Simmons), who represents the constituency next door, is

worried. I found that the arrangements there were admirable. If the young men would only pay attention to the information which is available, I am sure there would be no trouble. What pleased me very much was that the commanding officer of the dep&#x00F4;t went to endless trouble to make young men aware of the fact that to get a National Service grant they must make a voluntary allotment of 1s. 6d. a day and fill in a form.<br/>
Every effort which can be made is made to help the young men coming from Dudley and Brierley Hill, but of course I am speaking only about the infantry and I am not sure what happens in the other services and the Artillery. The main dep&#x00F4;t with which we are concerned is all right in this respect, but possibly other depots are not as good.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for what he said, and I am glad to hear of the situation at this dep&#x00F4;t. The more that can be done to bring these arrangements to the attention of more people, the better.<br/>
I was also asked a question about Korea gratuities. The explanation of the proportion between officers and other ranks is that the higher the rank the higher the gratuity. It does not mean that there is an unduly high proportion of officers in Korea.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) and the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) spoke anxiously about the upward trend in costs. I do not want to be out of order and I will not, therefore, speak about the Estimates as a whole, but perhaps I might draw the attention of those hon. Members to the beginning of my right hog. Friend's Estimates speech in which he pointed out that the Estimates are down by &#x00A3;100 million on a total of &#x00A3;500 million since 1953, which shows that the inflationary tendency has been checked, at any rate in the Army.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham asked a question about perquisites. He asked whether it was necessary to have all these allowances&#x2014;some of which I will not mention because they ought not to be discussed on this Vote&#x2014;in view of the pay increases. The answer is quite clearly that they were taken into account when the pay increases


were agreed. Anybody with any knowledge of Whitehall would realise that that is bound to be the case. We are concerned to see that soldiers are paid a reasonable rate of pay which compares favourably with that of other careers and professions.<br/>
The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme made, I think, a less constructive speech than usual. He said he was disturbed by our departure from previous policies and then proceeded to demolish the previous policies. It is therefore difficult to see what he likes. He advocated simplicity, and I agree with him that the pay system in the Army has never been simple, but, desirable as simplicity may be, it is important not to sacrifice the results at which we are aiming in order to attain simplicity.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also suggested that we had concealed the results obtained from the introduction of the three-year engagement. As I have tried to show, that is definitely not the case. With all his enthusiasm, the hon. Member for Dudley succeeded in extracting from us only what he would have got in any case.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages, all we got was wrath and froth from the Secretary of State. Three years from the time he introduced his three-year engagement&#x2014;about 1st November, 1954&#x2014;we began to put down Questions to him. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Swingler) joined in those Questions. We got a set of figures which enabled us to establish beyond any shadow of a doubt that the Secretary of State's optimum, his hope&#x2014;call it what you wish&#x2014;of 33&#x2153; per cent. was just not on, and we said in our charity that it would be something less than 10 per cent. That angered the Secretary of State, and for a period of many months he did his best to conceal from the House and the country the fact that the policy was an abject failure and that he would never get even 10 per cent. That is the blunt truth. It is quite true that from April onwards, when the Secretary of State's policy of concealment could not be carried any further, he began to come clean, and we did get the actual figure of 4&#x00B7;5 per cent. from him. But very early on&#x2014;</p>

<p>I think I know what the hon. Gentleman was going to say anyhow, because I have heard him say it so often before. If this is the burying of the hatchet, I am sorry that my right hon. Friend should not be here for such an important occasion, and I am sure he will miss it as much as the hon. Gentleman. No doubt we may be able to unearth some other hatchets to take its place.<br/>
I should like to say on the question of concealment that, as I have already said, and as my right hon. Friend has said over and over again, the reason why we did not give the information in question sooner was simply that it was not available. It was not possible to judge what the results of the three-year engagement were until it had been running for long enough to see. When the results were shown, two things emerged: first of all, that it had not come up to the optimum, which is quite a different thing from an expectation, because it was an optimum that my right hon. Friend had mentioned, and he was the first to admit that; and the other fact that emerged was that it was the three-year engagement&#x2014;whatever the hon. Gentleman may say about it, and to whomsoever he may attribute its rather doubtful paternity, because I know that he likes getting in a left and a right on these occasions, if I may call it that&#x2014;whoever takes the credit for it or the blame, that got us through the last three years as the five-year engagement would not have done.<br/>
I am sorry that almost all the remarks of the hon. and gallant Member for Brixton (Lieut.-Colonel Lipton) were out of order, and that I am therefore deprived of the pleasure of giving him the information which I had prepared for him. Perhaps we might meet on a later


occasion, or perhaps he might put down a Question and we shall have the answer ready.<br/>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) suggested that the new pay code was hard on the National Service man. I think that in general the rates at which we pay National Service men in this country compare favourably with those paid in almost any other country in the world. We should, of course, like to increase them, but the funds available are, as the hon. Gentleman will realise, naturally limited. We did ourselves feel that in this case, instead of concentrating on further increasing the pay of National Service men and further increasing the marriage allowances, we would concentrate on the Regular with the object of increasing our Regular recruiting, which, as everybody knows, is the chief aim of our policy.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-03-15a.597.0" hansard_membership_id="8210" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29332" speakername="Mr. Willis" colnum="597" time="">
<p>Surely it is quite wrong to compare the rates of pay of National Service men of this country with the rates of pay of National Service men of other countries. That might mean anything. We must compare them with the rates of pay in the Services here and the rates of pay outside the Services. The very fact that the hon. Gentleman admits that he gets so many letters from Members of this House concerning hardship indicates that these rates of pay and the very small marriage allowance of 1s. per day until a man is 21 is really too small for the National Service man. When we look, too, at the very size of this Vote in respect of National Service grants, the fact that it is almost &#x00A3;500,000 indicates that there is a great deal of hardship which could be avoided if the National Service man were treated rather more generously. To give him an increase of 6d. per day is really rather insulting in present circumstances. As I have said, to give him a very limited marriage allowance also puts the man in a very difficult position.<br/>
I do not think the hon. Gentleman has answered the criticisms about National Service men too well. If the aim is to get a Regular Army and to abolish National Service, well and good; but then I should have thought there might also be a case for increasing the National Service man's pay, because the cost would become smaller in respect of National Service men and we could afford to be

rather more generous. In any case, I am bound to say that I still do not think the hon. Gentleman's answer is at all satisfactory regarding National Service men.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might draw attention to one fact, and that is that the hon. Gentleman spoke about the large sum we spend in National Service grants. First of all, that is what National Service grants are for, to relieve any hardship where there is hardship. Secondly, I would draw his attention to the fact that there has been reduction in the sum allotted for that purpose because there has been a reduction in the number of applications, which shows that it is becoming less necessary rather than more necessary. We are also, as he himself has said, doing something to help the National Service man. It is not only a question of policy, but is also fair that a man who makes the Army his career should get a higher differential, with which I know lots of hon. Members opposite agree.</p>

<q>The Mobile Defence Corps was formed on 1st April, 1955, and provides the second echelon of Civil Defence.</q>

If the Mobile Defence Corps is the second echelon, could we have some information about the first echelon of Civil Defence and how exactly the Reserve will operate? We are told:
<q>It will comprise 36 battalions. A Headquarters of the Mobile Defence Corps has been established to deal with their administration.</q>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
I should like to know how far this Headquarters administration is facing the problem with Which, presumably, it is supposed to deal. What are the thirty-six battalions to do? Will they cooperate with the civil defence forces and are they to take part in the organisation of the twelve million evacuees? We have been told that twelve million people would be evacuated in an emergency and I was told this week that one million were to be evacuated in Scotland. I should like to know exactly how this Mobile Defence Corps will operate, whether its activities will be co-ordinated with Civil Defence and exactly what kind of activity is contemplated for the headquarters of the Corps.</p>

<p>This year's figures in Vote 2, and particularly subhead E&#x2014;"Training of the Territorial Army"&#x2014;show a noticeable reduction. This is due to the reduced structure of the Territorial Army which has been announced by my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Defence. I should, however, like to put to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary a point concerning the training programme as now outlined and to suggest that there is danger that the sum which is allocated may not be well spent.<br/>
I say that because under the new arrangement one year only is to be taken by the National Service men for training by the Territorial Army. There is a danger that we will get the worst of both worlds because the Territorial Army, which up to now has been responsible for training National Service men over a longer period and has had National Service men within its ranks, will now have them for such a short period that it is extremely unlikely that the National Service men will regard themselves as part of the Territorial units or that the money for which this provision is made in the Estimates will be well spent.<br/>
Another aspect is that psychologically the National Service men, having been


trained by the Regular Army under excellent conditions, might as a result of this rather piecemeal method of training form a poorer opinion of the Army than would have been the case had they come out after their period of Regular Service training. I suggest that my hon. Friend should look at the training plan closely. A smaller amount of money spent on building up a purely voluntary Territorial Army on the old system would probably be a better method than spending this greater amount of money on a Territorial Army which will continue to have a National Service commitment but of a reduced nature.<br/>
The Government could argue that this is similar to the commitment for the Z Reservists introduced some years ago by the previous Administration. The justification for the Z scheme&#x2014;and, I assume, the justification for the present scheme&#x2014;was that it associated men with definite Territorial Army units. I can appreciate that requirement, but whereas the previous Administration brought it in at a time when it was very necessary to have a quick mobilisation scheme I do not think that there is that necessity at present.<br/>
If it is suggested that this arrangement will strengthen the Territorial Army, I submit that probably it will not but that, on the contrary, it will have the opposite effect. If, on the other hand, the reason for it is that men must be associated with Territorial units to provide an effective mobilisation scheme, I suggest that this is not the type of mobilisation scheme we need at present. If instead of this arrangement my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary would study closer association between Territorial units and their Regular counterparts and made certain that the men knew which Territorial units were involved, I suggest that he would achieve the exact results at which he is aiming in these proposals.<br/>
I know that this is a matter of my opinion against my hon. Friend's, backed by experts at the War Office, but I should like him to consider the point and keep an open mind on this proposal, certainly for the coming year. If at the end of the year my fears prove justified, I hope that my hon. Friend will be prepared next year to propose that this scheme be changed and the Vote again reduced to have a purely voluntary Territorial Army

in the old style, with National Service men earmarked for Territorial units but not actually sent to them. The Territorial units, however, should have a very clear idea who the men are so that they can recruit them on a voluntary Territorial basis.<br/>
On the question of the Army Emergency Reserve and the Home Guard, the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) and I are, for once, on the same point&#x2014;probably with the same end in view but for different purposes. It seems to me that the money here expended is being expended on three different arms each with a similar end in view. The Territorial Army, the Army Emergency Reserve and the Home Guard are all concerned primarily with home defence commitments. The point made by the hon. Member for South Ayrshire indicates that there is a certain amount of confusion in people's minds. They feel that the whole of the home defence picture is now somewhat confused.<br/>
I believe that the decision to appoint a commander-in-chief for the home front, responsible for these home commitments, is of the greatest possible importance. The Under-Secretary of State for War would do well to ask him to look at this important problem in the course of the year and make recommendations. If we are to have effective expenditure of money on home defence, one of the most important things to do is to change the national psychological climate on the home defence front. If we look at home defence as a sort of stirrup-pump operation not fully operational, the expenditure of this money will not be justified and we shall not have the type of home defence system we require in modern conditions.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire referred to civil defence, but I and the Under-Secretary of State for War would be out of order if we discussed that now. I believe, however, that this Estimate is closely related to the organisation of a civil defence force on an operational scale over the coming years. I hope that my hon. Friend will look at the Estimate with a view to greater co-ordination of the home defence forces.<br/>
I suggest quite seriously to my hon. Friend that the expenditure now incurred on these three separate arms would be


better incurred if he considered the abolition of the Emergency Reserve and the Home Guard and the total concentration of the whole force under the Territorial Army. I would include, in particular, the new mobile defence battalions because these also are from a psychological point of view out on a limb. They are separate projects on which quite considerable sums have been spent. I suggest that my hon. Friend should look at the whole commitment with special reference to home defence operation, and consider presenting to the House in the Memorandum on the Army Estimates next year a very much more definite plan for the reserve forces within the home defence picture.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) asked what is the purpose of the Mobile Defence Corps. He must know that. It has been explained over and over again both in the House and in the Press. It will engage in rescue work in support of civil defence. He asked me to enlarge on what civil defence is going to do. That would be out of order. Therefore, I will now pass to the extremely interesting speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Ian Harvey).<br/>
My hon. Friend speaks with great authority&#x2014;no one speaks with more&#x2014;on the Territorial Army and on the reserve forces as a whole. I assure him that his extremely interesting suggestions will be very carefully studied. I was very glad to hear him say in an earlier debate that he thought there was a great future for the reserve Army. I wholeheartedly agree with him. What is more, it would be a great mistake to think, as has been sometimes suggested, that the fighting days of the Territorial Army are over. It is very difficult indeed to foretell with any accuracy what course any future war will take, and the next one is not likely to prove an exception to that rule.<br/>
That is one of the reasons why, as my right hon. Friend said in presenting the Army Estimates, it would be folly for us to be left with untrained reserves in this country. That is our principal reason at present for retaining the one camp for National Service men. It is, of course, quite true that the emphasis is no longer

as heavy as it was on the need for large reserves of trained men, but we have to be ready for all kinds of eventualities and there is no doubt at all that, for the reasons which my right hon. Friend gave, even one camp is of use for the purpose of associating them with their units. That purpose would not be served to the same extent by simply earmarking them and having them posted on paper to a definite unit. It is most important that they should see each other and should know how they fit into the machine.<br/>
6.0 p.m.<br/>
My hon. Friend mentioned the possibility of doing away with the Army Emergency Reserve and merging the whole thing&#x2014;the T.A., the A.E.R., the Mobile Defence Corps and the Home Guard&#x2014;into a single Home Defence Force. The possibility of doing that is obviously one of the problems which the newly-appointed Commander-in-Chief, U.K. Land Forces, will be studying. All that I can say at the moment is that this is a transitional period. Quite obviously, there would be great advantage in having what my hon. Friend suggested, namely, an all-volunteer Territorial Army, and I know that there are a lot of Territorials, and for that matter a lot of Regular soldiers, who feel that it would be a good thing, but at present we need National Service men to make up the numbers in the Territorial Army units, especially those which are scheduled to go overseas in case of war. We feel that one year's training&#x2014;one camp&#x2014;is the minimum required to keep the National Service men up to date.<br/>
We have had very big changes in the last year or eighteen months, and I think it is possible that in the future we shall have more big changes. Events are moving very fast and we are determined to keep up with them.</p>

<p>I cannot understand why, in Vote 5, the inland and coastwise conveyance of personnel, travelling allowances and expenses, in subhead A, has gone up by &#x00A3;850,000. As Vote A is down by some 38,000, or about 4 per cent., and as the Army is smaller by about 4 per cent., one would have expected that these travelling allowances would also have gone down by about &#x00A3;800,000. In fact, one would have looked for an economy in this direction of about &#x00A3;1,600,000 altogether.<br/>
I want to ask my hon. Friend how the increase has come about, and whether it represents an additional use of concession tickets and concessionary fares. I motor about a certain amount at the weekends and I often pick up young men in the Army and give them lifts. It is astonishing how far they go at the weekend, perhaps 150 or 200 miles, by way of lifts on the outward journey. They then use their concession tickets to go back on the railway, and many of them do this about three out of every four weekends. Therefore, one would expect that the expense to the Army of these concession tickets has gone up very considerably.<br/>
I should also like to ask whether the necessity for the home-to-duty travelling allowance is still justified. This was brought in during the war to enable officers and men to visit their wives when the latter had been bombed out of their homes in the bombed cities, but I understand that it is still in use in the Service. For instance, an officer who, say, has a house in the country and who makes a statement that he is making every reasonable effort to find a house nearer to his military base but cannot do so, therefore still receives this home-to-duty concession.<br/>
That is something which, in civilian life, would be looked upon very adversely indeed, and it has been resisted very generally in industry. I should like to ask my hon. Friend whether it has been abused or in any way turned into a "fiddle." I should also like to know why we have not made the economy of &#x00A3;1,600,000.</p>

<p>I hope that when the Under-Secretary replies he will tell us whether the statements which have just been made by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) are accurate or not. I have always thought that concessionary fares were limited to authorised leave, and I am very surprised indeed to learn that literally thousands of troops are swarming round the country, apparently with unauthorised vouchers in their pockets. That must be so, unless the people whom the hon. Gentleman has picked up have been a little odd. The hon. Gentleman gives me the impression that almost every soldier whom he picked up had a return voucher in his pocket, and why a soldier should travel in the hon. Gentleman's car on the outward journey and go back on a concessionary voucher is utterly and completely beyond me.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can answer my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke). First, he asks why it is that, although the number of troops has gone down, travelling costs have gone up. The answer to that is fairly simple. The main reason is because railway fares and bus fares have gone up, and therefore it costs more for them to travel. There is another reason, and it is that, with the increase in the strategic reserve, there are more troops in the United Kingdom, and therefore more troops travelling.<br/>
As regards the concessions, the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg), as so often is the case, is quite right&#x2014;I do not say always, but very often. A soldier may travel on a concessionary voucher only when in possession of a leave pass. Another point is that the cost of the concession is borne by British Railways and is not a charge upon public funds. We are extremely grateful to British Railways for granting this concession, so that the question really does not arise on this Vote.<br/>
In regard to the home-to-duty travelling allowance, I think my hon. Friend answered his question himself. These allowances are given when soldiers, for


reasons outside their control, live at a distance from their work, and it is only fair that they should have these allowances. As I have said before, all these things were taken into account in fixing the new pay increases, and there is really no question, in spite of the very satisfactory nature of the increases, of soldiers of any rank getting more than they deserve, and certainly no case of a "fiddle."</p>

<p>I should like to say a word or two about what has been said by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) because it seems to me that members of the Forces are in great danger when they accept lifts from the hon. Gentleman. I am wondering whether it is not the responsibility of the War Office and of the other Services to have a small notice published, so that they can put it in the hon. Gentleman's car, reading to this effect: "Beware. Do not accept any rides from this gentleman because he is only finding out something about you in regard to your concessionary fares which might in the long run be very detrimental to you."<br/>
I think it is only fair that something of that sort should be done, as a result of the points raised by the hon. Member, especially when it seems quite clear that he has got his information under the pretence of appearing to be a benefactor to those poor chaps who are trying to get home to their wives and families. I think it is incumbent upon me to ask the War Office to prepare a document of some sort for the guidance of these boys.</p>

<p>Great attention is paid to pay and accommodation of the Forces, but we do not often spend time on the question of rationing, which is an important subject. In February last it was brought to our notice that the Secretary of State for War was not as up to date on this subject as he might be, because an advertisement appeared in <i>The Times</i> asking for a nutrition adviser. It was clear from the terms of the advertisement that the Secretary of State was not aware that the authoritative body on this subject was the Nutrition Society. I hope, however, that as a result of the interchanges which took place on that and on a subsequent occasion, both he and his advisers at the War Office are now aware that there are competent people in the country who are carrying out research into balanced diet, and I hope that they are taking advantage of these researches.<br/>
I understand that considerable work has been done on emergency rations which troops might be called upon to use during operations. This policy was developed during the war, but since that time not a great deal had been done until a year or so ago. As a result of the work of the Under-Secretary of State himself, I understand there has been a great improvement in the quality and variety of the combat rations which troops could use when called upon to undertake operations in conditions in which supply is difficult. Obviously this is of the greatest importance, because in certain circumstances the success of operations might be in doubt if supplies of rations had not been carefully planned.<br/>
The Committee would be glad to learn from the hon. Gentleman of the developments which have taken place, because not only are these of value in the kind of operations which our troops are called upon to undertake at present&#x2014;as for instance, in Malaya and Kenya, and perhaps even in Cyprus&#x2014;but also if, unfortunately, larger operations ever developed they would have tremendous value.<br/>
I hope the Army is keeping in touch with the civil authorities to see that the Army Catering Corps is kept at the highest level. There was a time in the Army when it was thought that all the psychiatrists who had become a bit "touched" with their own psychiatry had gone into the Army Catering Corps. That view, when it becomes widespread, is not good for morale. It would be good for the Army, therefore, if we could hear from the hon. Gentleman that, now we are ten years away from the war, the Army Catering Corps is composed of cooks and not exclusively of unemployed psychiatrists.</p>

<p>Certain hon. Gentlemen who have just left us, who were so concerned about economy, will no doubt have been pleased to see that food and ration allowances are down by &#x00A3;4,220,000 on this Estimate. We ought to have an explanation from the Under-Secretary of State in that respect. I agree with my hon. Friend that the arrangements for the feeding of the men in the Forces are just as important as pay. Of course in the old days, when people went into the Forces because of unemployment and poverty, that was not so important, because what they got in the Army was better than what they were able to get when they were standing on the street corner or in the dole queue.<br/>
I remember that in my old Army days there used to be a saying, "What is a fine sight?" The answer was, "Two hot dinners on one plate." That was a commentary on the kind of people who used to go into the Army in those days. Now, however, there is a higher standard of living in the country, and that must be maintained for the men in the Forces. Also it has to be proved to those entering the Forces that they will be given food comparable to what they could enjoy outside.<br/>
I notice under Subhead A that provision is also made for animal feeding stuffs, including forage for horses and mules and food for dogs. Could we know what proportion of the money provided goes to the horses, mules and dogs and what goes to the human animal? Again, I hope that there is no sinister significance about this line on page 121:
<q>Provision for the purchase of animals is made under Subhead D</q>

This comes under rations. I hope that we are not feeding our troops on horse flesh? Can we be told why that should be included at all? Then, under Subhead B, "Solid fuel, Electricity and Gas," there are these words in the last paragraph:
<q>In order to control the consumption of food in commands at home and abroad, a fuel target based &#x2026;</q>
I thought a target was something that had to be achieved. Would not the words "fuel quota" be more explicit, or does Tory doctrinaire policy preclude us from having the word "quota" mentioned in these Estimates?<br/>
On the question of barrack services, do barrack damages come under that heading? Also, what are the maintenance costs of the old barracks compared with the new barracks which are being erected today? I should imagine that much of the &#x00A3;750,000 is spent on maintenance of buildings, many of which it might be better to destroy and to replace by something more modern and habitable.</p>

<p>If my recollection serves me correctly, there are about 700 horses on the establishment and it is presumably in respect of those horses that some of this forage is required. By some wise administration on the part of the War Office, about 12 million horseshoe nails are available for these 700 horses. That seems to disclose some discrepancy about which the Under-Secretary might like to furnish some explanation. I understand that some of these 12 million nails are to be sold in the near future. It strikes me as odd that with the diminution of the horse population of the Army, there has grown up this vast accumulation of 12 million horseshoe nails.</p>

<p>I will deal first with the remarks of the hon. and gallant Member for Brixton (Lieut.-Colonel Lipton). I am afraid that he is out of order, because horseshoe nails are not rations. [HON. MEMBERS: "Iron rations."] The same applies to the remarks about the maintenance of barracks and buildings made by the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Simmons). That comes under Vote 8, and I should therefore be out of order to discuss it.</p>

<p>That makes clear what things are involved and it has nothing to do with the maintenance of buildings. It has to do with barrack services. The hon. Member also asked what proportion of the Vote was spent on feeding animals. That is made clear on page 122. As the hon. and gallant Member for Brixton pointed out, we have only about 700 or 800 horses and mules and we are not really in danger of them eating us or the Army out of house and home.<br/>
The question why there has been a reduction in the Vote is simply answered by the reduction in the strength of the active Army and the Territorial Army. It is also accounted for by the reductions of certain civilian services in Germany and repayment services.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) raised the topic of the combat ration. He may remember that when he came to see me about a year ago he found my room at the War Office filled with existing 24-hour rations unpacked and scattered all over the place. We looked at the pack together and we came to the conclusion that it had several disadvantages. They were that it was too heavy for the purposes for which it is intended, as a 24-hour ration for use on operations, mainly the sort of operations when the soldier will have to carry his food on his back&#x2014;and that it was too complicated and too elaborate. There were four different menus, including items such as eggs and bacon, liver and bacon, steak and kidney pudding and tinned ginger pudding.<br/>
It will be obvious to hon. Members that although that sort of ration is excellent if one is sitting still and has plenty of time to prepare and eat it, it is not ideally suited to combat conditions. The benefit of the extra variety is more than out-balanced by the need for the individual to carry extra weight. Speaking as an amateur, but as one who thinks a great deal about his food and who has also eaten a certain number of these rations when they were first started in the war, I would much sooner have something lighter and simpler, and I believe that most soldiers would feel the same way.<br/>
During the past year we have been aiming at producing that. Subject to the results of the troop trials which are to take place in the summer, we have

succeeded quite well. We have had the advantage of the best professional and expert opinion in the matter and it has not been left to retired psychologists. We have had the advice of dietitians, or nutritians, or both&#x2014;I can never member which it is; I know that the hon. Member for Dudley knows one of the most distinguished in the country, so that no doubt he finds it easier to remember the difference.<br/>
I have with me a 24-hour ration of the new type. We have done away with tins completely. The ration can be carried in its pack and weighs only 27 oz. as against 4 lb., which makes a big difference. It is well packed and consists of a lump of dehydrated meat, which can be eaten cooked or uncooked, an oatmeal block, some chocolate, some cheese, soup powder and powdered tea, sugar and milk. I have not tried it, although I intend to try it, and I am assured that it is capable of all sorts of permutations and combinations which make it palatable and sustaining.<br/>
Perhaps I can say a word about catering in the Army generally and about the general ration scale. We watch that very closely indeed. Most of the complaints that have been made about food and which have come to me have been found to be due to bad preparation and wastage of rations and not to the quality of the rations themselves. We have been, and still are, going into that carefully, and we have done everything we can to see that food is well cooked and that materials are well used and attractively presented. We are actively examining the possibility of a general improvement in ration scales.</p>

<p>I view this Vote with some suspicion, because according


to a note on page 135 it provides for expenditure on the construction and maintenance of War Department buildings, including the purchase of engineers' stores and materials. I suspect that these include paint of which about a quarter of a million gallons were recently sold as surplus. How much provision has been made under the heading of engineers' stores and materials for paint during the forthcoming financial year?<br/>
The Under-Secretary informed the House that notwithstanding the tremendous sales of paint which I described on a previous occasion as a colossal Niagara on which very serious losses have been incurred, about 1,100,000 gallons have been taken into stock since 1st January, 1955. Most of it was ordered during 1953 or early 1954. If that is so, it seems that the War Department is more than adequately provided with paint. I should not like to think that in a few months time the War Department will find much of this paint surplus, and that we shall have further substantial sales of surplus paint.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
It used to be said in the old days that every soldier had a field marshal's baton in his knapsack. It looks now as if every soldier has a five gallon drum of paint in his knapsack, provided for him by the War Department. If the Under-Secretary can remove some of my serious apprehensions on this matter I shall be very grateful to him, and I think that the general public will be grateful to him. The Federation of Paint Contractors, a very reputable organisation, takes a poor view of the whole situation.</p>

<p>A great deal of this money is spent on maintaining existing barracks, including some in Cyprus. The

fact is, as my right hon. Friend has said over and over again, that a great many of our barracks are in very bad condition indeed. This is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs, as we are the first to admit. One of its worst features is that it involves, and has involved for the last fifty years, spending very large sums on the maintenance of buildings which are not really worth it.<br/>
The only answer is to get on with our current twenty years' building programme, and to build new barracks as fast as we can. That we are doing, given the limitations which are imposed on us by competition from other sources and by lack of funds. In the meanwhile, we must have somewhere for the troops to live, and we have to make those premises as habitable as possible. That explains this expenditure under the Vote.</p>

<p>I want to raise one or two questions on Vote 10. I notice that on page 165 of the Estimates we are told that,
<q>In certain cases the provisions of the Pay Warrant, 1940, continue in operation.</q>
I presume that covers the pensions and allowances to which the Vote refers. The cost of living has gone up considerably since 1940, and I should like to know why, in certain circumstances, and in what circumstances, we are still having these cases computed on the Pay Warrant of 1940.<br/>
Does the question of retired pay and half-pay, referred to on page 167 of the Estimates, mean that only field marshals get half-pay? That is how it reads to me. Field marshals get half-pay and they never retire. They are either on active service or on half-active service. How many of these half-pay field marshals are there to share the &#x00A3;10,000


provided for under that head in the Estimates?<br/>
Under Subhead A there is a reference to wound pensions. Are these a survival? I notice that they apply only to officers; nothing is said about other ranks. I remember that in the 1914&#x2013;18 war I had three wound stripes which I wore on my sleeve like vertical sergeant's stripes instead of across the sleeve, but there was no "lolly" attached to them. Should not these compensation payments for wounds come under the Ministry of Pensions and National Service, or are these additional to the disability pensions to which these officers would be otherwise entitled?<br/>
I want to say a word about the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, under Subhead E. Why do we need 187 staff for 460 patients. This is about one to every two-and-a-half patients. That seems a little extravagant. Why are there only 460 patients when we are told that the establishment of the hospital is 558? I could find for Chelsea Hospital quite a number of eligible disabled men who would be very happy to go there if they had the opportunity. I should like to ask whether there is any liaison between Chelsea Hospital and the Ministry of Pensions and National Service, because the Ministry must know of thousands of deserving single men who are in need of care and attention.<br/>
When I was at the Ministry of Pensions some time ago I went to Ireland, where there is one hospital which is kept open entirely for old pensioners in need of care and attention&#x2014;not just medical attention. There must be many 1914&#x2013;18 and even Boer War veterans who could be accommodated in Chelsea Hospital. I ask the Minister to tell us why it is below establishment, with only 460 patients when there is room for 558; and whether he will taken steps to direct the Ministry of Pensions, War Pensions Division, to see if something can be done to fill the vacancies.<br/>
I should like to know why, when men go into Chelsea Hospital, their pension is taken away. That may be one of the deterrents to getting men into Chelsea. I should also like to know why the office staff at Chelsea get accommodation, pay or retired pay and pension. They receive accommodation, their pay and still get their pension, but the patients who go there lose their pension. I cannot under

stand why that is so, and I should be obliged if the Minister would let me know why this applies to Chelsea, and whether it would not be a good idea for Chelsea Pensioners to be merged into the general pensions scheme of the country, when we might be able to ge rid of some of the archaic regulations which govern the place at the present time.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Simmons) raised a number of points of detail. He referred to the 1940 Pay Warrant, and asked for an explanation of the sentence to which he referred, which appears on page 165. The answer is that pensions, or whatever it may be, are drawn under the Pay Warrant in force when one retires. The hon. Member asked about pensions before 1921, and that again is something which has been replaced, except for the individual pensioners concerned, by the general scheme under the Ministry of Pensions. I seem to remember the hon. Member asking his question about field marshals on a previous occasion.</p>

<p>Field marshals are on what is called half-pay. At one time I think there were large numbers of officers on half-pay, possibly that was before the 1914 war. This is simply a survival of that. As the hon. Member himself said, field marshals never retire, and this is a way of rewarding them for the great services which they have rendered to the country in order to reach that exalted rank.<br/>
To answer the hon. Member's questions about the pensioners at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, the pension is taken away because the board and lodging and other amenities provided are considered to take its place. The office staff are paid their pensions because they are working for their living, and they have certain perquisites. In every case they are old soldiers with extremely good records, and I think it right that in those circumstances they should be allowed to keep their pensions.<br/>
The hon. Member raised one or two other matters but he did not give me notice of his intention to do so. However, I will look into them and give him a detailed reply.</p>

<p>Surely the Under-Secretary is not correct when he says that the patients at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, have their pensions taken away in order to pay for their board and lodging? That may be the effect of it, but the point is that the pension is taken away irrespective of what it amounts to, and if a man cares to leave the hospital at any time, his pension is restored. Obviously, therefore, it means that a man may give up quite a large pens-ion&#x2014;or perhaps when it comes to my turn to go to the hospital I shall give up only a few shillings; and therefore that has nothing to do with the cost of board and lodging.</p>

<p>One of the good things about discussing the Estimates of the three Services together

at this stage is that while one is waiting for the Air Force Estimates one learns so much of the problems of the Army. I never realised that horses and mules and bags of nails figured to such a great degree in the problems of the Army. I am only sorry that it is not relevant when discussing the Air Force Estimates to refer to the camels which are on the Air Force establishment, particularly as I read in the paper that someone said that obviously a camel is an animal designed and developed by a committee.<br/>
Those of us who have taken part in these debates on Service Estimates over the last ten years will agree that our procedure in dealing with Votes in this way leaves much to be desired, because we are not getting enough information and consequently it is difficult to debate these matters. We must improve the procedure or we shall have less interest taken in the debates and the Services will suffer as a result. In fact, in the long run the whole administration of the country will suffer. We are spending &#x00A3;500 million on the Air Force and a considerable proportion of that money comes under Vote 1 which we are now considering. We need the fullest information to justify that, but we do not get it.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
It is our duty to make complaints and criticisms, and I will make one criticism which I intimated at an earlier stage in our discussions. I wish to ask the Secretary of State to look carefully into the procedure in the Air Force for inquiring into crashes to see whether some improvement could be made in the procedure and more publicity given. Surely an inquiry should be closed to the public only if matters concerning&#x2014;</p>

<p>So far as I am aware, that is not the case. Vote 1 deals

with what it says, that is, with pay for the various items set out in the Vote. I would remind the hon. Member that a general discussion such as he suggests now always takes place on the Motion, "That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair." In Committee we deal with specific details.</p>

<p>I thank you for reminding me of that, Sir Rhys. I will deal with one or two points which I am confident are in order upon Vote 1, in connection with pay and allowances for the Commonwealth Reserve in Malaya. I raised this matter in the Estimates debate and indicated that I would do so again.<br/>
In the case of an international force, such as N.A.T.O., a system which permits differing rates of pay and allowances works fairly well, but in the case of a Commonwealth Reserve, composed of men coming from different Commonwealth countries, wearing the same uniforms, having the same type of organisation and virtually the same regulations, differing rates of pay and allowances lead to a great deal of friction and difficulty. We ought to have some regard to this matter when we try to operate an integrated command. I should welcome any assurance from the Secretary of State that this point is being seriously considered. There is no point in discussing what happens in the case of N.A.T.O., because our men there are serving under different regulations altogether, and they recognise that fact.<br/>
My second point concerns education allowances. It is all very well for the Air Ministry to say, "There is plenty of turbulence and postings, and men have to be moved, and therefore they should receive a special education allowance for their children," but the Estimates for this year show an increase of only &#x00A3;200,000 in respect of that allowance. There is a &#x00A3;7 million increase in the pay Estimates, but the increase in respect of the education of their children is so small that I am wondering if it will make anything like the difference which the Air Ministry must hope it will.<br/>
There is no more important point for us to consider than the fact that when officers and men are moved about they must take care of the education of their children. This moving about, or turbulence, is bound to continue. Shortly after the war many calculations were


made upon the assumption that the turbulence would decrease, and it has&#x2014;but not to the extent expected. This increase in the amount voted is very small when it is compared with the provision made in respect of civilian employees of the Air Ministry. I believe it is true that civilian employees, in certain circumstances, receive greater education allowances for their children than are received by Service men.<br/>
The amount of money voted in respect of National Service men is also of very great importance. I am not arguing&#x2014;as one of my hon. Friends did&#x2014;that National Service men should receive the same rate of pay as Regulars; the whole idea is to induce men to become Regulars. But I want to know more about the planning of pay for National Service men, and how it will be related to the obvious future elimination of National Service and the reversion of Technical Command to its true purpose as a training command instead of an adult educational organisation as it is today.<br/>
I notice that the Estimates contain a reference to special allowances given to officers, airmen and airwomen serving long-term appointments in the United States of America. We realise that we have a good deal to learn from the Americans in certain matters connected with procurement of aircraft. What do these people go to the United States of America to study? Do they go there to study the American system of procurement, or do they merely do the ordinary diplomatic and air attach&#x00E8; jobs over there? In any case, are these rates sufficient, in view of the enormous expense to which they are bound to be put in the United States of America? I hope that the Secretary of State or the Under-Secretary of State will be able to answer some of the points that I have raised.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the question of the pay of airmen and airwomen, and also the various allowances which they are now receiving. Last year the amount voted in respect of airmen and airwomen was &#x00A3;49,150,000. For this year it has been increased by &#x00A3;12,550,000. The amount voted in respect of marriage allowance is now &#x00A3;12,515,000, and in respect of educational allowances,

&#x00A3;200,000. Then there are lodging allowances, miscellaneous allowances and National Insurance contributions, the amount voted for the last of which is now &#x00A3;3,480,000.<br/>
We are entitled to an assurance from the Minister that the sums voted for the coming year will be sufficient to meet all the normal needs of the airmen and airwomen in the Service. We want to be assured that the personnel serving in the Royal Air Force are now being provided with what I would call a living wage. I ask this question because there is some doubt about the matter, due to the fact that the sum of &#x00A3;49 million voted last year was not sufficient, in certain cases. Yesterday afternoon, in reply to a Question of mine, the Minister said:
<q>Thirty-six airmen at Hornchurch have at one time or another accepted casual employment at a local bakery in their spare time. I do not know of similar cases at any other station."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th March, 1956; Vol. 550, c. 370.]</q>
I put the point because I understand that this is a full-time job. I think we can assume that the reason why these airmen had to take this part-time job was that they were not being paid sufficient money to enable them to carry on normal life that we claim these citizens ought to be able to enjoy. Therefore, they had to take this type of employment in their spare time. The Minister told me it was casual employment but my information is that it was not. It was night baking, and the amount of money was in some cases as much as &#x00A3;12 per week. One could hardly say that that represented casual work.<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will tell us that this improvement of pay will be sufficient to make that kind of work unnecessary. A rapid calculation which I have made suggests that the improvement represents &#x00A3;1 per week, on the average, for airmen and airwomen. That does not include various allowances which will increase the average income. I want an assurance that airmen and airwomen will not be compelled, in order to improve their financial position because of our penurious attitude towards them, to spend their nights in this way, after they have spent their days looking after the defence of the country.<br/>
I do not know why the Minister sees anything funny in what I have said. It is wrong that even one airman should be in that position. I hope he will tell us with complete assurance that the system of which I complain is no longer necessary. He said that he did not know of any similar cases at any other station; I wonder whether he made inquiry or, since nobody got up in the House to call his attention to the matter, he has just assumed that there were no other cases.<br/>
We are not seeking to interfere with the rights of an airman to do what he likes in his spare time, but I submit that during the night he should be sleeping so as to make himself fit for his duties next day. He should not spend his spare time doing night baking. The Minister appears to have a wrong attitude towards this matter.<br/>
There is another aspect of night baking to which I want to call attention. It is&#x2014;</p>

The next point was that in Malaya we have an integrated headquarters in which are not only British officers from this country, but Australian and New Zealand officers, and whether their pay

ought not all to be the same. The hon. Gentleman sought to draw a distinction between headquarters with officers only from Commonwealth countries, and headquarters such as of N.A.T.O. with officers from many other countries. There is not really a distinction. If we are to pay our officers more, simply because they are serving with foreign or Commonwealth officers, we do something unfair to officers who are not serving in those conditions. The officer has to go wherever he is sent and to do the job which he is given. Leaving local overseas allowances out of account, the officer may have extra money if he is living in an expensive place, but I cannot see any justification for giving an officer more pay when he is serving at these headquarters than when he is serving in any other job.<br/>
The hon. Member raised the question of the education grant. This has always been a worry to the Services in connection with the educating of children. The hon. Gentleman was wrong in thinking that civilian employees in the Royal Air Force got more than officers. They do not serve overseas. I think they get more at the Foreign Office and at the Commonwealth Relations Office. There has been a very recent improvement, which is a great deal better than nothing. If an officer is serving abroad he gets tax free the allowance which in England is subject to tax.</p>

<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, and I thank him for giving way. Is it not a fact that the Air Ministry Works Department civilian gets the same as the other Departments, and therefore more than the serving officer?</p>

<p>I thought the hon. Gentleman was referring to civil servants within the Ministry and not to the Works Department. I am not quite certain about it and I will look that point up.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of the small increase in pay for the National Service man and asked how it fitted in with our planning for the future of the Regular Forces. It fits into the plan very well. One object in not putting up the pay very greatly for National Service men while greatly increasing the pay for long-service men was to get the maximum recruiting effect, with the prospect of doing away with National Service and decreasing the requirement of National Service men.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked how officers serving in the United States were placed as regards pay in dollars, and so forth. I do not think it is too bad now. It is better than it was. I was talking only two or three days ago to an officer who had returned, and I asked him about this very point and how he managed with the number of dollars he was allowed. He did not seem to have any very great complaint. The United States is an expensive place to live in and the officer did not get an unlimited quantity of dollars. I do not think any serious complaint comes from that quarter.</p>

<p>Yes, certainly&#x2014;and he could not bring his own money over because he would not get the dollars anyway.<br/>
The hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) raised the vexed question of night baking. I do not think that men take these casual jobs necessarily because they are frightfully hard up. However much they have most people can always do with a bit more. If I may say so, that is the principle on which all millionaires have been made.<br/>
Queen's Regulations quite clearly lay down a number of conditions on which a man can take an odd job if he so desires. He cannot take it at less than trade union rates, for example, nor break a strike, but provided that his efficiency does not suffer and that he has the permission of his commanding officer&#x2014;which was not the case at Hornchurch&#x2014;he can do an odd job if he wishes. We are very anxious not to interfere with people if they want to do that. Provided that the efficiency of the Service is maintained and that the man wants to do the job we say "Good luck" to him.</p>

<p>The point is that the whole case put by the <i>Daily Mirror</i> was based on the fact that the men did this work because they found it necessary to do it.

<p>The hon. Member will recollect that the vast majority of airmen in fact do not do any casual jobs at all and do manage to live quite well. I there

fore think that he will be mistaken if he always bases his opinions on what he reads in the <i>Daily Mirror.</i> The <i>Daily Mirror</i> is not holy writ, and I think that the hon. Member should treat it with reserve.</p>

<p>Since the earlier stage of these debates the Fairey Delta aircraft has staggered the world with its record, and I think that we should all like to congratulate those concerned&#x2014;Mr. Twiss, and Fairey's and Rolls-Royce. But when we come to think of the achievement in terms of aircraft for the Royal Air Force we must get it into perspective.<br/>
Several years ago aircraft which we have discussed in the House many times&#x2014;the Hunter and the Swift&#x2014;both held the world's record for speed, I think. The Hunter is our fighter today, but in spite of that very great achievement of breaking and holding the world's record, the fact remains that today our fighters are greatly inferior to the American fighters. What this tremendous achievement of the Fairey Delta does is to reaffirm the excellence of our inventors, designers and test pilots, and shows that the Delta


wing seems to be on the right lines, but it does nothing to prove that the operational aircraft which we shall get within a measurable distance of time will be world beaters, and does nothing to prove that our aircraft industry is capable of developing and producing modern fighters.<br/>
I still make the earnest plea that we should concentrate our design and development and concentrate our projects. We have about seven fighters in production today; the United States, with infinitely greater resources, has four, and I think it is right that we should think for a moment of the problems raised by our not concentrating. In the last stage of these debates we had reference to the firm that is making the Victor, but how can we really expect a small firm like Handley Page, with about 6,000 men, to develop and produce a bomber like the Victor, when everybody at the top of the industry believes that the unit of production for an airframe firm is much more likely to be 20,000 to 25,000 men?<br/>
I shall not repeat what I said about other aircraft and stores&#x2014;aircraft and guided missiles&#x2014;except once again to ask for an assurance that the money which we are voting here shall not be used to duplicate any of the work that the Americans are doing. So far as fighters are concerned, we may have to swallow our pride and try to get American aircraft. The Australians are doing that. They have the American Sabre with a Rolls-Royce engine.<br/>
When we are negotiating for American aircraft, I suggest that we should also investigate the question raised by the hon. Member for Brentford and Chiswick (Mr. Lucas) as to why the design and development of the F100, F102 and F104 was so much quicker than that of our own aircraft. We should then see if we can apply the lessons learnt to the field in which we are doing well and going ahead&#x2014;the V-bombers, the super V-bombers, and, I hope, the intermediate ballistic missile.<br/>
The way in which the United States Air Force works with the firms shows, I think, our lack of technically-trained officers in the Royal Air Force, because it is extremely difficult to have teams working at the firms in the same way

as the Americans do, right at the beginning. There, they have trained engineers as officers, and they go into the firm and into the team at the beginning. Our weakness is that we have not enough of such men in the Royal Air Force. If we cannot recruit them we must train them. We certainly cannot go on as we are doing now. While voting this money for aircraft we must not think that because we had this wonderful record-beating performance only a few days ago, such aircraft or anything like it are within measurable distance of operational service in the Air Force.</p>

<p>I have only one point to raise in relation to this particular Vote. In the debate last week my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, in reply to a Question by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Wembley, North (Wing-Commander Bullus), referred to jet-training aircraft for the Service. In particular, he referred to the Miles 100 and the Jet Provost, and to the experiments being conducted
<q>&#x2026; on whether pilots should be taught from the beginning to fly jets, as opposed to the present system of flying piston-engined aircraft first and then going on to jets."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th March, 1956; Vol. 549, c. 1892.]</q>
I remember very well, in 1950 and 1951, when we on this side of the House were in opposition, raising with the then Secretary of State for Air, the right hon. and learned Member for Rowley Regis and Tipton (Mr. A. Henderson) the need for an intermediate jet trainer. I raised that matter on several occasions. We did not get an intermediate jet trainer but we got a compromise. We got a compromise in the form of the dual Vampire&#x2014;the Vampire T 11. I never thought that was really the right answer, but it was very much better than nothing, because it narrowed the gap between the piston-engined trainer and the operational aircraft in the squadrons.<br/>
The problem now centres not so much on the question of an intermediate training aircraft as on the best type of aeroplane on which a pilot should learn to fly. Should it be more&#x2014;or less&#x2014;advanced than the Jet Provost, with which many hon. Members will be familiar; or should it be a propeller-driven rather than a jet-engined aircraft? These and


other questions are obviously controversial&#x2014;questions which the Air Staff must now be considering very carefully.<br/>
As a small contribution to the controversy, may I say this? I am fully aware that there have been satisfactory reports from pilots about the handling qualities and characteristics of the Jet Provost, although I must say for myself that I find it difficult not to have some reservations about an aeroplane which was designed originally for a piston engine and which subsequently was modified to take a jet. But the question is really whether an aircraft of this character and specification represents a sufficiently advanced start for the modern Service pilot to make.<br/>
Would it perhaps not be better to consider starting a pilot on a rather more difficult, a more severe, aeroplane, so that the gap between that and an advanced training aircraft of the Hunter class would be substantially narrowed? If that were done, the gap between the original aircraft on which the pilot learned to fly and the advanced operational training aircraft would indeed be narrowed. Would it not be better to consider that?<br/>
I agree that that is a hard and almost brutal thought, and one which is apt to come rather more readily from a politician in the atmosphere of this Committee than from the more realistic mind of a pilot about to embark on his first solo flight. But these things generally are comparative, and I cannot help feeling that perhaps a more advanced start might in the end prove an advantage.<br/>
All I would ask is that when the Air Staff makes up its mind about the particular aeroplane which it wants, proper account shall be taken of the claims of the Miles Aircraft Company to provide that aircraft. I have seen at Shoreham the prototype of the M100, which is an entirely private venture; &#x00A3;20,000 to &#x00A3;30,000 of private money has gone into that venture, with no help from public funds. I believe that that design has definite possibilities, although I appreciate that it may not meet the requirements of the Service, in its present form, as a basic trainer. Nevertheless, when it flies later this year&#x2014;I hope it will fly this summer&#x2014;I trust that the Air Ministry will take due note of the results.<br/>
As I have no financial interest whatever in that company I can, I hope, say without fear of being misunderstood, that as designers of aircraft, and particularly light aircraft&#x2014;and here perhaps the hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas) will agree&#x2014;the Miles brothers have a remarkable record. I for one believe that they may well yet have some further and important contribution to make in the field of aircraft design. For a long time I have felt that the M52, the fast manned fighter on which they were working at the end of the war, and which was stopped by the Ministry of Supply in 1946&#x2013;47&#x2014;I think wrongly, but I do not want to make a party point&#x2014;was perhaps at that time the most advanced aircraft of its kind in the world. I believe that it had tremendous possibilities.<br/>
The principle of the short, straight wing with the razor-sharp leading edge, which was embodied in that aeroplane and which now, interestingly, is being developed in certain of the latest American supersonic projects, was the product of the Miles mind. The conception was brilliant and it was, in my belief, ten years ahead of its time.<br/>
I therefore believe that it would be a great pity, and indeed a loss to the British aircraft industry, if we were to cast lightly aside or to ignore the design genius and aerodynamic knowledge which are to be associated with the name of the Miles Company. And so I conclude by asking my right hon. Friend to keep in mind, when the decision to embark upon a new basic trainer for the Service is being taken, the claims of the M100 and any subsequent developments which may flow from it.</p>

<p>I want to support what the hon. Member for Brentford and Chiswick (Mr. Lucas) has said about the Miles Brothers. I have no interest in the firm other than my personal knowledge and contacts with the two Miles brothers and the visit which I paid to the factory at Reading, where I saw the work which they were doing. Personally, I am sorry that they were not able to continue in production. That was a very serious loss, not only to military but also to commercial aviation, on which they were doing great work, and I do not think it would be wrong to say that basically the reason they did not continue in production was that they had a most unfriendly reception


from what we might call the "Big Five" in British aviation. Now that they have returned, I am sure to help us, I hope that they will have the support for which the hon. Member asked from the Mini-try of Supply and to which I should like to add my personal support.<br/>
I notice from Vote 7 that we spent &#x00A3;186 million last year. I think it is pertinent, in view of the many criticisms which have been made, that we should ask the Minister to tell us tonight exactly what we got for that money. A great deal of doubt has been expressed on different occasions and now is the Minister's opportunity to tell us clearly what we who furnished the &#x00A3;186 million got for it.

<p>I am now looking forward. We are hoping to spend &#x00A3;165 million, and I think the Minister might tell us exactly what he expects to get for it and how much will be absorbed by the enormous profits which are being made by the firms concerned in this industry. Are the big dividends to be maintained during the year and are the bonus distributions to continue? Not only are we hoping to produce aircraft for this &#x00A3;165 million, but we are also subsidising the extraordinary profit which is being made out of the manufacture of aircraft today.<br/>
Each of these firms which undertake this work goes ahead, as far as I know, with its own research and design. This is a national effort and it is important that we should know what co-operation exists between these aircraft manufacturers for the swopping of knowledge which each may derive in his own research. It seems to me a waste of money in the production and research

associated with the manufacture of aircraft if every firm has to go ahead and learn its own lessons. There is no reason why the experience and knowledge gained by one firm ought not to be available in the defence of the country, because that is what we are trying to do. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that there is that co-operation at research and design level which in the future will help to save a great deal of the money now being spent.</p>

<p>It is very satisfactory that there has been a large decrease in this Vote over last year, but when we look to see the reason for it it gives cause for some disquiet. The decrease in the gross total of the Vote is due mainly, as the note explains, to a revised estimate of deliveries of aircraft, armament, ammunition, explosives and radar equipment. That means that the programme has been projected on the industrial resources of the country at too great a pace and we could not keep up with it. The Vote is lower, but I should like to ask whether this Estimate for this year is a realistic figure which is expected to be spent this year, or whether we shall see a future diminution of supplies during the course of this year. I wish to ask this question from two angles, first because I think it is bad accounting and bad estimating to produce a figure, as was the case last year, of &#x00A3;292 million and end up with &#x00A3;228 million, and secondly, and more importantly, because I hope there will be some very drastic economies in this Vote for the Air Force in the coming year.<br/>
It is all very nice to see this magnificent aircraft, the Fairey Aviation Company machine, with its 1,130 miles an hour. We throw our caps in the air and congratulate ourselves that we have defeated the United States, and the news makes headlines; but I suppose it is about the most inflationary thing this country could possibly do at present to spend that money on that aircraft. One wonders, with the pace at which inflation is going in the country and the hard-pressed needs of the community, whether we can really afford these extravagancies. We would afford them if they were really for the defence of this country, but when we look up in the air and see these giant fighters


slicing the sky at enormous speeds we wonder whether they are at all applicable to modern conditions of warfare.<br/>
They are too fast for the cold war; nobody suggests that this Fairey Aviation machine will help us in the Middle East, and they are quite out of date when it comes to long-range ballistic projectiles with hydrogen-bomb warheads. We know that about eight such warheads would knock out this country entirely; there is no defence aginst them, and in a year or two that will be the realism of the matter.<br/>
We know that we are going to have our own fleet of fast bombers capable of carrying a hydrogen warhead to Russia or to any other great Continent of the world which is hostile to us, and those bombers will be located at different bases round the world so that we can make sure we can utilise them, and therefore the deterrent is fully there. But of what use to mankind, and at what frightful cost to the people of this country, are these experiments going forward year by year in fighter aircraft, radar and all the defence equipment, including civil defence at the present time?<br/>
Some drastic rethinking on this whole subject must be undertaken by the Government in the course of the next twelve months, because it is not fair to the people of this country, to the taxpayers, and to the many many people who are suffering hardly at the present time, to have the Ministry of Supply grossly overstaffed with these people who are working on projects of Wellsian conception, when we can see the facts staring us in the face&#x2014;that in a hydrogen bomb war they are of no earthly use, and in the sort of colonial war we want to fight and must fight in the future they are of no use at all.<br/>
I beg my right hon. Friend, who is primarily an able economist and a very considerable financier as well, to look closely into these Estimates this year, and it we on this side of the Committee can help him to economise on these wasteful projects, we will certainly come to his aid.</p>

<p>The noble Lord, the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke), has raised two points which I think deserve some reply. The first is about this short-fall on the expenditure. In the Explanatory

Memorandum it is stated that, in addition to other aid given to us by the United States, we have received 100 Hunters. They have been made available to us free, and a tribute was paid to the generosity of the United States in this respect. I wonder if one reason why we have been unable to carry out our own programme is because superimposed upon the programme outlined in these Estimates has been this offshore programme financed by the United States. If it be the case that our industry is over stretched on the basis of the expenditure we are discussing, then it would seem to me that the additional aircraft mentioned, the 100 Hunter aircraft which now come into the programme, must have placed an additional strain upon the resources of the industry. I am surprised this matter has not been discussed at greater length in the previous debate.<br/>
The noble Lord also mentioned the continued expenditure on faster and faster types. I think he is right to ask to what use they are to be put. How are they to fit into our defensive system? That is really what we want to know before we agree to vote these sums of money, yet not a word has been said, in either this or the previous discussion on the Air Estimates, and I doubt whether we shall get much information today explaining how these are to fit into our defence arrangements.<br/>
My hon. Friend has called attention and paid a tribute to the feat of the industry and individuals connected with it in flying an aircraft over a measured distance at 1,100 miles an hour. I understand that included in these sums of money is a sum for research and preliminary work&#x2014;certainly preliminary work for the contracts have been placed, I believe&#x2014;for the machine which will be based upon this Fairey Aircraft, the DR11. How are we to fit this machine into the pattern of defence? How are we going to position this machine at that speed against an aircraft coming against these shores at the speed of sound? Are we going to get the radar equipment to put behind it? We know nothing at all about how radar is to assist the positioning of these aircraft, nor whether it is physically possible to manoeuvre at these speeds. I agree with the noble Lord that if we are to discuss these matters intelligently we ought to be given some information about how the articles


of equipment for which we are paying are to be used and whether they will be worth the sums of money the nation is called to spend upon them.<br/>
In the discussion we had on these Estimates before, I mentioned the fact that no detailed information has been given about the aircraft and, moreover, that such information as has been given has been proven in the event to be inaccurate. That has given rise to what I would call a cynical unbelief on the part of hon. Members about the information given to us with reference to aircraft. That is one reason why there are so few hon. Members present tonight. We have nothing to discuss as we are not told about these matters. I asked one or two questions in the last debate, but not a single answer did I get to questions about operational techniques of the aircraft concerned. We read in the Explanatory Memorandum this sort of information:
<q>The English Electric P.1 flew at Farnborough and shows great promise.</q>
That really is treating us as children. It is a sort of schoolboy's descriptive piece. That cannot justify the expenditure of this money. We ought to know more about it than that. That sort of phrase has been applied to other aircraft. The Swift, for example, was described as the finest fighter in the world, but eventually it was scrapped. This P.1 flew at Farnborough, but no maiden has been so coy as the P.1 has been. I hope that it will prove a successful aircraft, but we are given very little information about it. Could we have a little more information about the Javelin? We are told that:
<q>we can look forward to a progressive buildup.</q>
I am sure the noble Lord will agree with me on this. As guardians of the taxpayers' money are we entitled to Vote sums for a machine on the basis that "we can look forward to a progressive build-up," when there are all kinds of doubts and there have been all manner of delays? We should be told in detail what is happening to it.<br/>
This unbelief about which I have been speaking is fostered in my mind by the story of the Comet II, an aircraft which I think I am right in saying comes under these Estimates. In the Explanatory Memorandum we are told:

<q>The Comet II's will also be a valuable addition to Transport Command.</q>
I wonder if the Under-Secretary can give unqualified support to that statement. Is the Comet II going to be a valuable addition to Transport Command in the light of what the Auditor-General has said in his Report for the year ending March, 1955?<br/>
I have asked one or two questions about the Comet II. I asked them because they were proper questions to ask in the public interest. We have not had a full and frank reply about this machine and about what it is to be used for. In last year's discussions of the Air Estimates on 10th March, 1955, I put a question to the then Under-Secretary about this machine. It followed a question put by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Derby, North (Group Captain Wilcock) about the Comets and he was told:
<q>We are to get strengthened Comets II in Transport Command.</q>
I had the impression that at least some of those machines had been already built, or that the fuselages had been already built. One of the modification requirements stated after the inquiry was that the aircraft should have a heavier gauge metal in the fuselage. I could not honestly see how we could modify those fuselages without virtually rebuilding them. That was one reason why I put the questions to the Under-Secretary of State at the time.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
I asked the hon. Gentleman:
<q>&#x2026; are the fuselages for delivery to the R.A.F. already built?</q>
I must say that I thought the hon. Gentleman a little cross with me as he said that there was nothing funny about this at all. I had not suggested that there was anything funny, but that there was something I could not understand. I asked what precisely was to be the use for these machines and the hon. Gentleman said:
<q>I do not propose to lay down any particular task for the Comet."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th March, 1955; Vol. 538, c. 637&#x2013;8.]</q>
I put the same question to the present Under-Secretary the other day and he said that in addition to the modifications required by the Inquiry the military version was to be further strengthened by having a strengthened floor. We now


find according to the Report of the Auditor General, in paragraph 42, that:
<q>Three unmodified aircraft for other duties in the R.A.F.&#x2026;</q>
were to be purchased. I understand that is to be paid for out of the sums we are now discussing. The Report also stated that these unmodified aircraft were to have
<q>a minimum flying life of 2,000 flying hours at a limited pressurisation.</q>
I ask the question again and I think I am entitled to an answer. With limited pressurisation, what is to be the purpose for this aircraft. If they are to have a limit of 2,000 hours, are we really justified in paying for them the amount which was to be paid for them had they been fully operational as passenger carrying aircraft? That is what we understand, not from information given to us in these Estimates, but from what the Auditor-General has reported. We are told that we are to pay the same price for these machines with a flying life of only 2,000 hours&#x2014;which, I suppose, in military utilisation probably represents about two years&#x2014;as British Overseas Airways Corporation was to pay for unrestricted use on the civil air routes.<br/>
On the other modified aircraft we are to pay something extra. I do not get that information from the Air Estimates, although we ought to be given that information and there seems no reason why Members of Parliament should not be told as the information is given in the Report of the Auditor General. How much extra are we to pay and why are we to pay any extra at all in order that the machines should be brought up to the performance specifications originally laid down? This seems to be a story about which we should hear more. I shall not quote from the answers given me by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to whom I also addressed questions in an endeavour to get information. He said that he did not see why&#x2014;as he nicely put it&#x2014;I should be bothered about this matter. I think that as Members of Parliament we ought to be concerned with these matters.<br/>
I hope that we can get two pieces of information about these machines which are being taken into the Royal Air Force. First, what is the operational use envisaged for these unmodified machines? Is it proposed to take them up to this

2,000 hours' flying and then scrap them? What is proposed to be done about the flying time. How are we to test them for metal fatigue, and so on? How are we to reassure the crews who are expected to fly them? Are any passengers to be carried in them? We ought to have some information about this. Then there is the question of the additional amount of the taxpayer's money which is being paid in order that the ten modified machines can be brought up to the specification originally laid down.<br/>
It is sometimes asked in the country, and with increasing validity, whether the aircraft industry exists to serve the civil airlines and the Royal Air Force or whether the Royal Air Force and the civil airlines exist to provide customers for the aircraft manufacturing concerns. Certainly, when one sees what the Auditor-General has to say about this transaction, one is driven to the conclusion that in this case public money was paid out to support a private enterprise firm.<br/>
I do not want to say anything against that firm, for which I have great admiration. I know the energy and initiative which those people show. We can all cast our minds back to the Mosquito and we have very high regard for that product of the firm. Nevertheless, it seems that public money was paid out for this purpose&#x2014;and we are being asked to vote it tonight&#x2014;to help a private company out of its financial difficulties. I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to tell us a little more about this tonight.</p>

<p>I am very glad to hear hon. Members posing questions tonight that I have been posing for years. There has always been very great difficulty in finding out what we are getting for these astronomical sums of public money.<br/>
In this Vote we are asked to spend &#x00A3;183,500,000 and there are hardly two dozen Members present. It is little wonder, because over and over again Members come to this Committee but simply come up against a blank wall. One only begins to find out facts about these aircraft when hon. and right hon. Members move over from one side of the Chamber to the other.<br/>
I remember asking questions about the cost of a bomber when the Labour Government were in power. I always received the same answer&#x2014;that the question


could not be answered for reasons of public security. But immediately the Secretary of State for Air in the previous Government came over to this side of the House, he proceeded to give an estimate of the cost of a bomber.<br/>
The House of Commons is entitled to have a rough estimate of the cost of a bomber, and this information could be given to the House without breaking rules of public security. After all, we are entitled to have some vague idea of how this money is being spent. I do not want to give any information to the enemy. I believe that the intelligence services of the potential enemy know far more about the expenditure of this money than we know in the House of Commons.<br/>
Why are we not told the cost of a bomber officially? The Minister who was responsible at the Air Ministry during the time of the last Labour Government has estimated the cost of a bomber at &#x00A3;500,000. By means of Parliamentary Question and Answer, I have succeeded in discovering that to train a pilot to fly a &#x00A3;500,000 bomber costs us &#x00A3;25,000. In times of economic stringency, how far can this nation go in for vast expenditure of this kind?<br/>
This is a question that is being discussed in articles in the papers by ex-Service men and authorities. I have with me an article written by Rear-Admiral G. P. Thompson (Rtd.). I do not know exactly what sort of authority he is, but I assume that he has some authority, otherwise he would not be writting in the daily Press. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I assume there is some sense of responsibility and that when a gentleman who is a high-ranking ex-officer&#x2014;a rear-admiral&#x2014;writes about strategy, he is to some extent informed. If he is not well informed, the laugh that greeted my remarks was a reflection either on the officer or on the newspaper. These newspaper articles are read by millions of people. If the facts are not right, the Minister should do something to correct the impression they convey.<br/>
Rear-Admiral Thompson talks about our &#x00A3;500,000 bomber again. Surely we are entitled to know whether this figure is approximate. He puts the argument this way:
<q>But our V-bombers each cost &#x00A3;500,000 and there is no sound reason why the force should be large, in view of the adequacy of the

American deterrent. Within our limited resources we can manage &#x00A3;50 million for a token force of 100 bombers.</q>
What is a token force? If there is to be a force at all, what is the good of a token force? This military gentleman argues that it is quite impossible for this country to spend &#x00A3;500 million over the next few years on a worth-while force of 1,000 bombers if we are at the same time to have a sound home defence, large numbers of manned fighters and a network of ground-to-air guided missiles, which would cost little less.<br/>
We are responsible for the taxpayer's money. Any hon. Member can go to his constituency and be asked questions on the cost of this or that, but we must simply say, "We are just not told." I have tried over and over again to ascertain, from all kinds of Ministers, in both the previous and the present Governments, the cost of a helicopter. I have never been told yet. If we are responsible for spending the taxpayer's money, we should have some little information so that we can reply when asked questions by our constituents.<br/>
These are the days when the whole question of defence is being discussed by all kinds of people, because we do not know the answers to these questions. What we do know is that a vast sum for capital investment is contained in these Votes. After he had left the Treasury Bench, the previous Secretary of State for Air said:
<q>The veil of secrecy which I was accused of putting up in 1951 has, I am afraid, become an iron curtain solid and impenetrable.</q>
We know that behind that iron curtain there is a vast expenditure of public money. I suggest that, allowing for security reasons and for the fact that none of us wants to give information to the intelligence departments of other nations, the time has come when we should be told some elementary facts, such as the cost of this and that, so that we can explain to our constituents that we are careful guardians of public money.</p>

<p>A good number of points have been raised during the debate on this Vote, and I shall do my best to answer them. The hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas) started by expressing his congratulations, as did other hon. Members, on the record-breaking by the


Fairey Delta. I am grateful to him. He is absolutely right, of course, in saying that this is a pure research aircraft and is not intended to be a weapon carrier in any way. I might add that it is not covered by this Vote. It is borne under a Ministry of Supply Vote. Therefore. I do not think that it would be wise to pursue the matter further.<br/>
The hon. Member for Lincoln made the point, which was made several times in the debate on defence and on the Air Estimates, about the number of firms and number of projects. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Supply gave a long answer to that. He said that what really mattered was not the number of firms but the number of projects. He gave instances of the steps taken to reduce those projects. We shall certainly try to reduce them still further as time goes on.<br/>
The hon. Member also mentioned the question of officers in aircraft firms. We have such officers. We have, for instance, officers watching the development of the Vulcan and the Victor and, as I said in my speech on the Estimates, we are taking very active steps to increase and improve the education of officers, particularly by means of the cadet scheme that we have at Henlow, which I believe in the long run will pay considerable dividends.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Chiswick (Mr. Lucas) spoke about jet trainers and canvassed the rival merits of the Jet Provost and Miles 100. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Air said during the debate on the Air Estimates, no decision has been reached whether to adopt one or the other, or indeed either. But my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Chiswick has great experience in this matter, and I naturally value the advice which he has to give.<br/>
My noble Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke), who has left the Chamber, raised the same point as was raised by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Beswick). He asked whether the reason for the under-spending of our Estimates was that we were overloading the industry and ordering too many aircraft. I do not think that that is the reason. The reason why we have not got the aircraft we have budgeted for has been, every time, the

hold-ups in development and not in production. Once we have had the answers to the technical problems it has not been at all difficult to produce the aircraft. The bottlenecks are in research and development, not in production.</p>

<p>The Minister of Supply told a somewhat different story before, when he said that there were certain materials in short supply and he was changing the super-priorities scheme to make certain that there was no overloading on these important but limited number of materials. I can give an example where men are now on short time and are redundant simply because there is not enough titanium to go into the products.</p>

<p>I think that that is a very small factor, and that the Minister of Supply said that he was altering the super-priorities scheme because there were only a few things which were in fact in short supply. I do not think that the question of materials really impinges at all upon the under-spending of my own Estimates. Every time it has been a question of difficulties with development.<br/>
The hon. Member for Uxbridge and the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) also raised once again the question why the House cannot be told more about how many aircraft we are getting and how much they cost. No Government has ever disclosed those facts, and I do not think that it would be right to do so. To the hon. Member for South Ayrshire, who asked what a bomber costs, I am afraid the, answer is a lemon, though perhaps an unstated number of lemons might be a more appropriate reply.<br/>
I was also asked about the P 1. We have not got that. It is still a Ministry of Supply aircraft but, so far as we know, the development seems to be going reasonably well. The Javelin, on the other hand, is covered by the Estimates which we are now considering. The Javelin has not long been delivered to the Air Force, but we have had fighter pilots from the Central Fighter Establishment flying Javelins for some time, and I have talked to pilots at Boscombe Down who have been flying the Javelin.<br/>
Reports, so far as they go, are satisfactory. They are more satisfactory on this aircraft at this early stage than they have been on other aircraft. In


particular, there has been no difficulty with the guns, which has been the great trouble with the Hunters. I know that the hon. Member for Uxbridge is about to ask why an aircraft is mentioned in the Memorandum on the Air Estimates when no money is provided for it in this Vote.</p>

<p>I am sure that the Minister is interested in this matter, just as I am, from the Parliamentary point of view, but I am wondering what an explanatory Memorandum covering the Estimates for 1956&#x2013;57 is for. If it refers to aircraft which are not in fact paid for in these Estimates it is a waste of time to publish the Memorandum at all.</p>
</speech>

<p>The object of the explanatory Memorandum is to explain. The point is that the Air Force does not pay for aircraft until they are delivered, and therefore no money is provided. The P1 is under development, and there is no question of it being delivered in the current financial year. Therefore, no money is provided for it in these Estimates. The money is provided for in the Ministry of Supply Estimates. That is a technical point. Because it is not in our Vote we are not precluded from offering information about it.<br/>
The hon. Member for Uxbridge also spoke of the Comet. Subject to a certificate of airworthiness, we are buying strengthened Comets, which will carry out the duties common to aircraft of that type in Transport Command that is, shifting both men and goods about in emergencies and for special reasons. The unstrengthened Comets are not for Transport Command but are for use in tests with radar training and calibration and so on. Therefore, they do not need strengthening. They are not subject to the same degree of pressures.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman go on to justify the price? A limited purpose has been found for the aircraft in calibration tests and the like, and they cannot be used for more than a limited length of time. How do we then justify the spending on them of the same sum of money as would be spent if they were aircraft with an unlimited certificate of airworthiness?</p>

<p>That is all organised under the Ministry of Supply.

The information is centralised through Ministry of Supply channels, and I think that all that liaison is rather good.</p>

<p>The greater part of this Vote is for the pay of officers and men in the Royal Navy, and I should like to repeat the congratulations which my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South-East (Mr. Callaghan) offered to the Government when the Estimates were introduced for introducing these new scales of pay for officers and men of the Services. I agree with what the hon. Gentleman said in introducing the Estimates&#x2014;that, by and large, pay in the Royal Navy now compares reasonably well with earnings in civil life outside, and that it should enable the Navy to obtain the Regular recruits that it wants in the coming years.<br/>
Indeed, so far as comparisons are concerned, I looked rather wistfully at the pay and allowances of a lieutenant-commander with maximum service, because that was the rank in which I left the Royal Navy, and compared it with the present remuneration of a Member of Parliament, and I found that on the whole the Navy is not too badly treated by these standards.<br/>
In the debate on the Estimates, I raised the question of National Service in the Navy, and in view of the fact that there is now a reasonable chance of getting the regular recruits which the Service wants, I should like to ask the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary whether the very small number of National Service men needed in the Navy is really justified in present circumstances. We know that it is Government policy that the National Service man should have a choice of the three Services, but it is a very nominal choice as far as the Navy is concerned&#x2014;I think probably fifty to one against, if we take the figure of 2,000, the figure to which the Royal Navy expects to run down in the year 1957&#x2013;58.<br/>
I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary can give us any idea of the cost of training these men. Is it disproportionate compared with the rather different training arrangements that have

to be organised for Regular recruits? I am not saying definitely that I think National Service ought to stop forthwith in the Navy, but I should like some indication as to how uneconomic it is&#x2014;because it must be uneconomic from the Service point of view&#x2014;at the moment.<br/>
There is one other point on which I should like to ask a question. It concerns Vote 1, Subhead L, in regard to education grants. I gather that that is a new subhead, and in the Estimates it is stated that this sum of &#x00A3;100,000 is for the payment of an education allowance up to &#x00A3;75 a year for children at boarding school, and also for the payment of maintenance allowances of lOs a week for children boarded out who attend day school. The Estimates go on to say that the allowances are payable in respect of children between the ages of 11 and 18 of personnel serving abroad and those serving in the United Kingdom who are subject to frequent changes of station. Is it intended that these allowances are to be available for both officers and ratings? Perhaps we could be given some intimation as to how this new arrangement has arisen, what the demand for it has been, and generally what arrangements have been made under this heading in the past.<br/>
There is one other item under the Appropriation in Aid&#x2014;Item Z. There is a sum of &#x00A3;500,000 which is expected as a contribution from the German support fund. I am speaking subject to correction here, but it appears to be part of the sum which the Government budgeted for and which they expected to get from the Federal Republic of Germany in support of our Forces stationed in that country. I believe it is a fact that, within the last 48 hours or so, the German Federal Government have said that they do not intend to make any cash payment at all. Perhaps we can have confirmation from the hon. Gentleman whether, in the light of these recent developments, he expects that figure of &#x00A3;500,000 to be realised.</p>

<p>I should like to raise one point in relation to Subhead C; but first I should like to add my congratulations in regard to rates of pay. I should like to say that although I am not a feminist, I should like to see some explanation why there


should not be equality between the different Women's Services in regard to pay.<br/>
I have before me the total of the payment of these Services, and I should like to pay a tribute to the Women's Services and to the nursing services, because I have noticed during the debate on these Estimates that, up to date, no mention has been made of the very valuable services which they give in Her Majesty's Forces.<br/>
If one looks at the table showing what is the pay in the Regular Women's Services, it is interesting to note that in eight different sections there is inequality of pay between W.R.N.S., W.R.A.F. and W.R.A.C. In the case of a second officer, captain or flight officer, the difference is as much as 7s. per day. That is in the category of four years' service, and even up to the rank of six years there is still a difference of 5s. a day. After that, there is 1s. a day difference until they have done eight years' service, and then they get equality of pay up to the final rank. I suggest that as aircraft-women and able seamen are to begin with equal pay, there is no reason why there should be any difference in pay in these eight categories. The women have the same expenses, and they have to go to the same N.A.A.F.I. organisation.<br/>
All the Women's Services and the nursing services ought to get equal pay, and I should be very glad if the matter could be considered. I understand that their careers as officers are substantially the same in the final financial reward as for the other Services and it is only in the early stages that it is different. I should be very glad if my hon. Friend would look into it to see if there is any reason why there should not be equality with the other Women's Services.</p>

<p>Nobody is going to grudge the increase of pay to the sailors, who, like everybody else, are finding the cost of living going up under the present Government. Certainly, we would not grudge the W.R.N.S. their bit of birdseed which comes under Vote 1, but I think it is essential in these days that we should cut out waste and see that the utmost economy is carried out in the Navy, as in the other nationalised services.<br/>
I have been alarmed to read in today's <i>Daily Herald</i> an article by a gentleman named Hannen Swaffer. Nobody will accuse Mr. Hannen Swaffer of being anything but patriotic. He draws attention to the cost of the "Britannia", and I want to ask the Minister if he can tell us whether these figures about her payroll are accurate. Presumably they come under this sum of &#x00A3;63,688,000. After all, it is the people outside who read these articles, and they need to be satisfied that the Royal Navy is run economically and without any waste.<br/>
We are told in this article that since her completion two years ago the "Britannia" has been renovated five times, and that over &#x00A3;100,000 has been spent on her refitting. The article states that it costs &#x00A3;2,500 a day to run her. I should like to know if that is correct. It states that she carries a crew of more than 200 officers and men who are badly needed elsewhere, when warships are held up for lack of crew.<br/>
Those are startling figures, and the author of the article goes on to ask whether it was really necessary to take the "Britannia" to the Mediterranean for these maneouvres. Mr. Hannen Swaffer says that:
<q>Even Tory newspapers which boast of their loyalty have joined in the widespread criticism of this continual waste. Yet, so indifferent is the Prince to this outcry that, instead of flying to the Mediterranean for the naval manoeuvres in a Service plane, the petrol for which would have cost the nation comparatively little, Philip decided that nothing short of the Britannia would suffice. How many more millions will Philip's passion for the sea cost the nation?</q></p>

<p>Yes, Sir Charles. Although the Minister is strange to the Navy, because he was in the Air Force, I did not think that he thought the "Britannia" could sail to the Mediterranean without a crew. We have not reached the stage yet when automation propels the "Britannia".<br/>
I have raised this matter before. There were times when we could afford to pay &#x00A3;2,500 a day for these men. I suggest, however, that when people who are much more conventional in these matters than I am are calling attention to them, it is up to the Minister to allay the public apprehension that there is extravagance in the Navy and that this pay-roll would be much less if, for example, the "Britannia" were sold to the United States of America or disposed of in some other way so that it would not be a burden to the nation.</p>

<p>I shall start by replying to the questions of the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) whose first point was about National Service men. The hon. Gentleman asked whether they were justified, and whether their training was disproportionate and uneconomic.<br/>
On the first point, we, in common with the other two Services, look forward to the day when we can have a long term or Regular Navy. Frankly, we would rather not have National Service men, but while we have them they are extremely useful to us in many ways. Although I agree that their training is uneconomic in that we are giving them the same training as we give long-term men, and yet are keeping them such a short time. At the same time there is some economy in that their training is not separately organised but takes place with that of the Regular sailors.<br/>
Educational grants are available both to officers and ratings. They are necessary because one of the greatest disincentives to joining any of the Services is the difficulty of educating children because the father is moved around so frequently from place to place. A man posted overseas is faced with three almost impossible choices. Either he has to take his wife and children with him and trust to luck as to the kind of education he will find overseas; or he has to take his wife with him and find some means of boarding out his children during their education in this country; or he has to leave his wife behind to look after the children and face a long period of separation. Those are three extremely difficult choices. For these reasons we try to solve the problem by giving this education allowance so that people can board

out their children and avoid at least one of these unhappy choices.</p>

<p>Before the hon. Gentleman leaves that point, I was not suggesting that this practice was not desirable. I was wondering what provision had been made in the past in view of the fact that there was no sum in that subhead last year.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-03-15a.650.1" hansard_membership_id="10289" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29556" speakername="Mr. Ward" colnum="650" time="">
<p>This is an improvement which has been made recently for the reasons I have stated and as a result of experience.<br/>
On the question of the German support funds the hon. Gentleman is right. This &#x00A3;500,000 is the provision which has been made in the Estimates for the amount of German contribution for the coming year. On the point about the newspaper reports, I am not in a position to discuss that beyond saying that negotiations are still going on and that this is only an estimate which we put into this year's figures.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Miss Vickers) raised the question of W.R.N.S. pay. I appreciate and understand her interest in the women's Services which she has mentioned to me before. As she knows, I tried in a letter a few days ago to explain the situation and I am sorry that I did not succeed in convincing her. I will try again, but this is not an easy matter to explain. It is a mistake to try to compare the three women's Services rank by rank. The principle is that in post-war years it has been the rule, in dealing with the pay of the women's Services, to give them about three-quarters of the equivalent pay for male officers. The pattern for male officers in the Navy differs very considerably from that of male officers in the other two Services, because they are promoted at quite different ages and it is impossible exactly to compare their various ranks.<br/>
8.30 p.m.<br/>
If we equate the women's Services to the comparable male Services and not to the other two women's Services, we get some idea of how this works out. If we corn-pare the women's Services age for age and not rank for rank, we will also find that they are very closely equated. Finally, the best test of all is to take the careers in each of the three women's


Services from say, the age of twenty to the age of thirty-two and see what each is paid over those twelve years. It will then be found that the W.R.N.S. comes out a little ahead of the other two Services. That, I am afraid, is the best explanation I can give, and I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Lady.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) disappointed me very much and I am sure that he disappointed other hon. Members by raising the topic of the expense of the Royal yacht. I have not read Mr. Hannen Swaffer's article in the <i>Daily Herald,</i> so I do not know what he says about it, although I can imagine. What he probably does not say is that Her Majesty's Ship "Britannia," besides being the Royal Yacht, is also a hospital ship.</p>

<p>Did he? I am sorry. I said that I did not read the article. The hon. Member certainly did not say it. It is a hospital ship and would be so used in war time.

<p>In justice to Mr. Swaffer he said:
<q>It was stupidly stated at the start, that, far from the money being wasted, the yacht could be so changed that she could transport wounded.</q>

<p>That is not so. The "Britannia" is an operational ship and not a member of the reserve, and as an operational ship is capable of going to sea in an operational r&#x00F4;le very quickly indeed. I think that those are the main points, but if there are others, I will later write to the hon. Members concerned.</p>

<p>There are only two points which I wish to raise on Vote 2, and the first concerns the new seaman's uniform about which the Parliamentary Secretary had something to say in introducing the Estimates. I should like to ask him whether we really are to have this new uniform at last. I understand that it has been under consideration for at least six years, and probably longer. From time to time there have been announcements in the Press, no doubt inspired by the Admiralty, about the new uniform always appearing as entirely fresh pieces of news.<br/>
Is this the final form of the uniform and, if so, when is it to be issued to the men? When are we to have a Navy arrayed in the zip-fronted jumper? I always understood in the time which I spent in the Navy, which is now getting to be several years ago, that there were certain great advantages in having the jumper in its traditional design One of the things we were told was that it was essential for the safety of seamen. I hope we can have an assurance that there will be no diminution in safety through the new form of dress. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will also tell us how the cost will compare with that of the old type uniform. If it is more expensive, and one would imagine that it would be, is it proposed accordingly to adjust the kit upkeep allowance for men dressed as seamen?<br/>
Under Subhead G, I notice that there is a very considerable reduction in the amounts provided for provisions and victualling allowances. Like my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes), I am always glad to see economies in the Service Departments, but not economies at the expense of the men's food. I hope that we shall have an explanation on how this saving of something like &#x00A3;2 million has been achieved.<br/>
There is one other small matter which I should like to raise under this Subhead


&#x2014;grog money. The rate of grog money, we are told, is at present fixed at 3d. a day or 21s. a quarter. When I was on the lower deck, the rate of grog money was also 3d. a day. I should have thought that the cost of grog had gone up very considerably since then. Is this not in fact an encouragement to the man to take his grog rather than his grog money, and is it not time that the current value of grog was more accurately reflected in the grog money that the man gets who does not draw his grog every day?</p>

<p>Under Vote 1 we have voted a generous increase in pay, and we are all very pleased that the Navy, in common with the other Services, has been put on a good basis, so that both officers and men will draw pay that is in every way comparable and in many ways better than in civilian life. That being so, it brings me to the question of officers and men serving on home establishments, because all those men are praotically living civilian lives although they are working at naval works. Having regard to the fact that they are working in comparable conditions to civilians, I ask myself whether it is right that they should get Duty-free cigarettes and Duty-free rum at these home establishments.<br/>
I am in agreement with the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) that we do not want to see any economies in food, but I think that no one in this House would object if there were economies in the matter of rum and cigarettes. I feel that here there is a considerable temptation in the face of young Service men particularly. Many of them are non-smokers and many are non-drinkers, but we know that cigarettes and the rum which they can get have a market value that is considerably above 3d. a day for rum or the value of the cigarettes. So there is a temptation to take the allowance whether they want it or not and sell it. In fact, I hear that in naval towns there is quite a black market in cigarettes in the public lavatories surrounding the docks. I am assured that there is a certain amount of black market in rum in private houses and perhaps public houses.</p>

<p>There may be nothing new in that, but it may be done en a more extensive scale because, fortunately, we have in the Navy today a large number of young men who are non-smokers and possibly non-drinkers as well. I suggest to my hon. Friend that economies could be made by cutting out these duty-free items for men on home establishments. Not only should we make economies but we should be removing temptation from the men, and getting rid of what I think is a grievance among the civilian population that men working at almost similar jobs should get considerable "perks" to which civilians are not entitled.</p>

<p>I wish to raise the question of the supply of fruit, vegetables and fish to the Royal Naval Barracks at Portsmouth. Recently we have been discussing monopolies, and whilst one naturally favours N.A.A.F.I., other things being equal, since it contributes to Service amenities; yet I think that a little competition is still a very good thing. There is a Fleet Order on the subject which stressed this, and states that if there is an appreciable advantage, taking into consideration price, quality, variety, reliability and promptness of delivery, purchases from local traders should be resorted to. I have in my hand a list of prices of commodities such as fruit and vegetables and other things which have been bought from the N.A.A.F.I.<br/>
This Fleet Order stated that
<q>&#x2026;purchases from local traders should be resorted to only when there is an appreciable advantage to the ship, e.g., after taking into account of price, quality, variety&#x2026;</q>
and so on. That also applies to the naval barracks where last year, because of the excellence of the goods supplied by the local traders, their proportion actually went up to 50 per cent. of the only commodities which they are allowed to supply. I have here a comparison of some of the prices.<br/>
Last December, a new officer arrived at the barracks. I will not mention any names, and in any case I have not had an opportunity to investigate this matter. Indeed, I do not think that one could go to the barracks in order to investigate these things, and one would be very unpopular if one attempted to do so. But these are the actual sample prices on 19th January, 1956, the first price being


the local private tender: imported Jonathan apples, fancy grade, 6d. a lb.; the N.A.A.F.I. price was 8d. English Jonathan apples, first grade, were 5d. a lb.; the N.A.A.F.I. had none. Canary tomatoes for cooking were 7&#x00BD;d. a 1b.; the N.A.A.F.I. price was 11d. Imported lettuce, large, were 5&#x00BD;d. per head; the N.A.A.F.I. price was 10d. South African plums were 1s. 2d.; the N.A.A.F.I. had no equivalent. Salad tomatoes were 10d. a lb.; the N.A.A.F.I. price was 1s. 1&#x00BD;d. Celery was 3&#x00BD;d. and 4d. a head; the N.A.A.F.I. price was 5d.<br/>
On one occasion samples were brought to the barracks by a trader, and this new officer refused even to look at them. I gather that since 1st January no private tender has been looked at at all. Because he had been doing so much trade with the barracks, a local fishmonger spent &#x00A3;1,000 on the installation of refrigerating plant in order to keep the food fresh over Sunday to deliver to the barracks on Monday. So far as he is concerned that money has gone down the drain.<br/>
I have a pile of complaints which I can pass on to the Minister, and I wish to quote from a letter from one trader, in which he says:
<q>I would add that during my thirty years of business experience during which period I have been in contact with all ranks of the Supply Branch in practically all the Navies of the world, it has never been my sad misfortune to be addressed in such a manner, and to be the recipient of these remarks&#x2026;leaves me surprised and shocked.</q>
There is a great deal of feeling about this matter in Portsmouth, because the traders feel that there is a great prestige attached to supplying the Navy, and if they are no longer allowed to tender people may get wrong ideas quite apart from their loss of business. It is a very severe blow to them suddenly to be struck off like that.<br/>
8.45 p.m.<br/>
The saving upon those fresh articles, which the private traders are not now allowed to supply, was &#x00A3;1,900 last year. That was a quite useful economy. My main argument, however, is that some competition should be allowed. If a monopoly exists, people have to take what it gives them. The barracks evidently found that they were being served very much better by private traders than by

N.A.A.F.I. in the matter of fresh fruit, fish and vegetables.<br/>
It is quite easy for N.A.A.F.I. to contribute towards Service amenities if it puts up its prices; any firm can do that if it has a monopoly. I am not denying the good work that it does, but we should keep it on its toes. I ask my hon. Friend to look at this matter, and see whether it is necessary for traders in Portsmouth who have supplied the Navy for so many years in competition with N.A.A.F.I. to be suddenly struck off the list. It seems to me to be extremely unfair, and quite contrary to the Fleet Order.</p>

<p>I want to draw attention to the Royal William Yard in Devonport. As its name suggests, this is a very old yard, and I gather that quite a lot of its equipment and crew are being sent inland, to a place called Wrangton. According to the Estimates, certain heating was to be installed in the existing building to make it more habitable to the people working there. Many of these men are ex-Navy personnel of considerable age, with physical disabilities, and the inconvenience from which they are suffering at present is most noticeable.</p>

<p>I have only one or two questions to put upon this Vote. I understand that, together with the coming into use of the new uniform, the seasonal change in the colour of the crown of the rating's cap will disappear. Broadly speaking, it used to be blue in winter and white in summer, and it will now be white all the year round. I do not think that any exception will be taken to that change by officers and ratings. When the time comes for them to wear them again in the summer, officers will no longer have cause to wonder where the white covers of their caps have disappeared to in the winter.<br/>
Is it contemplated that white caps only will continue to be used even in time of war? It is quite conceivable that upon certain types of operation the wearing of a white cap at night would invite unenviable attention from the enemy, and it would not be a practical form of headwear.</p>

<p>I agree, but I did not experience those conditions.<br/>
While I was looking through the Votes in connection with the necessary arrangements to be made in respect of victualling yards abroad, it struck me that there was one item connected with salaries and wages of the police which has undergone a very marked increase this year as compared with the Estimates for the previous year.<br/>
They relate to overtime, which has shown very great increase from &#x00A3;700 to &#x00A3;5,500. It is possible that the wages and salaries of the police have been increased all round and that this has caused inflation of the figures, or there may be shortage of men on police duty at the victualling yards and in consequence they may have had to do overtime to keep the full roster of protection. I should be grateful for information on that point.<br/>
What is the present source of supply of the rum issued to the Royal Navy? It used to be very good dry rum from British Guiana, but I understand that almost all the vintage stocks were purloined by the Army in World War I and that the Admiralty has never quite caught up with the quality.</p>

<p>I do not think I met it. It was only by connivance and a slight irregularity that I was able to get a quantity of rum, but never sufficiently frequently to become a connoisseur.

<p>My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Commander Agnew) has referred to grog. I was interested in the comments he made about the vintage grog. I have heard that the Army nobbled the stock, but I have also heard it suggested that the Army laid it down as port. The trouble with the Navy was that, having

got some fine dry rum it used to wet it and issue it to the men as grog.<br/>
I see a mention in this Vote that those who do not like grog can take rum money in lieu. I have always thought it was to some extent a hardship that that privilege was not extended to officers, who have always taken a certain part of their emoluments as duty-free tobacco and alcohol. We always thought during the war that the fact that the Navy received half of its remuneration in that rather intangible form had the most unfortunate effect upon the calculation of naval pay in relation to Army pay.<br/>
Whenever a discrepancy was pointed out, it was suggested that that was either because admirals received higher pensions than field marshals or because naval officers received duty-free tobacco and drink. During the six years that I served in the Royal Navy, as I did not smoke, I had to consume quite a ridiculous amount of gin in order to get my basic rate of pay. The result of such an intensive course as that has been to make me not only a non-smoker but a nondrinker. It has occurred to me that it might not be at all a bad idea if some of this advantage, at any rate in relation to tobacco, were quantified so that naval officers could receive a substantial part of the reward for the valuable services they render to Her Majesty in the form of currency rather than of benefits in kind.<br/>
I have always thought, though I do not wish to elaborate on it now, that the Navy did a little worse on its victualling than did the other Services. Again, it was always pointed out to us that we paid so much lower in mess subscription than did the Army or the Air Force that it was right that we should be less well paid, but I think it is true that the victualling of the Navy costs a good deal less than that of the other Services. If that is so, it would appear that naval officers are not only on the whole rather less well paid than are their counterparts in the other two Services but that the Navy does not feed them as well either.</p>

<p>I have two points in mind about the grog issue. First, I should like to know to what extent the habit of taking payment in lieu of grog is increasing or decreasing. There was at one time a tendency, I


understand, for the number of those draw-pay in lieu of grog to increase. Perhaps the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary can give some information on that matter.<br/>
Secondly, the payment made in lieu of taking the grog is still the same as it was years and years ago&#x2014;3d. I should have thought that anyone not taking his grog today was entitled to rather more. I do not know how the Admiralty's finances are affected, but the exchange value of grog on board ship is certainly higher than 3d., whether measured in terms of service or of barter. The amount was 3d. when I was in the Service, which is a long time ago, and that was the figure a long time before that. If the Admiralty were to increase the amount to something respectable, it is possible that quite a number of other men would no longer draw their grog, but at present it is a good bargain and can sometimes work wonders. It is really time that the Admiralty examined this allowance.</p>

<p>The answer to the question about the seamen's new uniform is that, if there are no unforeseen production difficulties we should be able to start issuing it to the Fleet in about six months' time. It will cost about &#x00A3;28,000 a year more than does the existing uniform.<br/>
The hon. Member for St. Pancras North (Mr. K. Robinson) asked about the reduction in the amount of money provided for victualling. I can say that there is no decrease whatever in the standard of the food but there is, of course, a smaller number of men in the Navy, which accounts for the reduction in that figure.<br/>
Several hon. Members have talked about grog and grog money. I must confess that I used to like rum until about fifteen years ago, when I made the mistake of walking round a rum factory in Jamaica. The smell was so abominable that I have never been able to drink rum since. Nevertheless, I understand that it is very popular in the Navy. Supplies come, not from British Guiana or, my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Commander Agnew) will be glad to hear, from Australia, but from Jamaica or Barbados.<br/>
9.0 p.m.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) asked about duty-free cigarettes and rum in shore

establishments, and wondered why this privilege should continue in days when economy is so necessary. This is rather more than a custom; it has the strength of law, since it was legalised in the Customs and Excise Act, and it has been the tradition of the Navy for a great many years. There would, I think, be considerable discontent caused quite unnecessarily for the saving of very little money if this privilege was withdrawn.<br/>
I want to make it clear that it is a misconception&#x2014;I am not saying that my hon. Friend is guilty of it; he knows too much about it&#x2014;that sailors ashore are entitled to the same privileges as when afloat. This is not so. There are three categories of entitlement to the privileges, which vary, first, with the length of time a particular vessel is likely to spend at sea, and, secondly, with whether the sailor is in a ship at sea or temporarily in a shore establishment.<br/>
My hon. Friend expressed some anxiety about the possibility of a black market arising from this concession in shore establishments. I can assure him that we are constantly on the look out for that, and we should be more than grateful if he could produce any instance, into which we would look very carefully so that we could put a stop to it.</p>

<p>I understand that he has to register as a smoker before he is entitled to the concession, although I am not sure whether he registers as a drinker.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, South (Sir J. Lucas) spoke on the subject of private traders versus the N.A.A.F.I. That is an important point. There is no question in our instructions of rejecting tenders from private traders out of hand. On the contrary, our instructions to supply officers provide for the purchase of supplies from private traders, but they say that N.A.A.F.I. should be the main source of supply for such things as fish and fresh vegetables and that purchases from private traders should be made only when there is an appreciable advantage in respect of price, quality, variety or reliability.<br/>
I think my hon. Friend will agree that this is only fair to N.A.A.F.I. which, after all, has to operate a world-wide canteen service to meet the requirements of the Navy and often has to operate in places which would not be at all attractive to private traders. I therefore emphasise that any tenders front private traders would continue to be considered and would be accepted if they gave appreciable advantages to the purchaser.<br/>
My hon. Friend did mention one or two specific instances, particularly I think in regard to apples. I do not know, without looking at the matter very carefully, whether the private trader is always able to provide a better service in apples than N.A.A.F.I. I would say myself, however, that if, taken over quite a long period, it is found that there is very little advantage between the two, then N.A.A.F.I. ought to get the preference, although I dare say there would always be certain shorter periods when either one or the other might be able to provide a more attractive price. The principle, however, is quite clear&#x2014;that all else being equal, and unless there is some considerable advantage to be gained from going to private traders, N.A.A.F.I. does have preference, for the reasons which I have stated.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South asked about white caps and whether they would be worn in war time. The answer is, yes, they will; they are the permanent uniform, or will be from 1st May, to be worn all the year round in all climates, both in peace and in war. As to the wages of the police, the reason why overtime has increased is because the new conditions of the Service for the police provide for a shorter working week, and therefore more overtime.<br/>
The only other outstanding point is once again a grog one, namely, about the cost of grog. I am informed that the cost of grog is actually half the amount of grog money available. In other words, grog money is 3d. per man and the cost of grog is lid 1&#x00BD;d. per day. I do not myself believe that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) is justified in saying that because, generally speaking, the cost of living has gone up in recent years the price of grog money should follow that upward trend. I think it is very reasonable indeed that a man should

receive twice the value of the actual tot of rum, and I see no reason for altering that.</p>

<p>This Vote includes, I see, the Admiralty Compass Observatory, in my constituency, and I want to raise with the Parliamentary Secretary, or perhaps more specifically with the Civil Lord, a matter which has been raised with him on many previous occasions and with which he will be familiar, but which is one of considerable importance and is becoming, I venture to say, one of some urgency, and that is the conditions of employment, and more especially of remuneration, of the civilian staff at the Observatory. It is, I suppose, the 372 mechanics referred to on page 78. I see that the number is estimated to fall from 372 in the year 1955&#x2013;56 to 338 in the year 1956&#x2013;57.<br/>
A great many of those men fall into the category of dilutees. That is to say, they entered Admiralty employment under the relaxation agreements of 1939 or 1940 and they are still governed by those agreements. Their conditions of pay are still as set out in those agreements. Many other of their conditions of service, such as those relating to pensions, retirement, security of employment and, above all, priority of dismissal are


all regulated by the fact that they are dilutees.<br/>
In the past, this has not been considered a very urgent matter, although it has been recognised on all sides as anomalous. It has been possible to say that it does not matter very much as the number employed in these technical and engineering services has been constantly growing. Therefore, the question of redundancy has been purely academic and it has been hoped that before it ever became actual the matter would have been amicably settled by agreement between the Admiralty and the trade unions concerned. Undoubtedly progress has been made between the Admiralty and the trade unions concerned, but I think I am correct in saying that progress has not gone so far as it has between the Air Ministry and trade unions concerned in relation to dilutees employed by that Ministry. In some degree the status and entitlement of the dilutees employed in the Admiralty service is lower than that of those in the Air Ministry service.<br/>
This Vote and information I have had given to me lead me to believe that that situation is passing and that the number employed as mechanics is beginning to go down. Whether that is part of the national economies which have to be made in some parts of the defence services or whether it is due to regrouping of effort in these scientific services, I do not know. The fact remains that the number is beginning to decline and, therefore, the question of redundancy is becoming urgent.<br/>
This problem, which has been ticking along quietly enough for the last 10 years, is now ceasing to be one which we can allow to continue permanently unsolved. It is a very difficult problem; everyone recognises that. The trade unions, as a matter of principle, have to retain certain standards and certain requirements. They naturally say that the special conditions of wartime should not be prayed against them in peacetime.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
Against that, we have to remember that these technicians and mehanics represent a once-and-for-all operation. We earnestly hope that there will never be another war. Some of them have been in this status of dilutees now for fifteen

years and, broadly speaking, it is impossible for them by any means ever to get out of this category. They are dilutees for ever, they are deferred men for ever, and for however long they stay in the Admiralty Compass Observatory, even if for twenty or twenty-five years, when staff has to be cut they must be the first to go, and the youngest and newest entrants, who have been there for perhaps only a year, must stay in preference to them. That is not justice when it is carried on for that length of time and to that extent.<br/>
We all want to see expenditure on defence eventually reduced. We hope that the state of the world will one day permit very much greater economies in our defence services. Before that happens this problem must be solved, otherwise the Admiralty will be left with some very difficult human problems on its hands, and I do not know how it will solve them without getting into serious trouble with the trade union. I ask my hon. Friend the Civil Lord, who has had this worrying problem on his hands for a long time, if tonight he can give any hopeful news about it and to undertake to regard it as urgent and to try to find an agreed solution very quickly.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may make a brief reply to one or two of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. R. Bell). I am aware of his interest in this difficult problem of dilutees. I cannot at the moment give a full answer concerning the amount of work at the establishment he mentioned, but I believe that there has been a slight falling off in some of the work that it undertakes for another Department.<br/>
The general question of dilutees is a difficult problem. We employ a number of dilutees in the Admiralty, not only under this Vote but under several other Votes. It has, therefore, been a matter to which we have devoted a good deal of attention.<br/>
As my hon. Friend pointed out, a number of dilutees have been working at our establishment for a long time. The fact remains, however, that they did not serve an apprenticeship, and, although they may be thoroughly efficient at the job they do, some of them would not be able to turn their hands to the variety of work that a full craftsman would be able to do.<br/>
I have had conversations with some of the unions on the pay and status of dilutees. We have agreed with them to raise considerably the range of merit pay to which the dilutees are entitled, although they are not entitled to the full range of merit pay to which they would be were they fully qualified craftsmen. We have, in fact, recently reached agreement with one of the unions&#x2014;it is not the only one&#x2014;with a view to upgrading all those dilutees who are thoroughly efficient to the full status of craftsman, which will solve their particular difficulty. But we have not had the same success with every union and I suspect that the union which my hon. Friend has in mind is one with which we have not been able to reach agreement on the upgrading of dilutees. I can, however, assure my hon. Friend that we shall continue to give careful thought to the problem and will have further talks with the unions concerned as necessary.</p>

<p>I should like to draw attention to Subhead B relating to new works, additions and alterations, and to ask the Minister some questions about accommodation. Quite recently there has been an excellent suggestion that hirings

should be taken by the Navy. It would be of great value to families coming back from overseas. It is very difficult for them to obtain any quarters unless they are provided by the Navy, as they have to be for a certain period on the housing lists of local authorities before they become eligible for accommodation. It would be excellent if unfurnished quarters could be taken.<br/>
Many people coming from overseas are stationed in an area for at least three years. I have been in communication with an officer in charge of married quarters. He says that it is quite impossible to find accommodation other than furnished accommodation unless it is in permanent buildings built by the Navy for the purpose. Therefore, there are many families with furniture of their own who have no chance of obtaining a place in which to live. This suggestion would also mean a considerable saving for the Navy. In places like Plymounth there are 500 empty houses, many of which could be made available for this purpose.<br/>
The other matter about which I am concerned is the use made of blocks for the accommodation of chief petty officers. Quite recently in Plymouth, a block of this kind was built for the large sum of &#x00A3;750,000. What is to be the policy in future? Since the block was opened it has not been used to capacity and, with centralised drafting, what use will these blocks be in future? I feel that a considerable reduction could be made in this Vote if blocks of that kind were not built in future. At present they are not serving any very useful purpose.</p>

<p>I also have a question to put concerning married quarters. This is a matter which has always concerned my hon. Friend the Member for Stepney (Mr. W. Edwards), who probably would have been at this Dispatch Box but for the state of his health. What effect will the capital cuts announced recently by the Chancellor of the Exchequer have on the construction of married quarters for the Navy and also on the modernisation of barracks? We are in a slight difficulty over married quarters because some of them are constructed, as it were, under Vote 10 and some by loan under Vote 15, but I hope that we shall have a comprehensive reply about the extent to which they have been cut back as a result of the Chancellor's policy.<br/>
Under Subhead B of Vote 10 there has been a very considerable increase in the amount to be voted. A sum of &#x00A3;210,000 is to be voted for accommodation for personnel. There is another considerable increase in Item (<i>g</i>) for dockyards and factories&#x2014;from &#x00A3;154,000 to &#x00A3;360,000. I should be glad if the Minister could give the House some idea of in what part of the world the greater part of that money will be spent.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is quite right about the two items which he has picked out, because under the works programme in Vote 10 we are putting more emphasis on personnel accommodation, and we are endeavouring to make it very much better. In the earlier debate some remarks were made about accommodation afloat, and it was generally realised that it is very difficult to have a very high standard of accommodation afloat. Therefore, we are particularly anxious that the standard of shore accommodation should be improved.<br/>
To deal with married quarters, although it is quite true that many of them&#x2014;in fact, nearly all of them&#x2014;come under Vote 15, there will be no question of cutting our married quarters programme. That is in full swing in the three home ports and in other places. We have had certain difficulties in finding sites, but we are now going ahead with that programme. We are also going ahead with other living accommodation for single men.<br/>
The question of the barracks at Devonport and of the new block for chief petty officers has been mentioned. I should like to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport (Miss Vickers) that it is incorrect to say that this has not been fully used. From the moment the block was completed it was 69 per cent. full. In addition to that, there were a very large number of chief and petty officers living out who came in there during the day. I was down there the other day, and I think the standard of accommodation is good, but we have to face the fact that much of the shore accommodation that we have is not very satisfactory and that it is desirable to improve it. That is why, in Vote 10 next year, we are placing increased emphasis on our personnel accommodation and

also on dockyard buildings, which were mentioned in the earlier debate. That is where the money is going.<br/>
There is another point I should make in this connection: we are putting a great deal more money into care and maintenance to try to raise the standard of repairs. We have also been putting more money into minor works: small items which have tended in the difficult years since the war to get squeezed out.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked me if I could say where this money was being expended abroad. I am afraid that I could not say for certain without notice. I would suspect that a certain amount of it is being spent in Malta, but I can assure the hon. Member that both at home and abroad we have comprehensive plans for improving service accommodation. A special survey was made a few years ago by a rear-admiral, who went round all the establishments and tried to decide which were those that most needed improvement to their accommodation. Although there have to be changes from time to time, because of a new emergency arising, we have attempted to stick to our plans, and I hope that we shall get the best possible value for money in the improvement of this accommodation.<br/>
There is one further point which the hon. Member for Devonport mentioned in regard to hirings. She asked whether hirings could be unfurnished as well as furnished. I will look into that matter, but I am told that there are considerable difficulties in doing that, and that there is a danger that the civilian population might feel that the Royal Navy is taking more than its share of accommodation in the home ports. We are, however, trying to obtain more furnished accommodation, and I will look into the point which the hon. Lady has raised.</p>

<p>I notice that under Subhead C, relating to minor new works, the figure has gone up by &#x00A3;236,000. We do not want to build minor new works like castles, and I think that we should make some use here of modern technique in semi-permanent buildings. After all, these places have not got to last a very long time, and we should try to economise in new works. I notice that the amount under the heading of "Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance" has increased by a considerable amount, and I suppose that in some cases that


means renovation. Looking through all these Estimates relating to new works, I suggest that the time has arrived when we ought to look at them with the utmost care, because we do not want more capital expenditure or a greater call on our manpower and materials than we can afford.<br/>

<p>I beg to move, in page 17, line 8 at the end to insert:
<q>(4) For the purposes of section eight of the Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act, 1933, in its application to appeals from a juvenile court, the panel constituted under subsection (2) of that section shall include, in addition to the the members provided for by that subsection, a special section consisting of&#x2014;
<ol><li>(<i>a</i>) fifteen justices to be nominated annually from amongst themselves by the members of the panel constituted for juvenile courts in the metropolitan stipendiary court area under paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule to the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933; and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) one justice to be nominated annually from amongst themselves by the members of any panel constituted under paragraph 1 of that Schedule for juvenile courts in a petty sessional division of the county of London not wholly comprised in that area;</li></ol></q>
<q>and arrangements shall be made to secure that, so far as practicable, when an appeal from a juvenile court is to be heard by the court of quarter sessions for the county of London, members of the special section will be available to sit with the chairman of the court, and will be not less than half the justices so sitting:</q>


<q>Provided that this subsection shall not have effect in relation to any appeal entered by the clerk of the peace before such day as the Secretary of State may appoint by order made by statutory instrument</q>
This Amendment was put down to meet a point raised by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. MacColl) in Committee, where I undertook to meet his point with our draft. This is our draft. The hon. Gentleman was concerned that there was no provision to secure that justices with juvenile court experience were included in an appeal court hearing appeals from the London juvenile courts. I think this meets the intention which the hon. Gentleman had in mind.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the question of the delay in the testing of learner drivers, a matter of which I have given notice to my hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and I hope that he will attend the debate. I am very pleased to see my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in his place, and I hope that he will be able to answer the problems which I shall put to the House, but I am a little distressed to note that my other hon. Friend is not yet here.<br/>
However, I will develop my argument as best I may and hope that he will at some time attend our deliberations and that if he does not come, my hon. Friend will make a note of what I have to say and suggest to his hon. Friend that he looks at it diligently. I have raised this question with the Joint Parliamentary Secretary by letter and in an interview with him. Whether it is because of the letter and the interview that he is not here tonight, I do not know. It would have been a little more courteous if he had been here, knowing that the House was likely to rise earlier than usual. These matters are of some concern to a number of people in Sheffield.<br/>
The problem is that Sheffield has a waiting list for the testing of learner drivers which at present means that there is a delay of two months. By the time the summer comes, if my calculations and general information are correct, that delay, if nothing else is done, will increase to three months. Someone who wants to take a test and who puts down his name and feels able to take a test, possibly in June, will have to wait possibly until September. I believe that that is far too long.<br/>
The matter is made even worse by the fact that, owing to the bad weather, 700 cases have had to be put back. These 700 who have already waited two months, will have to wait another two months, making a total of four months' delay. The total


number of people waiting for tests in the Sheffield area is 1,300. I should like to quote from the Sheffield Telegraph which says:
<q>An official of the Yorkshire Traffic Area headquarters at Leeds"&#x2014;</q>
and I hope my hon. Friend will note that this is from the Parliamentary Secretary's own Department&#x2014;
<q>told the <i>Sheffield Telegraph</i> yesterday: ' We have a tremendous back-log of people waiting to take their tests and it will be seven or eight weeks before we can fix them all up again.</q>
That is seven or eight weeks after they have already waited two months. I believe that this merits special consideration. It is not a question of the ordinary run of administration. The matter has become so bad in Sheffield that the Minister should take special cognisance of it and, I suggest, come down to the House of Commons when this matter is raised and deal with it as an emergency.<br/>
I want to make it quite clear that I am not suggesting that those who are unqualified to drive should by some method of quick testing get through and possibly be allowed to drive on their own. I am not suggesting that or anything like it. I am suggesting that there is a duty upon the Minister, and through him the Ministry, to consider those people who have properly learned to drive a car and who wish to take their test, and not leave them waiting for this long period.<br/>
I am glad to see that my hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport has now arrived. I am grateful to him for coming to listen to this problem concerning Sheffield. I am sorry that the debate started a little earlier than was expected and that I have developed quite a large part of my argument. I do not propose to go over it again and I hope that the Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department will tell his hon. Friend what I have been saying.<br/>
I will point out again the gravamen of the main charge which I am making. First, that there are 1,300 people waiting for driving tests in Sheffield. As I said, the Minister has a responsibility to these people, because some may have bought cars and have to wait a considerable time before they can enjoy the use of them. It is even more likely that they have to hire cars and also take lessons from

instructors, which is an expensive business, and they may have to go on hiring cars and taking instructions when they are already able to drive, in order, as they say, to keep their hands in. I believe, therefore, that the Minister has some responsibility towards these people.<br/>
I should like to make some suggestions to him. The first and most obvious is one which I know he has carried out&#x2014;that is to advertise for and to try to get more testers. I appreciate the difficulty, but I believe that is should not be beyond the powers of his Department to get more testers and to get them quickly.<br/>
There are two temporary measures which I suggest because I believe the position in Sheffield has now become so bad that there temporary expedients should be taken. The first is that my hon. Friend should approach the Army authorities to see whether it is possible to get experienced Army driving testers, because there are many of these people about, to help deal with the present emergency in Sheffield.<br/>
I was explaining, before my hon. Friend arrived, that owing to the bad weather about 700 cases have had to be put back and these people will have had to wait four months before they can be tested. Therefore, this is an emergency which needs special consideration. It might be possible to get over this "hump," as it were, by asking the Army to lend a certain number of men, which I believe it would be prepared to do.<br/>
The second suggestion is that it might also be possible to approach the Army to see if sergeants and others, leaving the Forces at the end of their term of service and going into civilian life, could not be canalised into this form of occupation. My third suggestion is that it may be possible to draw in, as a temporary measure, testers from other areas where the backlog is not so great. I cannot believe that the backlog is so big in the rest of the country as it is in Sheffield. It would be a shocking thing if it were. I suggest that this is the sort of administrative problem which has to be met day by day. Such problems are successfully met and I do not think that this is one which the Minister cannot overcome.<br/>
I wish to raise with my hon. Friend the question of the administration of these tests. As he knows, at present the administration is through the Leeds office


of the Ministry. I understand that in Sheffield about 350 people are tested each week. That is in Sheffield alone. If we took in the neighbouring areas of Rotherham, Barnsley, Chesterfield and Doncaster&#x2014;I am glad to see the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Barber) is present in the Chamber&#x2014;it would make an administrative unit such as I believe it is possible to contemplate. When I put this to my hon. Friend during an earlier interview, I thought that he was unfriendly to the idea. I hope that tonight I may hear something more favourable. I should like to know whether he thinks the idea is practicable. I have made inquiries and I believe that there is accommodation available in Sitwell Street, in Sheffield, so that it is not the case that sufficient office room could not be found if an office were to be contemplated for Sheffield.<br/>
I have drawn attention to examples of what I think is extravagance in the Leeds administration, such as the use of telegrams and telephone calls. I am glad to say that since I raised the matter the position has improved, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the action he has taken. I believe that the administration has been tightened up. Even so, one continually finds difficulty, if one does not make use of these more expensive forms of communication, because there is long delay regarding letters and communications of that kind. I believe that in Sheffield we have a right to the efficient service which we should get were an office operated in Sheffield to serve Sheffield and the surrounding district.<br/>
That brings me to the point about the cost of the administration. I understand that each person tested pays a fee of 10s. which means that from the Sheffield area alone they must be taking about &#x00A3;170 a week. If one allows a reasonable fee for each of the testers it means that on balance there is a profit made out of Sheffield alone of about &#x00A3;70 or &#x00A3;80 a week. That could be used to run an office in Sheffield and so provide a better administrative machine there. The money is available and I see no reason why the service should not also be available.<br/>
To sum up, the points which I believe the Minister must face are these. First, an emergency problem has arisen because of the bad weather which has resulted in

1,300 people having to wait to be tested; and I believe that emergency action should be taken, either by bringing in people from outside, or using Service personnel if necessary, so that the duties placed on the Minister by Act of Parliament may be carried out. Secondly, he should consider the provision of a centralised office in Sheffield, which would, I believe, provide a more efficient service for the residents living in Sheffield and district. I believe that that would also result in a financial saving, although my hon. Friend may be able to say more about that tonight. Thirdly, I believe that if my hon. Friend will come to Sheffield&#x2014;it is not so far away&#x2014;and look at the problem on the spot, he will realise that there is a special problem. We shall be pleased to see him and to give him every facility.<br/>
It is a problem that is getting worse and not better, and one which it is a duty for him to solve. I have suggested some methods by which he might do so. I hope, therefore, that we shall be able to hear from him tonight that these people who are now waiting can have some hope of speedy testing in the future.</p>

<p>I should like to begin by apologising to my hon. Friend the Member for Heeley (Sir P. Roberts) for the fact that, owing to transport difficulties in London, I was a little late arriving to answer the debate. It is an extremely good thing that those concerned with the Ministry of Transport should, on occasions, understand how difficult it is to move rapidly about the Metropolis.<br/>
My hon. Friend has raised, on behalf of his constituents, the general problem of obtaining a rapid driving test for a person who is applying for a licence. My hon. Friend set out his problems in order. He suggested that the difficulties in Sheffield were worse than in other parts of the country, but I am sorry to say that that is not so. We are confronted with a great problem everywhere.<br/>
The average waiting period in Sheffield&#x2014;between the receipt of an application and the date of the appointment for a driving test&#x2014;is now about seven weeks. That is also the average for all parts of the country. It is a little worse than it


was a short time ago, because many appointments had to be cancelled owing to the bad weather, but in view of our experience in the past of the great increase in the number of applications which occurs when spring and summer come along, we do not expect any great improvement in this respect in the near future.<br/>
We are doing all we can to recruit additional driving examiners, and so far this year there has been a considerable improvement. At the same time, the number of applicants each year is increasing more rapidly than we can recruit examiners. In 1953, the Department received 691,000 applications for driving tests; in 1954, this figure had risen to 836,000, and in 1955, to 991,000. We expect that in the current year it may rise to over 1 million.<br/>
Recruitment of driving examiners is reasonably satisfactory. We have had many applications, but we do not intend to lower the standard that we require of those who are to be entrusted with responsible work of this kind. I am bound to say, therefore, that although the number of new examiners whom we are recruiting is greater than it has been in the last few years, I am not at all sure that it will be sufficient to deal with the greatly increased number of applicants for driving tests.<br/>
My hon. Friend asked whether we were satisfied that our present organisation was as well calculated to deal with the applications which are made as it could be. My hon. Friend sits for one of the divisions of Sheffield and naturally he is anxious to ensure that something special shall be done for Sheffield. That is the duty of all representatives of constituencies, and I make no complaint that he should be raising this matter.<br/>
Our general system of administration is this. We have examiners in all the large towns, but we have a different arrangement for fixing appointments. It is obviously desirable that appointments shall be allocated among examiners from a central organisation. We have therefore, not departed from the principle that the allocation of appointments shall be done in the office of the traffic commissioners. Applications from Sheffield are dealt with in the office of the Traffic Commissioner for Yorkshire.<br/>
My hon. Friend put forward a plea in favour of Sheffield, which is a large and important city, but we have to take into account the logical consequences if we depart from the general principle that the appointments are allocated where the traffic commissioners have their offices. If we decentralised the job to Sheffield, we should obviously have to do the same for all other large towns. We could not do otherwise, for example, for Liverpool, which at present has no office where these appointments can be made.<br/>
In my hon. Friend's own county of Yorkshire, the number of applications in Hull for driving tests last week was larger than it was in Sheffield. Therefore, if once we were prepared to concede the principle for which my hon. Friend is asking it could not be confined to Sheffield, historic and remarkable though that city is.</p>

<p>Would that be necessarily bad? My hon. Friend has introduced no argument in favour of centralisation. It might be very good to decentralise these things.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-03-15a.682.1" hansard_membership_id="9392" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18462" speakername="Mr. Molson" colnum="682" time="">
<p>That was the third point which my hon. Friend raised, and I was going to deal with it in its logical sequence. I am only concerned at the moment to point out, when my hon. Friends puts forward this claim on behalf of Sheffield, that it could not be confined to Sheffield but would necessarily apply to other cities. We have decentralised the offices from which the examiners exercise their duties. The question is how far we should decentralise the making of appointments.<br/>
This matter of making appointments is rather difficult. All applications are dealt with in the order in which they are made, and those who apply are able to say whether some particular day of the week suits them and whether there is some particular day when they are in any case unable to accept an appointment.<br/>
Those matters are taken into account&#x2014;<br/>

<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, That this House do now adjourn.&#x2014;[<i>Mr. Barber.</i>]</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-03-15a.682.3" hansard_membership_id="9392" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18462" speakername="Mr. Molson" colnum="682" time="">
<p>Those matters are taken into account, and appointments are made


to suit, so far as possible, the convenience of applicants.<br/>
There are occasions when climatic conditions make it impossible or undesirable for the examination to be held. It would obviously not be fair to the applicant if he were asked to take his test on a day when, owing to frost or fog or snow or whatever it may be, the difficulties of driving were very much greater than they normally are. In those cases we try to give the earliest possible notice to the applicant. It is for that reason that in the application form the applicant is asked to give his telephone number, if any, in order that he may be given the earliest indication that it is not thought suitable for the test to take place that day.<br/>
There are also a number of cases&#x2014;and these give rise, perhaps, to the most bitter feelings&#x2014;when the examiner himself, owing to illness or some particular cause, is unable to do his work on a certain day. Of course, it does create a great feeling of hardship in the applicant, when he himself is perfectly prepared to take the test and receives, either by postcard or by telephone or by telegram, at the last moment. notification that the examiner is unable to conduct the test. But it is obviously inevitable that that should happen on a number of occasions.<br/>
I come, then, to the question of whether my hon. Friend's request is reasonable whether, in Sheffield and in every other place where there are a number of examiners at work, it would be reasonable also to have clerks giving out the appointments. In Sheffield, the work that would be required would be a little more than could be done by one junior clerk and would not be really quite enough to justify the employment of two junior clerks.</p>

<p>I did suggest that it was easier to cover Doncaster, Rotherham and Chesterfield from Sheffield instead of from Leeds. It is a question of more easy administration.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-03-15a.683.1" hansard_membership_id="9392" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18462" speakername="Mr. Molson" colnum="683" time="">
<p>I will come to that question of ease of administration. At the moment I am dealing with the question of whether it is desirable to decentralise the allocation of appointments as well as decentralising the offices from which the examiners work.<br/>
When one is trying to allocate appointments for a large number of applicants amongst a number of examiners there is a great deal to be said for centralisation. It means that we are able to treat as a single pool all the applications which are made and to distribute them where the general demand makes it most convenient to do so. If all the applications for appointments, either for Sheffield or for the immediate neighbourhood of Sheffield, were to be made to clerks working in an office in Sheffield, it would be possible for them to allocate appointments amongst the examiners only from the applications which they were receiving from that particular area. We encourage applicants to let us know what day in the week and what hour is most convenient to them for the appointment and when it would be impossible for them to accept an appointment.<br/>
If, therefore, we opened a new office in Sheffield, where the appointments were to be allocated, it would be necessary to have more clerks than we have at present in Leeds dealing with the applications from Sheffield and district, and it would also be necessary for one of the two officials dealing with the matter to be of a more senior status in order to deal with difficulties which arose.<br/>
As my hon. Friend has been good enough to say, he has both written to me on the subject and discussed it with i me. We have looked carefully into it in order to see whether it would be possible to consult the convenience of the applicants in that area better than it is being consulted at present, and also whether that could be done without any substantial increase in expenditure. After that examination, we do not believe that it would result in any increase in the convenience of the applicants in the area, and we are quite convinced, after having gone into the figures, that it would result in employing officials of a higher category who could not be used as efficiently as they are at the moment. It would therefore result in an increase in public expenditure.<br/>
During his speech, my hon. Friend indicated his view that the Government were at present making a profit from tests in Sheffield.</p>

<p>He seemed to me to be of the opinion that we were making a


profit out of the tests now taking place in Sheffield. In fact, the cost of administration is greater than the amount which we receive, and we therefore should not feel justified in increasing the loss which we are sustaining at present. We believe that if we did so it would not result in any increase in convenience to his constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-03-15a.685.0" hansard_membership_id="11482" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30700" speakername="Sir P. Roberts" colnum="685" time="">
<p>Should I be correct in saying that in my hon. Friend's answer tonight he has taken more account of the administrative convenience of his Department than of the convenience of those in Sheffield who are taking their tests?</p>

<p>I had hoped that I had convinced my hon. Friend that from the point of view of his constituents, as from the point of view of everybody else, it is desirable that the allocation of appointments for the whole of Yorkshire should be centralised. I am in no way ashamed to say that the Government are not prepared at present to embark upon increasing facilities if that will lead to increased cost of administration.</p>
