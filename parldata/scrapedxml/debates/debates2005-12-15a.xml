It would have gone up 5 per cent. if not for measures introduced in the 2000 climate change review. There is no room for complacency. We are committed to getting our domestic target of 20 per cent. on track. We will introduce the climate change review and, as our amendment made clear in the recent debate on climate change, we are more than willing to consider ideas from the Opposition.

	<p pid="a.1424.4/1">I add my congratulations to the plaudits already given to the Secretary of State for the agreement reached in Montreal. I note that Paula Dobrianski, the US Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs who was present in Montreal, said that the United States would not welcome formal discussions geared towards a one-size-fits-all approach, which perhaps ties in with the Byrd-Hegel resolution of the US Senate. May I therefore suggest that contraction and convergence are the way forward? That is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and I hope that the Government will provide time for a Bill on that point, which has its Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="">14 July</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1427.0/1">I very much welcome my hon. Friend's interest in biofuels, and the fact that Teeside appears to be developing as one of the centres of biofuel production. I have looked at the Australian model. It is worth saying that the prime reason for setting up the Australian committee was that there were problems with consumer confidence in biofuels, particularly ethanol. That is not the case in the UK, where the mix of 5 per cent. is accepted by all car companies. However, it is important that we look at ways in which we can encourage the uptake and development of a biofuel industry in the UK, and I will give my hon. Friend's suggestion serious thought.</p>

	<p pid="a.1431.8/1">Yes, I agree with my hon. Friend. I found the atmosphere at Montreal, in relation to the views and co-operation of developing countries, much better than at Buenos Aires last year. One reason for that was the successful Gleneagles process involving China and India. The Gleneagles dialogue, which came out of that process, with the first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>, helped to build confidence and pave the way for the successful outcome in Montreal. China played a positive role in that, as did other major emerging economies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1447.4/1">It really is incredible, having spent &pound;2,000 million not curing TB with current methods, that we should have yet another consultation. To secure agreement on a method of culling, the Government must seek a derogation from the 1979 Berne convention on the conservation of European wildlife and natural habitats. Article 9 allows for derogations, but appendix IV lists a number of prohibited culling methods. How long will it take to secure a derogation, and which methods of culling will the Minister seek?</p>

	<p pid="a.1448.2/1">I regret that there will not be an appeal system, so will the Minister ensure that valuations of cattle are published and updated on his website so that people know where they stand. I think that he said that the Government will not compel a farmer to cull, so may I have a reply to my letter to the Secretary of State about the appalling bullying of my constituents in Pensax? Finally, he asked for clarification of a question that I asked earlier. If the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is paying a certain price to vets for the test, will he ensure that vets cannot charge farmers more for the same work?</p>

	<p pid="a.1450.3/1">I am grateful to the Leader of the House for giving the House the opportunity for a debate on the security of energy supply, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" name="Chris Grayling">my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase> has been requesting for some time. I trust that I will have the same degree of success with the request that I shall make to the Leader of the House today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450.3/2">Given the importance of the outcome of the Montreal talks on climate change, which is of long-term significance to us all, and the fact that there has been only limited opportunity to question Ministers through Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions because there has been no oral statement on the matter, will the Leader of the House guarantee that there will be a debate in Government time on the Montreal agreements on climate change?</p>
	<p pid="a.1450.3/3">I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will not have missed the various reports of recent weeks about the problems in public services. In the health service there are many NHS trusts that are in deficit to a total of many hundreds of millions of pounds. Operations are being cancelled and people's names are being taking off waiting lists. As an example of the problem, the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospital Trust will be cutting 280 jobs, crucially including those of nurses and doctors. We learn today that two thirds of our hospitals do not reach the top standards of cleanliness. In education, we heard yesterday that four out of 10 children come out of primary school without being able to read or write properly. So does the right hon. Gentleman not accept the need for a debate in Government time on the delivery of quality public services when Members can press Ministers on why, with so much extra money going to our public services, the Government are still failing to deliver the quality of services that people need?</p>
	<p pid="a.1450.3/4">Of course, public services are also delivered by local councils. The Audit Commission reports today that four out of five of the top-performing local authorities are Conservative controlled. I am sure the Leader of the House will want to join me in congratulating the best performing council in the country, Conservative-controlled Wandsworth. At the same time we are told that half of all town halls are wasting council tax payers' money, so will he ensure that there is a debate in which we can discuss how local authorities can best deliver improved public services and how they can learn from the success of Conservative councils?</p>
	<p pid="a.1450.3/5">Finally, in the spirit of Christmas good will, may I say to the Leader of the House that we on the Conservative Benches stand ready to give any help and advice&mdash;<i>[Laughter.]</i> Wait for it&mdash;any help and advice to Labour or Liberal Democrat Members who wish to learn how to run a successful leadership election.</p>

	<p pid="a.1453.0/1">May we have a debate on the unlikely subject of Government help to distressed citizens? [Hon. Members: &quot;Charles Kennedy&quot;] Is the Leader of the House aware that since the beginning of 2003, 119 million calls to so-called Government helplines have been missed? That is 126,270 missed calls a day, so about 1,000 calls have been missed since we started business questions. Given that many of those calls come from people who are distressed because the tax credit system is working so badly, can we at least get the phone system working so that those people can make a proper complaint?</p>
	<p pid="a.1453.0/2">May we have a debate on the control of British airspace and airports? Yesterday, the Prime Minister said,</p>
	<p pid="a.1453.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The idea that we should investigate every time that a United States Government plane flies into this country is completely absurd.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-14">14 December 2005</phrase>; Vol. 440, c. 1296.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1453.0/4">Many hon. Members expect the Government to know which planes from overseas powers, whether or not they are friendly, are flying into British airspace and the reason why such planes are landing at British airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453.0/5">Finally, will the Leader of the House confirm that there will be statements following the European Council and the World Trade Organisation summit? Given that the failure of one is likely to impact on the failure of the other, until we do something effective to reduce the common agricultural policy, there will be a continuing barrier to helping developing countries through the WTO.</p>

In the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly do not use the first-past-the-post system. In 2007, people who vote in local elections in Scotland will not use that system. We have the unfinished business of the reform of the House of Lords. Whatever the elected element, no one argues for the first- past-the post system.

	<p pid="a.1461.3/1">A few moments ago, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> asked whether we could have a debate on extraordinary rendition. What we got from the Leader of the House was astonishing complacency. He said that all the questions on that matter had been &quot;satisfactorily dealt with&quot;. What we are talking about is people being kidnapped around the world and transported to countries that practise torture. Some of those people have subsequently been released, and they have described the horrific torture to which they have been subjected. Condoleezza Rice's assurances on this matter have been shown to be completely hollow by the legal community in the UK. The Foreign Secretary has given assurances that he has been looking at records and cannot find anything. Of course he cannot find anything; the Home Secretary told me in answer to a parliamentary question that records are not kept once a transit has been completed. No wonder there are no records; they are not kept. Surely it is time for the Leader of the House to find Government time for a debate on this issue, on which there is now widespread public disquiet.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-15a.1462.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" speakername="John Reid" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="1462"  time="12:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051215/debtext/51215-12.htm#51215-12_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.1462.1/1">With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the defence industrial strategy, which I am publishing today and which has been laid before the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/2">The men and women of our armed forces play a vital role as a force for good in the world. I know that the whole House&mdash;and every complexion of party in the House&mdash;is very proud of the work that they do, in dangerous and demanding circumstances, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans or closer to home. We recognise that three elements are required for them to be the best in the world: the intellectual element, involving training, planning and doctrine; the physical element; and the element of morale. All those elements are important. Our armed forces can be this effective only if the Ministry of Defence and industry work as a team to provide them with the best possible tools to do the job, particularly in regard to the second element, the physical component of our fighting power, which involves equipment and capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/3">The defence industrial strategy, which we released today, is the product of five months of concerted effort by Ministry of Defence civil servants, the armed forces, other Government Departments, industry and the trade unions. It has at its heart the provision of effective and capable equipment to our armed forces. On a personal note, I should like to pay tribute to the noble Lord Drayson, who has overseen the production of this substantial document.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/4">The House will know that we are in the middle of a substantial transformation, enabled by the sustained growth in the defence budget that has been a feature of each of the spending reviews that have been conducted since the Government came to power. We are procuring a series of major new platforms, including future aircraft carriers&mdash;on which I made a written statement to the House yesterday&mdash;type 45 destroyers, new medium-weight armoured fighting vehicles, the A400M, Typhoon and joint combat aircraft, among others. This transformation has at its heart the delivery of truly network-enabled capabilities, linking sensors, decision-makers and shooters in a much more integrated way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/5">We expect these platforms to have very long service lives. The future business for the defence industry in many sectors will therefore be in supporting and upgrading the platforms throughout what we believe will be their long service lives, rapidly and incrementally inserting technology to meet emerging threats, fulfilling new requirements and responding to innovative opportunities. That is what we expect of a large section of industrial effort, rather than immediately moving to the design and manufacture of the next generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/6">This will require rationalisation within the defence industry, particularly of over-capacity in production facilities. In some cases, sustaining the skills, technologies and industrial capabilities that we need will be challenging. Change is sometimes challenging and painful, but the one thing that would be much more painful than not changing in a changing world would be to refuse to change, and to find that redundancy and irrelevance had overtaken the product. While we may look overseas to meet some requirements, we will need to ensure that we in this country maintain military freedom of action and safeguard our national security. This degree of change and transformation&mdash;and the respect for future planning capabilities and the maintenance of our strategic safeguards&mdash;implies the need for a comprehensive strategy for how we engage with the industrial base.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/7">The defence industrial strategy, building on the 2002 defence industrial policy, articulates a strategic view of our defence requirements going forward by sector, and the principles that will underpin procurement and industrial decisions in the future. It communicates for the first time to industry and the City those skills, technologies and industrial capabilities that are assessed as being required onshore in the UK in order to sustain the armed forces' ability to operate with an appropriate level of sovereignty. It recognises that this will be possible only if we have a healthy, profitable and internationally competitive industry capable of responding to our requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/8">The defence industrial strategy also investigates how we might with industry address mismatches between planned activity and the work required to sustain desired capabilities. It will give industry and investors a much clearer idea of our priorities, allowing them to plan more assuredly for the future, which will be of benefit to the management, shareholders and workers in industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/9">I now turn to the impact of the analysis that we have conducted on specific sectors of the defence industry. In the maritime sector, the Government are investing in the biggest naval shipbuilding programme that the Royal Navy has seen for two generations. The highly capable expeditionary fleet that will result will offer significantly enhanced military capability, well suited to the demands of the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/10">However, we need to recognise that the industry is currently fragmented&mdash;different companies and facilities undertake submarine build, surface ship build and support, even though the skills required often cross over. We must also face the fact that current levels of work, although huge by comparison with the recent past, will not last for ever. Once we are over the hump of the major reinvestment in new ships in about 10 years' time&mdash;that is how far ahead we are looking at the shortest end of our horizon&mdash;it will not be affordable to sustain excess industrial capacity in the longer term. That means making plans now so that we can keep the required key skills onshore in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/11">For submarines, we are committed to maintaining onshore the ability to design, manufacture and support through life all aspects of that capability, which is so important to our national security. Cost growth in the area, however, is a real and persistent problem. We must control cost. To improve productivity, a new structure is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/12">As my announcement on the future carrier in a written statement to the House yesterday demonstrates, we need to sustain the ability to design and integrate complex surface ships and to support and maintain them through life. A stable and healthy programme of warships and other complex vessels will continue to be built in the UK, and that will maintain and grow the high-end skills that we need. However, we might look to outsource some lower-end manufacturing offshore. That makes sense, not least in order to avoid the boom-and-bust cycle of sustaining or creating capacity for which there is no medium or long-term demand. That is also a much better arrangement for employees, providing the basis for more security and stability to develop and enhance their skills in long-term structured and secure employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/13">In the air sector, the Royal Air Force is in the middle of a substantial re-equipment programme, introducing into service the Eurofighter Typhoon and looking forward to the arrival in the next decade of the joint strike fighter. Both those aircraft will last for at least 30 years. Our current plans do not, therefore, envisage the UK needing to design and build a future generation of manned fast jet aircraft beyond the current projects&mdash;that is some 30 years away.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/14">That has unavoidable consequences, in forward planning, for the medium-term shape of the aerospace industry. We need to retain, however, the high-end aerospace engineering and design capability required to support, maintain, operate and upgrade Typhoon and the joint strike fighter through life, so that they are capable of tackling new challenges as they come along and incorporating new technology and improvements to meet those challenges. That is key to operating our aircraft in the manner that we would choose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/15">The aerospace industry has a critical role to play, and there will be substantial business opportunities for BAE Systems and other companies such as Rolls Royce and SELEX. I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Rolls Royce to provide future through-life support to the RB199 engine on the RAF's Tornado aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/16">As the focus shifts from designing and building new manned aircraft towards supporting them through life, industry will have to make that challenging transformation. We are, however, committed&mdash;this is enshrined in the defence industrial strategy&mdash;to working with industry to manage that transformation with foresight to our mutual advantage. To that end, we intend to enter into negotiations with BAE Systems in the new year with a view to agreeing how best to work together&mdash;and with the many other key suppliers in the sector&mdash;to ensure that the key skills and capabilities that we need are sustained in a cost-effective manner. That work will be complex and arduous and will necessarily take time. It is essential, however, if we are to maintain stability in a period of transformation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1462.1/17">This is an exciting, high technology industry with a healthy future. I am delighted to announce that we will invest in a significant technology demonstration programme for uninhabited combat aerial vehicles. That will help us to better understand the potential military benefits of uninhabited aerial vehicles&mdash;sometimes referred to as unmanned aerial vehicles, I have been instructed to say&mdash;including combat versions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-15a.1466.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1938" speakername="Liam Fox" colnum="1466"  time="12:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051215/debtext/51215-13.htm#51215-13_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1466.0/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his statement, and for making copies available to the Opposition in advance. As he will appreciate, however, it was a long statement and the document is extremely complex. The House might benefit from more time in which to consider the implications, and from a longer debate at some stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/2">The document has been much trailed. It contains a number of points that we welcome, and many that we have called on the Government to adopt in recent years. We welcome the new tone of partnership between Government and industry. More than a year ago we called for</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/3" class="indent">&quot;a mature partnership with industry, with both sides working together from a project's inception through to the completion of its service life.&quot; &mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-04">4 November 2004</phrase>; Vol. 426, c. 488.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/4">If Ministers have genuinely embraced the idea, the House should welcome that. We also welcome the identification of key capabilities that Ministers consider it essential to retain in the interests of our national sovereignty, although we shall have to study some of the detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/5">The Treasury, however, holds the key to much of what is in the document. Has the Treasury agreed to fund the defence industrial strategy fully in the 2007 comprehensive spending review, and what discussions has the Secretary of State had with the Chancellor to that end? If the defence budget is squeezed in the spending round, the document becomes simply a wish list. Implementation is everything.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/6">Has the Treasury made an assessment of the effect of spending on defence-related research and development and equipment on Britain's overall economic competitiveness, and will the Secretary of State make such information available to the House? Where onshore capability is maintained for reasons of strategic assurance, it is vital that value for money is guaranteed, especially when sole sourcing is involved. What measures will be established to ensure that, when the economic forces of competition are absent, taxpayers' money is best protected?</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/7">I have a number of specific sectoral questions. The document states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/8" class="indent">&quot;In a change to the stated Defence Industrial Policy, there is no absolute sovereign requirement to construct all our warship hulls on shore&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/9">Does the Secretary of State expect to buy hulls from abroad? What assessment have the Government made of the impact on the shipbuilding industry and employment therein?</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/10">Individual helicopter programmes have been amalgamated in the overarching future rotorcraft capability process, and the overall budgets have been reduced by &pound;1.4 billion on the basis that the Financial Reporting Council will identify synergies and savings. I think we have all heard that from Departments in the past. The most pressing requirements identified by recent reports from the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee are caused by shortfalls in the helicopter lift capability that is essential to our activity in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. However, more than two thirds of the &pound;3 billion FRC budget is about to be spent on two programmes, the Merlin Mk1 upgrade and Future Lynx programmes, most of which are unrelated to those requirements. Furthermore, &pound;1.2 billion is scheduled to be spent on purchasing, without competition, 80 Future Lynx helicopters for the Army and Navy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/11">An Army purchase is required to spread the non-recurring costs, but it is unlikely that such a route would have been followed if operational requirements had been the main driver. That approach seems to be at odds with the avowed aim of the strategy to put the cost-effective acquisition of capability at centre stage. Perhaps the Secretary of State will deal with the apparent discrepancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/12">The future aircraft carrier project was unveiled in the strategic defence review in 1998, with the first carrier due to enter service 14 years later in 2012. More than seven years down the line, we still have no firm order placed and no in-service date declared. Yesterday we had what is now described as a two-stage incremental approach to main gate. We will have another long wait before costs and timings are revealed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/13">Will the Secretary of State confirm that both carriers will miss what the Government used to say were the target in-service dates of 2012 and 2015? Is it not true that the industry expects no first carrier before 2014, and no second carrier before 2106 at the earliest? Where does that leave the existing fleet of three small carriers, one of which has been paid off prematurely while the other two are due for disposal well before the likely in-service dates of their successors? Above all, where does it leave the capability of the Royal Navy, which has already sacrificed so many of its other warships for the sake of the promised future carriers?</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/14">The statement made a passing reference to maintaining onshore the ability to design and build submarines, but no mention was made of the all-important issue of replacing the Trident fleet. Making the decision about embracing Trident is the step that the Government embrace about as much as Dracula would embrace a crucifix. Building a new fleet of missile submarines will have a massive impact on our defence industrial plans, and the time scale cannot be less than 12 to 15 years. That is why the Government pledged in the last Parliament to make the decision in this one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/15">Will the Government now face up to what is a vital issue? Why is the Secretary of State so afraid to do so? Of whom or of which is he more scared, the Chancellor, the Prime Minister in waiting, or the dissent of many of his Back Benchers? When will he begin in earnest the debate about the future of the nuclear deterrent on which people on both sides of the argument are willing, indeed eager, to begin?</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/16">Let me assure him in one respect. If the Government take the right decision, they will be able to count on the support of the Conservatives to ensure that the country remains protected indefinitely against nuclear blackmail. The generosity of the Opposition to the Government at this time is unbounded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/17">Overall, this may be a rather pessimistic strategy document. The argument seems to be that when the current tranche of orders is completed, surplus capacity will have to be dealt with. I wonder what assumptions are made in this assessment of the outlook for British defence exports and what measures the Government could put in place to ensure that some of the surplus capacity is used to expand our defence exports overseas, especially in the aerospace industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466.0/18">At first glance, there are a number of positive elements in the strategy document, but there are also a number of anxieties that will be felt across the country. The Secretary of State may be able to address some of them, but the Chancellor remains the key to preventing it from being a strategy of defence industrial decline. Sovereignty comes at a price; will the Chancellor and the Government be willing to pay it?</p>

	<p pid="a.1469.0/1">There are obviously some elements of the hon. Gentleman's contribution that I greatly welcome. I think that the document is important and I have no doubt that we will return to it in the course of our debates. Perhaps, as it is a substantial document, we could chat through the usual channels about how best to handle that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469.0/2">Secondly, I believe that we should try to achieve as much consensus as possible in respect of the document. I have always taken that view on defence as a whole. Issues of national security should, as far as possible, be resolved on a non-party basis. That is not easy and it does not mean the absence of criticism, but the consensual approach should be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469.0/3">I note that the hon. Gentleman offers me the opportunity of going, as they would say in East Kilbride, &quot;mob-handed&quot; to meet the Chancellor with the Conservative party behind me. If I do not immediately accept his offer, I am sure that he will understand why. My old friend the Chancellor has overseen and watched from a distance. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the foreword to the document, he will see that one of the three faces pictured at the top is that of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury&mdash;and he is smiling. It can also be seen that the word &quot;no&quot; does not appear anywhere under his signature. As far as I can make out, that is a first.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469.0/4">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there has been a great deal of cross-Government participation. That is why, sitting alongside me on the Front Bench, is the Minister for Industry and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" name="Alun Michael">the Regions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael)</phrase> and&mdash;a little further down, but close to us in spirit&mdash;my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General, who is also smiling. Clearly, the Government have adopted a united approach on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469.0/5">More seriously, the hon. Gentleman asked me whether the Chancellor has settled with me on the next three spending rounds. Of course he has not settled all that with me. We should remember that the rounds stretch through to 2015 and beyond, and it is obvious that no responsible Government would make commitments that far in advance. Over the past few years, there has been a real increase in defence spending which, as I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would in all fairness admit, was not always the case under the last Conservative Government. In fact, that period saw a 29 per cent. cut in real terms in defence spending. There is a great deal of unity on the part of the Government and I am glad that there is a great deal of consensus on the general direction of where we are going with our defence industrial strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469.0/6">It is a detailed publication and it is divided into three parts. The first provides a strategic overview; the second an analysis of specific sectors; and the third deals with implementation and how we have achieved implementation thus far. On maritime, the hon. Gentleman was good enough to read out the section that said that there would be no blanket requirement for hulls to be built onshore, but he unfortunately missed out the next part of the sentence, which says that there is a need to maintain a sustainable work load for a viable restructured industry in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469.0/7">Yesterday's announcement that 60 per cent. of the work on the two biggest crafts&mdash;at 60,000 tonnes&mdash;ever to be built by the Navy will be allocated to British shipyards demonstrates clearly that we are trying to maintain a sustainable level of employment and skills, particularly at the high-end sector of the technological development of shipbuilding and refurbishment. We are seeking long-term clarity and attempting to introduce ships at what might be called a regular drumbeat in order to assist the maintenance of skills. If we need a peak capacity at the lower end of production&mdash;the sort of crafts that would not traditionally be regarded as warships&mdash;we reserve the right to go offshore, but yesterday's announcement clearly shows that we intend to maintain a sustainable work load for a viable restructured industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469.0/8">The hon. Gentleman asked several detailed questions about aircraft carriers and in-service dates, but he appears to have missed something important from yesterday's announcement. By innovatively involving the companies that are to produce the new carriers&mdash;British Aerospace and the rest of the alliance&mdash;in the maintenance, updating and refitting of the existing aircraft carriers, we have effectively ensured continuity of capability. That is why the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the Naval Staff, said that yesterday's announcement was the best Christmas present that the Navy could have been given.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469.0/9">On Trident, I have little to add to what I have already said. It is a very important discussion, but we want to take time to reflect on it. With all due respect to the hon. Gentleman, we have clearly said, first, that we will retain the nuclear deterrent. We said that unambiguously six months ago in our manifesto. Secondly, the basis of retention is the assumption that, as long as potential enemies have nuclear weapons, we will retain them. Thirdly, we are not discussing whether to retain Trident, but whether in 15 to 20 years' time we will need something to continue the nuclear deterrent. We have a little more time, therefore, to challenge ourselves and each other on the assumptions and practicalities of the issue. There is no need to take a peremptory decision on that in order to meet the time scale for the defence industrial strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1473.3/1">I am sure that the Secretary of State's judgment in putting his trust in respect of our chemical and biological defence into the hands of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down in my constituency is entirely correct. He gave an assurance about the testing and evaluation work carried out by QinetiQ at Boscombe Down, also in my constituency, but said that he wants the European Defence Agency to consider whether we should amalgamate and rationalise some of that work across Europe. However, what about the intellectual property rights that we share with our American allies? What will their reaction be if they know that we are working with European companies, some of which are sited in a nation that is not even a full NATO member?</p>

	<p pid="a.1474.0/1">Obviously, that is one of the issues that has to be dealt with. Whenever I make a statement on any aspect of defence, the hon. Gentleman always has a perfect right to comment, as his constituency seems to have an interest in almost everything defence related. He has identified a problem that we must resolve, but I shall make one general point about the EDA. We do not regard it as an autonomous body that can order and procure on its own. If I may use the expression, we think of it more as a dating agency&mdash;a body that brings member states together to collaborate on projects that they consider worthwhile. It does not act over and above the member states, but rather brings them together.</p>

	<p pid="a.1475.2/1">On the helicopter sector, may I, as MP for Yeovil and an economic liberal, say that the Secretary of State has managed to strike the right balance between the need to secure key sectors and the need to achieve value for money for taxpayers? I congratulate him on that. Can we expect an announcement early in 2006 on the key Future Lynx order, provided that it meets the value-for-money criteria?

	<p pid="a.1475.3/2">As for the Lynx helicopter, we are keen to ensure that its through-life and update programmes are continued. The very important skills at Agusta Westland are essential to that, and I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> is right to ask about that, from his perspective both as a constituency MP and as someone with an interest in the procurement of very important assets for our armed forces. He will know that the world market in helicopter production is thriving and competitive. We would be silly not to take advantage of that, as that is the context in which we find ourselves. I happen to believe that Agusta Westland is able to do very well in the world market, given its success in providing the helicopters used to convey the President of the United States. That is at least one example of Liberals supporting the US President.</p>

	<p pid="a.1478.2/1">We have given that continual attention. I am musing on the word &quot;independent&quot;. I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means. Certainly I take responsibility as the person who, during the controversy about whether we should buy the C-17s, with Lord Gilbert was on the side of leasing C-17s. We believed that the operational capability of those huge aircraft overcame any objections that we should buy a less capable European alternative. We bought the C-17s and we are looking at buying more. As far as I can make out the RAF, whose morale will be flying a little higher than it was a few years ago, regard the C-17 as a great success. I forgot to mention it earlier. The independence of strategic airlift at European level is important. Some years ago it was identified as completely insufficient in the strategic defence review, so we tried to remedy that. We will continue to have a view on it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1479.5/1">It might be appropriate to say a word or two about the context of this afternoon's business, because this is one of those Bills that sadly seems to have received all-party support to date, and that usually means very bad legislation indeed. Time and again in the House, we are confronted with that revolting political concept consensus, which usually involves a lack of proper debate and scrutiny of the legislation. A few of us hope to put that right and give the Bill something of a proper examination in the limited time that is now available to us this afternoon. In doing so, I start with the group of amendments that you have just identified, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.1479.5/2">It is fair to say that the thrust of the amendments covers two principal areas of consideration&mdash;one is the general concept of consultation and the other is the contradistinction of expedience and reasonableness, which we shall perhaps come to later. In framing the amendments on consultation that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> and I have tabled, I underwent a rollercoaster ride in deciding finally where to end up, because the amendments suggest that the Treasury be obliged to consult the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs. I was in two minds about that, because when I looked at the genesis of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs, I found a rather mixed picture, and it is fair to say&mdash;I should warn the House&mdash;that this is perhaps not quite so straightforward as it would seem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1479.5/3">I wanted to create a vehicle, a mechanism, whereby somebody other than the Treasury can look at the very important matters that we are dealing with in the Bill&mdash;retrospection and all that goes with it&mdash;and I lit upon the commissioners as the most appropriate body. In doing so, I went to the Act that set up the commissioners and, indeed, to the explanatory notes to that Act, and I want to share them briefly with the House, so that hon. Members can judge whether my amendment is appropriate. Obviously, I will argue that, on balance, my amendment represents the way forward, but I want to attach a health warning to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1479.5/4">I refer first to paragraph 7 of the explanatory notes to the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1479.5/5" class="indent">&quot;The Act provides that, in the exercise of their functions, the Commissioners will comply with directions of a general nature given to them by the Treasury. It provides the legislative structure within which the Commissioners have the operational discretion to organise in the most appropriate way, and to make changes over time as necessary.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1479.5/6">Straightaway, we have run into a possible problem in that I am arguing that we give the commissioners the opportunity to be consulted, whereas we have right there in front of us the phrase,</p>
	<p pid="a.1479.5/7" class="indent">&quot;the Commissioners will comply with directions of a general nature given to them by the Treasury.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1479.5/8">That is my first health warning on the amendment.</p>

Friends to contribute, to elaborate a little on the idea that expediency rests almost entirely on practicability, so the test would simply be, &quot;Can it be done?&quot;, whereas reasonableness introduces more of a concept of fairness and, therefore, of judgment. That, surely, is the distinction that we are trying to make and is so important to those who may well suffer from retrospection in its worst forms.</p>

	<p pid="a.1487.5/1">My hon. Friend, a distinguished member of the Standing Committee that considered the Bill, is right to draw attention to that point, and I hope that he will have the chance to expand on it in his own speech in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/2">I find it hard to believe that the Minister will not accept the change proposed in amendment No. 14 so that subsection (2) would read:</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/3" class="indent">&quot;Those regulations may be made so as to have retrospective effect if it&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/4">is reasonable</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/5" class="indent">&quot;in consequence of the retrospective tax provision, for the regulations to have that effect.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/6">That would mean that the judge of that reasonableness would ultimately be the courts; it would not be left to the Treasury to decide whether the measure was expedient. It is hard to think of any circumstances in which the Treasury would not think it expedient to legislate in favour of getting more revenue, however just or unjust that might be. That is the big problem with the wording at present; it encourages the Treasury to say, as we often hear from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that if something will generate revenue it is expedient and must be good, irrespective of how fair or unfair it might be.</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/7">I have given the Minister a safety net. If she believes that the Treasury should continue to be the judge, it would, under my amendment No. 15, have to satisfy the test of reasonableness rather than of expediency. I hope that she will accept my amendment No. 14 but if she thinks that would cause great loopholes that the Treasury would not be able to close, as an alternative she could fall back on amendment No. 15, which would still give the Treasury the say, but on grounds of reasonableness rather than expediency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="Mr. Knight">My right hon. Friends the Members for Bromley and Chislehurst and for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)</phrase> have been consulting the dictionary. In preparation for this short debate, I resorted to &quot;Words and Phrases Legally Defined&quot;, a useful reference for legislators. It draws attention to decided case law in the UK and the common law jurisdictions and sets out how particular phrases have been interpreted in the courts, which enables us as legislators to decide which phrases and words we want to incorporate in our own legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/9">In a Canadian case, &quot;Words and Phrases&quot; refers to the &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; definition of expedient as</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/10" class="indent">&quot;advantageous; fit, proper, or suitable to the circumstances of the case: Useful, politic, as opposed to just or right&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/11">I realise that my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire was referring to the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot;, but with the greatest respect, I think that the &quot;Shorter Oxford Dictionary&quot;, which is in fact longer, sets out the definition more clearly and precisely. In the case of Health Care Developers Inc. <i>v.</i> Newfoundland, in 1996, there is a reference to whether the terms of the Public Tender Act were wide. The conclusion is that, due to the use of the word &quot;expedient&quot;, the Act is extremely widely drawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/12">Similarly, a reference in the &quot;New Zealand Law Reports&quot; to a case in 1998 notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/13" class="indent">&quot;'Expedient' is frequently used in statutes . . . While there may be shades of meaning of the word, depending on the context, reference to standard dictionaries brings out its basic meaning . . . Clearly, 'expedient' as used in the section&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/14">of the New Zealand Criminal Justice Act 1985&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/15" class="indent">&quot;sets a lower threshold than 'necessary', a conclusion reinforced by the consideration that the legislature often employs the alternative standards of 'necessary or expedient' &quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1487.5/16">That is especially material, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst referred to the statute that set up the Customs and Excise commissioners and the powers to deal with what was &quot;necessary or expedient&quot;. However, we notice that the words &quot;necessary or&quot; have been left out of the Bill. If the very commissioners are set up under arrangements that enable them to do that which is necessary or expedient, why should the Treasury be given even greater power, without the inclusion of the necessity test?</p>

	<p pid="a.1490.2/1">Obviously, it would be better than not accepting the amendment at all but, in deference to my hon. Friend, the word &quot;expedient&quot; is far too broad for the Bill, which gives the Government power by regulation to introduce retrospective legislation to penalise British citizens with higher taxes, especially national insurance contributions. If my hon. Friend had tabled such an amendment, I would be happy to address it, but I do not wish to encourage a joint test of reasonableness and expediency, as there is an inherent conflict between the two concepts. That is why I did not table such an amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1490.2/2">&quot;Stroud's Judicial Dictionary&quot; says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1490.2/3" class="indent">&quot;The word 'reasonable' has in law the prima facie meaning of reasonable in regard to those circumstances in which the actor, called on to act reasonably, knows or ought to know&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1490.2/4">That is exactly what we are trying to achieve. The Government should act reasonably in the exercise of the great powers that it seeks in the Bill. There is no reason why we should discuss all the other uses of the word &quot;reasonable&quot;, but it is worth remembering that expressions such as &quot;reasonable acts&quot;, &quot;a reasonable amount&quot;, &quot;reasonable and probable cause&quot;, &quot;a reasonable time&quot; and &quot;reasonable care&quot; are frequently included in legislation, and have been the subject of judicial decisions. If we are to introduce strong regulations that can penalise people retrospectively and if the Government act unreasonably, it should be possible to challenge such action in the courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.1491.3/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" name="Eric Forth">My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> have done the House a service by tabling the amendments. When I perused the amendments last night, I was more attracted to my right hon. Friend's amendment No. 2, which unfortunately has not been selected. I was unsure whether his amendment No. 1 would have any effect at all if implemented. The commissioners are not at arm's length from the Treasury. They have a similar purpose, and one struggles to think of occasions when the commissioners have stood up strongly to a Treasury view on a particular matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1491.3/2">So I started out not being sympathetic to my right hon. Friend's amendment because I took the view that it was too weak to be worth the candle, but on reflecting on the matter and listening to what he said, it occurred to me that if approved by the House, it may bring some benefits in that Ministers might decide to set out guidelines to the commissioners telling them, if the power of consultation was incorporated in the Bill, that they were required to take evidence from interested third parties and listen to representations made to them. The issuing of guidelines, which is not part of my right hon. Friend's amendment but which Ministers could nevertheless do, could make his amendment worthwhile. I have been won over as the debate has progressed, because the amendment could be made to work and have some effect. So, on balance, I can say that my right hon. Friend has my support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1491.3/3">I am with my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch all the way on the amendments that he tabled. I cannot see how the Minister can justify resisting the use of the word &quot;reasonable&quot;. A number of definitions were quoted to the House, but the essence of my hon. Friend's argument is contained in the &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot; quotation that I read to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst earlier. The &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;expedient&quot; as &quot;advantageous&quot; and goes on to say&mdash;this is a killing phrase&mdash;&quot;politic rather than just&quot;. The Paymaster General is asking us to accept the use of a power that can be taken to be unjust. I wonder why she has not thus far signified that she accepts my hon. Friend's amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1491.3/4">I suspect it is highly likely that the courts would not interfere with the use of a power where that power can be used expediently. I do not think the courts would interfere with a Minister saying, &quot;I took that decision because I deemed it was expedient&quot;, whereas we know from a raft of court decisions that the courts eagerly give their view where the statute concerned refers to &quot;reasonable&quot;. Using the word &quot;expedient&quot; in effect gives Ministers carte blanche.</p>
	<p pid="a.1491.3/5">I agree with what was said earlier. I have nothing but praise for the Paymaster General, but when we are making law and examining the phraseology that we use, we must assume the worst. I am far from happy to allow a future Government of whatever political persuasion to give powers enabling a Minister to deem, on a whim, that a decision is expedient. I hope that on reflection the House will accept my hon. Friend's amendment, and I hope the Minister will accept it.</p>

Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase>, which deal with consultation. I share my right hon. Friend's view that tax legislation should be based as far as possible on consultation. It is important that good legislation should reflect discussions that the Treasury has had with tax advisers, professionals and representatives of industry, so that their views can be taken on board. The Treasury has a fair record of consultation with external bodies. Indeed, when retrospective taxation was discussed in the debates on what became the Finance Act 1978, one of the preconditions of retrospective taxation in trying to close tax loopholes was that there should be consultation with professional bodies and institutions. That is an admirable principle, and it is usually followed. However, it is not always followed. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">My hon.

	<p pid="a.1499.1/1">I want to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/2">As the hon. Member for Christchurch implied, this is not about making people pay more national insurance. It is about ensuring that they pay the national insurance that the House, over decades, has decided that everyone should pay. It is a question of fairness. Unfortunately, however, all Governments faced the same problem. Governments would see a contrived avoidance scheme and close it down; the avoiders would then move to another highly sophisticated scheme, which would have to be targeted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/3">The current Government took a number of steps. I announced the first in a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, making it clear not just that the Government would close the loopholes that they had identified so far, but that any future attempt not to pay the right amount of national insurance or tax would be prevented. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase>, whom I welcome to his first debate as a member of the shadow Treasury team, said that that statement was unclear. Let me read a sentence from it, because I am not sure how people can claim to be confused by it or not to understand it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We intend that from today both tax and NICs legislation should achieve our objective of subjecting the rewards of employment to the proper amount of tax and NICs, however the rewards are delivered.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>; Vol. 427, c. 41WS.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/5">That seems perfectly clear to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/6">The statement announced the closing of existing loopholes, which was dealt with by Finance Bill tax measures and is dealt with by measures in this Bill. It also introduced a strong deterrent. It said &quot;Just don't do it, because however you do it, we will close down the scheme.&quot; The amendments would remove, or weaken, that deterrent. They effectively say to those in the tax avoidance industry &quot;Let us continue to play this game of cat and mouse. You carry on finding ways not to pay tax, and we will close the schemes down after the Treasury has lost the revenue.&quot; That is not acceptable to any fair-minded or, dare I say, reasonable person.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/7">The hon. Gentleman also brought up the question of consultation, and the roles of the commissioners and the Treasury. It was a good debating point, but was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the workings of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. As the Bill only completed its passage through both Houses earlier this year, I find that a bit strange.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/8">Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is a statutory body, and Treasury Ministers represent it in Parliament. It is therefore appropriate for the Treasury to introduce the legislation. Both here and in the other place, there were debates on exactly what was meant by the term &quot;Treasury&quot; in legislation. It means the Treasury as a Department, meaning the Treasury and HMRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/9">On the specific amendments, I have to ask why the Treasury and HMRC would not be working together on the regulations. Of course they would, so amendments Nos. 1, 4, 7, 10 and 11 are wholly unnecessary. Whenever Treasury regulations are to be made to supplement primary tax and national insurance contributions, officials from both the Treasury and HMRC always discuss and consult each other on the wording. It is simply unnecessary to enshrine such a normal practice, which has been accepted as straightforward administrative practice for an extremely long time, in the Bill. Doing so would be a waste of parliamentary and drafting time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/10">Conservative Members then went on to stress the need for consultation, but they know perfectly well that the regulations are subject to consultation and affirmative procedure. Anyone who wants to express their views on regulations can do so. The notion of consultation, as it appears in the amendments, is simply preposterous.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/11">What of amendments Nos. 14, 15 and 17? I do not believe that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst intends to destroy the Bill, but if he does, he should have said so when he moved his amendments, rather than dress up his aims in linguistic niceties about the meaning of &quot;reasonableness&quot; and &quot;expedient&quot;. The amendments strike at the heart of the caveat of a deterrent. If the statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> holds in its deterrent effect, no legislation will be necessary because people will not try, through remuneration&mdash;this applies only to employment remuneration&mdash;to avoid paying their proper taxes or insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/12">The idea that in those three amendments&mdash;Nos. 14, 15 and 17&mdash;all that the right hon. Gentleman is doing is a bit of linguistic tidying-up is simply not the case. If he wants to know the use of &quot;expedient&quot;, he needs to see it in the wider context. He knows full well that it is not about looking into whatever dictionary one cares to take off the shelf because the context of the word is important as well. In the particular case of proposed new section 4C, the expediency applies to certain specified purposes, which is quite right. If he wants precedent for using the word &quot;expedient&quot; rather than &quot;reasonableness&quot;, he need look no further than to his own Government in 1992, although I can understand why he now wants to distance himself from decisions that he was happy to vote for at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/13">This has been an interesting debate, but it would have been better if the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst had been more straightforward with the House about what he was attempting to do&mdash;to remove the strong and important deterrent effect of the regulations. If the right hon. Gentleman still wants to put his amendments to the vote, I ask my hon. Friends to oppose them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1504.2/1">Of course I agree with my hon. Friend. The Government would probably say, &quot;Well, it does not matter really, does it?&quot; because those folk are far away and do not have a direct voice in what is going on here. We are talking about the Government saying that it does not matter how, when or whether they raise money, but I suspect that that would apply equally to their attitude to whether they disburse money.</p>
	<p pid="a.1504.2/2">Proposed new subsection (5) says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1504.2/3" class="indent">&quot;But nothing in subsection (2) authorises regulations to be made which have effect in relation to any time before 2nd December 2004.&quot;</p>

Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> has tabled an amendment by which he seeks to alter that date. I would prefer to remove it altogether. The Paymaster General attempted to justify that date in summing up the previous debate. She said something along the lines of , &quot;If a Minister says on a certain date we may legislate in the future to do something that you may do in the future but we are not sure and we really don't care very much, that is all right.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1504.2/5">We are now into the era of blanket provision, forecasting or attempting to forecast what might be and giving the Government what amounts to a blank legislative cheque to do whatever they like. That may be all right in the minds of Ministers whose attitude, frankly, to government and Parliament over the past seven or eight years has been consistently contemptuous&mdash;we have almost come to accept that&mdash;but to have it spelled out in a Bill is going way too far. It is one thing to alter the procedures of the House, to reduce, curtail or deny debate or to cut down almost to nothing the time available to scrutinise legislation in Committee, but when phrases such as &quot;it does not matter&quot; or &quot;any time before&quot; this or that date are included in a Bill, we are getting into extremely dangerous territory.</p>

	<p pid="a.1509.2/1">Certainly. The idea of governing by ministerial fiat, by statement, is dangerous, and not only in the context of the measure that we are discussing. One might consider the consequences of this year's pre-Budget report, where the Treasury unsaid what it had previously said about the eligibility of the inclusion of ordinary houses in self-invested personal pensions. An earlier ministerial statement had announced that from April 2006 it would be possible for people to include property in their SIPPs and on that basis many companies set up businesses and incurred expense and risk. The Government will not compensate people who were adversely affected by anticipating Government legislation. I have no quarrel with people anticipating legislation. They took the Government's word as a true intention of what would happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1509.2/2">It turns out that that is not going to happen. As recently as <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase> this year, I received a letter from the Economic Secretary justifying and, indeed, commending the proposals that SIPPs should include assets such as houses. He pointed out that that would not have an adverse effect on the property market. In any event, he said, only 1 per cent. of pension funds would be affected. Anyone who assumed from that letter that they should invest in such pension funds or set up schemes to facilitate such investment would have been acting in advance of the Finance Bill and therefore at their own risk. Unfortunately, no compensation is available in such a situation, but the Government are suggesting that if they make an announcement through a written answer on national insurance contributions, it should be regarded as gospel. Their approach is therefore inconsistent. We appear to be moving into a new era of government by fiat&mdash;whatever Ministers say goes&mdash;while, at the same time, letters are written to introduce provisions for compensation for people who act on the basis of those Government statements only to find that they have acted to the detriment of their interests.</p>

There are practical consequences of Governments legislating by fiat, and there are times when, as a Member of Parliament, one might wish that the law could be retrospective. For example, I have a constituency case where somebody is arguing bitterly that a single prostitute living above a shop should be deemed to be running a brothel. Unfortunately, the law says that in order for it to be a brothel, there must be more than one prostitute operating. My constituent would be delighted if the Government introduced legislation making it retrospectively criminal to be doing what that individual is doing, but those of us who believe in the rule of law and the principle of parliamentary legislation would not support such retrospection, even if it was thought to be expedient. I am sure there are people who would say that such legislation was expedient, but I do not believe we should allow that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/3">It is true&mdash;this is the point that the Paymaster General made&mdash;that there are precedents for retrospection. They go back to the time of the second world war, but during the 1970s, under the Labour Government of the day, the then Chancellor, Denis Healey, now Lord Healey, brought in rules to deal with tax avoidance. Retrospection was a controversial issue at the time and the debate about that resulted in the development of the Rees rules. Those were drawn up by Lord Rees, who at the time was shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury and went on to be Chief Secretary to the Treasury and an important member of the Government of my noble Friend Lady Thatcher.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/4">Mr. Rees, as he was in those days, argued that retrospective legislation should be subject to four conditions. First, the warning given in the House of Commons</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/5" class="indent">&quot;must be precise in form. A mere suggestion that there are vague schemes of tax avoidance that must be counted should not suffice. Secondly, the problem at which the warning has been directed should immediately be referred to a committee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/6">He referred to one that he understood existed, made up of members of the Inland Revenue and the accountancy and legal professions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Thirdly, if the committee can hit on appropriate legislative provision, the draft clause . . . should immediately be published in advance of the Finance Bill so that those who are likely to be in the field of fire will have a second clear intimation of what to expect. Fourthly, such a clause must, without fail, be introduced in the following Finance Bill . . . I believe there may be situations in which&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/8">that approach</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/9" class="indent">&quot;is the only solution if we are to counter avoidance of the sophistication and scale which we understand has been current of late. But if a Government are to adopt that remedy, it must be on&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/10">that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/11">The Paymaster General cannot suggest that there are no precedents for retrospection, because there are precedents for retrospection with safeguards, and I tabled amendment No. 16 because those safeguards have not been met in this particular case. The statement by the Paymaster General on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> was not the subject of immediate consultation with the relevant professions, and it was not the subject of a clause in the next Finance Bill. I agree that that is true of the tax provisions, but they are a separate issue, because we are discussing provisions relating to national insurance contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/12">I thought it telling that the regulatory impact assessment states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/13" class="indent">&quot;As this is a measure directed at tax avoidance, consultation was not appropriate before the publication of the Bill. The proposal is to apply to NICs the existing rules for disclosure of tax schemes. These rules were the subject of detailed discussions with the accountancy and legal professions, and other businesses during 2004&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-15a.1512.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" speakername="Christopher Chope" colnum="1512"  time="16:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051215/debtext/51215-27.htm#51215-27_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.1512.1/1">Hon. Members must draw their own conclusions. When the Paymaster General made her statement, if the Rees conventions had been complied with, consultation with the relevant parties would have been carried out immediately and the Bill would have included the appropriate draft clauses. However, the regulatory impact assessment tells us that no detailed consultation took place before the Bill was published, because the measure is directed at tax avoidance. If the Paymaster General is right in saying that everything was plain and apparent back in December 2004, what harm would there have been in working out the detailed legislative formula that was to flow from the proposition set out on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/2">As the Institute of Chartered Accountants has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/3" class="indent">&quot;We do not think that anyone reading the Paymaster General's <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> statement could have expected the content of the Bill.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/4">&quot;Anyone&quot; includes not only dullards, but smart lawyers, accountants and o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">thers. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase>, who is on the Front Bench, is a distinguished accountant, and perhaps he will tell us later whether he knew exactly what would happen when he read the Paymaster General's statement. If it was obvious, there could have been no harm in having detailed consultations with the profession, but that never happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/5">Amendment No. 19 would remove a grotesque Henry VIII provision that gives a power to change primary legislation by regulation and to do so, in certain circumstances, retrospectively. That is wholly unjustified, even in what the Minister described as the extreme circumstances that make the Bill necessary. I hope that she can explain why she thinks that this particular provision is necessary. This is a very serious issue. We are talking about an assault on fundamental freedoms that go back to the days of Magna Carta. The Minister will say, as always, that there is a precedent. The problem is that every time we take away one of those freedoms, or salami-slice it a little bit, we are gradually giving the state more power.</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/6">The Government argue that the Bill has an element of proportionality. I should like to draw the House's attention to what the explanatory notes say about article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Paragraph 84 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Clause 7 enables, but does not require, provision to be made requiring disclosure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/8">Paragraph 85 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The Government considers that any perceived interference with rights under Article 8 of the Convention created by these provisions is justified under paragraph 2 of that Article on the grounds that it is necessary in the interests of the economic well-being of the country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/10">If the provision was in the interests of the economic well-being of the country because it would raise vast sums of money proportionate to the overall budget of the Exchequer, one could begin to see that it might comply with the article.</p>
	<p pid="a.1512.1/11">Let us consider this in context. At its height, the provision will raise &pound;96 million for the financial year 2004&ndash;05. Yet, earlier this month, the Government announced in the pre-Budget report that they propose to borrow &pound;151 billion over the next five years. It is hard to see that raising &pound;96 million&mdash;which equates to &pound;3 or &pound;4 per person in employment&mdash;through retrospective legislation can be justified on the basis of proportionality. Is that modest gain justified by the enormous assault on our civil liberties and human rights represented by this provision? I do not think so, and that is why I hope that the House will support the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1515.0/1">In respect of the date of retrospection, it is not that <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> is a particularly offensive date. It may well have been a lovely day; I do not know, because I was not fortunate enough to be a Member of this House at the time. It might well be reasonable to backdate to that date national insurance contributions that have been avoided by means of &quot;dishonest schemes&quot;&mdash;to use the Paymaster General's words&mdash;although we continue to disagree on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1515.0/2">The implication of the Bill is that we shall set a dangerous new precedent for the way in which the House conducts its business. Would it become a requirement that all financial services professionals should, instead of reading the <i>Financial Times</i> over their cornflakes, thumb through a copy of <i>Hansard</i>, looking for ministerial statements that might affect them two years down the road? Should they believe that whenever the Government express an intention to legislate, they will follow it through? We have had broken promises from this Government before. Should tax advisers warn their clients of the potentially earth-shattering&mdash;or at least profit-affecting&mdash;implications of the Paymaster General's words every time she addresses us with her customary eloquence? No, that would be absurd. We have endured the loss of clarity in our tax system. We must not endure a further erosion of certainty, otherwise we will become prohibitively uncompetitive as a nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1515.0/3">Legislation should be proportionate. It is said that this legislation will affect only the dishonest. It will not. It will have a knock-on effect throughout the financial services industry. Will the Minister at least exclude one knock-on effect by confirming that the use of ministerial statements to signal retrospective taxation will not proliferate into a general principle?</p>

	<p pid="a.1516.7/1">I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman believes me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1516.7/2">The right hon. Gentleman referred to people of modest means. I suspect that his definition of modest means is slightly different from mine. It is right, however, to discuss SIPPs in this context. The Government listened to the considerable representations made on SIPPs and changed their approach in the pre-Budget report. That might appear to be a contradiction to some Members, but I do not think that it is. To me, the underlying theme is that if one has modest means&mdash;I would say that they were considerable means in terms of what is dealt with in this Bill, and in terms of SIPPs and second homes&mdash;getting involved in such tax avoidance measures is dodgy until the law is passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1516.7/3">In the statement that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General made on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, she included a statement of intent that she and the Treasury team wished to be put into United Kingdom legislation. That was not government by fiat. If it were, we would not be here, because we would not have a Bill in front of us. My right hon. Friend would have introduced the changes by fiat from <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>. I would have objected strongly. From what I know of her, there is no way that she would ever wish to govern by fiat. The matter would rightly come before the House, as it has done today. To suggest that this is government by fiat, which brings in all the arguments about the Magna Carta, takes us off track.</p>
	<p pid="a.1516.7/4">I echo what the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire said about amendment No. 6. Were it to be passed, it would make things worse in terms of what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" name="Eric Forth">the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase>, as I understand his view, appears to want to happen. On amendment No. 16, tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch, either he and other Members who keep using the word &quot;principle&quot; have a principle on retrospectivity or they do not. We cannot have half a principle going back to <phrase class="date" code="">11 October</phrase> this year, but not going back to <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>. Either one can envisage that retrospectivity, as I do, going back to a ministerial statement that is yet to be enacted but will be enacted if the Bill is passed, or one cannot. What he said about a convention in relation to Finance Bills seems to undermine his position. Either he has a principle or he does not.</p>

	<p pid="a.1517.0/1">Surely the principle is knowing what the situation is. On <phrase class="date" code="">11 October</phrase>, the Bill was published and anybody could see its content.

	<p pid="a.1517.1/1">That is a helpful intervention, because my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General and I differ from the hon. Gentleman on whether the written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> was opaque. I do not think that it was, and my right hon. Friend has made it very clear to the House that she does not think that it was. I accept that the accountancy body to which the hon. Gentleman has twice referred said that it was not quite clear, but I do not think that it was opaque. I think that it said, &quot;Watch out if you're trying to get involved in some strange tax avoidance scheme. We have clamped down on them in the past and we are going to clamp down in the future.&quot; My right hon. Friend put out a kind of caveat-avoider warning on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1517.1/2">The hon. Member for Christchurch made a point about his amendment No. 19 and the Henry VIII clause. The amendment proposes the removal of new section 4C(3), which the hon. Gentleman said was retrospective. When I intervened on the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst earlier, I quoted subsection (3)(a) to demonstrate that it was not retrospective. I realise that the hon. Gentleman has worries about retrospectivity, but he seems to be interpreting the phrase in brackets in subsection (3)(a) differently from me. There is retrospectivity in the Bill, but I do not think there is any in subsection (3).</p>

	<p pid="a.1518.1/1">The hon. Gentleman and I differ, in that I do not agree that it is retrospective, but I understand his interpretation and I hope that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General will clarify the wording.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.1/2">I take the hon. Gentleman's point about economic well-being, but I think he rather over-egged his case. He referred to a projected Government deficit of &pound;151,000 million over the next five years, and contrasted it with the sum of &pound;95 million. With due respect, he inadvertently did not present a true picture. The &pound;95 million is the projected increase in tax revenue for 2004&ndash;05 as a result of the Bill. According to the regulatory impact assessment, thereafter it will be &pound;240 million a year. In round terms, if the &pound;240 million continued for the whole five years, the total would be more than &pound;1 billion. I appreciate that &pound;1 billion is about two thirds of 1 per cent. of &pound;151 billion, but the comparison is not quite as extreme as the hon. Gentleman suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.1/3">Amendment No. 5 proposes the removal of new section 4B(4) in clause 1. Will my right hon. Friend explain what the subsection means? As I said earlier, I think that if it were removed, the effect would not be what the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst wants, but I may have misunderstood. If I may use the word employed by the hon. Member for Christchurch, the subsection is slightly &quot;opaque&quot;. I hope that my right hon. Friend will explain it, and why she wants it to remain&mdash;as I imagine she does.</p>

Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> in speaking about Adam Smith. It cites passages from the European case &quot;<i>Stichting Goed Wonen&quot;.</i> Paragraph 32 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1519.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The principles of the protection of legitimate expectation and legal certainty form a part of the Community legal order. They must accordingly be observed . . . by Member States&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1519.1/8">And paragraph 33 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1519.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Although in general the principle of legal certainty precludes a Community measure from taking effect from a point in time before its publication, it may exceptionally be otherwise where the purpose to be achieved so demands and where the legitimate expectations of those concerned are duly respected&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1519.1/10">I suspect that the Institute of Chartered Accountants was surprised on reading paragraph 33 and felt that its legitimate expectations had not been respected. The principles of paragraph 32, it probably thought, should apply&mdash;that people should have legitimate expectations and be able to rely on legal certainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1519.1/11">People have asked how that differs from the Rees rules that were set out in the Finance Act 1978, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch referred. It reminds me of further comments from the accountancy profession. I do not want to go into all the Rees rules again, but I would draw attention to the first of the four:</p>
	<p pid="a.1519.1/12" class="indent">&quot;First, the warning must be precise in form. A mere suggestion that there are vague schemes of tax avoidance that must be countered should not suffice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1519.1/13">It is the generalised nature of the Paymaster General's statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, which leads people to ask whether the first Rees rule principle has been met. The Paymaster General was explicit in saying earlier that it had been met, but others feel that it has not. That poses the question of how people should have reacted to that statement. Is it perhaps more appropriate to start the period of retrospection from <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-11">11 October 2005</phrase>, when the Bill was published, and to thereby present clearly to advisers, professionals and others interested in tax matters the nature of the Government's concerns? That is the issue that we have been debating through this group of amendments and it is important to the principle of retrospection. People are looking for clarity and certainty, which the Paymaster General's statement of December 2004 perhaps did not possess in the eyes of some. I would welcome her comments on that and on other aspects of retrospection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1519.1/14">Through amendment No. 18, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1954" name="Greg Knight">my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)</phrase> seeks to amend just one line in clause 1, but leaves untouched other payments that are themselves linked to national insurance contributions. If his amendment is accepted, another one should be tabled and accepted to bring all contributions and payments into line with each other, instead of singling out statutory payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1519.1/15">Given that there is another group of amendments that we want to discuss later, I will conclude my remarks and look to the Paymaster General to be much clearer about the issue of retrospection and how it fits in with the Rees rules set out in the Finance Act 1978.</p>

	<p pid="a.1520.0/1">Conservative Members quote the Rees rules but I am not sure that they understand exactly how they are implemented. I remind them that HMRC issued a detailed technical note on the day of the pre-Budget report that made it clear that contrived and complex avoidance schemes were being closed down. Draft legislation was issued shortly afterward and comments on the technical detail were invited. The reference in the regulatory impact assessment to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> drew attention relates to the disclosure rules, not to the retrospective aspect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.0/2">Given that we are dealing with inconsistencies, I should point out that one minute Conservative Members claim that nobody understood the meaning of the statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, yet the next they pray in aid accountants' and accountancy firms' explanations&mdash;given in December 2004&mdash;of their understanding of the statement's meaning. Let me give Conservative Members three helpful quotations from the people at PricewaterhouseCoopers, as provided by John Whiting. The first states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.0/3" class="indent">&quot;we recognise the problem that the Government is trying to tackle by taking this unusual power.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.0/4">So the people at PricewaterhouseCoopers know what we are dealing with. They continue by saying that they</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.0/5" class="indent">&quot;congratulate those responsible for . . . this Bill&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.0/6">and for</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the package of explanatory notes and frequently asked questions that accompany it and (seemingly) the potential for proper time to debate it&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.0/8">on the Floor of the House and in Committee. The third quote is probably the most important:</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.0/9" class="indent">&quot;the first use of powers in this area will be to bring in NIC regulations to parallel the charges imposed by Schedule 2 F(2)A 2005 in the employee securities area. There can be no objection to this&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.0/10">So the idea that people do not understand the very precise way in which the Government are approaching this issue&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-15a.1521.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="1521"  time="16:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051215/debtext/51215-30.htm#51215-30_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1521.1/1">No, I will not, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind. He has not been here for all of this very long debate, and in the few remaining moments I want to reply to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" name="Eric Forth">the amendments of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1521.1/2">So the idea that people could not comprehend this measure or that they did not have sufficient details from the Government is a misunderstanding on the part of Conservative Members. The confusion, moreover, is perpetuated in the amendments, which seek to do lots of different things and contradict&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, I suppose that it is a case of betting both ends against the middle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1521.1/3">Amendment No. 5 would have the effect that regulations made under the provisions in the Bill could apply only to tax measures made after the Bill had been passed. Clearly, that would undermine the deterrent effect of the statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, and put at risk national insurance yield of &pound;95 million in 2004&ndash;05. I disagree with the hon. Member for Christchurch, as I do not think that that is an insubstantial sum. It could also put at risk all the 2005&ndash;06 yield of &pound;240 million, as the end-of-year bonus season could escape liability for national insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1521.1/4">Amendment No. 5 would also produce an anomalous result between tax and national insurance. The Opposition spoke about human rights challenges, but the amendment would mean that people using an avoidance scheme that gets caught by any of the tax provisions having effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> would have to pay back their income tax liabilities, but not their national insurance liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1521.1/5">Amendments Nos. 6 and 20 would increase uncertainty. Ironically, or perhaps deliberately, they would contradict amendments Nos. 5 and 16. They would remove proposed new section 4B(5), which specifies that regulations cannot have effect before <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>. The amendment would therefore extend the scope of retrospection, and mean that there would be no limit on how far back Ministers or regulations could go. I am sure that Opposition Members would not want that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1521.1/6">Amendment No. 16, like amendment No. 5, would undermine the deterrent effect of the <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> statement. As I described earlier, it would put at risk substantial amounts of revenue, as bonuses paid through the contrived schemes could escape the national insurance liability if the operative date for the regulations were <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-11">11 October 2005</phrase>. That would produce another anomalous result: tax would be collected through a scheme whose purpose was considered to be avoidance, but the national insurance liability under the same scheme would not be collected. Frankly, that would be an unreasonable&mdash;to put it politely&mdash;use of legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1521.1/7">Amendment No. 19 would restrict the scope of regulations that may be made for modifying any provision of any enactment for the purposes specified in proposed new section 4C(2). That would mean that the regulations could not amend primary legislation, so that where such legislation deals with matters in 4C(2)&mdash;such as contributions, contributory benefits and pension scheme matters&mdash;it could not be amended, even where not to amend it would be to the detriment of employees. The current arrangement is to allow such amendments where that is fair to employees and ensures that they receive their entitlement as a result of a change of national insurance liability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1521.1/8">Amendment No. 9 is unnecessary, and frankly unwise. It would omit proposed new section 4C(5)(g), which enables regulations to be laid that will redetermine matters to the benefit of contributors. Without that provision, it is possible that increased entitlements that arise from retrospective legislation will be denied by virtue of a previous determination. That is, when people are deemed to be required to pay national insurance, that will affect their entitlement to contributory benefits. The amendment would prevent increased benefit entitlement being assigned to those individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1521.1/9">I shall deal briefly with amendment No. 18, which addresses the Bill's impact on the provision of statutory payments, such as maternity, paternity, adoption and sick pay. Retrospective regulations made under the powers in the Bill could have an effect on entitlement to those statutory payments. Eligibility for statutory payments is based in part on the employee's average weekly earnings assessed over a specified calculation period. As a result of an avoidance scheme an employee may therefore receive less than they may have been entitled to if they had paid the correct amount instead of the lower amount. The amendment would prevent the employee from receiving that additional payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1521.1/10">I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1954" name="Greg Knight">the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)</phrase> thought that the Bill prevented the restoration of those statutory payments, whereas it is the amendment that does the damage. The Bill provides for that to happen. Therefore I urge hon. Members to reject amendments Nos. 5, 6, 16, 19, 20 and 9. They undermine the deterrent effect of the <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> statement, increase uncertainty for employers, are detrimental to employees and will put at risk a substantial amount of national insurance money that is due to the national insurance fund. If the amendment is put to the vote, I urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1525.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. I would like to know whether the Minister thinks that proposed new section 132A(6) to the Social Security Administration Act 1992 would cover accountants. The provision includes a reference to &quot;legal professional privilege&quot;, but having never practised as an accountant, I do not know whether accountants would fall under that definition or be covered by the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.1/2">There is an overwhelming case for allowing anyone who gives confidential advice to ensure that that advice and the papers associated with it remain confidential, even if that person is not legally qualified. Some years ago I employed a young girl called Jane Oakes. She wanted to be a solicitor, but during her employment with me and while she was taking her studies, she was not legally qualified. However, she was an expert on certain areas of law. Information such as that which she obtained when advising a client on her area of expertise, even though she was not legally qualified at the time, should be protected under the Bill and the general provisions on client-lawyer confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.1/3">Legal privilege can provide a defence for a professional legal adviser to a charge of failing to report suspicions of money laundering, but that applies only if the information is received in privileged circumstances and is not communicated to the lawyer with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose. However&mdash;this might answer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase>&mdash;there is no specific provision in money laundering legislation or the Bill to provide the same protection to accountants. I do not think that accountants generally have the same protection as lawyers when they give advice, although a legally qualified person who advises his employer can claim the defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.1/4">I understand that, so far as money laundering is concerned, at the time the initial guidance was issued, discussions were under way between Ministers and interested parties about how legal privilege could be interpreted. Will the Minister, when she speaks on Third Reading, tell us whether she has had any discussions on the scope of privilege? It is a crucial point for many of us who will have to decide, during the Third Reading debate, whether we want to support the Bill or divide the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.1/5" class="italic">It being Five o'clock, Mr. Deputy Speaker, pursuant to Order [<phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>], brought proceedings on consideration of the Bill to a conclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1526.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">We have reached the final stage of the House's deliberations on the Bill and I would like to reiterate to the House the purpose of the Bill. It demonstrates the Government's continuing commitment to take action against tax and national insurance avoidance on rewards of employment and to close down avoidance in that area for good. The Bill is key to achieving the Treasury and Government's objectives of fairness and opportunity by ensuring that all pay the correct amount of tax and national insurance that the House has already decided. It is an essential element in building a serious and credible deterrent against future avoidance activity and it is needed to secure total tax and national insurance yields of &pound;200 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;500 million per annum thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/3">As the income tax disclosure provisions have demonstrated, it is not possible to anticipate the range and complexity of the extremely contrived avoidance arrangements that the Bill seeks to address. The powers in the Bill will enable the Government to deal effectively with any tax and national insurance avoidance arrangements that emerge in future that are designed to frustrate its intention that employers and employees should pay the proper amount of national insurance on the rewards of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/4">I thank Members who participated in debate on the Floor of the House and in Committee. The debate has entailed a thorough scrutiny of the purpose and details of the Bill, although at times, in some contributions, its objectives got a little lost. That scrutiny included details that are to be set out in regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> said on Second Reading that</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/6" class="indent">&quot;in terms of general principles, I broadly endorse what the Government are trying to achieve through the Bill. My colleagues and I voted for higher national insurance contributions to fund the health service, so it follows that we want such revenue to be realised&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase>; Vol. 438, c. 483.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/7">Unfortunately, that does not follow at all because in Standing Committee the hon. Gentleman's colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase>, voted with Opposition Members on an amendment that would have removed the deterrent effect of the Bill. He accused the Government, and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/8" class="indent">&quot;We are doing some violence to an underlying principle&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/9">a principle that the hon. Member for Twickenham agreed with. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The amount of tax revenue at issue should be very great to justify our doing that violence.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-15">15 November 2005</phrase>; c. 9.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/11">I do not agree with the choice of words of the hon. Member for Eastleigh, and I am not sure what the Liberal Democrats now count as a substantial amount of revenue, but I think that &pound;200 million, rising to &pound;500 million, comes into that category. The arguments put forward have been supported by the hon. Member for Twickenham, and it would be good if he ensured some consistency from his party.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/12">Over many years, we have seen a minority of employers&mdash;it is only a minority, but they happen to be very wealthy&mdash;using highly sophisticated tax advice to sidestep the intention of anti-avoidance legislation passed by this House, ranging from 1998 up to the Finance Act 2005. Despite legislation effective from the date of announcement, they have managed to continue to avoid paying the amount of tax and national insurance that is properly due. They do so because new contrived schemes can be devised quickly and used when legislation closing existing schemes is announced. With that approach, the revenue remains very much at risk, even in the short term unfortunately, because employers still have scope to adopt another scheme and get away with avoidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/13">The Government's intention is to shut down such activity permanently. To do so, we have to undermine fundamentally the incentives for employers repeatedly to seek out new contrived schemes contrary to the intention of Parliament. The Bill is intended to deter future avoidance by providing a power to backdate a national insurance liability to <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> if necessary. With such backdating, there is little point in employers and their advisers looking for a new loophole because the national insurance will still become due. The Government hope that we will not need to legislate because employers will finally get the message.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/14">Any amendment that had the effect of removing our ability to make regulations imposing a backdated national insurance charge to a date before the announcement would remove the deterrent effect of the Bill and put all the revenue captured by those arrangements at risk. We have discussed that repeatedly, on Second Reading, in Committee and today, and I have repeatedly reassured Members that there are numerous examples of contrived schemes that the Government have had to deal with since 1997 and that the previous Government also had to tackle. They include contrived schemes involving employee benefit trusts, soft currency loans, such as those denominated in Turkish lira, adjustable options and special purpose vehicles. That will continue unless the Government take action.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/15">The power to make regulations altering liability is restricted to reflecting, as far as possible, employment remuneration measures in tax legislation&mdash;normally Finance Acts&mdash;that have been backdated. The provisions would already have been discussed during a Finance Bill, before national insurance triggers action, and would be only to reflect anti-avoidance measures. Where such regulations are made, the House will already have had the chance to consider any relevant human rights issues on backdated tax legislation during the passage of the relevant Finance Bill or other legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/16">In addition, the Government will publish the draft national insurance regulations a minimum of 12 weeks before they are made, so that employers and their representatives have every opportunity to comment on the content of any proposed national insurance charge. Where possible, backdated draft regulations will be published no later than when the corresponding tax provisions are discussed in the Standing Committee of the Finance Bill. Both will be available at the same time, so that Members can see how they fit together. Furthermore, to ensure that there is adequate parliamentary scrutiny when regulations are made that create a backdated national insurance liability, such regulations will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/17">I am pleased to be able to conclude that the Bill has had thorough scrutiny in the House. I have listened carefully to the constructive contributions from Members of all the parties involved in the discussions and I thank them for their participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.0/18">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-15a.1528.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" speakername="Mark Hoban" colnum="1528"  time="17:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051215/debtext/51215-32.htm#51215-32_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1528.0/1">At <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the outset, may I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> for his role in scrutinising the Bill in Committee? It was not an onerous Committee, but he and my hon. Friends made great progress in asking detailed questions of the Paymaster General. I am therefore grateful for his work on the Bill. As the Paymaster General said on Report, this is my first opportunity to speak on tax matters as a Front-Bench spokesman. I am a chartered accountant, albeit a non-practising one&mdash;I except, of course, my annual struggle with my tax return&mdash;and I look forward to engaging in constructive debate on tax with the Treasury. I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> is a chartered accountant, and he, too, will wish to make a contribution to our debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/2">For the benefit of Members who are new to the Bill, including my right hon. and hon. Friends who participated in our debates on Report, may I reflect why the Bill is needed? The Paymaster General referred to avoidance issues, but a separate Bill on national insurance is a needed because of the way in which national insurance and other taxes are administered. The Bill makes additional provisions to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. Before 1999, national insurance contributions were managed by the Department of Social Security. Since then, they have been managed by the Treasury. Until national insurance was brought within the Treasury's remit, the national insurance and the income tax systems were often out of sync, and it took some time for national insurance to catch up with changes in income tax. Indeed, at one point, the Treasury and the DSS announced wildly differing approaches to the taxation of share options within weeks of each other. At least the Bill tries to manage those processes and bring them together.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/3">The Bill has two principal objectives&mdash;first, to apply disclosure arrangements in the Finance Act 2004 for taxes other than national insurance to national insurance itself, and, secondly, to create the opportunity to levy retrospectively additional or new national insurance charges in cases in which the Government believe that schemes have been contrived to avoid national insurance. As the explanatory notes acknowledge, that is a first for national insurance:</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Existing NICs legislation does not allow regulations to be made which can take effect that far back.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/5">That captures the flavour of our earlier debate on retrospection. I wish to highlight three issues that have been raised in debates on the Bill: retrospection; the breadth of the Bill and the problems that that has caused; and the delay between the introduction of primary and secondary legislation, and the comments that the Paymaster General made about the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/6">On retrospection, we have debated the Paymaster General's statement in December 2004 and the issues that arise from it. There are concerns about retrospection, but I do not want to reopen the wounds that were exposed on Report. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, in a letter from the tax faculty to the Paymaster General in February this year, highlighted three issues, including, first, the test of certainty and the fact that taxpayers should be aware of how much tax they pay. They are entitled to expect that they will be taxed in accordance with the law in force at the time of the relevant transaction. Retrospection undermines those expectations of certainty. Secondly, the institute considered the legal basis of retrospection and the way in which it sits in the wider context of EU and human rights law. Looking at emerging EU case law, it said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the state cannot retrospectively remove a right without a transitional period&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/8">The Bill does not, as far as I am aware, provide a transitional period for the removal of a right. The test of the Bill, therefore, may not be in the House but in the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/9">The third issue raised was the potential of retrospective legislation to undermine the credibility of the UK tax system in the eyes of UK taxpayers. The Institute of Chartered Accountants rightly observes that by and large the UK tax system has a high degree of credibility, the tax rules are obeyed, and taxpayer compliance and honesty are good. If we introduce increased uncertainty into the tax system by greater use of retrospection, the predictability and certainty that is such a feature of the UK tax regime will start to diminish, perhaps leading to concern on the part of international employers. If they come to the UK and site operations here, will they find the tax regime changing without prior warning? We need to bear in mind those three aspects when we consider retrospection and its impact on the overall tax environment in which we work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/10">A further concern about retrospection is its impact on the law-making process. If retrospection on a wide scale becomes institutionalised, will law making become lax? If the Revenue thinks that it can have a second bite at the cherry by using retrospection to correct mistakes that it has made in drafting legislation, will that create an environment in which the Revenue takes less care in drafting the original legislation? I am sure the Treasury and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs will not see retrospection as a way of taking a more relaxed approach to drafting legislation. On the whole they are diligent in drafting legislation and we want that to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/11">We discussed today the breadth of powers in the Bill. I remarked earlier that tax advisers were surprised at the content of the Bill and the breadth of the measure. In its report on the 2004 pre-Budget report the Treasury Committee, commenting on the Paymaster General's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The indication in this statement that the Government will continue to announce proposed legislation, effective from the day of the announcement, to stop schemes which come to their attention is nothing new.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/13">Indeed, we touched upon the Rees rules, which relate to that. The Treasury Committee went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/14" class="indent">&quot;What is new is the declaration that future schemes, not yet devised or which have not yet come to the Inland Revenue's attention, may be stopped as from <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>. This amounts to a general anti-avoidance rule in this area of taxation of income and rewards, although no new powers are being taken by government.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/15">So, in the Committee's view, the very thing that the Government had backed away from&mdash;introducing their disclosure rules in the Finance Act 2004&mdash;because of criticism from the tax law review committee at the Institute for Fiscal Studies and comments from the Chartered Institute of Taxation, they seemed to have backed towards. We need to look again at how the legislation works.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/16">The Paymaster General spoke of the importance of making sure that the proper or right amount of tax is paid. In seeking to extract that, how do the Government distinguish between planning, mitigation and avoidance? There is a spectrum. If people are following the law, at what point do the Government intervene to tackle avoidance issues? We will need to consider that. The Paymaster General referred to the process for scrutinising secondary legislation, and that may give us the opportunity to do so in Committee when those statutory instruments are laid. Taxpayers have a right to expect that the tax law on the day on which they undertake a transaction will continue to apply to that transaction going forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/17">The third and final issue that I shall comment on is the delay between primary and secondary legislation. Primary legislation tackles the PAYE and income tax aspects of a contrived scheme. Under the Bill the consequent national insurance secondary legislation can come forward so that amendments made to income tax legislation to close down avoidance schemes can be used in national insurance legislation to close down similar loopholes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-15a.1535.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1903" speakername="Denis Murphy" colnum="1535"  time="17:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051215/debtext/51215-34.htm#51215-34_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1535.2/1">I thank the House for allowing me the debate. I welcome the current consultations on nutrition and hydration in schools. Like many others, I was shocked by some of the ingredients that are used to feed our children through school dinners and the amount of junk food and drink available during the school day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.2/2">I understand and applaud the need to examine closely the drinks and snacks that are available throughout the school day from tuck shops and vending machines, and to ensure where possible that those drinks and snacks are healthy and beneficial. However, I have some serious concerns about the recommendations of the school meals review panel on the drinks that should be allowed in schools and their impact on a company based in my constituency&mdash;Waters and Robsons of Morpeth, Northumberland, manufacturers of Abbey Well natural mineral waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.2/3">The school meals review panel recommendations on drinks are that</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The only drinks available should be water (still or fizzy) skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, pure fruit juices, yoghurt and milk drinks with less than 10 per cent. added sugar or a combination of these (for example smoothies). There should be easy access to free, fresh, chilled drinking water&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.2/5">Waters and Robsons have worked closely with local education authorities to produce a low-calorie drink that has natural flavours, contains no artificial flavours or colours and also contains no sugar. It is sweetened with sucralose, a natural sugar alternative, which has fewer than 5 calories per 250 ml serving.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.2/6">The company has also developed a new bottle to replace canned soft drinks in vending machines, and it is on the approved list of suppliers to schools in 60 local authority areas. That will change if the recommendations are accepted and those excellent drinks are banned from schools. How could a perfectly healthy low-calorie product, approved by the Food Standards Agency, find itself on a blacklist when it should be hydrating children and playing an important role in the fight against obesity?</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.2/7">In October, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced at the Labour party conference that her Department was launching a new initiative to make school meals available and to ensure that they would be much more healthy. The initiative will have the support of the vast majority of parents and teachers, but to achieve that goal, low-calorie drinks need to be added to the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.2/8">The consultation document, &quot;Turning the Tables&quot;, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="">3 October</phrase>, dealt only with school meals but strongly advised that the policy be rolled out for other types of food and drink available throughout the school day. I am worried that the report was rushed out to meet the conference deadline, and was not seen by a number of members of the panel before publication. I cannot believe that all members of the panel agreed that intense sweeteners, which are being promoted by the Food Standards Agency as a healthy choice, are all bad for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.2/9">The only drink allowed for the purposes of hydration is plain water. While I applaud the promotion of water, I suspect that many children would prefer an alternative. If the only choice is between plain water, full fruit juice, milk or sugar-sweetened dairy drinks, the calories will pile on and children will still feel thirsty.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-15a.1536.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-15b.1536.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-12-15a.1536.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1903" speakername="Denis Murphy" colnum="1536"  time="17:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051215/debtext/51215-34.htm#51215-34_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1536.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that excellent point. I shall refer to that matter later.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/2">I am convinced that a small group of agencies is actively promoting the idea that intense sweeteners are unhealthy, even though there is no evidence to support that. In fact, the opposite would appear to be the case, as the Food Standards Agency is actively promoting them as a healthy option.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/3">The Health Education Trust was represented on the school meals review panel by its chief executive, who I suspect is the main opponent of the use of intense sweeteners. I understand from discussions with Waters and Robson that the HET offers its services to food and drinks producers as a consultant, giving advice on food and drinks that it feels able to endorse as suitable for schools, at a cost of &pound;500 a day, along with &pound;100 per brand endorsement. It also runs a healthy vending project, in which an operator must pay &pound;500 to display the HET endorsement logo, and 5p commission on every vend through the machine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/4">Interestingly, the HET endorses Volvic Touch of Fruits, which is produced by a French company and contains 11 teaspoons of sugar per litre. By any standards, that is a lot of sugar. Yet the HET told Abbey Well Foods that it would not endorse its product even if it were to reformulate it to a similar profile. When Abbey Well asked to meet the HET in order to try to understand its position, it was informed that it would have to pay the normal consultation fee prior to any such meeting. Will my hon. Friend the Minister examine the make-up of the HET to determine whether there are genuine conflicts of interest among members of the committee?</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/5">In order to address some of the problems, the British Soft Drinks Association met the Department for Education and Skills on <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase>. I understand that little progress was made there. The DFES was unable to answer any questions relating to why intense sweeteners were excluded from the proposals, but suggested that it might be because they helped children to develop a sweet tooth. However, they were unable to supply any evidence to support that view, other than anecdotal evidence. The DFES was unable to respond, even when it was explained that the amount of sweeteners could be adjusted to meet any desired level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/6">The DFES confirmed that a new panel, the school food trust, had been set up to examine rolling out the recommendations to include all food and drink in schools, including snacks and the contents of vending machines. I understand that those members of the school meals review panel who were available would be invited to sit on that panel. There are no prizes, therefore, for guessing what their recommendations might be. They are due to report in January after a six-week period, and the main role of gathering the evidence has been allocated to a director of the Compass catering group. Compass has a potentially significant financial stake in the supply of food and drinks products to schools. Perhaps it is not therefore the best choice for the role.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/7">The current proposals appear to rule out all carbonates and still and juice drinks, regardless of calorie or juice content. Many drinks classified as &quot;healthy choice&quot; by the Food Standards Agency in relation to advertising to children would also be banned. Rising concerns about calorie intake and obesity have moved the soft drinks industry into developing products to meet the demand for drinks that have less or no sugar but that continue to provide tasty refreshment and hydration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/8">Consumers of all ages have responded with great enthusiasm to low-calorie drinks. Consumption of regular sweetened drinks fell from 96 litres per head in 1984 to 84 litres per head in 2004. Over the same period, low-calorie drink and bottled water consumption rose from 10 litres per head to 147 litres per head. In 2004, the share of the soft drink market held by regular sweetened drinks was 27 per cent., while low-calorie drinks had 49 per cent., bottled water had 15 per cent., and fruit juices had 9 per cent. There is a danger, therefore, that if a choice of healthy, tasty, low-calorie products is not allowed in schools, children will vote with their feet and seek potentially unhealthy products from outside school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/9">In the main report, &quot;Turning the Tables: Transforming School Food&quot;, section 10 of the recommendations states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/10" class="indent">&quot;We believe our recommendations will lead to the consumption of healthier combinations of lunchtime foods by primary and secondary school children. This improved quality will clearly mean some increased costs but those costs should be set against the health and other benefits. Redressing the imbalance in children's diets will contribute towards a reduction of obesity and diseases such as tooth decay in young people. In the longer term the changes we recommend now should reduce the chances of young people suffering from various chronic diseases in later life. But more than that new standards can set the scene for holistic changes in the way young people perceive food and health, and can pave the way for wider changes in our food culture.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/11">I support that statement in its entirety. I am not advocating allowing high-fat, high-sugar or high-salt products. Unless we allow a wider range of healthy foods, snacks and drinks, however, more children will be tempted to buy and consume their food and drink outside school. The regulatory impact assessment released with the report recognises that children might react negatively to the proposed changes, resulting, in its own words, in the consumption of unhealthy foods outside school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/12">I started my speech by applauding the efforts of the Department and I shall conclude in the same way. The initiative is excellent. It is flawed, however, in not allowing a wider range of healthy options to be available throughout the school day. There is nothing wrong with tuck shops and vending machines in schools, provided that the school sets the standards for the products available. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> mentioned, for many schools it is a useful form of extra income. Sixteen per cent. of two to 15-year-olds in the United Kingdom are obese, and the figure is much higher in some areas. To help fight that rising problem, low-calorie products from an approved list should be allowed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/13">Will my hon. Friend address the following questions? Will he allow a member of the Food Standards Agency to become a member of the advisory committee? How will he ensure that there is no conflict of interest for anyone sitting on the advisory committee? Will he make public the evidence used by the advisory committee for rejecting any ingredient? I realise, of course, that there are a number of genuine fears about the use of some artificial sweeteners, and it could be an ideal time, when we are considering food and drink in schools, to widen the debate on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/14">However, the drinks that are currently supplied to 60 local education authorities and manufactured in my constituency are those with which I am concerned today. Abbey Well drinks contain no artificial colours or flavours, are made with natural mineral water and are sweetened with sucralose, which has the same profile as sugar but with only five calories per serving. The average consumption of between 40 and 120 cases a week in each secondary school that the company supplies demonstrates that such products are both popular and beneficial, and I urge my hon. Friend to ensure that they continue to be consumed in schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.1539.5/1">The established industry is beginning to make serious representations about the contribution that it could play, and we welcome them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1539.5/2">The problems of diet, health and obesity among children have been recognised, and there is now a real will in Government to make improvements. More nutritious school food could help to reduce the risk of diet-related health problems such as obesity, but also of cancer, coronary heart disease and diabetes in later life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1539.5/3">For some time, the Government have been committed to promoting whole school approaches to health. School meal standards were reintroduced in April 2001. The first standards, incidentally, were in place for more than 20 years and it was promised then that they would be reviewed after a time. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has made clear, that time has now come. The House will also be aware that in March this year, the Secretary of State announced a package of measures designed to improve significantly the quality of school food and committed &pound;235 million of funding to help achieve it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1539.5/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck mentioned the school meals review panel&mdash;an expert group that was convened by the Department as a temporary advisory group. The panel comprises 24 members from a variety of professional backgrounds, including field and academic dieticians and nutritionists, head teachers, governors and other school staff, support staff, catering and industry professionals. The Department also invited observers from other Departments that had a contribution to make to the panel's proceedings to attend its meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1539.5/5">The panel's remit was to advise the Government on how best to meet their commitments in the public health White Paper, which set out to improve school food through the revision of school meals standards aimed at delivering a reduction in pupils' consumption of fat, salt and sugar and an increase in the consumption of fruit, vegetables and other foods containing essential nutrients. Anyone living with young children or who has had them in the past will be aware of the scale of the challenge to get them to eat healthily and nutritiously.</p>
	<p pid="a.1539.5/6">As my hon. Friend mentioned, the panel's report was entitled, &quot;Turning the Tables: Transforming School Food&quot;. He quoted quite extensively from it and I welcome the clear support that he gave to its principal approach and findings when it was published. As I said earlier, it remains subject to consultation that runs to <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>. The report recommends far-reaching changes to the standard of food and drink in schools. It recommends that tough minimum food-based standards should be implemented for school lunches by September 2006, stipulating the portions of food that should be served, and, importantly, restricting children's choices to ensure that they cannot opt out of healthier food.</p>
	<p pid="a.1539.5/7">Anyone concerned about those issues would recognise that such measures will work best when children receive consistent messages about food from schools. Most would accept that there is no point in setting strict standards for lunchtime food, if children can then access foods that have a low nutritional value or are high in sugar and salt elsewhere on the school premises at other times during the school day. To that end, the panel also recommends that standards similar to those for school lunches should also apply to tuck shops, vending machines and other outlets.</p>

	<p pid="a.1540.1/1">My hon. Friend did indeed make those points clear in his contribution. What I am trying to set out clearly now are the panel's recommendations. To be clear, the consultation is not on the settled policy of the Government that will result from the process, but on the recommendations of the panel. Views have been invited and this evening's debate provides another valuable contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1540.1/2">The school food trust, a non-departmental public body, is being set up. It will give independent support to schools and parents to help make the transformation to healthier school food. It will also undertake the work necessary to develop standards for other school food.</p>
	<p pid="a.1540.1/3">The school meals review panel wants children to drink water&mdash;and only water&mdash;or drinks with a nutritional value. Its view is that substituting any other drink for a healthy drink is a wasted opportunity. In &quot;Vending healthy drinks: A guide for schools&quot;, the Food Standards Agency recommends replacing carbonated drinks with a simple healthy offer of water, milk or juice. It has also developed a nutrient profiling model that identifies food types and allocates points, depending on the level of each nutrient per 100 g of food. Products are then categorised on the basis of their overall points score. However, the model has been developed for use in relation to advertising controls only, as part of the Government's programme to regulate broadcast advertising to children of foods that are high in fat, saturated fat, salt and sugar. Food and drink that the model might categorise as &quot;healthy&quot; may not necessarily meet the more stringent standards recommended by the school meals review panel&mdash;a point about which my hon. Friend may be concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1540.1/4">There has been some concern and confusion among schools, local authorities and other stakeholders about the Health Education Trust's relationship with the Government. My hon. Friend touched on several matters relating to the HET, which is a charity formed to promote the development of health education of young people in the UK. The HET's director was a member of the school meals review panel and actively contributed to the proposed new standards on which we are consulting. The HET is independent of the Government and as such, the Government rightly have no direct control over its activities. I understand, however, that officials have been in touch with the HET to ensure that its advice is based on Government recommendations and standards currently reflected in published Government toolkits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1540.1/5">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has already indicated that she is prepared to take tough decisions on which food and drinks will no longer be provided on school premises, where there is a case for taking such decisions. However, matters of detail such as the inclusion or exclusion of a particular diet&mdash;for example, those sweetened with artificial sweeteners&mdash;or of carbonated drinks will need to be dealt with once the consultation has finished. The products produced by the company in my hon. Friend's constituency fall into that category. I underline the general point that I made at the outset: no decisions have yet been taken and the purpose of the consultation is to bottom-out some of the more detailed issues. My hon. Friend has made a timely contribution to this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1540.1/6">I can assure my hon. Friend that decisions will be made only after the responses to the consultation have been properly collated and analysed, and only after obtaining further expert advice from the school food trust and the FSA. I hope that he will draw some reassurance from the answers that I have given, and that they will prove useful to him in his continuing discussions with the company in his constituency. If there are further points that he or the company wish to make, I know that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be only too pleased to receive them.</p>
