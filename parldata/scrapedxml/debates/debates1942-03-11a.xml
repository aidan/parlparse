<p>After the German occupation of Denmark, Count Reventlow was regarded as charged informally with the protection of certain Danish interests not under enemy control. In December last, Count Reventlow issued a communiqu&#x00E9; to the Press to the effect that he had informed the Danish Ministry for Foreign Affairs that, as a consequence of the Danish adherence to the Anti-Comintern Pact, he could no longer in his existing relations with the Danish Government, worthily and effectively carry out his official duties as Danish Envoy. Count Reventlow has now assumed the Honorary Presidency of the Association of Free Danes in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government have decided to recognise Count Reventlow as continuing to be responsible for the protection of such Danish interests as are not under enemy control.</p>

<p>Would the right hon.

<p>There is already in existence in the Royal Air Force a procedure for ensuring that the capabilities of officers, whatever their age or rank, are kept under constant review. Reports are rendered on them either annually or specially as circumstances may require and those whose services are not satisfactory are placed on the retired list or called upon to relinquish their commissions. There have, in fact, been a number of retirements and resignations of officers of all ranks from the highest to the lowest, and accordingly, I see no need for a special review of the kind suggested. The compulsory retiring ages of regular


officers in the various branches of the Service are set out in detail in King's Regulations and Air Council Instructions. Regular officers reaching their retiring ages during the war may be retained on the active list at the discretion of the Air Council.</p>

<p>I am aware that damage has been done, in Ealing and elsewhere, and that in some cases this has been due to careless or unskilled workmanship.

I regret that the burning off of railings is not practicable as a general rule, as the available supplies of gas and acetylene burners are urgently needed for war work of great importance. Various bases of contracting have been considered, but I am satisfied that the alternative of

<p>During the expansion of the building programme the Ministry avoided large increases in staff by utilising to a considerable extent the services, on a commission basis, of firms in private practice. Up to the present time there has been no such diminution of work falling upon the staff of the Ministry as would warrant a reduction in that staff, but the question of staff in relation to work is under continuous review. The total staff of the Ministry on 1st January, 1942, was 12,720, as compared with 8,670 a year ago. I regret that it is not possible readily to give separate figures for the staff employed solely in connection with the build-

ing programme. The increase indicated is due almost entirely to the large expansion of existing services in connection with the construction, provision and maintenance of buildings and supplies required by civil Departments generally, as well as the large extension of the activities of the Ministry in connection with such matters as control of civil building, registration of builders, recovery of salvage, etc. I should add that, while it is the case that the amount of new work undertaken by the Ministry is beginning rapidly to diminish, it will be some time before this diminution is reflected in the amount of work actually in process.</p>

<p>It continues to be the policy to introduce representative institutions in West Africa as the local populations become ready for them.

In all the West African Dependencies the Legislative Councils contain African members nominated to represent the local communities, while in Nigeria, the Gold Coast and Sierra Leone, there are also African elected members.

<p>Perhaps the hon. Member will read my reply and put down any further Question.<br/>
<i>Following is the reply:</i><br/>
The detailed survey made by the Sierra Leone Government, to which reference was made by me in my reply to my hon. Friend's previous Question on the 25th February, was confined to Freetown where it was known that the rise in the cost of living had been exceptionally high. The survey was limited to households whose heads earned less than &#x00A3;3 a month. As stated by me, the Governor has explained that the figure of 75 per cent. rise estimated by the Committee which conducted the survey must be accepted with reserve, owing to the difficulties experienced in securing reliable information from the households from whom information was sought. The difficulties included suspicion of the objects of the investigation, and the tendency of persons who were approached on the one hand to exaggerate their expenditure, and on the other hand not always to disclose full particulars of their income. In this connection I may mention that a profitable source of income at the present time is petty trading, which, on account of the great increase in the prices of native produce, has become a very remunerative sideline in Freetown. The Committee found it very difficult to assess this item. The report concludes by saying that although the increase in the cost of living in Freetown has been extremely marked, the earnings of the average household have increased considerably at the same time, although it is not possible to obtain sufficiently accurate data to determine how large these increases are.<br/>
The survey was made in February, 1941, at which time the lowest paid class of Government workers was in receipt of wages of 1s. per day. The Government, after careful consideration of the report, reached the conclusion that a fair bonus would be one at the rate of 5d. per day for such labour. In May, 1941, the basic wage rate for such labourers was raised from 1s. to 1s. 2d. per, day, and the cost of living bonus which was authorised in November, 1941, was consequently fixed on the basis of 3d. instead of 5d. per day. The bonus takes the form of an issue of food to that value or cash in lieu. Other labourers up to and including those earning 5s. 11d. per day receive bonuses ranging between 5d. and 1d. per day.<br/>
The answer to the second part of the Question is in the affirmative. With re-

gard to the third part, the reply I gave on 25th February indicates the nature and scope of the measures taken and shows that all the West African Governments are fully alive to the necessity for ensuring that hardship arising out of the increased cost of living shall so far as possible be minimised. The position regarding the number of wage earners in West Africa has substantially altered during the war, and reliable statistics of the present number of wage earners are not available.</p>

<p>The "Struma" was a converted yacht of about 200 tons. Flying the Panamanian flag, she left Con-stanza last October with some 769 Jews on board with the intention of effecting their entry illegally into Palestine. She reached Istanbul about mid-December, when she was described as being badly overcrowded, and thereafter considerable repairs to her engines had to be effected. While she was lying at Istanbul, the Turkish authorities intimated that the passengers could not be allowed to remain in Turkey. The Palestine Government also made it clear, with the support of His Majesty's Government, that they could not be admitted to Palestine. This action was in conformity with the policy consistently followed since the establishment of the mandatory r&#x00E9;gime and publicly confirmed by His Majesty's Government in November, 1940.<br/>
When the Turkish authorities found that the passengers would not be admitted to Palestine, they decided on 23rd February to send the vessel back to the Black Sea. On 24th February news was received that she had sunk as a result of an explosion four or five miles from the entrance to the Bosphorus. The cause of the disaster is not definitely established. She may have struck a mine, but the possibility of her having been torpedoed is not excluded as a Turkish vessel was torpedoed in the vicinity about the time.<br/>
His Majesty's Government greatly deplore the tragic loss of life which occurred


in this disaster. They had hoped that effect might have been given to the offer of the Palestine Government to admit to Palestine the children on board between the ages of 11 and 16, but this proved impracticable as the Turkish authorities did not feel themselves able to give the necessary permission to land. His Majesty's Government earnestly hope that such a tragedy will not occur again. It does not lie in their power, however, amid the dangers and uncertainties of war, to give any guarantee, nor can they be party to any measures which would undermine the existing policy regarding illegal immigration into Palestine, in view of the wider issues involved. Subject to these reservations, however, I can say that His Majesty's Government will endeavour, so far as lies in their power, to ensure that there is no recurrence of such a disaster as that which befell the "Struma."</p>

<p>As the reply is a long one, I will, with my hon. Friend's permission, circulate it in the OFFICIAL REPORT.<br/>
<i>Following is the reply:</i><br/>
In 1941, there was in Northern Rhodesia an acute shortage of maize for local consumption, and emergency measures had to be taken to import supplies, which could be ill-spared, from neighbouring territories. In order that everything possible should be done to obviate a recurrence of this shortage and of shortages of other foodstuffs for local consumption, immediate steps have been taken to increase the production of foodstuffs to the maximum, especially maize and wheat. Every effort has been made to secure the necessary labour but it has not been possible to obtain the full numbers required under voluntary arrangements. Accordingly, in view of the urgent necessity of securing the required labour at once in order that the land may be prepared in time for planting, my Noble Friend has agreed to the Governor's proposal to use compulsory powers for a limited period of two months to deal with the immediate necessity and for the compulsory recruitment of up to 600 labourers on European farms. The Governor has, therefore, taken compulsory powers under emergency regulations for the period expiring on the 30th April to conscript labour for essential work on farms, and he will use the regulations to obtain such number of the 600 labourers as are not obtainable voluntarily. The Government has taken steps to ensure that the conditions of employment on the farms are fair

and equitable. Labour conscripted under the emergency regulations will receive a rate of pay not less than the average rates paid to farm labour and rations to the satisfaction of the Government. Expansion of native production will proceed side by side with European, and the Governor is satisfied that the recruitment for farms during the next two months will not prejudice native production in any way.</p>

<p>With regard to the first part of the Question, I would refer my hon. Friend to the answer my predecessor gave to a similar Question of his on 4th February. The Government of India are co-operating closely in arranging for supplies both now and in the future. In normal times about 30,000 tons of rice is imported into Ceylon a month, but this amount should be considerably decreased by rationing. The population of Ceylon has increased in recent years. No representations have been received from the State Council or from private organisations in the matter.</p>

<p>The question of holiday travel is engaging my close attention. My Noble Friend, in his broadcast last Sunday, has explained the arrangements which the Government think it desirable to make in the immediate future for dealing with the Easter problem. But for the reasons stated in his Question by my hon. and gallant Friend, drastic economy will be required throughout the coining months in the use of transport for any purposes not connected with the war effort of the nation. While, therefore, the Government are anxious that all war workers should have one week's holiday during the coming summer, it will not be possible to provide facilities for long-distance holiday travel. It is, therefore, desirable that industrial and other enterprises should arrange to stagger their holidays as much as possible, and it is hoped that many people will spend their holidays either in the neighbourhood of their homes or in walking or cycling.</p>

<p>The answer to the first part of the Question is in the negative. As to the second part, it is an offence under the Food (Acquisition of Excessive Quantities) Order for any person to acquire food in excess of the "normal quantity," which is defined as
<q>such quantity as would be required for use in the household or establishment of that person during a period of seven days or such longer period as ought fairly to be allowed in view of the existence of any special circumstances.</q>

<p>I think there ought to be no doubt in the matter. The terms of the Order say that no person shall have in his house any food which exceeds the normal quantity required by him, and the normal quantity is defined as being the quantity for a period of seven days.

<p>I had intended, as you have said, Mr. Speaker, in answer to Question No. 87, to make a statement on the subject of black market offences. In view of the importance of the subject and the interest which the House and the country take in it, I am grateful to you and to the House for permitting me to make the statement now.<br/>
Under the existing Defence Regulations the maximum term of imprisonment which can be imposed for contravening


orders for the control of essential supplies is three months on summary conviction and two years on indictment. For deliberate and calculated efforts to evade for selfish ends orders designed to secure an equitable distribution of controlled articles, these penalties are inadequate. It has been decided, therefore, to introduce new Defence Regulations raising the maximum term to twelve months' imprisonment on summary conviction and to fourteen years' penal servitude on indictment. In the pursuit of these offenders there is close co-operation between the police and the Departments concerned with the control of food and other articles. As is shown by the number of prosecutions, active measures are being taken for the detection of offences. Continuous observation will, however, be maintained with a view to strengthening further the machinery and making such improvements as experience may suggest.<br/>
The offences to which the new Regulations will apply will vary in gravity. Many of them can properly be dealt with by the summary courts empowered as they will be to impose as much as a year's imprisonment. It would be a great mistake to undervalue the work of the magistrates who deal with the great majority of offences against the Defence Regulations as well as against the ordinary law. To their public spirit and efficiency in administering justice we must continue to look for assistance in dealing with a large proportion of offenders. But in order to ensure that there shall be no failure to commit to the higher courts the graver cases calling for greater penalties than the summary courts are authorised to impose, the new Regulations will contain a provision enabling the prosecuting authority to require such cases to be committed for trial on indictment. There will also be a provision enabling the Director of Public Prosecutions to require particular cases to be committed to Assizes rather than to quarter Sessions.<br/>
Special consideration has been given to the question of fines. Even when sentences of imprisonment or penal servitude are imposed&#x2014;and for deterrent purposes it is most important that full use should be made of such sentences&#x2014;the offender must not be allowed to retain his illicit gains. Whatever other punishment may be imposed upon him, he ought to forfeit any profit he may have made by contravening the law. The new Regulations

will therefore require that, in the absence of special circumstances, the offender must be fined a sum equal to the benefit which in the opinion of the court he has derived from his offence. This is the least which ought to be done. The maximum fine which may be imposed will not be limited to the amount of the profit. It may be higher, as for example under the existing provisions in Defence Regulation 55 authorising a fine equal to three times the price at which the offender has offered to sell or buy the goods in question: and the courts will, I am sure, recognise that in appropriate cases the fine should be larger than the profit and that sentences of imprisonment or penal servitude should be imposed as well as fines.<br/>
The new Regulations will also contain a provision for dealing with the man behind the scenes who, though he organises and profits from illicit transactions, keeps so far in the background that it has hitherto been difficult or impracticable to bring him to justice. Although it may be known that such a man has taken a large share of the profit it has frequently been impossible to bring home to him guilty knowledge or active complicity. In future the onus will be placed on these shy profiteers of explaining their conduct to a court. There will be a provision in the Regulations that any person who receives a commission or valuable consideration in respect of an illicit transaction in controlled articles shall be guilty of an offence unless he proves that he did not know and had no reason to believe that the transaction was illicit.<br/>
As many of these illicit transactions start with thefts, the new Regulations will not be confined to contraventions of orders made under Defence Regulation 55, but will also apply to any cases of stealing or receiving controlled articles. Theft of the nation's food or other necessaries is more than theft: it is a crime against the State and must be rigorously punished.<br/>
These new provisions have been very carefully devised in consultation with the Departments concerned with the administration of orders for the control of essential commodities and with those who have had experience of the proceedings in the criminal courts. If further powers are needed, they will be taken, but the Defence Regulation now proposed will, I am confident, provide potent weapons for a vigorous offensive against persons who,


regardless of the national interest and of the principle that food and other essential articles must be fairly shared, are seeking to exploit the war situation for private gain. The courts can, I feel sure, be relied upon to make effective use of the new powers and to administer them with a due sense of the gravity of the evil at which they are aimed.</p>

<p>Care has been taken to give the courts ample powers in that matter. Supposing the offender to have been convicted of selling or buying goods worth &#x00A3;5,000 and to have made a profit of, say, &#x00A3;1,000, then he must be fined &#x00A3;1,000, and may be fined &#x00A3;16,000, that is to say, three times the value of the goods, plus the profit. That is the principle upon which these proposals proceed. There is the further case that if, on indictment, a man is convicted of selling goods worth, say, &#x00A3;100, and of making a profit of &#x00A3;20, the court will not be limited to a fine of &#x00A3;320; the court will be able to impose any fine it thinks appropriate, up to a limit.</p>

<p>The crisis in the affairs of India arising out of the Japanese advance has made us wish to rally all the forces of Indian life, to guard their land from the menace of the invader. In August, 1940, a full statement was made about the aims and policy we are pursuing in India. This amounted, in short, to a promise that, as soon as possible after the war, India should attain Dominion status, in full freedom and equality with this country and the other Dominions, under a Constitution to be framed by Indians, by agreement among themselves and acceptable to the main elements in Indian national life. This was, of course, subject to the fulfilment of our obligations for the protection of minorities, including the depressed classes, and of our treaty obligations to the Indian States, and to the settlement of certain lesser matters arising out of our long association with the fortunes of the Indian sub-continent.<br/>
However, Sir, in order to clothe these general declarations with precision and to convince ail classes, races and creeds in India of our sincere resolve, the War Cabinet have agreed unitedly upon conclusions for present and future action which, if accepted by India as a whole, would avoid the alternative dangers either that the resistance of a powerful minority might impose an indefinite veto upon the wishes of the majority or that a majority decision might be taken which would be resisted to a point destructive of internal harmony and fatal to the setting-up of a new Constitution. We had thought of setting forth immediately the terms of this attempt, by a constructive British contribution, to aid India in the realisation of full self-government; we are, however, apprehensive that to make a public announcement at such a moment as this might do more harm than good. We must first assure ourselves that our scheme would win a reasonable and practical measure of acceptance, and thus promote the concentration of all Indian thought and energies upon the defence of the native soil. We should ill serve the common cause if we made a declaration which would be rejected by essential elements in the Indian world, and which provoked fierce constitutional and communal disputes at a moment when the enemy is at the gates of India.<br/>
Accordingly, we propose to send a member of the War Cabinet to India, to satisfy himself upon the spot, by personal consultation, that the conclusions upon which we are agreed, and which we believe represent a just and final solution, will achieve their purpose. My right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House has volunteered to undertake this task. He carries with him the full confidence of His Majesty's Government, and he will strive in their name to procure the necessary measure of assent, not only from the Hindu majority, but also from those great minorities, amongst which the Moslems are the most numerous and on many grounds preeminent.<br/>
The Lord Privy Seal will, at the same time, consult with the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief upon the military situation, bearing always in mind the paramount responsibility of His Majesty's Government by every means in their power to shield the peoples of India from the perils which now beset them. We must remember that India has a great part to play in the world's struggle for freedom and that her helping hand must be extended in loyal comradeship to the valiant Chinese people, who have fought alone so long. We must remember also that India is one of the bases from which the strongest counter-blows must be struck at the advance of tyranny and aggression.<br/>
My right hon. Friend will set out as soon as convenient and suitable arrangements can be made. I am sure he will command in his task the heartfelt good wishes of all parts of the House and that, meanwhile, no word will be spoken or Debates be held, here or in India, which would add to the burden he has assumed in his mission, or lessen the prospects of a good result. During my right hon. and learned Friend's absence from this House, his duties as Leader will be discharged by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p>There are one or two points in connection with this Vote to which I wish to draw the attention of the First Lord of the Admiralty. They are particularly concerned with the training of personnel and the selection of officers. These matters have been brought to my notice by a document which I have just received. It is a document drawn up by a group of young officers who are keen on these matters, and I propose to give a hint or two of the views which they express, for the information both of the public and of the House, and, with my right hon. Friend's consent, I will then hand the document over to him in order that it may receive the attention of himself and his advisers. This document complains that to a large extent the efficiency of the Navy is hampered by a slavish adherence to the traditions of Nelson's day. Among other comments which its authors make, they suggest that the training of personnel, which is now entrusted to retired officers or pensioned instructors, should be given to more active and vigorous persons. They also ask that more attention should be given to training in gunnery, which they consider is very badly neglected. They complain that much of the training has no relation to the modern conditions in the Navy and that a lot of time is spent on such things as making hitches and splices, and so on&#x2014;things which are not of much use in the modern Navy, however valuable they may have been in the days of sail. In short, they complain that much of the present syllabus for the training of personnel has no relation to modern naval conditions.<br/>
They suggest, in view of the possibilities of invasion and the use of the Navy in that connection, that a certain amount of attention should be given to land fighting. They also ask that attention should be given to the abolition of a good deal of very harmful and unnecessary ceremonial which is still adhered to in the Royal Naval establishments. They claim that the time so employed could be devoted to instructional courses, which, spread over a 10-weeks course, would give them no less than another 10 or 13 hours which could be spent on very necessary instruction.<br/>
With regard to the training of officers, I ask the indulgence of the House while I read an extract, although at the same time I should like my right hon. Friend to realise that I am in no way detracting from the value of the great service which he did when he introduced promotion from the lower deck. This is what these young officers say as to the effect of the new scheme:
<q>The recruitment of officers now is entirely from the lower deck with the exception of a few specialists, nevertheless it is by no means satisfactory, not only that the wrong type of man is often selected but that the right type is far more often overlooked. A certain number of regular officers are still being produced from places like Dartmouth, which it is almost impossible to enter without monied parents. The selection is made as follows. Whilst the trainee is a rating he is first seen by a C.W.1 board which recommend him for a commission. After that he is watched at sea, and if recommended by his captain he goes before a preliminary and then a final Admiralty selection board. If passed he goes to the "King Alfred." The chief criticism of the system lies in the method of selection.</q></p>

<p>I am reading from a scheme sent to me by a number of young officers:
<q>Every trainee fills in a questionnaire which is examined. Men with suitable educational qualifications are noted and watched. The snag is that no one who has not at least had a secondary school education is even considered, no matter what brilliance he may show while at the training establishment, thus many who might make very brilliant officers are overlooked. The official excuse for this is that without a secondary school education men cannot master the officers' training course. This, speaking from personal experience, is not true. Any intelligent man can easily master the course, while no matter how high his educational qualifications, unless they are linked with intelligence a good officer does not result. Particularly important is the understanding


which an officer has of his men, and the present insistence on education results in a gap between officers and ratings. There is no doubt that the system as at present worked definitely prevents the average rating from ever being even considered for an examination.</q>
I do not know how much truth there is in this, but coming from the source it does, I think it would be worth while for my right hon. Friend to consider it in connection with the scheme he has already introduced, with a view to finding out whether there are some points which might be reconsidered to make it more effective and give a larger measure of satisfaction, while securing a wider range of selection for these officers.</p>

<p>I rather understood my hon. Friend to say that he does not put these views forward as his own considered opinion, and that he is not taking personal responsibility for them, and in those circumstances it is important that the House should know more definitely whether these are the views of one or two young officers or whether he himself accepts responsibility for them.</p>

<p>I take personal responsibility, although, as I said, I have been more or less informed and inspired by a group of young officers. It is a thing which is quite usually done; the hon. Member himself does it in the House regarding any matter of which he may have some knowledge. So far as that goes, I am responsible for anything I say, and so far as it may be helpful to the First Lord, I propose to hand over to him such information as I may have and any criticisms in connection with the training of personnel and the training of officers, in order that he may be better enabled to discuss the questions which I put before him.</p>

<p>Before the right hon. Gentleman replies, with regard to the suggestion that the best types are not always selected, I should like to give a special testimony based on the experience of two visits in connection with the magnificent work done by the "King Alfred." It is one of the best bits of work the Admiralty have done during the last two years. Far from the impression having been conveyed to me that there was any undue inquiry into the origin of trainees or their schooling, I formed the contrary opinion, and I believe that in the recruitment of temporary officers from

the lower deck the Admiralty has set a magnificent example which the other two Service might very well follow. Obviously, in an enormous expansion such as has taken place, there may be exceptions, and men of ability may have been overlooked, but I would like to say, from what I have heard from men in the Service who joined up before or since the outbreak of war, that the regular officers received the temporary officers with open arms, although they have a different badge&#x2014;which I think is unfortunate; it is a pity they do not follow the example of the other two Services&#x2014;and the experience of temporary officers is that they are received in every way as equals. They are given every encouragement, and on the whole the feeling of the lower deck, especially among men who joined only for war service; is that they have had a square deal. There is just one other matter which my hon. Friend raised.</p>

<p>If the right hon. Baronet is suggesting that I complained that the promotion scheme from the lower deck is a failure, he is wrong. I suggest how it can be improved.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend gave me the impression that there was a good deal of grousing on the lower deck. If that is so, he is quite right to raise the matter, but I have seen another side of the story, and I think it just as well to raise that also. When the hon. Gentleman interrupted me, I was just going to say that if my hon. Friend had concentrated on one case in which there is a need for reform he would have been doing a great service, and that is the question of the status of engineering officers. I know my right hon. Friend must be conscious of a grievance among engineering officers to the effect that they are regarded somehow as an inferior grade. It was largely due to the great work of Admiral Fisher when he was First Sea Lord that higher ranks were made open to them and equality in principle given. I think that far greater use should be made of the skill, knowledge and expert training of the engineering officers. Obviously, all the high commands must go to the executive officers. But I have heard that parents are saying to their boys, "Do not become trained for an engineer officer, because all the higher posts will be denied to you. You will have to do harder work than


the others, but, of course, you can never reach the top." Obviously that is inevitable. Command of the Fleet must go to the executive officers. But, as I said the other day, when it comes to any appointments in dockyards or administrative posts which largely imply technical training, equality at least should be given to the engineer officers. I believe that the organisation of the Admiralty would gain, and I think it would be to the general advantage of the Navy.<br/>
I have just looked through the long list of members of the Board of Admiralty. This has very much expanded of recent years. I would suggest that when there is a suitable vacancy, if there is an engineer admiral available with experience and training, consideration should be given to his appointment. The War Office at one time actually put on the Army Council an engineer admiral. There is a man in the Ministry of Supply, a very distinguished engineer officer. I believe it would be very much appreciated in the Service if more recognition were given to the engineering side of the Navy's work.<br/>
I wish now to refer to Dartmouth. The hon. Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon) seemed rather to imply that entry at Dartmouth was still confined to well-to-do people. I thought the right hon. Gentleman had made a great change there, that boys from secondary schools were now to have a square deal, that it was going to be democratised. Of course, it will take time. That ought to be acknowledged and made clear, because that reform would go a long way to meet the criticisms of the hon. Member.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a small point. I put a Question to-day and received an Answer which really gave us a great surprise. In the registration of youths which is taking place it has been my experience in the last fortnight that a large number of boys have said that they wanted to join the Navy. I have had the humiliating experience of having to tell them that there was no unit for them to join. I brought this matter to the notice of my right hon. Friend personally about six weeks ago, and I went to see the officials concerned. Having spent two of the most happy years of my life in the post to which the hon. and gallant Member for Widnes (Capt.

Pilkington) has been appointed, on which I congratulate him, I have a great interest to see that the Navy gets its share of the boys who are now being registered. It is really a heart-breaking thing to ask people to apply and then have no unit for them to join. It is bad for morale. I hope the First Lord will see that nothing shall hold up this matter in the future and that some assurance will be given about it.</p>

<p>I wish to raise one point upon which I will not detain the House for very long, but it is a matter of considerable importance to retired officers. It is a matter which really affects all the three Services, but I thought that I could most appropriately raise it on the Admiralty Vote, because one looks to the Senior Service to look after its officers, present and past. I hope that in this matter, as in others, they will set an example to the other Services. In 1931, as a result of the economy campaign, a reduction was made in the pay of retired officers. That reduction was partially restored on 1st July, 1934, and in 1935 the retired pay was consolidated on a basis of a 9&#x00BD; per cent. cut on the standard rate. I wish to appeal to my right hon. Friend the First Lord to consider whether that 9&#x00BD; per cent. cut may not now be restored and the standard rate brought back once more. The amount of money involved for the Admiralty, I was told in answer to a Question, would be &#x00A3;157,000, a comparatively small sum for the nation, but the present position creates one of considerable hardship for the individual officers concerned.</p>

<p>I wish to say a word on what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) said about engineer


officers in the Navy. It has been brought up in Debates on the Navy Estimates year after year for the last 10 years, and has been supported from all parts of the House. Why should we get soft and soothing answers, and yet nothing is done? There are two points I wish to put to the First Lord of the Admiralty. We do not expect engineer admirals to be put in command of fleets, but surely there is no reason that they should not be appointed to be admiral superintendents at dockyards such as Devonport. Why cannot they be given some position such as that? Why should the engineer branch of the Navy not be represented on the Board of Admiralty? We have asked for that year after year, but nothing has been done. If we had geniuses like Lord Fisher as First Sea Lord at the Admiralty, it would be done. I ask the First Lord to consider this matter to see whether something cannot be done.</p>

<p>I wish to say a word on this matter, being an engineer born and bred. This has been a vexed question with our union for over 40 years. The engineer is still treated in the Navy in the same fashion as when engineers were not in existence, in the days of Nelson. There has been no change made so far as the officers are concerned. There has been a great revolution taking place, particularly in our day and generation, so far as the engineer is concerned. A battleship, particularly, with everything connected with the Navy in that line, is all machinery. Just as in the coalfields, everything is becoming mechanised. The engineer is the very foundation of the Navy to-day. But no change has been made in the position of the personnel in the Navy. In every industry the engineer is given a chance, because engineering is the foundation of industry. I am not saying this because I am an engineer, but this is an engineering age. The Navy, however, is the most conservative institution in this country. It does whatever it jolly well likes, and we need to take a strong hand with it. It is not the perfect institution that it is supposed to be. This is one of the facts which goes to prove that. The engineer has never been given his proper place in the Navy. I do not know whether you will let me touch upon another matter, Sir, which is very serious? That is the position of the Admiralty in relation to shipbuilding.</p>

<p>Then I shall have to be satisfied. I have come here primed with actual facts about the awful state of chaos, mismanagement, and misunderstanding, which arises because shipbuilding is in the hands of men who know nothing about shipbuilding, who have never worked in a shipyard, and who are giving orders to shipbuilders who have built the mightiest steamers afloat, both for the Admiralty and for private shipowners.

<p>With regard to the matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon), it has been one of my special desires at all times when associated with the Admiralty to improve both the conditions of the personnel and their avenues of promotion and standards of training. I think I can claim to have done something in that direction. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) referred to the statement, made to-day, that there were apparently in war too many officers coming from Dartmouth into the Service who would not have been able to do that training unless their parents had been wealthy. We have revolutionised that situation. We have thrown open scholarship aid to boys not only from grant-aided secondary schools but from


preparatory schools, whose parents could not otherwise have afforded to send them for expensive training at Dartmouth College. We have already received reports on the 20 boys with scholarships from secondary State-aided schools now at the College.</p>

<p>About the same number. We want to get the best selection of the brains of our youth all over the country, and to make certain that finance does not stand in their way. I am glad to say that the reports on the first full term's work by those boys have been most encouraging, and that they show that the boys are likely to stand up well to the tasks that they will have to perform.</p>

<p>Would it not be advisable, in view of that statement, for the Admiralty to send a message to the various youth organisations, drawing their attention to the new situation which exists in connection with this training course, and to get the broadest possible basis of supply?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1942-03-11a.1095.3" hansard_membership_id="469" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22677" speakername="Mr. Alexander" colnum="1095" time="">
<p>The widest possible publicity has been given to it. The fact is best illustrated by the hundreds of applications which we have received for permission to sit in the examinations for scholarships. But I can assure my hon. Friend that we will examine every possible step to see that they are notified. The best avenue for getting candidates is to see that every school, of all the types eligible to send in candidates, is properly informed. With regard to the rest of the case made by my hon. Friend the member for North Camberwell, the record of achievement of those who have passed through the training provided in this war for commissioned branches from the lower deck is, I think, a sufficient tribute to the excellence of the work done. The standard which I have observed, not only from reports but from actual visits which I have paid, among Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officers is most encouraging. Take, for example, a young man going from civilian life into training in "King Alfred" and, within 12 months

of that time, becoming a full lieutenant, and destroying perhaps with his one ship, 80 or 100 mines in the face of the enemy. That sort of achievement is a pretty good tribute to the nature of the training the Navy is giving in the war training ships and establishments. I have heard, too, from relatives of my own, who have served on the lower deck in this war and have passed through, or are passing through, the training, how well they think of the training syllabus and of the officers who have had the handling of their training. But when my hon. Friend has a widely-based case made to him from officers, we shall, of course, examine the case with great care. We want to make sure that the selection made from the lower deck under the commission warrant is of the best. It has been so successful that we are anxious not to hold up from training candidates of the lower deck, the work of whose ship has meant that they have had to go to a foreign station. Therefore, we have extended the work of the "King Alfred" to a foreign station in order that there may he wider facilities to take the inflow during the was for training for commissions.<br/>
With regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Lindsay), I am obliged to him, because of his previous knowledge of work at the Admiralty and also his experience at the Board of Education, for the consultation he has already had with me on the subject of Sea Cadets. The position has been different in the case of the Sea Cadet Corps compared with training for other Services. It has been carried out very largely in the past&#x2014;and a great deal of good work has been done&#x2014;by the Navy League and other voluntary associations. When the new position came to be created we had to consider the matter very carefully and see what could be done to extend the opportunity in a wider number of centres for these cadets, the arrangements for whom will now be superintended by the Admiralty. I can say to him that the arrangements for the Sea Cadet Corps are being fitted in both with the operations of the cadet corps of the other Services, and with the local education authorities, and at the same time attention has been given to the expansion of the number of units and centres. The present situation is that it is advancing rapidly, and in the case of the two centres


in which I am myself interested&#x2014;in the West Riding of Yorkshire and the Tyneside&#x2014;we are already making arrangements for extending units. In view of what my hon. Friend told me across the Table, I shall certainly go to the department of the Admiralty dealing with that expansion and say that the greatest possible expedition should be given to the creation of new centres or branches of the Cadet Corps so that, as far as possible, we can meet what is a very important&#x2014;and from my point of view very praiseworthy and laudable&#x2014;desire on the part of youth to join this great Service of ours.</p>

<p>In the case of the Air Force my right hon. Friend will remember that a well-known master, now the hon. Member for Swindon (Mr. Wakefield), has been put in charge, and I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman will consider&#x2014;I am casting no reflections on present appointments&#x2014;appointing some reasonably young naval officer, if it is possible for him to be spared, to adapt the training to the young people. I can assure him that they are waiting, and it is pathetic to see them asking to go into these units when there is nothing available for them.</p>

<p>I will certainly consider the suggestion of my hon. Friend and discuss it at once with the appropriate department. There is a very strongly held view in the House with regard to engineer-officers. I have never found in my experience at the Admiralty any desire to under-rate or under-estimate the enormous value of the services and the great technical service rendered to the Fleet by engineer officers. I would say to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) that they are not placed in quite the position he seems to think. They have promotion all the way through both from the college and the lower deck, and they reach the high flag rank of vice-admiral, so I do not think that his general complaint is quite justified. The question whether they should be given the opportunity of acting, for example, as admiral-superintendents of dockyards is a most important one. We have to remember, however, that the admiral-superintendent of a dockyard always has the advice of engineers, and moreover that he also has a great many non-technical duties to perform which are very often so well performed by naval officers. But I will go this far and say that there can be no real

professional bar to an engineer-admiral acting as a superintendent of a dockyard. The question which the right hon. Gentleman the hon. Member for South-West Bethnal Green put with regard to creating a seat on the Board of Admiralty for engineer officers is rather more difficult. If you are to say that the Board of Admiralty, on its naval side, should consist of a flag officer representing every section, we would have to include the medical, paymasters and so on.</p>

<p>Certainly that is not my contention, nor that of those who are pressing for this. We say that if there is an able and qualified engineer-admiral, the fact that he is an engineer should not exclude him from consideration. That should not be a bar against an engineer-admiral sitting on the Board of Admiralty.</p>

<p>I shall certainly take that point into consideration. When you consider the controls which have to be operated by a professional member of the Board of Admiralty, you must be certain that the person selected has had experience in all respects, not only as an engineer, of those controls.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a matter which greatly affects the ability of the Navy to carry out its responsibilities without placing undue risks upon naval officers and men who fly aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm from shore bases. The only torpedo aircraft which the Navy possesses is a seaborne aircraft, the Swordfish, which is six years old, a biplane, with a speed of about 90 miles per hour, and is quite outclassed by the shore-based aircraft it is likely to encounter. It was designed to perform seaborne duties, torpedo work on the open seas, but in the Mediterranean and other places the Admiralty has squadrons of Swordfish based on shore which fly within reach of the shore-based aircraft of the enemy. I received a letter only about a fortnight ago from a young officer in the Fleet Air Arm who was flying in one of these Swordfish squadrons. He says they often had to fly over the land where they met fighters which were infinitely superior, of course, to ours. They did most of time flying at night, and in moonlight in the Mediterranean the night was often as light as day, and they had suffered losses from the fighters of the enemy. He goes on to say:


<q>Our squadron was ordered to attack shipping in an enemy harbour, and the attack had to be carried out in broad daylight. I took part in this attack, and we came out with only three aircraft out of eight, the losses all being due to the presence of enemy fighters.</q>
He says further:
<q>This is not a criticism of that operation. I quite realise that it was essential to the conduct of the war, and none of us had the slightest hesitation in carrying it out, but it served to show how aircraft designed for sea warfare stood rather a slender chance of survival, when opposed by shore-based fighters.</q>
I had that letter by me when we debated the Navy Estimates. I meant to refer to it, but I had not the time. Next morning I saw in an obituary column that this young officer had lost his life in one of these attacks. I quite realise that when the Government decided, in 1937, to keep the Coastal Command under the Royal Air Force the development of torpedo shore-based aircraft would be in the hands of the Royal Air Force, but when this war started the Royal Air Force only had one type of shore-based torpedo aircraft, which, apparently, is not very efficient. I do ask my right hon. Friend to go into this matter very carefully with the Air Ministry and come to some sort of an arrangement whereby young men of the Royal Naval Air Service can fly in aircraft that are not outclassed by enemy fighters when, of necessity, they have to be based on shore within reach of the enemy. There is a young officer in this House who recently commanded one of the fighter squadrons of the Royal Naval Air Service. He told me his fighters, which were, of necessity, based on shore, were greatly inferior to the fighters of the enemy and, indeed, to those of the Royal Air Force.<br/>
Surely the First Lord should insist on the fighter squadrons of the Royal Naval Air Service, based on shore, being properly equipped with fighters that are fit to meet those of the enemy. I hope it will not be suggested that I am trying to make bad blood between officers of the Royal Air Force and the Navy. After all, they all come out of the same cradle, whether they wear dark or light blue uniforms, and I am sure that officers of the Royal Air Force sympathise greatly with those of the Navy for having to continue to fly in aircraft which are inferior to theirs and inferior to those of

the enemy. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Hertford (Sir M. Sueter) told the House recently how he produced torpedo aircraft 27 years ago. I have a letter, which I happened to receive a day or two ago from an officer who commanded the ship in which these aircraft were carried. It is from Lieut.-Commander L'Estrange Malone, at one time a Member of this House, who says:
<q>On 12th August, 1915, under your inspiration and guidance the first successful attack with planes carrying torpedoes across the Bulair lines scored three hits on enemy ships. That was a great day.</q>
Surely if the Navy had been free to develop its Naval Air Service throughout the past 20 years or more, we should not be so far behind nowadays when we have only six-year-old 90-mile-an-hour torpedo aircraft. I went over to America eight years ago to have a look at the American naval air service. It was too per cent. ahead of ours. Why could not we have bought torpedo aircraft from the American Navy when the war broke out, and it was necessary to base some of our torpedo aircraft ashore? I am sure we could have got them, and I expect we could get them now. The hon. and gallant Member for Cleveland (Commander Bower) told the House that at the beginning of the war Coastal Command, doing naval work, had only American commercial machines, and a few flying boats for reconnaissance, no torpedo aircraft operating and no fighters or bombers. What would have been said of the Admiralty if they had been responsible for carrying out the naval duties performed by the Coastal Command of the R.A.F. if they had been so ill-equipped. When I came back from America I went to Short's works at Rochester, and I was shown&#x2014;</p>

<p>I quite understand, Sir, since the Navy has not any flying boats though it ought to have, so I will leave it at that. What I do suggest is that the First Lord and the Air Ministry should really get together and try to provide the Royal Naval Air Service with up-to-date aircraft, so that the sort of thing which happened the other day, when three enemy ships went through the Channel, does not recur. The Admiralty had only six Swordfish torpedo planes at their disposal. Naturally, the Admiral threw them into the battle. They were seaborne torpedo bombers. What chance was there against the opposition they had to encounter? None. But if the Admiralty had had aircraft similar to those which the Japanese had, and the numbers they used against the "Prince of Wales" and the "Repulse," I doubt whether those ships would have ever got home.</p>

<p>I would like to ask a question about these torpedo-dropping aircraft, in which I have been interested for a considerable time. Who is responsible for the design of torpedo-dropping aircraft? Does it come under the Experimental Establishment at Farnborough, or whom, because we have been at war now for two and a half years, and as my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Portsmouth (Sir R. Keyes) has just said, all we have are Swordfish aircraft, six or seven years old. Has nothing been done during the last two and a half years to improve the type of torpedo-dropping aircraft. It is no good the First Lord coming to the House and saying that he and the Secretary of State for Air are looking into the matter now and studying hard. Surely that ought to have been done during the last two and a half years. In the last war we never took two and a half years to develop new machines. We got them out in a few months, and we helped the Army to a considerable extent. A great many Naval Air Service machines were handed over to the Army when the Army were in difficult straits in the last war. If we could do that in the last war in a few months, why on earth cannot the Admiralty get proper torpedo planes for this war. I do not know how long the right hon. Gentleman has been. First Lord, but surely in his time he might have insisted on something being done to develop the torpedo plane and not let the

Japanese get away with it as they did. I said a few days ago that it was disgraceful that this should have happened, and I feel rather hot about it, having introduced the torpedo-carrying seaplane and aeroplane into the Navy. We old pioneers have been let down by the technical people, or by whoever is responsible at the Admiralty. I want the First Lord to tell the House who is responsible, and not get away with remarks to the effect that it will be looked into, and so on. Who is responsible?</p>

I am sorry that the hon. and gallant Member for North Portsmouth was removed from command of the Commandos, because if he were still there, perhaps I could have persuaded him to make a Commando raid in Whitehall and go from one office to another cleaning out the whole gang and getting some new, fresh lads in so as to develop work that is essential.

<p>I will speak again on this Vote with the permission of the House. When I rose to reply before, I


thought that no other hon. Member rose. The questions raised by the hon. and gallant Member for North Portsmouth (Sir R. Keyes) about the aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm are questions with which I am most vitally concerned. No one who has been responsible for the administrative control of the Navy during the past year and a half could have been anything but concerned about the situation in relation to the torpedo aircraft available for the use of the Fleet Air Arm, but to suggest that the actual aircraft which are in use are useless is, I think, to go too far.</p>

<p>That depends very largely upon whether they had fighter protection&#x2014;and they had&#x2014;as I am sure the hon. and gallant Gentleman will admit. I do not want a wrong impression to go out about the work of the Fleet Air Arm, and I am sure the hon. and gallant Gentleman does not want it either. Ever since I have been at the Admiralty, we have been pressing, and with some success, to get improvements in the equipment of the Fleet Air Arm. The suggestion that nothing has been done is quite false.</p>

<p>Will the First Lord tell the House exactly what success he has had in improving torpedo-dropping aircraft? The Swordfish aircraft was shown to me at Malta five years ago, and as it was probably designed a couple of years before that, that would make it seven years old.

<p>The Swordfish was succeeded by the Albacore, which was slightly faster&#x2014;not very much&#x2014;and had some other improvements. It is largely in use to-day. Secondly, there is a very much more powerful and very much faster torpedo-bomber now coming into active production, which has been designed and developed for some considerable time.</p>

<p>I am giving the facts. If there is anyone who has pressed more for this work to be done than I have during the last 18 months, in trying to get this equipment for the Fleet Air Arm, I should like to meet him. May I add something else? My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Portsmouth referred to the possibility which there was of obtaining American machines for the purpose of improving the speed and equipment of the Fleet Air


Arm. That has been in progress during the whole of the time I have been at the Admiralty, and we have got fighters, Martlets and other types, which were obtained early on, although, as I am sure my hon. and gallant Friend will recognise, many technical alterations had to be made in them to make them successful.<br/>
There is one other point I want to make with reference to the remarks of the hon. and gallant Member for Hertford concerning the development of the work of the Fleet Air Arm and the obtaining of faster torpedo-bombers to fly off carriers. We have also had concurrently another problem to settle, and that was the arrangements for landing the very much faster machines. This work has been developed and brought up to date, and we are now able to handle on carriers, as a result of these developments, very fast fighter machines and, equally well, the fast torpedo-bombers which are coming into production. That is the extent of the success which, I submit, has been accomplished.</p>

<p>I want to remind the First Lord of the Admiralty of something he said during the Navy Estimates to which I attached the greatest importance. He said:
<q>But the experience in the case of the 'Prince of Wales' and 'Repulse' points to the fact that every possible drive has to be put into further equipping ourselves for the development of this form of attack.</q>
That is torpedo-bombing. He then went on to say:
<q>I have strong views on the question."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 26th February, 1942; col. 382; Vol. 378.]</q>
I only want to ask him if he will kindly express those views. I suggest to him that he has not done so.</p>

<p>Obviously, what I had in mind there was the torpedo-bomber attack upon the Fleet, which was not carried out from aircraft carriers. The attack was made by land-based torpedo-bombers. I feel it to be of vast importance that the Fleet should have at its service an adequate number of shore-based torpedo-bombers for the same kind of work as was carried out against our two ships by the Japanese. There must be no misunderstanding in the House about my views on that. My hon. and gallant

Friend the Member for Hertford hoped we should get together with the Air Ministry in regard to future development. I can assure him that the Admiralty are doing all they possibly can in that direction to get what we feel the Navy needs and must have.</p>

<p>The First Lord has really got away from my point. I was not complaining so much about the Fleet Air Arm sea-borne craft. What I was complaining about was that Fleet Air Arm aircraft, which were designed to fight only from aircraft carriers, should have to be used for shore bases&#x2014;because of the narrow waters of the Mediterranean where they constantly meet shore-based fighters of the enemy which absolutely outclass them and cause many casualties.</p>

<p>I wish to ask the Financial Secretary to the War Office one or two questions. Since we debated the Army Estimates there has been a change in the War Office. Unfortunately we cannot have the Secretary of State for War in this House, although, if I may say so, he has a very good substitute on the Front Bench. I am sure we are all in agreement that the sooner he is in the House the better, and we wish him a better time than his two predecessors. He has assumed office in a way which has become habitual to Secretaries of State&#x2014;he has decided to review the qualities of all officers over 45 years of age up to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. It is a commonplace to say that youth will have its way, but if ever there was a conflict in

which it could be said that it was a young man's war, this is the one. I do not exactly come from Scotland, but I come from a county near enough to have learned a little from that country.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to resist their influence, and consequently I am not so apt to be influenced by catch phrases. I wish to ask the Financial Secretary to explain just what is the system whereby the War Office are to test the qualities of these officers who will come under review. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha), when he was Secretary of State for War, made changes at the top just before the war, and his successor made changes on the women's side. We want to be quite sure that in the review that is taking place quality for modern fighting is going to be the real test.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman will have gathered from supplementary questions yesterday that there is some question in the mind of certain Members as to what would be the value of this test. There are others who think we ought to go much higher than lieutenant-colonel. There may be need of that, and I daresay the Government would not hesitate about it if necessary. I have long held the view that the real difficulty that the Army has to face is not the commands so much as their selection of the average type of officer, and I think the hon. Gentleman and those connected with the War Office ought to know that there is very grave question still in the minds of a number of people as to whether the quality of the officer is the test, or his social status, or the school he went to. We know of a certain gentleman who was asked what school he had been to. I know the War Office would not tolerate that kind of thing as far as they are concerned, but have they a proper grip of the selection machinery, of the people who select the men from the youths until final selection? I do not say that the old school tie is the only thing that you have to criticise. Everything points to the fact that you have to have a considerable stiffening of men of leadership, men of quality and ability who have had experience of the rough and tumble of life but who may not have academic qualifications at all. I hope that is


borne in mind. You can get a good N.C.O. who has neither been to one of the old schools nor to a secondary school nor to college. I hope very serious attention is given to this factor.<br/>
I asked the hon. Gentleman yesterday whether they were extending Commando training to other units, and in general he said they were. I do not know just what that means. The Commandos properly are a force which acts as a rule with naval units and the Air Force, jointly, for some sudden descent at some unexpected point. The principle of the Commando does not necessarily mean cooperation with other Forces. What it means is that you have a small body or bodies of men who act under leadership, take very grave risks and go out "on their own." I do not think it would be stretching it too far to say that what is called infiltration, as practised by the Japanese, is one application of the same principle. I think you could also say that you have the same principle in operation in the guerilla forces in Russia and elsewhere. The Commando is just a form of guerilla. I do not know what the attitude of the War Office towards the Commando is. I do not know whether they have given sufficient thought to possible developments of the idea for the Fighting Services, but I hope the matter is receiving the attention of the War Office, because, if one thing is certain, it is that in this war we have to have a considerable number of detachments and units which are prepared, so to speak, to go out in the blue for that purpose.<br/>
I should like to put another question, in connection with the Beveridge Report. In dealing with their investigation into the waste of man-power into the Army, they propose the setting-up of a corps of mechanical engineers. They said they had been very much influenced by the result of the corps of instructors in the Navy, and they said:
<q>The Navy is machine-minded. The Army cannot afford to be less so. The Navy sets engineers to catch, test, train and use engineers. Until the Army gives to mechanical and electrical engineers, as distinct from civil engineers, their appropriate place and influence in the Army system, such engineers are not likely to be caught, tested and trained so well as in the Navy. There is danger that they will be misused by men whose main interests and duties lie in other fields.</q>

Have the War Office taken any decision on that matter, and have they decided either for or against the forming of a corps of mechanical engineers? I have always thought that the model of the Navy was one that the Army might well have copied long ago. I shall be very pleased indeed if the hon. Gentleman can give an answer to my question in the affirmative.</p>

<p>I want to raise the point that I raised on the Admiralty Vote, the question of the registration of young men between 16 and 18 who come under the cadet system. I understand that the War Office intends to go in for a considerable expansion, probably five-or ten-fold, of the existing numbers, but I think there is still confusion, because in the first registration the age for cadets is from 14 to 17. The age for the Home Guard is quite indefinite. In the first registration the numbers who belonged to an organisation have been swollen all over the country, especially in the rural districts, because a large number of young fellows between 17 and 18 have automatically joined the Home Guard. It was also discovered that quite a number between 16 and 17, and others who put their ages up, are also in the Home Guard. In the case of the Air Force there is a clear-cut pre-Service training unit of 16 to 18, and one boy in every five is in it. The scheme had as its head the director of pre-entry training until a few weeks ago&#x2014;a distinguished educationist who was headmaster at Uppingham and was lent to the Air Force.<br/>
The Army is going in for an almost comparable expansion, and I would like to ask one or two questions about it. What arrangements have been made for the intake of, say, five times the present number of cadets? Why was an exclusive arrangement made with one of the voluntary associations? I do not object to the arrangement being made with that organisation&#x2014;I think it is wholly good&#x2014;but I have had complaints from a number of other organisations which would like to have been taken into confidence from the beginning. I would also like to ask whether there is not some young officer, preferably one who has been in action and been in the Commandos, who can be put at the head of this movement to inspire confidence throughout the youth of the country. Something of a dramatic


nature is needed. The scheme was launched in a rather curious way, and it did not make a great appeal. The Air Force were given priority in starting their movement, a letter was sent to the mayor of every town, arrangements were made with the Board of Education, and a careful course was worked out. I suggest that there should not be a great deal of drill, only enough for disciplinary purposes, but that the cadets should be something like a junior Commando organisation. That is the thing that would appeal to boys.<br/>
The position of a headmaster who has three pre-Service training units in his school is rapidly becoming absurd, and it will before long become a matter for consideration whether between 14 and i6 there should not be some preliminary basic general training for all three Services. Specialisation could then be simply worked out for the Army, Navy and Air Force during the two years 16 to 18. At the present moment it is rather confusing. I am not aware of anybody who is in charge, with great respect to Lord Bridgeman who is in charge of the Home Guard. I should like to have somebody to whom the cadets can look, a young, inspiring man who has been in action, who will adapt the training to modern conditions and will give a lead to the movement. If there are to be 150,000 cadets, as there are in the Air Force, it will have to be carefully organised and dovetailed and integrated into the educational system and the youth organisations of the country.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Lawson), I note the changes on the Government Front Bench. The Financial Secretary to the War Office will soon be sitting in solitary glory with or without the moral support of the War Minister. On the last occasion the late War Minister, we thought, put up rather a good show. He is succeeded by the Permanent Secretary, who has served under four War Ministers, and some of us think that he was the man who ought to have been sacked. The new War Minister was introduced to the country as ruthless and, to use an Americanism, a "tough guy." We shall be interested to see how he introduces his policy of ruthlessness, whether he will practise it upon himself, and

whether we are to have a new order, the undistinguished order of the bowler hat, introduced in a wholesale fashion at the War Office. I would like to speak of the Territorial officers and men who have been absorbed by the war Army. I hope that the War Office will bear in mind these men who have given years of service. In the Air Force and the Navy the fact that officers and men were in the Reserve was recognised when they were absorbed. I am hoping, if my remarks reach the War Office and this "tough guy," that the officers and men who were in the Territorials will be allowed to have the honourable "T" restored to them, for it showed that they had put in honourable years of service as Territorials before the war.<br/>
For two years I have been a member of His Majesty's Forces. I have no uniform, but I am an accredited member as a welfare officer. I have been most encouraged by the work which has been done by the thousand or so welfare officers in every command. In the Northern Command, to which I am attached without pips, I know of only one who is paid, and we have to pay him because he has to live. He draws the Army pay of an officer. I mention this because in the Debate on the Estimates the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. E. Walkden) referred to welfare officers and imagined them in all the splendour of their uniforms, strutting about like peacocks. Most of these officers are doing their work without any spotlight. Their attention is concentrated on the small units, anti-aircraft searchlights and so forth.<br/>
Owing to this department of the War Office having been developed, first by Sir John Brown, and being now under its present distinguished head with his staff, it is very efficient. It is not now so much a question of the provision of amenities&#x2014;draughts boards, games and so forth&#x2014;as of the personal contact which is maintained by welfare officers. One welfare officer in Sheffield received 27 letters in one day from soldiers. I also get my share. As I am a civilian, either a soldier or the commander-in-chief can approach me for advice. We deal now with the personal problems of the soldier. For instance, a man's wife is ill, or, as happened the other day, he is concerned because he has not had a letter from his wife, which, I may say, is most refreshing, because among other things we have


been asked how to get easy divorces. Other soldiers are concerned about the care of their children. I spend a lot of my time visiting the households of the wives of serving soldiers, and to try my best to be a cheerful visitor. One of the jobs which welfare officers are doing is trying to keep up the morale of the Army. In Britain at any rate the Army to-day is standing by and waiting, and it is monotonous, routine work, without a lot of excitement, but I am certain the men will be ready to serve in other ways and will be "on their toes" when the time comes. I wish to refer next to education in the Army. In pre-war days it had been greatly developed.</p>

<p>Then I will leave that subject. In regard to the personal care of soldiers&#x2014;and I do not mean by that the coddling of soldiers&#x2014;I very much value a little booklet called "Current Affairs," which is issued fortnightly. I wish it could be an Army instruction that every subaltern should receive a copy of "Current Affairs" fortnightly &#x2014; those who do get it now find it very interesting&#x2014;and that he should get his platoon together during working hours, not in the men's leisure time, and explain to them what "Current Affairs" has to say, because it has something of interest for every soldier who takes an interest in his country. I should also like to talk about padres and chaplains. I wish we could introduce into the Army the system that prevails in the Navy. I believe the padres would do their work better without pips on their shoulders and with not so much saluting.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Lawson) mentioned the old school tie. The present Adjutant-General, when he was Commander-in-Chief, Northern Command, went through the list of pass-outs from an O.C.T.U. He told me so himself. He analysed the list of those in one O.C.T.U. which was supposed to be "rather the thing" and he found that the majority of the men who had passed out had not come from the great public schools. Those schools had their share, and we want them to have their share, because I am not going in for class distinctions and shall not say that

Borstal shall not compete with Eton, because there is no reason why it should not. It was found that secondary school boys came out of that O.C.T.U. with greater distinction than the boys from some of our great public schools. Personally, I should like the whole lot to come out with distinction, and I draw no distinction between the secondary school and what is known as the public school. Finally, I would say that I hope that when the Financial Secretary to the War Office or his secretary looks at my speech in the OFFICIAL REPORT to-morrow some of the questions I have raised which are of vital interest to officers and men will be dealt with sympathetically, looking forward and not looking backward.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the question of air co-operation. It has been acknowledged that air co-operation in the Army has not been, shall we say, as satisfactory as it ought to have been, and I do hope that this matter will engage the very earnest attention of the War Office and, incidentally, of the War Cabinet, because to send troops on any modern expedition without the proper proportion of air support is just as absurd as it would be to send troops without their due proportion of artillery. It is an undoubted fact that again and again in recent operations the failure of those operations has been put down to the lack of air support and air co-operation. The last thing I want to do is to engage in any controversy, and this question has been side-tracked by controversy over the question of the dismemberment of the Air Force. I do not wish to advocate dismemberment of the Air Force, but I do want to advocate that every military formation should have its due proportion of Air Force allotted to it for such operations as it may have to undertake. For great, premeditated operations it may be necessary to have more than the ordinary proportion, exactly in the same way as more, and considerably more, than the ordinary divisional allotment of artillery is allotted, and always has been allotted, to troops about to take part in great operations.<br/>
I should like to see exactly the same principle in the allotment of Air Force. If it is a matter of command, then there can be no doubt that any Air Force allotted to work with the Army must necessarily be commanded by an Air


Force officer, in precisely the same way as the artillery of a division, a corps or an army is commanded by an artillery officer, for technical reasons. But I do suggest, indeed, I go further and say it is essential, that in any great military operation the military commander must be the commander-in-chief, and that such Air Force as is allotted to him for the purpose of the operations he is undertaking must be under his command and at his disposal.<br/>
A very unfortunate state of affairs prevailed in the Middle East last year. The Air Force was under the command of an officer of equal rank with the military and naval commanders-in-chief, and it rested with him to allot his admittedly inadequate force to various theatres. He had calls from Libya, Abyssinia, Iraq and the Fleet, and subsequently from Greece, Crete and Syria. The result of his most unenviable task in trying to make a satisfactory allotment was that we were left strong in no single theatre. There should be a definite and normal proportion of Air Force allotted to work with military formations, and the allotment should be supplemented as necessary, no doubt at the discretion of the air officer commanding. The commander of the military forces must have all his forces, including the Air Force, at his disposal, for any operations which he may have to undertake.<br/>
The selection and testing of candidates for commissions is admittedly very difficult. Some hon. Members seem to jump to the conclusion that it was comparatively simple during the last war, because the men had been tested in the field, so to speak. I had considerable experience in selecting candidates and recommending them for commissions during the last war, and I can assure the House that it was not a simple matter. It was very much the reverse. The qualifications are, and always should be, very simple; they consist of a due proportion of education and strength of character. It is impossible for a man without education to acquire the technical knowledge which every officer should possess, and with strength of character should go power of command. It is easy to say those things, but it is not always easy to judge, and the inclination of anybody who has to make recommendations for commissions is obviously to take the best educated

candidates. Sometimes, however, education does not go far enough. I have known persons of great educational attainments who had not the necessary strength of character to enable them to command men, which is the principal duty of an officer. On the other hand, one has known candidates with strength of character, possibly to a very considerable degree, without the education, and sometimes without the intelligence, to enable them to learn and to carry out the multifarious duties of an officer in the field.<br/>
I remember that divisional commanders were faced with a great shortage of officers at one time during the last war. There had been heavy casualties, but we were told to produce 12 candidates every month for commissions. Several of my brother divisional commanders and myself went to the Army Commander and told him that we would send the very best 12 candidates we could find, "but," we added, "we can tell you beforehand that 8 out of the 12 will probably not make good officers," and that was a fact. It was very difficult to find officers. I do not think that the difficulty is nearly so great in the present conflict, because, for one thing, we have not made the fatal mistake that was made in the last war of getting an enormous quantity of our potential officer material killed as private soldiers&#x2014;inadequately trained private soldiers&#x2014;very early in the war. This time we have the material in very considerable quantities, but still selection is difficult, and much must depend on those officers who have to make the recommendations, and particularly on those commanding cadet units whose business it is not only to instruct potential officers but to watch them carefully, draw out their characteristics, good, bad and indifferent, and make the final recommendations as to who should receive commissions.<br/>
In peace-time we had a system of promotion from the ranks, and it was not a badly-thought-out system at all, but it was difficult because there was a tendency among commanding officers to choose young men of good character and the best education. A certain amount of difficulty was caused by the fact that officers were told that they must send in names. No doubt that was a very good precaution in order to ensure that people


who deserved promotion from the ranks were not merely glossed over. Very often the only way of testing was to find out a candidate's education, and naturally commanding officers took those who had first-class certificates of education, and good characters. The result was what I heard a distinguished officer allude to as a number of blameless clerks sent forward for commissions, and they were not always a success. They had got past on account of their military character, and incidentally by their education, but their power of leadership had not been tested. The best educated young men were apt to be put in the quartermaster's stores or some position where their educational attainments would have full play, and they were never tested to show whether they could command a section in the field or a corporal's guard. One cannot lay down hard-and-fast rules about the matter, but one should keep in mind two things of most importance; one is knowledge, which must be based on education, and the other is strength of character, which alone can give influence and power of command over other men, such as every officer ought to have. If we keep those points in mind, we shall not go far wrong.<br/>
The cadet unit is an immense advance as compared with the last war. In the last war it was only introduced in the last year or year and a half, and it at once produced a difference in the standard of the officers who were receiving commissions at that time. I cannot help thinking that if it is properly run now, and if there is a real test of these officers when they pass out of the cadet school, we ought not to go very far wrong, even though the system has not as yet been tested to any great extent in the field.<br/>
I would like next to refer to the question of discipline. I do so because there has been a great tendency, both in some of the newspapers and in this House, to decry the value of discipline as such and the value of what might be called the outward signs of discipline, which are smartness, saluting, general self-respect, appearance and so forth. One Member in the war debate, I think it was the hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths), said that our system of training was wrong and o went on to say that there was too much drill, discipline, saluting, physical training and spit and polish, if I remember

aright. Discipline is still all-important, and good discipline gives a commander control over those under him, control which he must have for efficiency, and it gives the man a habit of instinctive obedience and of self-control, which is very important. The ideal, I would say, is the disciplined soldier with his body trained to make him fit for hard work and his mind trained so as to be receptive of the instructions which he has to receive and assimilate.<br/>
The outward signs of discipline are of very great importance, and human nature has a good deal to do with that. What are the outward signs of discipline? First of all, saluting. Undoubtedly saluting is the outward sign of the respect which a soldier ought to feel for his superiors in the Service. It is incidentally a matter of courtesy, and courtesy is not a small thing, either in the Service or elsewhere. Besides that, there is the manner in which a soldier addresses his superiors, and by his superiors I do not mean only officers, I mean also warrant officers and non-commissioned officers. They have to be addressed with respect, and I would say that if a man does not have to show respect, he is very apt not to feel it; it is very bad for him if he does not feel it, and there is something wrong with the discipline. Then there are the outward signs connected with the man himself. If he is smart, alert, active and self-respecting, he has at any rate all the outward signs of a good soldier, and I am afraid that all too often in these days, so far as the outward signs are concerned, they are apt to be absent, or at any rate not very conspicuous. On the other hand, there is a very great relationship between what a man looks like and what he feels like.</p>

<p>I was about to refer to that very matter myself, and I will do so in a moment. If I may just elaborate the the argument I was making, it is that if a man looks down-at-heel and rather like a tramp, he is very apt to feel down-at-heel and like a tramp, which is a very bad


way for a soldier to feel. On the other hand, if he looks as if he has taken some trouble&#x2014;and indeed must have taken some trouble&#x2014;to make himself smart, alert and self-respecting, then he is apt to feel that way, and that is the way a soldier should feel if he is a really trained and reliable man.<br/>
I was about to refer to the point made by my hon. and gallant Friend about battle dress. It is rather hard on the Army to be put permanently into battle dress, because it is very difficult to look smart in it. One has even heard it said, I am sure unthinkingly, how very much smarter airmen look than soldiers when you see them in the streets. I think there is a good deal in it. The airman's dress is nearly the same, although of a different colour, but I personally think that it is a dress in which it is possible to look smart. It is very hard indeed to look smart in battle dress. I know the difficulty of producing&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member is not quite right in saying that this is a general Debate. It is a Debate on the particular Votes which are under consideration, the number of men, personnel and pay. It is a little difficult sometimes to decide what questions are or are not in Order, but generally speaking it is right to say that we cannot discuss on this Vote matters which come under another special Vote. Now there is a special Vote with regard to clothing, but I think the Vote on personnel does allow a certain amount of discussion as to the way in which the soldier is clothed, from the point of view of its effect generally upon his morale. I think that is about the best explanation I can give of the position. As to what is permissible, I think the hon. Member will permit me, if I hear him going beyond what is in Order, to stop him.</p>

<p>I did not intend to pursue the matter much further except to say that whether it is battle dress or any other dress, it is necessary to preserve the morale of the soldier as far as possible. I would only say one more word about appearances and particularly what is sometimes known as spit and polish. I do not think there is any hon. and gallant Member in the Navy present in the House at this moment, but if there were, I would ask him&#x2014;and I do ask&#x2014;whether anybody in that Service has ever heard of a dirty ship which was a good ship? Perhaps one might almost say that one has never heard of a dirty ship at all, but if such a thing did exist, would anybody say it was a good ship, or that any man in it who was a dirty man was a good man? If people ask, either outside this House, or Members inside, whether there is any example of really efficient troops who do very much go in for appearance and smartness, I would ask them whether they think that the Brigade of Guards is a good example of efficient troops. [An HON. MEMBER: "What about the Australians?"] The Brigade of Guards are, I believe, about the best troops in the world, and they are certainly not troops who disregard discipline, either real discipline or the outward appearances of discipline. I would go further, and say that there are troops in the world, and there are men in the world, who are absolutely first-rate fighting men by nature, but there is not one single one of such men and no body of such troops


who would not be better if they were thoroughly and strictly disciplined.<br/>
Lastly, I would say that the real test of discipline, the thing which makes the difference between really good, strict discipline and the reverse, is when things are going wrong, when things are difficult and dangerous, and when orders which have to be obeyed are disagreeable, difficult and dangerous to obey. That is a big test as to whether the officers have that power of command which enables them to take hold of weary, reluctant, perhaps even, I would say, half-beaten men and make them stand up to what they have got to do&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>]&#x2014;It has nevertheless got to be done if we are to be successful. No one who saw the retreat from Mons, which was not at all a pretty sight, or the retreat at the time of the German March offensive in 1918, would have had any difficulty whatever in picking out who were the well disciplined units and who were not.<br/>
I will say no more about discipline, but I would like to refer for a moment to the question of the introduction of a new rifle and bayonet. I see that a new rifle and bayonet is being introduced. I do not doubt it is an improvement on the old one.</p>

<p>As I am in Order, I would like to say something very briefly about pay and allowances. I believe that the pay and allowances of the single unmarried private soldier are perfectly adequate, not to allow him to live in luxury, not to allow him to have every amusement he wants, but to be perfectly comfortable in his unit and to get his small requirements for his reasonable entertainment. I believe from some experience, and from what I have been told by serving officers, that except in exceptional circumstances the pay and allowances for a single private soldier are adequate. It is a different matter when

we come to the question of the soldier's relatives. There, to my mind, is the whole difficulty and secret of this matter. I believe that if the soldier can feel that his dependants, his wife and his family, have enough to live in reasonable comfort, he will not bother so long as he has enough for his small personal expenses in his own pocket.</p>

<p>What I was coming to is this, that in my experience the pay of the non-commissioned officer ought to be increased. The non-commissioned officer has responsible duties, and if he is a good non-commissioned officer, he is very cheap at the price at which the Government get him. This applies in war-time; it would apply perhaps even more in peace-time, because the non-commissioned officer, the really good man, was tempted away from the Army when the Army had very great need of him, to go, for instance, to the police or to some other more remunerative job where his abilities could have full scope.<br/>
One point I should like to mention is about acting and lance ranks. In wartime, with the swollen establishments, and a very large number of posts, which are very conspicuous in London, for example, under the command of non-commissioned officers, many men, either lance-corporals or corporals, have to be given the acting or lance rank of sergeant or, in certain cases, of corporal, in order to take charge of these various posts and to take charge of those various duties for which noncommissioned officers are essential. Only the number on the establishment can draw pay for these lance ranks. I am perfectly


aware of the difficulty which is caused by the question of establishments, on which the Treasury has a great deal to say, but I do ask that this matter be looked at with a more lenient eye. I would agree that there must be a limit somewhere, that there cannot be unlimited lance ranks, but I think that the present limit is inadequate and that discretion might very well be given to officers not below, say, the status of a brigade commander, to decide on the number of extra acting and lance ranks which might reasonably be allowed to draw the pay of those ranks.</p>

<p>I intend, if I may, to take the risk which you, Sir, permitted the House, a few minutes ago, and to ask two very short questions in regard to the Home Guard. I notice that the Estimate refers to the numbers of the Army, and as the Home Guard is now recognised as part of the Regular Army, I am taking advantage of your permission. I only wish to ask two particular questions which I hope my hon. Friend will be able to answer to-day. They are questions which very gravely affect the capacity and the morale of the Home Guard. One is the question of compulsion. As the House will recall, the late Under-Secretary announced some months ago that compulsion would be introduced and made generally applicable throughout the country. Unfortunately, although generally applicable, it is not generally applied. Therefore, a number of anomalies exist, which are disturbing and annoying and contrary to the best interests of the Home Guard. In the country districts, you will find that in one parish compulsion is imposed and in the next it is not, because it happens to be in a different command. I take it that the General Officer Commanding has the responsibility for introducing compulsion in his command. From all sections of the Home Guard come constant demands that compulsion shall be generally applied. It is felt unfair to continue to increase the burden on the willing horses. For over a year and a half these very willing horses have been bearing the burden of guards and picquets, and sometimes fatigues, uncomplainingly, and generously giving their short spare time for what they regard as an essential public duty. If compulsion is generally applied those fellows will be given a little more time, and they will

feel that all the lazy or unwilling people&#x2014;and there are still some in this country&#x2014;are bearing their share.<br/>
There is another point, which is really in the same category, because it affects the numbers and efficiency of the Home Guard. That is the question of travelling allowances for men coming from their homes for operational instruction, Home Guard exercises, or instructional parades. Throughout this country, especially in the large cities and urban districts, there are a number of men employed in factories and offices at some distance from their homes. Sunday is the one day of the week on which the Home Guard can be really mobilised, on which instructional parades, and certainly exercises upon any scale, can be held. Members of the Home Guard want to attend these parades; they want to make themselves more efficient, but they have to pay their expenses themselves. That is not fair. It hampers these men in their desire to make themselves more efficient. I know that the subject is under consideration, and that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the War Office will do all that he can to make the Treasury realise that it is right to pay these expenses, in the interests of the Home Guard&#x2014;and, therefore, in the interests of the country, for we may have to depend upon the Home Guard. The Home Guard is the cheapest force that there has ever been in this country, and no stone should be left unturned in the effort to make it efficient. Those are the only two points I have to raise.

<p>I think all hon. Members will find themselves in complete agreement with the views of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Petersfield (Sir G. Jeffreys) on the question of Army discipline. I doubt whether any Member of this House has a greater claim to speak on Army discipline. I think it is the experience of Members who have served during the current war that battle dress does not help in that very difficult problem; but we have to weigh in the balance certain fundamental considerations. Is battle dress satisfactory when it comes to campaigning? That is the only acid test to apply at present. At the same time,


the War Office can help by not discouraging those little regimental idiosyncracies, and by incorporating them in the uniform when they can, in order to give that distinction which means so much in <i>esprit de corps.</i> In other days the soldier used to take an instinctive pride in being able to recognise at a glance the regiment of another soldier, even in Service uniform, from the way his buttons were arranged, or from his regimental badge. This regimental spirit is being unnecessarily depressed, and that is not in the interests of morale or <i>esprit de corps.</i> In the early days of the war, the authorities decided that it was not desirable that our troops engaged in certain fields of war should be identified by having their units named. In the <i>communiqu&#x00E9;s</i> there was no mention of the regiment, the formation, or the arm of the Service, to which particular troops belonged. But in the old days, we found that when it was stated that one regiment had distinguished itself or that another regiment had had a very sticky time, it created an intense public interest in the welfare of individual regiments, which permeated down through the commands to the regiments, and gave the soldier that feeling of regimental pride which is so vital for morale and discipline. Everything that the War Office can do, within practical limits, to stimulate that spirit will be to the good.</p>

<p>Exactly. I rose mainly because I was interested in the speech of the hon. Member for East Hull (Mr. Muff), who spoke about Army welfare. I am not satisfied that all is right with Army welfare. I am not satisfied that the organisation which the War Office has set up is the best. I may be old-fashioned, but I share the view that the most important welfare officer is the junior regimental officer. Anything that tends to dispel from his mind the idea that the welfare of his men should not be his first consideration would be a most unfortunate thing for the Army. But there are many problems in civilian life, arising out of war emergency regulations, which are outside the scope of the regimental officer, because he is not informed of them. He has not the time, and in

many cases he has not the knowledge to give the right advice.<br/>
There are many legal questions which arise affecting the personal life of the soldier and the lives of his relatives and his next of kin at home on which even his regimental commanding officer is not in a position to advise him with the knowledge and skill that he would like to employ. Therefore, that is where the Army welfare organisation, which has been set up since the war, should operate, and I am not satisfied that it operates quite as well as it should. If we start at the top, we find that there is a Director-General, with a staff at the War Office which is combined with the Army and education services and presided over by a Territorial Major-General. On his staff there are certain deputy-directors and other staff officers, who, I assume, are adequate for the problem with which they have to deal. They are paid staff officers on the establishment of the War Office and receive pay and allowances as any other staff officers would do in any other military formation, but when we leave the directing head and come down to the unit and the individual, that organisation ceases to be of a paid Army character.<br/>
Each static command in the United Kingdom has a commanding welfare officer carrying the rank of acting-Colonel (unpaid). He is assisted by a deputy-director carrying the rank of acting-Lieut.-Colonel (unpaid), with a limited established staff, also unpaid, to carry out the work which comes to him through the regiment, the brigade and the division to the command headquarters. I well remember a short time ago, when two static commands were divided in the country&#x2014;and my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the War Office will appreciate the commands to which I refer&#x2014;it was necessary to set up an entirely new command establishment welfare organisation, and the general officer commanding-in-chief of the command concerned selected his man, who happened to be a very distinguished Regular Army retired major-general, who had recently retired from active command, to set up this organisation. I was privileged to have a conversation with him shortly after he was given the new appointment. He had to set up an organisation without adequate finance, without adequate staff, and without travelling facilities to reach the formations for which he was to be responsible,


and he had an entirely inadequate organisation with which to deal properly with the problem. It was pointed out to me that it was necessary for him to have a deputy-director to spend the whole of his time in office organisation and to set up the organisation at the start. He would probably have to come from his ordinary place of residence and take up residence in a strange town where accommodation might be difficult and expensive to find, and have to set up an organisation entirely on a voluntary basis. This man was working 10, 12 and 16 hours a day without any pay at all. He was not to be given the facilities that were absolutely necessary to enable him to discharge his duties with efficiency. He was going to try and recruit from various sources other voluntary helpers to advise him on the legal problems to which I recently referred, such as housing questions and problems of allowances paid under this Regulation or that Regulation.<br/>
If the Army consider that it is necessary to have a welfare organisation in a static command in this country, they should admit that it is right and proper to have an efficient organisation, properly paid and administered, and acting under direct Army orders of the general officer commanding-in-chief. That would enable him to use the normal channels of Army communication through the division and the brigade down to the unit, and, if necessary, up to the War Office. He cannot use the normal military channels and he has not an adequate staff with which to deal with the matter. I do not think that it is fair to quote in this instance the question of the London district, which has been very fortunate in its organisation and its Director. It started in the very early days, and the officer who presides over that organisation in London was fortunate in collecting a large amount of public funds, and, being situated in London, to have at his disposal a large number of part-time, well-disposed civilians, authorities in their own field, who were able to offer part of their time. But where command headquarters are situated out in the blue, in some out of the way country district where these things are impossible, it is not fair to say that, if you can do it in London, you ought to be able to do it in the north, east, south or west. The problems are not comparable, and I hope that my hon. and gallant Friend will look

into the matter to see whether it is possible to give the command welfare officers, who are doing their best to discharge their office, the opportunity of doing so on a financially sound and adequate administrative basis.<br/>
I come to the question of those officers of 45, who, as a result of the new Regulations, may be found to be unfitted to continue in their present commands. I do not want to touch upon the question of the Home Guard in any detail, but only wish to bring it in for a minute or two in relation to my general argument. If the Home Guard to-day is part of the Regular Army, and it is a real force upon which the authorities have decided to rely to a very large extent in the event of invasion of this country, there can be no half-way house, and everything we can do within the limits of our resources to-day to strengthen that military body should be done. There are many officers in the Regular Army to-day who for one reason or another may be unfitted to continue in their present command, and who, under the new Regulations, will be retired. Their services might well be utilised as group commanders or as zone commanders in the Home Guard. Nine out of ten of them have been serving continuously with the Regular Army since mobilisation. They may have been in the Regular Army, Reserve of Officers or the Territorial Army, Reserve of Officers, and, in any case, their experience is spread over a long period. Therefore, it would be opportune if the War Office found a way of utilising their services in these administrative posts to which I have alluded. But they should not be asked to do it on a voluntary basis. That would not be fair. A man is worthy of his hire to-day whether he is a soldier or civilian, and it is not right to expect a Regular officer to come into the Home Guard for the benefit of his health only irrespective of his financial obligations outside the service. I hope that this very valuable material will not be lost to the nation at a time when the Home Guard might be called upon in the near future to play a most important part in the defence of our own country and that the War Office will consider this suggestion.</p>

<p>I propose as briefly as possible to deal, as I believe I am entitled to do in this Debate, with four or five discon-


nected questions. My first point is that of the Home Guard. I am not in the Home Guard, but during the past few months I have had an opportunity of coming into personal contact with the Home Guard organisation in a rural part of Britain. I want to back up what was said by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore). The Home Guard will not even retain its present degree of efficiency unless compulsion is applied, because it is losing heart. I would like to speak of a small town, which I know intimately, of 3,000 inhabitants. The Home Guard company in that town numbers 160, and not more than 50 or 60 turn up at the ordinary parades. Members of the Home Guard who turn up tell me that they are losing heart because there are so many men in that town who ought to be playing a part in the war effort but who are in reserved occupations and salve their consciences by doing a certain amount of fire-watching or something like that. I do not think it is fair to expect the Home Guard to be keen or efficient while they see so many people getting off their proper obligations.<br/>
Then there is the question of weapons for the Home Guard. I think the provision of pikes for the Home Guard, if it was not meant to be a joke, was an insult. With our immense war production, potential and actual, to-day I cannot see why every member of the Home Guard should not have a perfectly good and modern rifle. However, I will leave this matter there, as I see from your menacing gesture, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, that I should be out of Order if I pursued it. In a body of irregular troops&#x2014;and I think I am right in calling the Home Guard irregular troops, because they were organised on that basis&#x2014;there is one factor of supreme importance, and it is that they should be masters of their weapons. In the Home Guard not enough attention has been paid to training in the proper use of the rifle and how to shoot straight. There has not been enough ammunition, and there has been a lack of range facilities. The possibilities inherent in that organisation are immense, but at present not enough advantage is being taken of them.<br/>
We are having great changes at the War Office, and I want to say to the Secretary of State and to the new Joint Under-Secre-

tary, who is here on the Front Bench, that if you study the history of war, either ancient or modern, victories are won by only two kinds of Armies. There is the old unthinking sort, the Army of Kipling, which we had to some extent in the last war, which does its duty and fights but is not encouraged to think too much about the political cause for which it is called upon to fight, and then there is the sort of Army which is imbued with the revolutionary spirit, the kind of Army which won the Battle of Valmy, the Army which conquered France for Germany and the Army which is conquering Germany in Russia&#x2014;a crusading Army. Is it not possible that in our proper concern for other aspects of military life&#x2014;education, welfare discussion groups, health and so on&#x2014;we have allowed our attention to be deflected and have fallen between two stools? I have heard many speeches about the Army in this House, but I have heard very little from any quarter about the need for fostering the fighting spirit. Only a little of this is being done in a limited way by one small branch of the Army. It should be possible to set up in this country special training centres, ten or a dozen if you like, where junior officers and senior N.C.O.'s can be trained in initiative, can be hardened and trained in irregular warfare. I have seen it done in a small way; the results are magnificent, but they should be multiplied ten or twelve-fold. After all, the whole country and indeed all civilisation depend on whether we can make the Army fight hard enough to win the war.<br/>
As at present trained in this country the Army&#x2014;and I say this categorically&#x2014;is deficient in initiative in every rank. In the junior ranks not enough attention is paid to training in initiation, and the middle and senior ranks are overwhelmed with administrative duties. Take the relatively simple question of a court of inquiry into some loss of stores or a simple accident&#x2014;how many hands has it to go through? How many people have to see the papers, counter-sign them and deal with them? How much money can a battalion commander write off? He is the man you trust with the lives of hundreds of men, yet you hardly trust him with a few pounds. You appear to think that he is either a crook or is incompetent, yet you put perfect trust in him when he is dealing with men's lives. The whole thing is ludicrous. Staff officers breed staff


officers; paper breeds paper, and it is breeding at a terrific rate. While you have initiative and fighting spirit put into second place and questions of administration put into first place, and divisional or corps staffs concerned mainly with administrative detail instead of with fighting, it will be some time before our Army can win the war.<br/>
Thirdly, I do not think anybody who knows the true situation in the Army is content with the present degree of air cooperation, but I will leave this point at that. There is another matter, which is not of minor importance, and that is the attention which is officially focused on all troops, except English troops. Serious harm is being done all over the world by the implication that England is letting Scottish, Welsh, Irish and Empire troops do the fighting for her and that England is not doing her proper share. That also applies to some extent to the use of the word "British." We direct so much publicity and attention to Empire troops that what I think is a fact is forgotten&#x2014;that British divisions come out of this war better than any other. I do not know if English or Scottish troops are better in battle, and if I did, I would not say so, because it would create enmity between two groups of people who stand or fall together and who are the best of friends. I think it is a mistake to let America think England is letting other people do the fighting for her, for it is not true.<br/>
I would like to refer to the question of men who are missing or who have been taken prisoner. I do not know if the House is aware of it, but it often happens that the wife of a man who is declared to be missing suffers a reduction of income because of that declaration. That, I think, is wrong. Take the case of the wife of a private soldier who is making an allotment from his pay. Suppose he is in a particularly difficult financial position and is receiving a War Service Grant. Seventeen weeks after he is declared to be missing it is assumed that the allotment from his pay has ceased; it automatically happens that the War Service Grant is cut off, and the woman is paid a continuing allowance, which, theoretically, is the amount she would receive as a pension if and when her husband is declared to be killed. It is an anomaly, although I know there is a lot to be said on the other

side, that because a man is missing his wife should suffer a heavy reduction in income when her same obligations continue to exist. These War Service Grants are usually to help to meet obligations towards some building society or something like that obligation which continue. All this may appear to be small thing, but I should be grateful if those responsible would cause inquiries to be made. With regard to prisoners of war, a series of unfortunate answers&#x2014;I say "unfortunate" deliberately&#x2014;which my hon. Friend gave in the House seemed to stress the fact that the War Office placed the primary responsibility for the welfare of prisoners of war upon an outside and voluntary society.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that flat contradiction. I am not making any personal attack on my hon. Friend; I simply want it to be made clear that the War Office accept full and complete responsibility for the welfare of British Prisoners of War. They may devolve some of the actual administrative duties concerning that welfare to the Red Cross, but the responsibility starts, and remains, with the War Office, and it is no good the War Office saying that the Red Cross is a voluntary society and that they can have nothing to do with, for example, arrangements concerning Mr. Adams, and at the same time saying that they, and not the Red Cross, are primarily responsible for the welfare of prisoners of war. If I have misrepresented my hon. Friend&#x2014;and I hope it is a misrepresentation&#x2014;then I think the War Office ought to make it known as widely as possible that they do not attempt to devolve any of their primary responsibility towards these unfortunate men. I apologise for my disconnected remarks dealing with various subjects, but I hope I have kept my promise to be brief.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Member for Petersfield (Sir G. Jeffreys) told the story of a lad who joined the Forces and refused an allowance from his father because he was so wealthy in the Forces. Last Monday night I spoke at a meeting in Nottingham, and after the meeting I was approached by a group of soldiers. The


spokesman for them was a Welshman from Tonypandy, and he said, "Tell the Prime Minister we want proper pay, we want the abolition of the means test for our dependants, and we want something to do." If the soldiers had something to do, the question of battle dress would not arise. The hon. Member for East Hull (Mr. Muff) said that every subordinate officer ought to get a copy of "Current Events," and that he ought to get his men together, and give them the contents of "Current Events." The hon. and gallant Member for Farnham (Captain Nicholson) said that we need an Army with a revolutionary spirit. Therefore, I suggest that, instead of supplying "Current Events," it would be a very good thing if the Ministry were to supply every subordinate with a copy of the Communist manifesto, and if every subordinate made known those contents to his troops.</p>

<p>I do not want to contradict the hon. Member, but that is not quite what I said. I should be thankful if the Army had the revolutionary spirit or any other spirit as long as it was a fighting spirit. I said that the trouble is that we have not got the old-fashioned spirit or the modern revolutionary spirit, and that we fall between two stools.</p>

<p>I think it would be found that many of the lads in the Army already have a fair understanding of the contents of the Communist manifesto. I listened with attention to the remarks of the hon. and gallant Member for Petersfield, and as I listened I got the feeling that he had learned nothing and forgotten nothing of all that has happened during the past few years. He talked about officers being capable of commanding, he talked about discipline, as though these were the things that mattered. Sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish between commanding and brutal bullying. The lesson that has been taught us during the past two years is that we want, not commanders, but leaders in whom the men have the most complete confidence. It is not so much discipline as initiative that is wanted amongst the rank and file. I am certain that the hon. and gallant Member has not understood that. It is not a question of marching great masses of men to be butchered. Nowadays, along with the massed forces,

there has to be associated in the Army all kinds of groups, not only guerrillas, but motorised groups, cycle groups, patrol groups of every kind, all of them showing individual initiative. This initiative is needed not only on the part of certain officers who are in command, but in the men, who must be capable of taking individual initiative on every part of the front. Consider the lessons from the Pacific. What happened with the Japanese? Was it a case of marching up masses of men? No, it was a case of groups penetrating here and there, and of every kind of initiative being shown. The idea of the past, the dead idea, of marching out masses of men and forming squares to deal with thousands of unarmed natives&#x2014;that was the idea in the Zulu War. That is what the hon. and gallant Member was thinking about&#x2014;the Zulu War.</p>

<p>I was not thinking of anything of the kind. I wonder whether the hon. Member is thinking of anything at all, and whether he has ever taken part in any kind of operations in any war.</p>

<p>I have not taken part in any operations in war, but I have taken as much part in modern warlike operations as has the hon. and gallant Member. I suggest that the hon. and gallant Member and all officers of the Army ought to go to the Tatler Cinema and see the film "Suvarov." Here was a field-marshal who was dismissed because he refused to treat the men as automatons, because he refused to concern himself very much with such things as battle dress, and so on; he dressed as a private and 'went about the field of battle among his men, without his coat on, and in his shirt sleeves. Matters of dress are not of great concern. If the men are properly treated, if they have confidence in and are inspired by their leaders, and if they have something to do that is worth doing, they will not be very much concerned about dress. Why, I am told by some of my colleagues that in Scotland, in a snowstorm, a group of men had to polish their boots, polish their buttons, polish everything, and turn out for a special parade to meet a new padre. That is not the sort of thing that encourages the men.<br/>
Take the Russian Army. The Russian Army has discipline, but when the men


are off duty, there is not that stiff and superior attitude on the part of the officers towards the privates, and the privates do not salute at every step they take. The officers and men mix together, they go about the streets together, they go to caf&#x00E9;s together, they play games together, and associate in the same clubs. Can hon. Members imagine, in this so-called democratic Army, a private soldier coming down the Strand and meeting the hon. and gallant Member for Petersfield, in the full military uniform of a brigadier-general, and saying, "Hallo, Johnny, how are you? Going in for a glass of beer?" Can hon. Members imagine that? No. Why not? Cannot hon. Members understand that the old world is gone for ever, that an entirely new situation confronts us, that an entirely new kind of Army is wanted, a new type of army in which every man counts?<br/>
On this Estimate we are discussing the number of men in the Army. There is something I want to tell the Secretary of State, the Financial Secretary, and the Under-Secretary, whom I am very pleased to see on the Front Bench opposite. I do not know whether I have ever said that about any other Member on that Front Bench. I hope it will not count against the Under-Secretary. I do not know how many men there are in the Army, but there are two short, ex-Lance-Corporal Willis and ex-Corporal Mick Bennett. These two men showed the greatest possible qualities in the Army, and their commanders have discharged them with the highest possible characters. The predecessor of the present Secretary of State for War refused to give any reason why they were put out of the Army. Why were they put out of the Army? It was because they were young Communists. There are thousands of our party comrades in the Army, but these two were well known. One of them, ex-Lance-Corporal Willis, spoke a few words at what is known as the People's Convention. The general Press kept his name out of the papers, but a gentleman of the name of Hannen Swaffer was kind enough to reveal who he was in one of his articles. Had he been reprimanded, he could have understood it, but months afterwards he was discharged. Mick Bennett, who never committed an offence of any kind, was also given a high

character by his commanding officer. These lads were anxious to give their best services in the Army.<br/>
I have written to the new Secretary of State on the matter, asking him to take it up and put an end to this sort of thing. You can never hope to build up an Army or win a war where anything of this character is going on. I remember an earlier Secretary of State for War, who was recently in the East, asking me why I was so concerned about these young lads and young Communists being in the Army. He pointed out that any supporters of Capitalism in Russia would be put out of the Army. In the Soviet Union the Army is for the defence of the workers and the peasants and for the defence of the Soviet people. Is any Member on the other side of the House, or the Secretary of State for War, prepared to get up and say that the Army in this country exists for the defence of the capitalist class? If anyone says that it does, I agree there should be no young Communists in it. But, if you claim the Army exists for the defence of the country and the people, then there can be no political discrimination against young Communists.<br/>
I want to join with those who are dissatisfied about the situation in the Home Guard. I have been approached in this connection by my constituents, and I have attended various meetings of the Home Guard in Fife. I received a letter the other day, and I will read part of it to the House. It comes from a lad in the Home Guard. He is a very keen member. As has been said, the Home Guard may become vital for the defence of this country at any moment, and we do not want the casts-off from the Army as a result of the review of officers over the age of 45 put in the Home Guard. We want to use the initiative and leadership of the masses who are in the Home Guard. This lad states that the Home Guard in this area should be doubled in strength. He says:
<q>Nothing has been decided and no information can be obtained from battalion or zone headquarters. All that has happened is that volunteers have been turned into conscripts.</q>
He points out that the position is much about the same in the whole county, which is so much under strength as to be unequal to the task of putting up an effective defence against invasion.
<q>The Ides of March draw near, but decisions are delayed and the man-power which


is available to bring up the strength of the Home Guard so as to make it really effective is untouched. Will you please ask the Secretary of State for War why these decisions which are so obvious and could be made by the ordinary intelligent man in a day take the military experts months?</q>
That applies not only to the War Office but to other Departments as well. I said in the course of my remarks on the Navy Estimates that a Commando landing should be made in Whitehall to clean out all the Departments. They should clean the whole crowd out and get more energetic and active people in the Departments. I have had some experience of this. I raised a question with the Home Office, and the Home Office referred it to Scotland Yard. Scotland Yard referred the matter to the chief constable in the area affected and the chief constable referred it back to the Home Office. It is the same thing with these lads in the Home Guard, and they feel a sense of frustration because decisions are not made. This lad goes on to say:
<q>Would you please ask Captain Margesson or his-successor</q>
&#x2014;fortunately it is his successor&#x2014;
<q>who is responsible for the issue of pikes to the Home Guard, and when may we expect the bows and arrows and slings?</q>
You are not going to encourage the lads if you talk about the Home Guard having to meet the onslaught of an invading army with pikes. It is necessary for the War Office to take a decision and get the Home Guard up to strength, and to see that everything possible is done to ensure the utmost confidence will be inspired in those who are participating in the Service. I suggest that the War Office should send a representative to Fife to have a consultation with the four Fife Members and representatives of the Home Guard to consider what can be done to bring the Home Guard up to strength and to inspire confidence among its members. In conclusion I ask in all earnestness that the Secretary of State for War takes up the question of the restoration of ex-Corporal Willis and ex-Corporal Mick Bennett in the Army.</p>

<p>I should like strongly to support what was said by the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore) in support of compulsion for the Home Guard. It is quite certain to my mind if we continue with this idea that only in certain areas are you to have compulsion, all keenness

will disappear from that organisation. As far as I can see, it is impossible to say one zone is a danger area and another zone is not. It savours much too much of the business of having all your guns facing outwards round the coast. In one small town that I know, in what seems to me to be a very vital area, they started with a Home Guard of 80. Owing to calling up it has now gone down to 40, and they feel very strongly locally that there are a great many young men who might be doing better things, but who are now only doing tire-watching and that sort of thing. After all, the Home Guard has to be on duty for at least 48 hours a month. In the town to which I refer it is more than 10 weeks since they had an alert and the fire-watchers have needed to do nothing at all during that period. In country districts, some of which are not supposed to be dangerous areas, unless the Government develop compulsion you will lose a grand and vital spirit.<br/>
In the second place, may I suggest that in the reorganisation of the Army which is coming the Government should seriously consider whether there is not some method of giving better opportunities to men in the ranks, or junior officers, to get ideas considered. A man may have an idea for improving the efficiency of the Army&#x2014;it is chiefly the people who are doing the job who get those ideas. He submits it to his platoon commander, who, if he is not too busy with all the papers about which we have heard, reluctantly sends it on to the company commander. It goes all the way up, and probably before any action is taken the circumstances have changed. I should have thought it was possible to develop a machinery whereby any man, whatever his rank, could make a suggestion without any fear that a superior officer would resent it. Cannot the Government consider some more efficient procedure?<br/>
I agree very much with what has been said about the terrible amount of administrative paper. Although I have not the honour to be in uniform I have heard a great deal about it. There are a great many papers which could be signed by non-commissioned officers but you have to hunt about for a commissioned officer, and he often signs it without the faintest idea of what it is about. A battalion commander has a considerable number of


men under his command but has no secretary to help him. You could not imagine similar conditions in business.</p>

<p>An adjutant has a great many other things to do. Looking after 1,000 men is a very big job. The hon. and gallant Member for Farnham (Captain Nicholson) referred to Commandos. I find among men in the Army a growing feeling that unless we are very careful we shall develop the belief that the Commandos have all the dirty and risky things to do.</p>

<p>I understood the hon. and gallant Member was referring to them. I withdraw my reference to his speech. But I believe that unless we are careful we shall develop a belief that only in certain regiments is there any fighting to be done. When we send abroad such small expeditions as we recently sent to France&#x2014;to the great joy of most people&#x2014;we should as much as possible attach men from other regiments so that they can get trained in these ideas of carrying out defence by attack.<br/>
I should like to make a suggestion regarding cadets. You have the three Service Departments all training young cadets, and they are doing very good work indeed but, as I understand it, the War Office, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry are all competing for these young future recruits. Would it not be advisable to have one national service for these cadets, and that they should all wear the same uniform? It must surely be very wasteful to dress some in blue, some in khaki and so on. They should grow up in one service and later be transferred to the particular service for which they seem most apt. If you did that you would develop in the fighting services the spirit of co-operation between the three Departments which is so necessary. I find, especially in country districts, the feeling that it would do these boys a great deal of good if they received a general military training and were later transferred to the job for which

they showed themselves most useful and apt.</p>

<p>I intervene because I was interested in the observations of the hon. and gallant Member for Petersfield (Sir G. Jeffreys) dealing with discipline. I should never hope to enter on equal terms into a discussion with one who has such a distinguished record as the hon. and gallant Member, but I am rather inclined to think that he over-emphasised the gentility and the appearance of the average private soldier. I agree that there should be discipline and mutual respect between those serving in different ranks. But I am not inclined to agree that the fighting qualities of the soldier are determined by the uniform he wears. I know of no better fighting soldiers than the Colonials, who have not a very high regard for what are considered the ordinary decencies of discipline in our Forces at home, namely saluting and taking part in all kinds of flummery.<br/>
One part of the hon. and gallant Member's remarks which made a peculiar appeal to me referred to the question of promotion from the ranks. He was quite correct in saying that the commanding officers had difficulties in selecting those who had a good sound education and recommending them for commissions. The implication of his remarks was that such a recommendation could not go forward unless the man had the necessary educational background. The point that I want to raise is what is to happen to discipline where those in the ranks are educationally and intellectually superior to the commandant and have imposed on them insolence instead of discipline. I raised the point in connection with discipline in the women's service&#x2014;the A.T.S. I agree that an army without discipline becomes a mob. We must have discipline. There must be mutual respect. That mutual respect must run through all ranks of the Services. There is an obligation on those who hold the highest commands to have at least respect for those who are under their jurisdiction. The complaint I made here was that my fellow countrywomen were positively insulted, and that they were intellectually superior in many instances, and in no case inferior to the person who insulted them. When they tried to make themselves more efficient by seeking counsel and guidance where they


ought to have got it, they were told to shut up. When the complaint was made in this House, the Financial Secretary was vehement, and said: "Bob's your uncle. I believe what the commandant says and I do not believe one of the other officers."<br/>
This is not a question of a commandant speaking brusquely to a serving soldier, but of a commandant speaking to those who had given distinguished service in the organisation before the commandant had had anything to do with it. I agree whole-heartedly that if we are to have an Army marching as an Army, there must be discipline, but if there is no respect accompanying that discipline the Army, soner or later, will become just a howling mob. I ask the Financial Secretary whether he will, at least, let the A.T.S. officers in Scotland know that he takes the view that there is something to inquire into. Not into my conduct, however. I have got past the stage when I have any charms even for A.T.S. officers, although it was suggested that I had in some way made them the unwilling conveyors of this news. I do not think that I could have cast any spell on the ladies to make them give this information. I say, however, that at least 39 distinguished countrywomen of mine were insulted in their own capital city by a person who expressed the hope that she would never require to conic back to Scotland. If the hon. Gentleman can do nothing more, I hope he will see that she is not disappointed in that hope.<br/>
The hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) referred to the question of the soldier's appearance. I know a unit which last week-end had to parade to receive a new padre. They had to brush their boots, polish their buttons and so on&#x2014;what for? To meet the man who is supposed to be their spiritual guide.</p>

<p>I am not saying that it is intentional. I may not look it, but I am a religious man myself. I say, however, that at a time like this it is criminal

to waste time for such a parade. It is no outward sign of discipline to impose these things on the men. The sooner it is realised that the Army to-day is a democratic institution the better. There are boys in the Army whose parents never dreamed that they would be there and who, by their early upbringing, had an objection to militarism in every shape and form. They are in it now, not because they were compelled, but because they considered it to be their duty. If you want to break the morale and spirit of these fellows, then carry on, but the sooner we realise that the Army is a democratic Army and the sooner we get a return for the money we are spending, the sooner we will get that co-operation from all ranks which must end in ultimate victory.</p>

<p>I can hardly imagine any subject of greater interest to the enemy or more likely to provoke him to invade this country at an early date than the discussions which take place in Public Session on the deficiencies of the Home Guard.

<p>My hon. Friend will no doubt address that request to the Leader of the House in due course when Business is being discussed. We have had a wide Debate to-day, and I cannot hope to answer all the points that have been raised. If I am not able to deal with any of them, I assure hon. Members that they will receive from me some answer in the near future. There have been several speeches, particularly in the latter part of the Debate, which have touched on the questions of smartness, spit and polish, discipline and welfare. I agree with much that was said by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Farnham (Captain G. Nicholson). In considering what should be our policy in regard to these matters and what value should be attached to them, the only test that ultimately counts is the extent to which these and other factors contribute to the fighting spirit of the troops.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South Cardiff (Colonel A. Evans)


spoke about welfare officers and suggested that they should be put on a paid basis. The hon. Member for East Hull (Mr. Muff), on the other hand, complimented the welfare officers upon the fine unpaid work which they were doing. I do not propose now to go into the administrative questions which my hon. and gallant Friend raised. If he has had experience of any serious difficulties of this kind, perhaps he will communicate with me, and I will have the matter looked into. I should, however, like to take this opportunity to express to the welfare officers throughout the country the gratitude which the War Office feel for the untiring and extremely valuable work which they have been doing without receiving any remuneration and very often at great person sacrifice to themselves.</p>

<p>Before my hon. Friend leaves the question of welfare, with regard to the welfare organisation with our Armies abroad, the Director-General of Welfare has recently returned from an extended tour of our Middle East and Far East fronts, which presupposes that there are welfare organisations in being with the field commands and base headquarters there. Can the hon. Gentleman tell the House whether they are conducted on a voluntary basis or whether the officers employed on that duty are borne on the establishments of the commands?</p>

<p>I shall also be glad to discuss that question with my hon. and gallant Friend. There have been several speakers who have referred to the Commandos. My hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Lawson) asked about the tactics and training of Commandos. I can assure my hon. Friend, without going into details, that the organisation of the Commandos is as flexible and as adaptable as one could possibly desire. There are no hard and fast preconceptions as to tactics. My hon. Friend may be quite sure that the experience which has been obtained in the Far East of Japanese infiltration tactics and of Russian guerilla methods has been studied and that the lessons will be applied under suitable conditions. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Bartlett) said very rightly that we must not leave all the fighting to be

done by the Commandos. That principle is, of course, fully accepted. Training of the Commando variety is already being extended to other classes of units, and in the latest raids some of these other units have been included in the expeditions. For example, detachments of the South Wales Borderers and of the Royal Fusiliers took part in a recent raid. This development is proving most successful, and there is every intention of extending it further.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Farnham asked about division of responsibility between the War Office and the British Red Cross Society in relation to prisoners of war. I am glad to make the position clear, though I did not realise there was any misapprehension on the point. In regard to detailed Service questions, the individual Service Department is naturally responsible. On the other hand all general questions of policy concerning the welfare of prisoners of war, of all three Services, are the responsibility of the War Office. The War Office has entrusted to the British Red Cross Society the task of sending to prisoners of war parcels containing food, medical comforts and clothing, and also the task of despatching next-of-kin parcels. The War Office take full responsibility for having decided that the British Red Cross Society, with its international connections, was the best organisation to undertake this task. The War Office cannot on the other hand accept responsibility for the detailed day-to-day administration of the British Red Cross Society. The position is that if at any time we felt the British Red Cross Society was not discharging these duties to our satisfaction, it would be our responsibility to decide whether a change of arrangements was necessary. There is, however, no reason to suppose that anything is amiss, and the War Office is satisfied that these important functions entrusted to the Red Cross are being well and efficiently discharged.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for what he has said to clarity the position, but can he say whether the War Office keeps an eye upon the activities of the British Red Cross Society with a view to anticipating any breakdown which may occur, anticipating it some way ahead in time for steps to be taken to deal with it? For instance, if a breakdown were to take place two or three months hence and parcels ceased to reach our prisoners of war, would it come as an unpleasant surprise to the War Office, or are they in constant consultation with the British Red Cross Society to see that such a breakdown does not take place, because there are always apprehensions that such breakdowns may occur?</p>

<p>There is no question of a Departmental inquiry. The British Red Cross Society is not part of the War Office. A question was asked by the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street about a proposal, which was supported by the Beveridge Committee, to pool the mechanical engineering resources of the Army. In the Debates on the Army Estimates, I stated that a decision on this subject would not be very long

delayed. I am now able to announce that it has been decided to bring together the greater part of the Army's engineering maintenance services and form them into a new and separate corps. The new corps will be made up of three principal components; first, the entire engineering side of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps; secondly, the maintenance personnel of the Royal Army Service Corps, with the exception of formation workshop platoons and independent companies; thirdly, it will embrace a large part of the mechanical maintenance personnel of the Royal Engineers.<br/>
This far-reaching measure of reorganisation will entail not only extensive administrative changes, but also large-scale transfers of personnel. I must, therefore, warn hon. Members not to expect that this can all happen overnight. It is bound to take a certain amount of time, but there will be no avoidable delay.</p>

<p>I thought that the House would like to receive that information as early as possible. The question of further debate can if desired be considered later.

I think I told him recently in answer to a question that this matter was being sympathetically considered. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly. His other question was in regard to the use of the powers of compulsory enrolment for the Home Guard.

<p>I now have to inform the House that in certain parts of the country


where voluntary recruitment has been insufficient, it has become urgently necessary, on military grounds, to bring Home Guard units up to strength. It has accordingly been decided to bring into force the powers of compulsory enrolment in Civil Defence Regions Nos. 4, 6, 7 and 12. These regions correspond approximately to the areas embraced by the Eastern, South-Eastern, and Southern military commands.

<p>Areas which manage to keep their units up to strength without

the introduction of compulsion should be proud of the fact.<br/>
Perhaps the most important topic that has been raised in the course of the Debate is in regard to the recently announced review of officers. The rapid expansion of the Army at the outbreak of war gave rise to many difficult problems. None was perhaps more difficult than that of finding, and finding quickly, large numbers of reliable officers. Every available source was drawn upon. Officers were recalled from the retired list and from all the various classes of the Reserve. Many of these officers were no longer very young, nor were they perhaps as fit and active as they had been before. But they saw that the country wanted them. They answered the call, many of them at great personal sacrifice, and they have given of their very best. The nation, and, I am sure, this House, will always feel indebted to those men for the service which they rendered, at a time when it was greatly needed.<br/>
It is, however, inevitable that, after 2&#x00BD; years of war, a proportion of these older officers who are filling posts which are normally held by much younger men, should be beginning to show signs of strain. Under this scheme any officer who, for one reason or another, is no longer able to discharge his present duties with full efficiency will, if so recommended, be transferred to some other less exacting military appointment. If, in the last resort, no suitable alternative employment can be found for him, he will be released from the Army and will be free to take up civil employment. I would like to make it clear to the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street, in view of one or two remarks he made, that there is no question of applying any rule-of-thumb or any arbitrary age-limit to these officers. The only test will be that of suitability for the job which they hold. I was interested by a letter which I saw in the "Times" this morning from Field-Marshal Lord Birdwood on this subject. In this letter he writes:
<q>There exists among the older type of officer some apprehension whether the 'possibility of less exacting alternative employment' is, or may be, a mere form of words.</q>
I should like to take this opportunity of making it quite clear that this is not a mere form of words. Strenuous efforts will be made to find alternative military


employment for these officers. As part of this effort, a more intensive comb-out of younger men in sedentary staff jobs is to be undertaken. Nevertheless, there will be a certain number of officers who will have to return to civilian life. Accordingly the War Office and the Ministry of Labour are together doing everything possible to place those who are thus released in suitable jobs. The Ministry are setting up special machinery to deal with applications from officers who have been released under this scheme. In addition, the Regional Man-Power Boards have been asked to consider these officers for civilian appointments which are now held by younger men, who could then be released to join the Armed Forces. As a result of these arrangements I am hopeful that there will be very few of these officers who are released from the Army for whom useful employment cannot be found.</p>

<p>Will my hon. and gallant Friend remember the Home Guard in this matter? These are just the officers we want, men who have experience and knowledge, and who, while perhaps not quite young enough to carry on in the Regular Army, are absolutely first-class men for the lighter duties of the Home Guard.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for the hon. and gallant Member to remind the War Office of the existence of the Home Guard. I am hopeful that one of the results of this scheme will be to increase the strength of the Home Guard. As for the problem of filling the vacancies which will be created, I can assure the House that there need be no anxiety about finding suitable officers to take the places of those who will be retired under this scheme. To-day there is no longer the shortage of officers which was so serious a problem at the beginning of the war. Ever since then the O.C.T.U.'s have been steadily turning out a succession of picked young leaders, trained in the latest theory and practice of modern fighting. Nor will there be any difficulty in filling vacancies in the higher ranks of major and lieutenant-colonel. There are in the Army to-day, I am quite sure, plenty of fit, able and experienced officers who are well qualified for promotion.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street and others have asked why the higher ranks of officers are not included in this review. It is of course

confined to officers of the rank of lieutenant-colonel and below. It has been suggested that this is due to a tenderness of heart for senior officers, but I can assure the House that that is not the case. The reason is that in the higher ranks it becomes increasingly important not merely to ensure fitness and efficiency but to see that each individual officer is, as far as possible, personally and individually suited in character and qualifications for the particular appointment which he holds. The method of a single, general review, such as the one which has been recently announced, would not adequately secure this result. The only way this can be obtained is by closely and continuously watching the performance and achievement of each individual officer. This process is going on constantly, and hon. Members can rest assured that there will be no undue hesitation in replacing senior officers who do not come up to the higher standards now required. The principle by which we are guided is that if there is any reasonable cause for doubt about an officer's capacity to command, the benefit of the doubt must be given to the men whose lives are in his hands<br/>
The review about which I have spoken deals of course with only one side of the picture. There remains the problem of ensuring that any vacancy which may at any time occur, shall as far as possible be filled, regardless of all other considerations, by the man best fitted for the job. The hon. Member for Chester-le-Street and my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Petersfield (Sir G. Jeffreys) asked about the system of selecting officers for commissions. In this connection, it may interest the House to know that it has been decided thoroughly to re-examine the existing methods of selecting officers, not only for commissions but also for promotions and for the higher appointments, and to consider any changes in procedure which may be necessary to ensure that the best possible use is made of the available officer material of the Army. I do not wish to suggest that the present system of selection is failing to produce the best men. On the other hand, this is so vital a matter, that it is just as well to make quite sure.<br/>
Much has been said and written about the need for aeroplanes, tanks and guns. These are, of course, the essential tools of victory. But battles are not won by


equipment alone. Leadership, perhaps more than any other single factor, will determine the success or failure of a campaign. Our resources of leadership are amongst the nation's most precious assets. We must make sure that they are not wasted.</p>

<p>I am raising certain matters on which the new Joint Under-Secretary to the War Office is to reply, and I understand that he has just left the House in order to get certain information. From the welfare point of view, a large proportion of the A.T.S. stationed in the London area are not being properly looked after, and, as a result, a number of them are miserable. My attention was originally drawn to this state of affairs by a senior Chaplain of the Forces concerned. For months now A.T.S. have been quartered in billets, or in empty houses situated all over the metropolis, and many more A.T.S. are arriving. The chaplain concerned has taken me round. In many cases there is nothing in the sleeping rooms except double-decker iron bedsteads and small wooden lockers for each occupant. There are no chairs, and of course no curtains, and not even a small bit of matting by the bed-side. In many cases there has been no heating throughout the winter. Many of these rooms have had a damp atmosphere for months. I understand that some time ago the authorities promised better conditions, but nothing has come of it. Sometimes these quarters have what are called rest rooms. I have inspected one or two of the so-called rest rooms, and I can assure the House that those I have seen are just about as dreary as a morgue.<br/>
Can it be wondered at that in the evenings the occupants of these houses want to get away from such surroundings? Those who have no friends or relations in the London area are at times able to go to the cinema. More often they go to a Lyons Corner House, which is inexpensive and where, anyhow, they can get some warmth and bright lights. But most evenings they are unable to afford that, and consequently they have nowhere to go, and so they remain in their cheerless quarters and get depressed. In the St. Marylebone area the Y.W.C.A. have been good enough to offer to the A.T.S. authorities what accommodation they

could spare. I have seen that proposed accommodation, and it amounts to a large draughty passage. I understood that a stove would be placed in that passage. When furnished it is unlikely that it would accommodate more than 30 women. It might be inadvisable, if I were to say publicly the number of members of the A.T.S. in the St. Marylebone area alone, to say nothing of those who are expected, but I can inform the House that the total is considerable. The provision of suitable rest and recreation rooms for these Service women should not be left to charity, nor is it the function of Lord Nathan's welfare organisation. That organisation already has sufficient headaches. It is the responsibility of the Government, who have taken these women away from their homes, and it is the duty of the War Office to look after their well-being.<br/>
As to providing some suitable place for these members of the women's services to go to when off duty that does not necessarily cost them money. The solution is a simple one. One or two empty houses in the Central London area should be converted into non-residential clubs, and it should be the aim of those who might run such clubs to try to get away from the official atmosphere and to provide a "homey" place. I suggest that large houses should be used for this purpose so that a start could be made in a modest way on the ground floor, leaving room for expansion. I can assure the hon. and gallant Gentleman who is to reply that that expansion would be required very soon. The Mayoress of St. Marylebone has a very capable and willing committee of women helpers who are prepared and well qualified to run such a club as this for women in the Services in the North London area, and I estimate that, with voluntary assistance, the amount that would have to be provided by the War Office would, at the most, not be more than &#x00A3;800 to &#x00A3;1,000 per year. Such a club would meet the needs of the North Central London area.<br/>
I would like to put this straight question to the representative of the War Office. Incidentally, I believe this will be his maiden effort as a Minister, and I take this opportunity of wishing him luck in his new venture. I am also very glad that I am to supply him with his baptism of fire, and I shall do that from now on, with my own particular type of submachine gun. I hope that his fighting


spirit, while at the War Office, will be more apparent than it was in the last speech which he made in this House as a back-bencher. I put this question: Would the War Office be prepared to agree to a year's trial of such a club, and would it not be possible to give an answer to that question to-day, at the risk of every Member present in the House fainting? Or is it necessary that for an interminable time, such a small matter as this should be referred to various departments and committees, a process which, as many of us know to our cost, generally ends in the long run in the answer coming back in the form of a very small wizened lemon.<br/>
This is an important matter. These unfortunate conditions have been in existence for many months. The amenities provided for women in war industries are much better, and I think that the comparison is unfair to women in the Services. Surely, &#x00A3;1,000 or &#x00A3;2,000 would be well spent if the result was that many women in the Services, especially in the London area, were made more contented? I use the expression "more contented," because I somehow feel that an absolutely contented woman is just about as rare as eidelweiss on Hampstead Heath. What I am drawing attention to is a serious cause for complaint. A little consideration and expenditure on the part of the War Office would pay magnificent dividends in the shape of better work and more efficiency, to say nothing of the better feeling concerning the women's Services that would be engendered all over the country. That would start as soon as these women in the Services in the London area were able to write home in happier vein.<br/>
On this question of contentment in the Services paving a dividend out of all proportion to the expenditure involved, I want to know what the much-publicised "new brooms" at the War Office are going to sweep up for the families of soldiers, who at present are getting a very raw deal. I hope that Sir James Grigg has every intention of demanding an adjustment of present conditions to the extent that the standard of living of the soldier's family shall be the same as that of the average industrial worker's family. Until that is done, I say quite frankly, and at the risk of being called every name under the sun by the authorities, that you will not get the majority of married soldiers to put their hearts into

their work, or into their fighting. Government spokesmen can indulge in as many heroics as they like, of the kind that we once heard from the ex-Under-Secretary for War when I and another Member of this House were raising matters that concerned the rate of pay of soldiers, and I was making comparisons between the pay of our soldiers and those of other soldiers that they meet in this country. Such heroics will be of no value, because the cold fact remains that if a soldier's dependants are not looked after fairly, you cannot expect to get the best out of him.<br/>
I recently told the last Secretary of State for War that if he could not manage to arrange that his soldiers, especially those of the lower ranks, were no longer underpaid, he ought to go. On a subsequent occasion, and on the same subject, I informed the late lamented Under-Secretary for War that he was quite incapable of moving with the times. When, soon afterwards, the Ministerial services of these two gentlemen were dispensed with, my heart warmed to the Prime Minister; but soon afterwards I became perplexed as to why, if the right hon. and gallant Member for Rugby (Captain Margesson) was considered an unsatisfactory Minister, the Permanent Under-Secretary to the War Office who, as we all know, was co-responsible for policy, should be the right man to take his place.</p>

<p>I wish to emphasise the query put by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore) as to the arming of the Home Guard. It is notorious that the equipment of the Home Guard is entirely inadequate. I can present to my hon. and gallant Friend the Joint Under-Secretary a few lines for his notebook:
<q>Here lies a man who fought the Hun;</q>
<q>He had a pike, the Hun had a gun;</q>
<q>When his time comes to go aloft,</q>
<q>Whom must he blame&#x2014;the Hun or Page Croft? </q>


[<i>Laughter.</i>] This is no joking matter, and I should be delighted if my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary&#x2014;whom we congratulate upon his speech&#x2014;could treat this question a little more seriously, because we know, and the country knows, that the Home Guard suffers from serious lack of equipment. I would like my hon. and gallant Friend to promise that he will make a personal investigation into this matter of equipment, and that he will make quite certain that when additional men are called up for the Home Guard there will be adequate equipment waiting for them.</p>

<p>I desire only to add a few words to what was said by the hon. and gallant Member for St. Marylebone (Captain Cunningham-Reid). I hope that my hon. and gallant Friend who is going to reply&#x2014;and I congratulate him upon the opportunity he has of replying&#x2014;will treat this matter seriously. He has just come back from the Army, and he must know that many of the things my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for St. Marylebone said about the conditions of the A.T.S. in London apply in many parts of the country. Although many improvements have been made, arrangements for their comfort remain elementary. We expect something more than a trite answer. Nowadays we want actions, not merely words. It is not a question of not being able to find material, but of convincing the Treasury that they would be well advised to spend a little more on the welfare of the Army in general. The question does not apply to the A.T.S. only. I remember that in my talks with welfare officers, I learned that they had immense difficulty in providing these girls, not only in the London area but in much less civilised parts of the country&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh"]&#x2014;much less developed parts of the country&#x2014;with the most elementary amenities of existence. It has been left to charity in the past. It is not good enough in these days, when we are asking girls who have been brought up quite well, in most cases in comfortable homes, to leave those homes and serve their country in the hour of trial, to say that they shall have to suffer the same rough conditions as men are expected to undergo. These girls in many cases have taken over the

bare barrack rooms that men have left. In many cases they have had to go into not only uncomfortable, but insanitary, conditions.<br/>
I would particularly direct the attention of my hon. and gallant Friend to the Ack-Ack sites, where women are serving with men in the mixed batteries. The conditions there, as far as personal hygiene is concerned, are not entirely satisfactory. We who are parents, although we have some compunction in allowing our children to go, realise the necessity for it, but we expect the War Office to leave no stone unturned to see that these girls enjoy reasonable amenities of life. I assert&#x2014;and I believe that my hon. and gallant Friend knows this to be the truth&#x2014;that that is not the case to-day. The House expects him to improve the welfare part of the War Office, which is badly in need of it. He should, first of all, obtain more money and insist upon the Quartermaster-General's Department of the War Office providing more amenities such as electric light in some of these outstations which do not possess them to-day. There is a great necessity for electric light even if they can get no other amenities. When they are off duty they want to be able to read a book in reasonable comfort, and it is not asking too much, surely. These conditions prevail in the Army to-day, not only among the A.T.S., but among the men as well. We do not want to mollycoddle our Army, neither the girls nor the men, but we ask that they shall have comfortable conditions comparable with those which my hon. and gallant Friend has experienced as an officer serving in the Army. It is up to him, as one who has recently served in the Army, to see that the reasonable demands that we have made are acceded to, and we shall judge him not by what he says, but by what he does. If he gives the Army these things he will be a great success in this House.<br/>
I would like to ask my hon. and gallant Friend whether he is going to reply to that somewhat serious accusation which was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbartonshire (Mr. McKinlay). Either it is true or it is not, and if it is not true, it should be disposed of in this House at once. I refer to the allegation against the Director of the A.T.S. If the suggestions of my hon. Friend are not true, they ought to be disposed of in this House, otherwise that lady will be


suffering under a sense of grievance. The late Secretary at State for War, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Rugby (Captain Margesson), made a statement in this House previously, and evidently my hon. Friend has thought fit to bring up this case again to-day. Will my hon. and gallant Friend dispose of it once and for all, because if it is not disposed of, there will be a continuing feeling among certain parts of the A.T.S. that the supreme leader of that force is not the type of leader one would naturally expect? I do not know whether my hon. and gallant Friend is in a position to reply to the statement that has been made in the House to-day, but it ought not to he allowed to go unchallenged.</p>

<p>I do not propose to intervene for more than a minute, but as the vexed question of the Home Guard has been mentioned, I would like to make a suggestion to my hon. and gallant Friend. The difficulty in the Home Guard really is one of trained officers, and possibly some of the officers who may be too old for active service in the Regular Army might be allowed to continue to some extent their services with the Home Guard. The other point concerns the question of instructors for the Home Guard, particularly in the remote districts. There is a difficulty in regard to these instructors, and I wonder whether there could be a corps of instructors in the Home Guard, perhaps of older men who have the time to give instruction or whose services might be employed although they were too old for active service. If these two points can be placed before the War Office, I shall be very grateful.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1942-03-11a.1157.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McKie" colnum="1157" time="">
<p>I rise to support what was said by my hon. Friend and near political neighbour the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Fildes) regarding the Home Guard. My hon. Friend amused the House, as he invariably does, by quoting some lines regarding the present condition of equipment of that very valuable corps. I think that my hon. Friend will agree that things have shown a marked improvement over the last 21 months since that body first came into existence, but there still remains a very great deal to be done. I hope that the new Joint Parliamentary Secretary, who I understand is to reply&#x2014;and, like my

hon. and gallant Friend the Member for St. Marylebone (Captain Cunningham-Reid), I heartily congratulate him upon having obtained Front Bench rank&#x2014;will be able to lift the curtain a little more on this matter.<br/>
There is another point which was touched upon by my hon. Friend who has already replied on behalf of the War Office regarding the question of compulsion or conscription for the Home Guard. My hon. Friend mentioned three or four regional areas where it is intended to introduce some measure of conscription or compulsion forthwith. No doubt I shall have the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries in saying that I am very sorry that Scotland has not yet been included. The area of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore) does not concern me so much as does my own area and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries, as we represent very wide and scattered areas. The two of us represent over 100,000 people, stretching from Gretna Green to the Mull of Galloway, over 100 miles, and a very scattered and highly vulnerable area, where the ordinary citizens are seriously disturbed about the state of affairs. I know that the question of whether conscription or compulsion is to be introduced is very seriously exercising the minds of those who are responsible for running the Home Guard. I have not had an opportunity of bringing the matter to the notice of my hon. and gallant Friend, and I had no intention of speaking had not the question appertaining to the Home Guard not already been raised, but I hope that my hon. and gallant Friend and those who are responsible at the War Office will take this matter very much to heart. It is a very serious point indeed. Those who are responsible for running this very valuable body of men want to know where they stand in these very vulnerable areas. I wholly dissociate myself from the remarks of the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Mathers), who expressed the hope that there would be a further opportunity of withdrawal for those who wish to withdraw from the Home Guard.</p>

<p>May I have an opportunity of putting the hon. Member right? I asked that before, finally, compulsion is applied some warning should be given in the area where it is


found necessary to apply compulsion in order at least that it is known that compulsion is definitely coming in unless sufficient recruits are obtained, so that those who have not yet responded to the call may have an opportunity of making that response. I think that they ought to have an opportunity of getting the force up to strength without any necessity for compulsion being applied.</p>

<p>I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, and I at once apologise. I thought that he was making a plea for a further opportunity to be given to members of the Home Guard to withdraw, and I was going to say that, as far as Scotland was concerned, there was no objection to compulsion. I did not hear him correctly and I apologise, and I hope that the War Office will seriously consider the points raised forthwith, or as soon as practicable, and let those who are responsible for running the Home Guard know the result.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. McKie) will not be disappointed if, craving the indulgence of the House, at any rate on this occasion, I do not reply to some of the points which have been raised in this discussion. I can, however, assure him as well as the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Fildes) and the hon. and gallant Member for the Drake Division of Plymouth (Lieut.-Colonel Guest) that the points which have been raised will certainly receive the consideration of the War Office. I appreciate what my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) has said with reference to myself. As he said, I have just returned from the Army, and I hope that, although I served as an officer, just as he did himself, none the less my interest in the welfare of all members of our Forces will be found to be just as great as that of those who have served in other capacities. I have no doubt that he and I may differ from time to time as to what is desirable or necessary, but I can assure him that, at all events, my intentions will be as much above suspicion as, I have no doubt, he would like his own to be viewed.<br/>
In regard to the reference he made as to the alleged conduct of the Director of the A.T.S., I am afraid I shall have to

disappoint him, because at the moment I have nothing to add to what was said by the late Secretary of State for War when he replied to a Question on this subject and said that he had satisfied himself that her conduct on the occasion referred to was wholly correct. That is the position which we take up on this particular episode. The hon. and gallant Member for St. Marylebone (Captain Cunningham-Reid) raised the question of the conditions of the A.T.S. in the London district. I apologise for not being in the House for the first few minutes of his speech, but, as I understood, he was drawing attention to what I think is a transit camp in his own constituency.</p>

<p>Well, I can assure the hon. and gallant Member that I will give my personal attention to the allegations he has made. I will have inquiries made, and I will endeavour to satisfy myself that, if conditions are as he says, everything possible will be done to improve them. I am sure, though, that he does not expect me on this occasion to be able to deal with any particular hostel or hostels which he has in mind, but in so far as he has mentioned a particular hostel or other billet, I will certainly have a precise investigation made with a view to putting the matter right so far as it may be wrong. But in all fairness I should refer to the general position in London though I cannot, of course, speak from my own personal knowledge. I have been in the Department only four or five days, and I will not attempt to suggest to the House that I can speak on matters within my own knowledge. But I am advised that, as far as the London District is concerned, the conditions generally are reasonably satisfactory. That does not mean that in certain cases there may not be conditions that are not up to the required standard. I hope we shall be able to put them right, and to that extent we appreciate the hon. and gallant Gentleman's intervention in bringing them to our notice. If hon. Members bring these things to our notice, we shall be only too glad to try to put matters right<br/>
However, I think it is only right to say that, generally speaking, conditions in the London District, as far as the A.T.S. are concerned, are reasonably satisfactory. The House may be interested to know that the 1,000 to 2,000 members of the A.T.S. who are stationed in London&#x2014;the figure is a fluctuating one, of course&#x2014;are accommodated in the married quarters of barracks, a number of requisitioned hotels, flats, and large private houses; there are roughly, 30 separate buildings which are being used for military purposes. I do not say that in every case the conditions are entirely satisfactory, but it is right to say that, in the main, these places have adequate heating arrangements, the sanitary arrangements are on the whole satisfactory, there are recreation rooms, and I think the sleeping accommodation is such that there is no question of any allegation of overcrowding. In three or four cases it was found that billets were not up to the required standard, and I am informed that improvements to rectify them are in hand at the present time. But, of course, even the War Office is dependent upon the availability of material and labour, and this is one of the difficulties which we, just as any other Department, have to contend with when it comes to a question of repairs. Although the hon. and gallant Member spread his net rather wide&#x2014;and in vain&#x2014;because I am not prepared here and now to commit the War Office in relation to the experiment to which he referred, I hope he will derive satisfaction from my statement that certainly I am prepared to consider any proposal that he puts forward.</p>

<p>There is a brief point I wish to raise about an anomaly in pay in the Royal Air Force. First of all, I should like, if I may, to take this, the first chance I have had of speaking about Royal Air Force matters in the House of Commons, to thank the Air Ministry for the promptness with which they have always dealt with the many cases I have brought to their attention. Naturally, during the past years of war I have had a good deal to do with the Royal Air Force, and I have always found them most helpful, sympathetic and cooperative. In raising this anomaly in pay, I should like to say that it would really seem platitudinous to argue about money matters concerning members of the Royal Air Force who are at all times so


willing to give their services and not count the cost. But there is one point which wants looking into. The average officer who is training for operational work while doing training is allowed to live out with his family and is given a living-out allowance. He then passes from training to an operational station, where it is quite different. He has to live in the station. His family remain at home, and the wife, with his children, if that be the case, has to try to keep up a home ready for her husband when he comes off operational work, and is considerably less well off financially than when her husband was living at home. Admittedly it costs extra to have an officer living in the house, but the difference in the pay is considerably more. At the same time the officer has to pay certain mess fees while on an operational station. In other words, it has always seemed to me that a pilot officer going on operational work is in some sense placed in financial jeopardy, besides all the other jeopardies which he has to suffer. I shall be extremely sorry if I am not in my place when the Under-Secretary replies, but I have to address a meeting. This is a matter I have wanted to raise for some time.<br/>
In conclusion, I would say that we are all going through a period of depression in the country over the effects of the various disasters in the war. But it is always an encouraging thing to talk to a Royal Air Force pilot who is on active service, and to realise that he and his comrades are really whole-heartedly at work seven days in the week. If we could only run our lives on that same line, by giving all and not counting the cost, we should be well on the way to the reconsecration which must come if we are to win this war.</p>

<p>It would be very little use my discussing the numbers of the personnel if one could not indicate the justification for that discussion by asking or suggesting how they should best be employed. That is why I was hoping I might be permitted to refer for a second or two to certain discouraging words or discouraging speeches which were made last week in regard to the use of the Royal Air Force in bombing industrial and other targets in Germany. A number of hon. Members tried to convince my right hon. and gallant Friend that there was no longer any utility in bombing targets in Germany. It seemed to me that, no doubt unwittingly, they were serving as loud speakers for Goebbels. I paid a visit to Germany after the last war and came across a very intelligent German officer who had been in the intelligence service. We had many discussions about the effect of the war, and one thing that he repeatedly rubbed in, was that the Germans feared bombing more than anything else and were glad that the war had come to an end and that they could feel certain that they would not be bombed. I was relieved in my mind by the statement of the Secretary of State, when he made it clear, in categorical terms, that the policy of the Air Force was to continue bombing Germany relentlessly.</p>

<p>The more one studies the policy recently announced by the right hon. Gentleman, the more confusing it becomes. A short time ago I received a letter from an aerodrome defence officer who was bitterly disappointed because he could get little support, or encouragement, from the station commander in regard to the defence of his own aerodrome. He said the station commander was essentially preoccupied with flying and with the capacity of his pilots and machines. We all admire that regard for the pilots and machines, but surely experience has told us that neither pilot nor machine will be of much use if there is not an aerodrome. The right hon. Baronet, as a means of assuaging the anxieties of the House, said that all would now be well because we were instituting an R.A.F. Regiment for the defence of aerodromes.<br/>
I do not want to minimise the effect of that description of the duties of the R.A.F. Regiment, but it seems to me that it is quite unworkable, and I am sure I am not alone in that thought. If and when we have invasion, it will surely be preceded or accompanied by a series of almighty blitzes from the air, whether the invasion is seaborne or airborne. If so, surely the main portion of the R.A.F. Regiment will then be employed on the very job for which they are trained; that is, re-surfacing and re-equipping, filling-up bomb craters, and so on at the aerodrome. Therefore, although I willingly accept my right hon. Friend's assurance I cannot quite see that the R.A.F. Regiment, consisting largely of R.A.F. personnel drawn from the aerodrome, can be an effective instrument for the defence of the aerodrome. The further development of the command which my right hon. Friend envisaged renders the position still more obscure. It has to be under the command of the station commander, but at some unspecified and highly uncertain time during the invasion it comes under the operational command of the area Army commander. This is a sort of tortuous maze, and it is difficult to understand exactly what functions it can carry out,

under whose control they can be carried out, and when control devolves from the station commander to the area Army commander; in other words, how the men composing this force are to carry out the defence of aerodromes when the invasion comes. That is the real problem with which I have been faced, and with which other Members have been concerned. I can speak for some with whom I have consulted, and we feel that there is only one real solution. That is, that the ground defence of an aerodrome, like the defence of a factory or any other war establishment, is the job of the Army, and that the military commander of the area must be responsible.<br/>
You, Sir, have rather restricted the scope of my argument, because I was going to refer to a subject which your predecessor in the Chair permitted the hon. and gallant Member for Petersfield (Sir G. Jeffreys) to develop. That is the question of co-operation between the Air forces and the land forces. The hon. and gallant Gentleman developed this subject at some length and endeavoured to persuade the Government and the House that the Army should have its own operational aircraft. We all agree on that, and we would extend the principle to the Navy as well. We all wonder why this obvious reorganisation does not take place. On many occasions doubts have been expressed whether my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had sufficient power over the Air Ministry and the senior Air.officers, and whether the latter were not afraid of an encroachment on their status and powers if they yielded now. This is the kind of rumour that is going round, and I feel that the Secretary of State should be made aware of it, because it is not good for the Air Force and the Air Ministry that these doubts should go round without being squashed. I know that my right hon. Friend said in the last Debate that there was no truth in them, but the rumour persists that owing to the vested interests created as a result of these comparatively junior officers being forced by the expansion of the Air Force into high positions, they may, even with the national existence at stake, be unwilling, by lack of judgment or of years, to forgo the power and position which they hold in the Air Ministry as sole controllers of this vast and growing force.<br/>
I should not have intervened on this question had I not realised that there is a feeling of frustration and of anxiety throughout the country as to the proper utilisation of all our Armed Forces, including the Air Force. I feel that the people of this country are saying: "We are being encouraged to give blood, sweat and tears, encouraged by the Ministry of Aircraft Production and other Ministries to work harder and longer, give up more of our time, give up our holidays, give up our travel, and how is all this blood, sweat and tears to be used? Is it going to be thrown on one side? Is it going to be yielded up at Singapore? Are we going to see our big ships going down because Japanese bombers could choose just where they wanted to launch their air attack?"</p>

<p>Perhaps I was carried away a little. I will finish my remarks by saying that the British people and the Empire are tired of inefficiency, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will try, with such powers as he has, to produce an organisation directed by people who are worthy of the men whom they direct.</p>

<p>I should like to have an assurance about the care taken to prevent accidents, particularly to young pilots, in the Air Force. I feel confident that every care is taken before young pilots are put into any position of responsibility, but my attention was drawn to this subject a week or two ago, though I need not mention the place I have in mind nor, indeed, the number of accidents which occurred in a comparatively short time, because to draw any useful conclusions one would have to know the number of pilots who were flying there and how often they flew. While we are all lost in admiration of the dexterity of these young pilots who do all manner of tricks in the sky, there must be a period of their career before they have acquired full confidence in themselves. Probably they have the skill but are just lacking in confidence. They have certainly sweated and spent agonising hours in preparing themselves for the tasks that lie ahead. It is at that final stage that I hope the greatest care will

be taken to prevent accidents, because all that effort to which I have referred will have been wasted if there should be an accident. We have to take into account that sometimes climatic conditions here are entirely different from what some of these young men have been used to, visibility here is different, and great judgment has to be displayed in estimating distances both in taking off and in landing. I feel that before these young pilots are given full control of machines they ought to be accompanied in the air for a time. I should like to ask for an assurance that every care will be taken in this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady the Member for Bodmin (Mrs. Rathbone), whose intervention in our Debate is welcome on all sides of the House, said it was the first time she had spoken on air matters in this House but I know that we shall all look forward to her contributions on that subject in future. She was kind enough to pay a tribute to the Air Ministry for its method of dealing with individual cases. I shall be happy to pass on that tribute to those members of our administrative staff who carry the burden of that work, which is very considerable. Very often the Executive are, quite rightly, subjected to criticism in this House, but it is all too rare for us to get a tribute and I know all members of our staff will be glad to receive it in this case.<br/>
The hon. Lady put a question on what she called an anomaly. If I may put it in a sentence she said that when a married officer lives out, he is in receipt of married allowance and lodging allowance, but when he lives in, he is in receipt of consolidated allowance, and that as it works out, he is less well off when he lives in than when he lives out. I think that is her case. The hon. Lady must be aware that there is, at present, in none of the operational commands any order that air crews must live in. Indeed, in the majority of cases, the air crews live out. There are times, however, when, under the stress of operations, air crews may be ordered to live in for certain periods. It is a very difficult problem and not one which can be dealt with in relation only to the Air Force. It is an inter-Service matter, affecting the Army and Navy as well. We have the problem under review


and I hope that we shall be able to come to some arrangement by which, when air crews are ordered in, they will not lose by it. I cannot give any assurance except to say that this issue is very much alive and that it is one with which I have a great deal of sympathy.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore) may be assured that we shall go on bombing the Germans. About aerodrome defence, this rests with the Army, but we have, by agreement with the Army, formed the Royal Air Force Regiment to help in that task. I am not going into the details now of those questions which my hon. and gallant Friend raised, but I suggest that he should read the Debate on this matter, when he will find the subject will be clear to him. He made one fundamental error when he said that the Royal Air Force Regiment consisted of mechanics and airmen, and when he asked how they could do their work of tending the aircraft and at the same time defend the aerodromes. If he will read the speech of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air, and my attempt at answering questions, he will see that the Royal Air Force Regiment is composed of men who specialise upon aerodrome defence only, and that those men to whom he was referring are known as "backers-up," ordinary men on the aerodromes, who can be employed in backing-up the Royal Air Force Regiment, if their other duties so allow. I should be very happy at any time to enlighten him, to the best of my ability and the ability of my Department, if he will come along and see me.<br/>
I was very glad indeed that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Morpeth (Mr. R. J. Taylor) raised the question of accidents, because one of the tragic aspects of the administration of a Service Department such as the Air Ministry, which my right hon. Friend and myself have to face, is that the air, even in peace-time, has always taken its toll of human life and that in war the toll is much greater. I can assure him that we regard accidents as incidents which must be investigated and sifted to the uttermost. We are always anxious about accidents; we can never be happy or complacent or satisfied so long as accidents, which might possibly be avoided, occur. We have a complete accidents branch; we sift out statistics of all accidents with a view to finding out

whether a particular type of aeroplane is more prone to accidents than to others and whether a particular age group is inclined to be more prone to accidents than another; we study meteorological conditions and get a series of cross sections of all the circumstances attending accidents.<br/>
As regards the boys and young men who come from abroad, as the products of the great Commonwealth Joint Air Training plan, the point made about their coming to a new climate, is, I think, met by the fact that they go to one or two reception depots where they are given certain routine work and where, in future, they are to learn something about the fundamentals of the sister Services, the Army and the Navy, for a period of three or four weeks. This will allow them to become acclimatised. Before they are allowed to go up in the air again, they always go up in a dual control machine, with an instructor to see that they have not lost their skill, and to rub up their knowledge again. I think I have answered the Questions put by my hon. Friend and I trust that the House will accept our assurance that my right hon. Friend and I will keep a strict look-out on accidents at all times.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. and gallant Gentleman be good enough to deal with the matter I raised the other day&#x2014;why the Royal Air Force is being trained on biplanes when all operational work is carried out on monoplanes? There was, at one time, I believe, a prototype of the Magister which appeared to be suitable for the purpose, and I shall be glad to have information on the point.</p>

<p>I will gladly answer that point. Biplanes are used to any extent in the training of pilots, only at the elementary stage, and at this stage the biplane has been found to be satisfactory and economical in use. It is our experience that pilots receiving their initial training on biplanes show no variation in skill, as compared with pilots who have received elementary training on monoplane types. I cannot agree that the biplane is inefficient or wasteful, or is not giving our young men a fair chance. On the other hand, the biplane has not got all the modern developments associated with the low-wing monoplane, and it is desirable


to introduce our young men to these particular characteristics at the earliest possible stage. Therefore, as our supply of biplanes fades away, so are we bringing in a supply of elementary trainers of the low-wing monoplane type. I hope that will satisfy my hon. Friend.</p>
