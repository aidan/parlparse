<p>Deferment has been granted for 682 persons who have undertaken to give their services to E.N.S.A. for not less than six weeks each year.

<p>No, Sir. The point is that a conscientious objector has a right to go to a tribunal, and coalmining, like everything else, is one of the occupations to which it is open to the chairman to direct people. I cannot interfere with the process of the law.</p>

<p>No, Sir. It would not be practicable to submit all men who are examined under the National Service Acts to a special psychological examination directed to temperamental fitness for coal-mining.

<p>In view of the trouble that has been caused in the mines in the past by compelling those who were unsuited to the work to undertake it, does the Minister not think it would be just as well to be wise in time and take such steps as I have indicated, as there is otherwise the danger of trouble from the other miners?</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour if he is aware that Mr. J. E. H.

<p>The local appeal board were aware of the result of the police court proceedings, but, in the light of all the evidence before them, they were of the opinion that the worker's action amounted to serious misconduct justifying dismissal. In these circumstances, the National Service Officer has no power under Article 5 (3) (<i>b</i>) of the Essential Work Order to direct Mr. Barker's reinstatement, and there is no further action I can take in the matter.</p>

<p>Is this not an amazing situation and one that calls for intervention by the Minister? This man was proved in a public court innocent of misconduct, but the employers, somehow or other, are able to get an appeal court to decide against the decision of the public court.

<p>Is the Minister not begging the point? The same chap who was before the public court was before the appeal committee, but while the public court exonerated him from the charge of misconduct the appeal board dismissed him for it. He was charged before the committee with a criminal offence.</p>

<p>In answer to that long argument I can only say that the man was charged in the court with a criminal offence. In the case of the Essential Work Order it was only a question of fact whether his misconduct contravened the Order and not whether it was criminal at all.</p>

<p>No, Sir; since there are going to be frequent ballots, the publication of the number or numbers drawn would cause confusion and would mislead many men who are not for the time being on the register for calling up to the Forces, because, for example, their calling up is deferred or postponed and they are, therefore, not within the field of the ballot.

<p>If the comparison is between the wages of the ordinary Indian seaman and the fully-qualified European A.B. or efficient deckhand the position is as stated by the hon. Member. But the Indian does not do the same amount of work and there is accordingly a great disparity in the numbers that have to be employed. As regards accommodation, it is true that the minimum cubic space required by the Merchant Shipping Acts to be provided in the accommodation for Indian seamen is much less than that required for European crews. But in practice the space provided for Indian seamen on ships built in recent years has almost invariably been not less than the statutory minimum required for European crews. As I informed the hon. Member on 2nd December, the position regarding the conditions of employment of Indian seamen is at present under active consideration by the Government of India.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. Attention has been paid for a number of years to the activities of this so-called society, which is in fact a propaganda bureau run by a single individual, whose influence and importance are negligible. Attention will continue to be paid to him, but it has been the clearly expressed wish of Parliament that there should be as little interference as possible with the free expression of opinion, and I have no power to put a stop to this individual's activities merely because his propaganda is abhorrent to all right-minded people. I presume that the second part of the Question refers to the National Workers' Party of Great Britain. This organisation rented two rooms from the Britons Publishing Society from the beginning of 1936 until the beginnig of 1937, when it ceased to function. It also bought some propaganda material from the society.</p>

<p>I think my hon. Friend is under a misapprehension as to the scope of the Metropolitan Police Order to which he refers. It deals with only a part of the arrangements for the release of men to the Armed Forces and to industry, to which I referred in reply to his Question on 2nd December. Under those arrangements the Commissioner of Police has already taken steps to make available a large number of the younger members of his Force, both regulars and War Reserve constables. The responsibilities of the police are such that it is

impossible to spare all the young and active men, and it was therefore decided that to make up the total figure of men to be released some men over military age must be included.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. I decided to comply with this request, and Mr. Roland Burrows, K.C., was good enough to accept my invitation to hold an inquiry into this matter. While preparations were being made for the holding of this Inquiry, other allegations of a serious character were brought to my notice reflecting on the administration of branches of the Civil Defence Services. It will, I think, be in the public interest to extend the scope of the proposed Inquiry so as to enable these further allegations to be investigated. Certain preliminary inquiries are being made but I hope that it will be possible to begin the Inquiry into all the matters requiring investigation early in the New Year.</p>

<p>I regret that the informa-asked for in the first part of the Question is not available. As regards the second part, the prosecution of parents for the non-attendance of their children at school is primarily a matter of taking proceedings under the school attendance by-laws which, generally speaking, require whole-time attendance at school. It is, however, necessary to bear in mind the provisions of Section 10 (3) of the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, which gives relief from proceedings under that Section in cases where a child of the type referred to makes not less than 200 school attendances from October to March.</p>

<p>Although I do not accept my hon. Friend's view that the wage increase bears particularly hardly on the small farm, the Government have always been anxious to assist small farmers as much as possible to overcome their special difficulties. Measures such as the acreage payments on potatoes, wheat and rye, and the marginal production scheme have been introduced for this purpose. The position is kept under review; the increase in the acreage payment on wheat from the 1944 harvest, recently announced, is for example intended to benefit the small man. A general price increase would not be a suitable or acceptable method, since

amongst other disadvantages it would not differentially benefit the smaller farmer.</p>

<p>asked the Financial Secretary to the Treasury under what regulation that part of the income of a person over 65 years of age which exceeds &#x00A3;500 a year is subject to a tax of 15s. in the &#x00A3;1 instead of 10s.?</p>

<p>The provisions relating to relief from tax&#x2014;generally known as age relief&#x2014;in favour of persons of over 65 years of age with income less than &#x00A3;500 are to be found in Section 15 (2) of the Finance Act, 1925, as amended by Section 8 (2) of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1940. This Section contains the marginal provision to which my hon. Friend's Question relates and which far from imposing an additional burden gives relief in cases where the income is just over &#x00A3;500 and where in consequence the taxpayer misses the full benefit of the age relief; but for this relief there would be a sudden jump in the liability where the income just exceeds &#x00A3;500.</p>

<p>It is impossible within the limits of a Parliamentary answer to give all the details of my Department's activities. I would, however, refer my hon. Friend to the Debate in this House on 27th July last, and particularly to my statement that the Department is engaged in the production of reports of two kinds&#x2014;(1) geographical, upon individual markets, and (2) industrial, to indicate to particular export industries the conditions they are likely to find in all the more important markets. These reports are being continuously revised, so that the final product may be as up-to-date as possible. At the same time discussions are taking place with a large number of industries in order that views may be exchanged about their particular export trade problems, and to ensure that the services of the Department are on lines that will afford the maximum assistance to exporters. A number of the Department's overseas officers have already been brought home for consultation, and this practice is being

continued and developed. Moreover, a senior officer of the Department has recently been in the Middle East conferring with the Department's officers in that area and it is intended that similar conferences shall take place in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>I have a statement about the Prime Minister to give to the House. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary informed the House on Tuesday on his return from Cairo that he had left the Prime Minister to see the work of the Conferences through to the end. He left him in good health, though perhaps a little tired. I have to inform the House that the following bulletin is about to be issued from to, Downing Street:
<q>The Prime Minister has been in bed for some days with a cold. A patch of pneumonia has now developed in the left lung. The general condition is as satisfactory as can be expected.</q>
It is signed Moran, D. Evans Bedford (Brigadier), R. J. V. Pulvertaft (Lieut.-Colonel), and is dated 16th December. A further bulletin will be issued daily.<br/>
The House will be sorry to learn of the Prime Minister's illness, and I am sure it will be the desire of all of us that we shall send our best wishes for his recovery. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I may add that highly qualified specialists are in attendance. The House will observe that the bulletin is signed not only by Lord Moran but also by Brigadier Bedford and Lieut.-Colonel Pulvertaft, who are Consulting Physician and Director of Pathology respectively to the Middle East Forces.

<p>I should like to say a word or two upon this Clause in order to give to the Committee any information that may be available in regard to the position of the three main activities of the Miners' Welfare Fund&#x2014;pit-head baths, canteens, and rehabilitation centres. It would take too long to-day, although I should have liked to do so, to touch on all the other activities for which the Commission is responsible, such as Scholarships, recreational schemes, convalescent homes and others.<br/>
The construction of pit-head baths was stopped in the middle of the programme owing to war exigencies. I should like, however, to let the Committee know that there are now 362 pit-head baths completed. That covers 419,146 men or a percentage figure of 57. The collieries remaining to be dealt with, including 660 which employ fewer than 50 men each, total 1326 and cover 322,057 men, or 43 per cent. Under that last group come 12 baths which were left unfinished owing to war requirements, covering 13,334 men, and four baths for 1,710 men now being


completed because they are essential for coal production. While the Miners' Welfare Commission are most anxious and eager to get on with and complete the baths programme, it is impossible in war-time conditions to do so owing to the shortness of labour and material. It is also doubtful whether the special equipment required for baths would be obtainable, the factories making it having been turned over to munitions work. I should like however to assure the Committee that we shall press on with it at the earliest possible moment and that we have schemes in hand and waiting to be set in motion directly that is possible.<br/>
A word on the canteen position. It will be remembered that the Government asked the Miners' Welfare Commission to instal canteens throughout the coalfields, and this has been and is being done. Out of 1,028 collieries employing more than 50 men each, 893 employing 95 per cent. of all the men engaged in the industry have canteens now operating. Of these 893, full meals are served at the canteens of 415 collieries employing 50 per cent. of all the mineworkers. When the canteens under construction or in preparation have been completed the percentages will be 98 and 70 respectively. The Commission's officers have been in touch with all the remainder and arrangements are being made as and where possible to carry out those which are still required. It is always a principle adopted that the canteens erected and installed are of the type desired by the men in the colliery concerned. The use made of the canteens, although not as full as might be desired, compares not unfavourably I understand with that made of factory canteens, if account is taken of all the men using the canteens whether for snap or snacks as well as those taking full meals. The proportion taking full meals averages only about 30 per cent. I would like, in connection with the canteen programme, to thank the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Works for all their help and co-operation. The carrying into effect of the programme has meant an enormous amount of work on the part of the staff of the Commission which is very attenuated, and it is progressing satisfactorily considering the difficult conditions under which we are working. The main difficulty in regard to canteens, as in regard to rehabilitation, on which I shall touch in a moment, is that of labour. Even

if we get the labour, it is sometimes difficult to ensure its retention, and this inevitably throws out the whole programme of work. We are, however, in touch with the Ministry of Labour on this head, and we hope to get matters a little more stabilised in that connection.<br/>
The third large programme, of which I am sure the Committee would like to hear, is that of rehabilitation centres. This big scheme is also one which the Government have asked the Commission to take up. Two centres are now in operation. The number of centres in preparation, one being non-resident, is five, and the remainder, to cover the whole of the coalfields, are being provided in collaboration with the hospitals in the areas. Those which are being catered for directly by the Miners' Welfare Commission cover 64 per cent. of the industry, and those which are being catered for by the hospitals, in collaboration with the Miners' Welfare Commission, total 36 per cent. It may interest the Committee to know that I am officially opening a centre at Talygarn for the South Wales, Forest of Dean, Somerset and Bristol area on Saturday and we hope that it will be a very satisfactory installation. In the rehabilitation programme the main difficulty lies in getting medical officers and staff for the various installations which we are organising.<br/>
I should like to take one more moment to thank on behalf of the Commission all concerned for the help which they have given us in this work. Not only Members of Parliament for mining constituencies, but leaders in the industry; both men and owners have co-operated wholeheartedly during the period in which I have had the privilege of being chairman of this Commission&#x2014;now nearly 10 years. The members of the Commission and staff, the 25 District Committees and the very large number of sub-committees (some 1,400) all feel that it is very fine work and are grateful to be able to take a part in it. We have of course our difficulties here and there but throughout the whole length and breadth of the coalfields the co-operation has been first rate. We are getting ahead with the work and we hope that it will be to the satisfaction and assistance not only of the workers of this vital industry but of the country as a whole.</p>

<p>I wish to thank the right hon. and gallant Gentleman


who has just explained the purposes of this Bill to the Committee and also to say that I am very glad indeed that it is proposed to push on with this work of providing washing facilities, pit-head baths and canteens in the collieries as far as it is possible at the present time. Not so long ago I wrote to the right hon. and gallant Gentleman about a canteen in my constituency, advocating the provision of full meals wherever possible and he replied to me rather cautiously. Perhaps he was wise, because I have learned since that the full meal canteens, especially one in my constituency, have not been very well attended. Apparently one has to be careful in this respect and there are many considerations to be borne in mind. From inquiries which I have made, however, it appears that in the particular case to which I refer, no washing facilities were available. That has since been rectified but it would seem that canteens, on the whole, are not so well attended where there are no washing facilities or pit-head baths.<br/>
The reason I gather is that the miners do not like to come up from their work dirty, and sit down to a meal without having a wash and that is very understandable. I think if the miner is able to avail himself of washing facilities or, better still, pit-head baths when he comes from his work, he is much more likely to wish to sit down in the canteen to a proper meal. In other cases in my constituency where pit-head baths are provided, full meals are not provided but only light refreshments. I think that in cases where there are pit-head baths, full meals could possibly be provided in the canteens, but that the experiment might not be so successful at those places where there are no washing facilities or no pit-head baths. I believe that the provision of these facilities at collieries would play an important part in connection with our coal output. I know that the real troubles behind this question are different and that we cannot discuss them here to-day. But a measure which would enable the miner who is performing such arduous and dangerous work to get additional food would have an effect ultimately on coal output and anything which can be done with the assistance of this Fund to provide washing facili-

ties and canteens will be most useful. It will be money well invested which will come back to the nation ultimately in increased output, although, of course, that is not to say that there are not other problems which must be tackled because they are really fundamental. I thank the right hon. and gallant Gentleman for his statement and I hope that, as far as is possible, in view of present difficulties about priorities in materials, he will push on with the work of providing both pit-head baths and canteens.</p>

<p>I think I am the only surviving Member in the House of the Departmental Committee on the Miners' Welfare Fund which was appointed in 1930 by the hon. Member for Seaham (Mr. Shinwell) then Secretary for Mines. I am very glad that this Measure has been introduced and I am sure that the terms of the Clause which we are discussing are in accordance with the recommendations which we made. We recommended that when the condition of the industry justified it, the levy of one penny should be maintained. It is satisfactory that it has been maintained now for a considerable period and I hope it will be maintained for ever. The work of the Miners' Welfare Fund has been extraordinarily successful. It has produced a spirit of good will and co-operation, which had been sadly lacking in the mining industry, and I hope that the precedent set here may be applied to other industries where there is a similar lack of welfare facilities. I was delighted to hear the report given by my right hon. and gallant Friend on the work which is being done and is in contemplation. My constituents will benefit from that work although only to a small extent, because my constituency is just on the edge of the coal field but the country as a whole and this great national industry will benefit enormously by the admirable work which he and his committee have been doing for so long and which they will continue to do now, I am glad to say with unabated resources.</p>

<p>I should like to add my appreciation of the statement made by the right hon. and gallant Member for Central Nottingham (Sir F. Sykes). As representing a mining constituency, I can assure him that the work of the Commission has been appreciated to the full. I am not sure that I could say as much about his statement in regard to the baths position. It is unfortunate that the erection of baths has been slowed down. A serious effort ought to be made to build baths. Their provision was begun before the war, and it is rather pathetic to see baths left in a half-erected condition and no progress whatever being made towards completing them, although miners are in need of bath facilities. One can visit a place month after month and find that no notable measure of progress has been made, and that state of things ought not to be allowed to continue. It is true that there are labour difficulties, but labour is found for a great deal of other work which is not of any more importance than the provision of pithead baths. Labour is being released for other purposes, and why cannot some of it be used for the provision of these baths, which are so desirable and necessary? We were a long time in getting into action in regard to this matter. A certain number of prejudices had to be overcome and then funds were not provided, though when at last we did get into operation we were making rapid progress. In my own county some 60 per cent. of the miners are provided with bath accommodation, and the other 40 per cent. are now awaiting their turn and I would urge the necessity of getting on with things. Priorities should be granted for materials and labour for these baths.</p>

<p>I think it arises out of the statement made by the right hon. and gallant Member for Central Nottingham. He mentioned baths and canteens and the whole purpose of Clause 1 is to secure the finance for these objects. It appears to me there is not much object in our discussing baths if we are not to discuss the purpose to which the levy is to be applied.</p>

<p>Shall we not be able to follow the speech of the right hon. and gallant Member for Central Nottingham (Sir F. Sykes)? He eulogised the work done in the matter of canteens and baths and rehabilitation, and some of us are very keen about all three things, and possibly something else which is in Part I. Almost everything concerned with miners' welfare work is in Part I, because it depends upon the 1d. per ton levy.</p>

<p>That may be the case in regard to the money, but not as to labour and materials. I was not aware that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Central Nottingham (Sir F. Sykes) was going to take quite the line which he did take, for his remarks might have been more appropriate to the Third Reading, but as he has made them I think I ought, within limits, to allow the Committee to follow suit, but I hope they will not digress from Clause 1 as it stands in the Bill because it is rather limited, merely providing for the continuation of the Section of the original Act extending the operations of the Mining Industry Welfare Fund.</p>

<p>On a point of Order. Clause 1 does deal with the sum of money which is to be available, and the right hon. and gallant Member for Central Nottingham (Sir F.

<p>I have felt in a difficulty and I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline (Mr. McLean Watson) what I should talk about. He said, "Talk about nothing and you will get on all right." I do not want to prolong my remarks, but I thought we had an opportunity to press upon the right hon. and gallant Member the necessity of getting on with the baths. The question of canteens looms large, and it is necessary to pass this Clause before we can get the funds to provide them. I would say to an hon. Friend who spoke earlier that there are several reasons why canteens are not so extensively used in mining as in other industries. It is not fair to compare miners' canteens with canteens in industries where there is a definite break for meals. That may account for the fact that the canteens have not been so extensively used as they might have been. I want to make the point that there is no break in a miner's working day for a meal. A miner comes up from the pit in a dirty, filthy state. Miners have to choose between running for a bus or train and getting home to a meal that may be prepared for them&#x2014;in many cases an imaginary meal&#x2014;or taking a meal at the colliery and losing the bus. It is therefore not fair to say that the miners are not anxious to participate in these canteens. Where the canteens are built near the villages so that the men can take a meal and then go home, they are extensively used, but where there is the possibility of losing their buses or trains, then, naturally, they have to make their choice, and the choice is to get home.<br/>
I should like to ask my hon. Friend what degree of permanency we are going to secure with regard to this question of rehabilitation. Is it just a temporary measure, or has there been any definite conclusion arrived at that this scheme of rehabilitation will be in any sense permanent? One Scottish welfare centre has secured very fine premises at the Gleneagles Hotel, where the millionaires used to go to play golf, and part of it is allocated to the miners for rehabilitation purposes, but the possibility is that the millionaires will want to go back to Gleneagles when the war is over and that the miners will be ejected from the place.

Can we have any idea from my hon. Friend or from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Mines as to the degree of permanency that we can expect in regard to this question of rehabilitation, because, if we can have an answer to that question, it will help us very much indeed. I greatly appreciate the work which has been done and the fact that the Bill has again been produced. I am also pleased to hear about the Fund, but I do hope that permanency will exist in this matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-12-16a.1732.0" hansard_membership_id="5206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32180" speakername="Mr. George Griffiths" colnum="1732" time="">
<p>I am very pleased that the Miners' Welfare Fund has extended its benefits until 1951. We were very much alarmed in the mining districts when the statement was circulated in the Press that the penny was going to be reduced to a halfpenny. The outcry was very strong, because if there is any name in the world that the miners, their wives, their children and their children's children reverence, it is the name of Lord Sankey. It was Lord Sankey who presided over the great Commission which included such greatly loved men as Smillie, Herbert Smith and others. That Commission revealed to this country a state of things in the mining villages that a lot of people in the British Isles never thought prevailed. One of the recommendations of the Commission is one which I must not talk about, because it was a recommendation that public ownership should take place. I must not touch on that; the time is not opportune.<br/>
I can remember that when I was a lad&#x2014;it is some years ago now&#x2014;there were four of us coming home from the pits, and my mother had to heat the water on a fire in a little pitman's cottage for four miners to wash with. It used to take us nearly a couple of hours before we got that out of the way. I am very glad that that sort of thing does not prevail today in the major mining districts of the British Isles. Pit-head baths, as has been stated by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sloan), must take precedence over the canteens, because a man wants a wash. After a clean-up he is prepared, generally speaking, to have his meal, and I am quite sure that the chairmen of the Miners' Welfare Committee and the Welfare Commission that sit at the present time will agree with me that the biggest percentage


of cooked meals in the canteens is taken where there are pit-head baths. I cited a case when I was on the other side of this House ten days ago of a man who worked a large number of shifts and who had to travel five miles each way in a bus in his black face because there was no pit-head bath. The foundations for pit-head baths at his pit had been prepared, but the baths have not been built on account of the war. That man travelled ten miles, and then, on top of that, he travelled another two and a half miles down the pit, walking in and walking out, and then had to go home in a filthy condition. I am hoping that we shall get the money and be able to start pit-head baths. I feel that baths should be given priority over canteens in the future.<br/>
One word, if I may, on this rehabilitation scheme. I went along with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions to Mansfield, and I was delighted with the day I spent there. I saw men who had been crocked up, some with broken legs, others with broken spines or other very serious injuries, but these men had the joy of life in them, because, although they were not permanently cured of their injuries, they had great hopes that they would be able to get back to their work. That is a great thing with the miner. He does not want to do dataling if he is a coal-face worker. One of the reasons why he does not want that is because a man who is at the coal face gets little more money than if he is dataling. If he is dataling, he thinks he is a drag on the concern. These men at Mansfield felt that they were going to get back to their work. I am pleased that the chairman has stated that we are going to extend these rehabilitation centres. I can speak about these things because I was a member of a miners' welfare committee in South Yorkshire for 15 years, and I know the benefits that accrue. I had the wife of a miner at my house the other day, and she said, "Our Sam has come back from the miners' convalescent home, and he has put on ten pounds in weight in a fortnight and is now ready for work." So all the pit-head baths, canteens and other social amenities are without doubt very acceptable. I am delighted that the Miners' Welfare Fund is going on until 1951, and after that I hope it is going on for eternity.</p>

<p>I welcome the statement that has been made by the chairman of the Welfare Commission. Before the war we used to discuss the Welfare Fund, and there were then two objects in view, baths and miners' institutes. No miners' institutes have been erected during the war, although they were very warmly welcomed, especially by miners in outlying villages. I dare say that if the money were available now, miners' institutes would again figure in the programme of the Welfare Commission. I welcome also the maintenance of the penny per ton. If there had been a reduction in the amount of money coming into the Fund we should have found ourselves in difficulties, not only during the war but afterwards. The baths programme is not nearly completed. We want more bathing facilities at a number of collieries that will still continue to operate for some years.<br/>
Since the war began there have been new developments in amenities and in the facilities for rehabilitation. When a miner met with an accident before the war, he got his compensation if the accident was received in the course of his employment, and he was usually treated in a hospital if it was serious, and then he went home until he was able to return to his work. Now we have had a beginning made with rehabilitation. I was pleased to hear the chairman speak with such enthusiasm of the progress that has been made in that direction. I hope we shall have more rehabilitation in the future than in the past. I hope also that the Welfare Commission will not surrender Gleneagles Hotel after the war is over. I hope that the hotel business will be dropped and that the place will be called "The Gleneagles Convalescent Home" or "Rehabilitation Centre" and that it will not be a place where millionaires can go to enjoy themselves. We have had enough of that in the past. The hotel is serving a much more useful purpose at the moment than it was before the war, and I hope that miners in Scotland who are injured and require treatment will be looked after in a place like Gleneagles Hotel. It is none too good for the men who are producing coal in Scotland.<br/>
I welcome the maintenance of the penny per ton. Miners are raising no objection to it, and anyone who begins to talk about miners being hard and stingy is


saying something which is simply not true. The miners welcome the welfare machinery in the industry, as well as the baths and the institutes, and no objection has been taken to the programme that is now being carried out by the Welfare Commission in regard to amenities and rehabilitation with the changes that are being made above ground and the changes being made below ground, I cannot understand the opposition that comes from certain quarters in this House to young men being directed to the mines.</p>

<p>Perhaps not, Major Milner, but I have to confess that I have been surprised at the outcry that has been raised. There is no comparison, either above or below ground, between the conditions at present and even those which I knew when I left the mines, and there should not be so much objection to people being induced to go into the mines. Miners are supposed to have made good wages, which induced them to stay there, but now there are other inducements. The miners hope that all the money possible will be kept in the Miners' Welfare Fund for the purpose of making conditions in the mines better and more attractive. I welcome the Clause.</p>

<p>I am maintaining that it is the most distasteful job that I know. I have known many jobs, but nothing quite like it. I support Clause 1. Changes have been effected. I should have liked to have put many questions to the right hon. and gallant Member for Central Nottingham (Sir F. Sykes) in regard to the Clause, but I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for the way in which the money is spent, so I can only suggest that we have not had the right kind of explanation up to now why certain things that ought to have been

done have not been done with the money previously voted.</p>

<p>I will specify them. I am unhappy about the suggestions made by the hon. Members for Hemsworth (Mr. G. Griffiths), Forest of Dean (Mr. Price) and South Ayrshire (Mr. Sloan) about the shortage or the absence of baths. I cannot understand why the Minister of Fuel and Power has not gone to the Supply Committee or to some other Department and asked for equal treatment with the Service Departments in the matter of supplying mobile or emergency baths. During the next 12 months the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister can do a considerable amount of work with the money to which we are now being asked to agree. I believe we could find typical samples of baths that could be constructed or erected close to pit-heads, not of a permanent character but sufficiently so to meet emergencies, where-ever canteens are opened. It is no use saying that we are not able to adapt ourselves to new circumstances. We can do it. The truth is, as the hon. Member for Hemsworth said, that wherever there are pit-head baths side by side with canteens, the hot meal canteens get more customers. Why? Because people do not feel comfortable with merely washing their hands or faces. They want a real good bath.<br/>
Will the Parliamentary Secretary endeavour during the next few months to persuade some of the Supply Departments to erect baths, perhaps somewhat similar to what we have seen in the American camps or in our own military camps in this country? They should be erected where canteens are open. Will the Parliamentary Secretary give us an undertaking that no more canteens will be opened until there are emergency bathing facilities to go with them? I believe that the hon. Member is as worried as we are why so few people are using the canteens in some areas. I would like to take housewives to the canteens and show them what good value their husbands are getting, and urge them to browbeat their husbands to go to the canteens, where they could get good value for their money.</p>

<p>As it is essential that we should get the Bill before a certain


time, perhaps it will be as well if I say now what I have to say. I suppose that this is one of the few Bills dealing with mining that can pass through the House without raising very violent controversy. That is because since 1930 we have seen in mining districts the value of the penny per ton levy. The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. G. Griffiths) said that miners would always revere the name of Sankey. It is true that when, in 1920, the Mining Industry Act created the Miners' Welfare Fund, Parliament did the mining industry a good turn. Out of the money there have been developed many social amenities, such as hospitals and convalescent homes and things too numerous to mention. Not the least of these developments was when the Miners' Welfare Commission started to pay attention to washing facilities at the pit. It is also true to say that we have been very backward as a country, compared with some others, with regard to the provision of washing facilities at collieries. In 1911, when Parliament made provision for it, it was so surrounded with limitations that it proved to be impracticable. Until after the last war no progress was made, but then an effort was made to establish washing facilities. There was a change in the attitude of the men.</p>

<p>Yes, certainly. We have seen a good deal of change with regard to the need of baths on both sides of the industry. At my own pit the proposal was turned down many years ago, but in 1925 I had the privilege of being present at the opening of baths at that pit-head. To-day, 60 per cent. of the men in the industry are employed at collieries where baths are provided. It is a definite object of this Bill to provide money up to 1951, when the whole question of miners' welfare comes up for reconsideration, in order to provide and hasten washing facilities at every colliery in the country. The Miners' Welfare Commission, in conjunction with the Minister of Fuel and Power, are in consultation with the Minister of Works to get a relative priority. I think I can assure the Committee&#x2014;I have sufficient evidence here&#x2014;that the Minister of Fuel and Power has the keenest determination to get this baths programme going as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I am coming to the points in proper sequence. The hon. Member asked whether we had been to certain of the Ministries to stake out our claim for certain things; undoubtedly we have. We have had some terrific arguments. It was only when we were faced with certain objections that there had to be somewhat of a slowing down. It might be useful to point out that when the Government decided in 1940 to stop the erection of pit-head baths owing to labour and other difficulties, there were 38 baths under construction. Twenty-four of them were completed, and 14 had to be stopped at various stages short of completion because the delivery of all materials and equipment could not be guaranteed. Since then six of them have been proceeded with, and we are constantly considering how best we can meet immediate needs, particularly when we are asking certain men to go into certain pits. I think I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. E. Walkden) that we will lose no opportunity of providing what facilities we can.<br/>
With regard to canteens, I agree with my hon. Friend that there are more people using full meal canteens where there are baths than at collieries where there are not baths. I know that some collieries that have not pit-head baths have provided washing facilities for hands. My hon. Friend may take it that we shall not delay in taking any opportunity of improving that side. It is perfectly true that the spending of this welfare money does bring in the question of canteen facilities generally, and the question of rehabilitation. With regard to the progress that has been made in canteens, that has been dealt with in Parliamentary question and answer, and therefore I do not need to weary the Committee now.<br/>
Regarding rehabilitation, the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sloan) asked a perfectly fair question as to what guarantee could be given that this rehabilitation will be continued after the war. I think he and I were at Gleneagles at the opening of that very fine hotel as a rehabilitation centre. He will be interested to know that a certain gentleman up there said to me at the opening, "How long do you think you will want this hotel?" I said, "As long as it is doing


useful work." With regard to the future, I think I can say this, having had the privilege of presenting to the Government the Report of the Committee that sat on medical services for miners, you can take it for granted that this rehabilitation has come to stay in the mining industry. If, after the war, we get a general scheme of rehabilitation, it may be possible to dovetail the miners' scheme in. That will be a matter for discussion later, but I think none can deny that there would be such a row in the mining industry if anybody attempted to limit that rehabilitation. And always remember that we rehabilitate not merely to get a man fit to get back to the pit and win coal for the war effort, but because it is the humane thing to do to get an injured man fit as quickly as possible. I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire that he may take it for granted that this rehabilitation has come to stay.</p>

<p>In reply to that, I would say that I cannot, and nobody else can, say that particular buildings now in existence will stay after the war. I have no authority for saying that. We were very much indebted to the Scottish Board of Health for the facilities they have provided for Scotland. While we cannot say that a particular building will remain for all time after the war, one can say this, that the facilities for rehabilitation will continue as long as there is a need for them in the mining industry.<br/>
The only other thing I have to say is that this extension of the welfare penny levy from the end of 1943 to the end of 1951 is a very welcome thing. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth talked about the alarm. He need not be alarmed. There was no intention on the part of my right hon. Friend of limiting in any shape or form the provision of pit-head baths. The only discussion was whether it was wiser to get the money now or leave it until after the war. Finally it was decided to get the money now, and that is the purpose of this Bill. I predict it will have a very smooth passage and that we shall ultimately see the benefit.<br/>
One final point. Some time, possibly on the Estimates, would it not be a good

thing to have a fairly general discussion on the progress that has been made in miners' welfare? If we do that, we may dispel a good deal of ignorance about the British mining industry, and we may be able to show that some real progress has been made. I do not hesitate to say&#x2014;I have the statement I used a few weeks ago in one colliery district showing the progress that has been made since the Welfare Fund was established in 1920&#x2014;that it is really remarkable progress, although, as the Chairman of the Welfare Commission has said, you do get differences in administration; but on the whole there has been a remarkable development. I have heard it described from platforms many times as the magic penny. It certainly has done a great amount of good. I hope that when the appropriate time comes Members in all parts of the House will be prepared to discuss, and discuss thoroughly, the progress that has been made since 1920 through the Miners' Welfare Commission and the Miners' Welfare Fund. At the moment we have to limit ourselves to discussion pertaining to the Bill.</p>

<p>As it is desired to have this Bill through very soon, I want to say that we welcome this, as miners, very sincerely indeed. Regarding what the Parliamentary Secretary has said on the question of the levy and pit-head baths, as to whether we should have the money now or defer it till the war is over, I will say that when the President of the Mineworkers' Federation, in a speech, seemed to imply that there was a danger regarding the levy nothing less than consternation went through the mining area. Some of my hon. Friends, Members from purely mining constituencies, would have liked to have had a word or two on this. There are a number of things we would have liked to have said. For instance, it appears to me that if we had been as interested in the miners as we ought to have been and we had taken the same steps even during the depression in regard to pit-head baths as with regard to mechanisation, we could have had every colliery in the coalfield to-day with a pit-head bath. We are also complaining about the lack of technicians. I would commend this, that in regard to the miners' scholarship scheme everything might be done to make the scheme as applicable as possible to as wide a number as we can so that we can


solve the question of technicians in the mining industry. I hope that when this comes up again my hon. Friend will be able to report some progress in some of the matters that have been mentioned with regard to labour and materials, so that the baths which have not been completed should be and those which have not been commenced may have been started and be in course of completion. We sincerely welcome this Bill.</p>

<p>I want to make a suggestion, but before making it I would like to express my agreement with the references that have been made to the changes and developments in miners' welfare. Anyone who cares to go back and read some of the reports of, say, 100 years back on the conditions in the mining industry, and then consider the situation in the mining industry to-day, could scarcely believe it to be the same industry which is being considered. At the same time it should be remembered that this progress up to where we are just now with the pit-head baths, rehabilitation, and the rest of it, has been one long struggle on the part of the miners and the miners' organisation. If ever there was an organisation of the working class or of any kind which has justified itself by the service it has given to those within its folds, it is surely the organisation of the miners which is now the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, which at all the different stages of organisation has played its part in building up a better conception of conditions for miners and in building up at the same time the strength of the union.<br/>
I would say that now, more than ever, when young men are being directed into the mines, is welfare necessary, particularly in connection with the provision of washing facilities at the pit-head baths. We have now got away from the old days, when in the evening if you went into a miner's house you would see the big kitchen with a stone floor and everywhere around heavy, dirty, wet clothes hanging, making home life almost impossible. We have got away from that, and as a result of the council houses and pit-head baths we have produced a better situation. I would say that with the coming of the lads into the pits as a result of the ballot we should do everything possible to get washing facilities. I suggest to the Minister that his Department should lay it down and demand the Government's

support for it when they lay it down that they will not be forced out of Gleneagles unless, and until, they get alternative accommodation of the same high standard. It would be a shame and a disgrace if the Ministry allowed golfers when the war is over to come back and turn the rehabilitation work out of Gleneagles.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That this House welcomes the statement made on behalf, of His Majesty's Government of the acceptance in principle of the right of Newfoundland to self-government; and urges His Majesty's Government to give effect to such approval by taking the necessary preliminary action as soon as practicable.</q>
I regret that I have to start with a bit of a grumble. The statement made by the Under-Secretary the last time we discussed Colonial matters was so mixed up with the general Debate as to lose its effectiveness. I have had cuttings from newspapers in Newfoundland which show that they are puzzled as to what happened, and that they have missed altogether the force and significance of that statement. I have called attention on other questions to the way this Government do the right thing in the wrong way, and thereby lose what credit it should have had and spoil the whole picture. This Debate may serve to put matters right on the other side. They commented over there on the fact that the three Members of the Mission appeared to be absent, and that other people who have shown an interest in Newfoundland affairs also appeared to be absent. They did not know that that discussion was spatchcocked into a Debate of an entirely different nature.<br/>
My colleagues and I have decided, particularly in view of the fact that we have less time than we expected, to divide between us the statement about our Mission which is, in fact, our report to the House. I am especially charged with what I will call the constitutional aspect. There are one or two preliminary statements which I want to make, which at first may appear irrelevant to the report of the Mission and to the Motion now before us, but as the Debate proceeds I think Members will see that the past history of Newfoundland accounts very much for the position existing there at present. Until we apprehend

that, we are likely to take a mere superficial view, exactly as one would in the case of any other State. The island was discovered in 1497. It was not until 1583 that it was formally taken possession of by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, in the name of this country. That meant that England had adopted her first child and the British Empire had begun. Then followed a long period of neglect&#x2014;one might call it child neglect, or parental forgetfulness&#x2014;which accounts very largely for the disposition of the population of the island. For more than a century and a half the original fisherfolk and settlers were not allowed to settle in the country, and, with a stubbornness born of their English blood, they maintained their position in little groups all around the island. That accounts to-day for the economic and constitutional situation. It would be well for hon. Members to keep those facts in mind, because they have a bearing on the situation that we discovered. In reporting on our work, at first I felt a little dubiety over the fact that three separate reports had been drawn up by us, and, may I say, without consultation with each other and without discussion, except in the sense that we discussed these matters with the same people. That adds more to the value of the fact that on the broad basis of the reports we have submitted there is very little disagreement: there is slight disagreement on matters of detail, but on fundamental matters we are in accord.<br/>
The Mission set about its work in unconventional and unorthodox manner. We did not sit in any central building in the capital, nor did we, wherever we went, sit in state and ask the people who ordinarily do such things to come and give evidence. We went to the people themselves, after having got our bearings and found out the distribution of people and interests. So we had a somewhat unique experience, I imagine, for a Mission representing Parliament. The very fact that travelling facilities in the country are so poor made our work very much more difficult than it otherwise would have been. While we travelled just over 3,000 miles, I hope I shall be understood when I say that that represents three or four times that amount of travel in any other country with ordinary facilities. Outside the Avalon Peninsula, there is hardly any train service, and what there is is not taken too seriously: it is no good making appointments, or hoping to be anywhere


by a certain date or a certain time. Also, the great shortage of roads makes travelling very difficult and very slow. So for a large part of the year, in the worst season of the year, people in different parts of the island are cut off from each other. There is little or no means of communication such as we are used to. If we do not get these facts into our minds, we lose sight of the difficulties which confronted the Mission and which now confront the Government.<br/>
We took our evidence and interviewed people on wharfsides, in sheds, on one occasion in a churchyard, in school halls, and more particularly in stores, because we found that the thing to do&#x2014;there are no shops outside St. John's, in the way we understand them&#x2014;was to go into a store and talk to the first person we met. Thus the grape vine telephone worked: things began to sink in. So we managed to get evidence, apart from anything we did of a formal character. My hon. and gallant Friend the Senior Burgess for Oxford University (Petty Officer A. Herbert) and my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Thornbury (Sir D. Gunston) came into contact especially with those who had served in the Forces in the last war and people of that sort, while I addressed a conference of the Labour people. Also, we were guests at a dinner at which every Labour representative on the island was invited and was present. They were the only gatherings of what I would call a formal kind, but they were important and helped us to make the necessary contacts. That, briefly, is the method on which we conducted our inquiries.<br/>
I propose to deal especially with the constitutional position. The difficulty we were up against was that nobody seemed to know quite what he wanted. Everybody had a vague idea&#x2014;which was a good one&#x2014;that he wanted to return to some form of self-government, but exactly what it was he did not know, except that he did not want to return to the position which existed just before the Commissioners were appointed.</p>

<p>Of course, it had reference to the Government, but they also said, "We do not want him, and we do not

want him," indicating that all the remnants of that Government had not disappeared, and that they did not want to be burdened with them again. That they expressed in no uncertain language. There were three or four alternatives which cropped up in discussion. There can be no question of any challenge whatever to the claim for responsible and representative government. The only dispute which might arise is as to how it should be given, and the appropriate time. If I may quote the Apostle Paul:
<q>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient.</q>
There was the question of the return to what they call responsible government, and there was the question of the continuance of the Commission Government. Some people had ideas of linking up with Canada, and some of linking up with the United States; that last suggestion found very few supporters, but it had its genesis in the fact that for the time the island is enjoying unexampled prosperity. That is largely brought about by the United States naval bases and military camps, and other places which they have built. These have brought much money to the Newfoundlanders and plentiful employment: no fewer than 20,000 persons have been engaged therein. These people, forgetting their past history, are beginning to think that if they link up with the United States that sort of thing was going to continue. The Mission were quite clear that they could dismiss that anyway as a serious proposition. Then there is the question of linking up with Canada. There is a large number of people who want that, but an overwhelming number who are against it. I think that the Mission are right&#x2014;although I may speak with prejudice in saying that&#x2014;in thinking that that is a matter which can be decided only by Newfoundland, not a matter which can be imposed upon Newfoundland from here in any way. That brings me to the question started by the hon. and gallant Member for Altrincham (Sir E. Grigg) of a system similar to that of Northern Ireland. It was felt that the long distances separating us and a variety of other considerations put that out of the question altogether.<br/>
We are left with two issues, either to restore responsible Government or to try to find a middle course and to approach it in steps. You cannot isolate the constitutional position from the economic posi-


tion, and that is something which I hope the House will keep clearly in mind all through these discussions. Just now Newfoundland is enjoying a period of prosperity such as it has not known since the last war, but the fact that it also enjoyed prosperity during the last war and was afterwards plunged into the depths of misery and poverty should make us very careful how we view the position in this connection. There is more than one factor which has led to that prosperity, but the dominating one consists of the United States air bases and the military encampments that have been built there and also of Canada with its air bases. We cannot ignore the fact that both Iceland and Norway have been out of business as far as fishing is concerned, and that also is bound to have its effect. We find there reasons for Newfoundland's prosperity, but as the possibility of war begins to recede from the far West, so we can see that prosperity will recede, and already the peak of the prosperity period has passed.<br/>
Now will begin the period of declension. It is essential that steps be taken as soon as possible to prevent Newfoundland entering the terrible depths of depression at the time when the people had only an allowance of 3d. a day, or not more than 2s. a week at the outside, to assist them over that period. A few of the clergy and priests we met out there told us how acute was the hunger. That factor has to be taken into consideration when we consider the problems concerned with regard to the Constitution. Differing only a trifle as to the period of time for development, the Mission have arrived at the idea that there must be a compromise position for a time between commission government and that of responsible government. They have suggested to the Department that Commissioners should be nominated from this side and that those from the other side should be elected by a general franchise of the country, so by that means we could begin to bring them into some knowledge and use of the franchise to which they have been unused for some time.<br/>
There is strong criticism of the Commission of Government; nobody can deny that. At the same time a good deal of it arises because of the manner in which they were first appointed and the difficulties

under which they have laboured since, some of their own making. The Commission of Government was appointed at the request of the Parliamentary Government of Newfoundland itself.</p>

<p>That is how they came to be appointed. Following on from that, there was also the period when the world was in a bad state economically, about the period of the May Report. That also made it difficult and probably accounted for the way in which the Commission was appointed. I believe that in better times that Government would have been differently constituted. We sent out three civil servants from this country with all the qualities and all the weaknesses of the Civil Service. They were honest, hardworking and took great care in discharging their duties faithfully and well, but with not much understanding of getting into contact with the public or public opinion. They made two very bad mistakes at the kick-off. Important as some economic things are, if you injure national sentiment you cut very much more deeply than anything else. Almost the first thing that was done was to close the Colonial building, which had been the Parliament House since 1855, and to abolish its insignia and the symbols of Parliament, at once creating the impression that it was the intention of the Government on this side to wipe out every possibility of a return to responsible government. One cannot characterise that as other than rather a stupid thing to do. In addition, on the grounds of economy they swept away their national museum and nobody knows where the contents are distributed&#x2014;little things, the House may say, but they are rather important in the life of a nation. But they did other things for which they have received no credit. They lacked what the hon. and gallant Member who seconds the Amendment does not lack&#x2014;a sense of publicity and a way of "getting across" to the country what they were doing and what they intended. One did not know what they had actually done by way, of improvement, but as a matter of fact they had introduced hospitals which were not there before. They had started a welfare service and a few other things which were not very spectacular but were of wide importance to the nation itself. I have by a happy coincidence a cutting, received as


late as last night, sent to me from St. John's&#x2014;it is from one of the principal newspapers, "The Evening Telegram,' of 6th December&#x2014;and I will read the following extract:
<q>While without doubt more could have been expected of Commission of Government in bringing about a better balanced economy, it cannot be claimed that when affairs were in our own control much attention was given to such matters. Administration after administration chose to tolerate in the salt cod industry the pernicious system of tal qual which encouraged shiftlessness in the curing of the country's main product. Such was the lack of insistence upon the quality of the exports that the markets for Newfoundland salt fish, Newfoundland lobsters and Newfoundland herring dwindled. Such was the indifference to the need for protection of the game life that such animals as the caribou were all but exterminated. So little regard was paid to the value of the timber and water power resources that they were disposed of to speculators for next to nothing. Although there was crying need for improved medical facilities, outside St. John's there was not a single hospital, with the exception of those provided by the Grenfell Institute and the Twillingate Memorial largely maintained by the people of the North-East coast. Even when conditions were at their worst, evidence of venality in public life was, not lacking.</q>
That was before Commission of Government went in and referred not only to the last Government but <ob/>an over a number of Governments elected by its own people. This, mark you, is in a paper which has been strongly insistent that they must have their own right of self-government and which shares its views with the "Daily News," the leading paper in Newfoundland. We saw the articles of the hon. Member opposite which are syndicated on that Continent in this paper from time to time.</p>

<p>That was the position we were up against. In addition to what we propose with regard to the Commission themselves we also suggest that it is not quite in keeping with his position, nor is it fair, that the Governor should continue to be Chairman of the Commission. It places him in an invidious position in that he might seem to take sides, but, after all, he is the King's representative. Although fully qualified as this gentleman undoubtedly is, and against whom there is not a word of criticism, either from us or from Newfoundland, from the very nature of things he has not the training neither the experience to appreciate a position like that. Therefore we have sug-

gested that there should be a chairman appointed by the Governor after his choice had been agreed to by the members of the new Commission and this we suggest as a half-way house. In addition we suggest that a Treasury official should go out there to advise and that he should, have power, up to whatever might be the agreed amount, to consent to expenditure on the spot rather than that every trumpery bit of expenditure should have to be referred back to London in order to obtain assent to it. We also suggest that two or three highly placed civil servants should go out from this country to advise in Newfoundland and that similar civil servants should come over here from Newfoundland in order to obtain a training in this country and so by that means gradually to build up a Civil Service. Those, in broad outline, are the main proposals we suggest with regard to the Commission government themselves.</p>

<p>Would the hon. Gentleman allow me to ask him a question really to bring out a point? Are he and the hon. Friends who accompanied the deputation aware that several Members of this House, including myself, who have paid private visits to Newfoundland in recent years, have approached the appropriate authorities&#x2014;the Dominions Office&#x2014;with very much the same sort of proposals that he has made and that to date not the slightest notice has been taken of any of the suggestions that have been made?</p>

<p>I hope they are going to realise it to-day, though I do not know. We cannot expect that Newfoundland can stand on her feet alone economically, so we have ventured to put proposals to the Dominions Office whereby they must be helped. If we want a British Empire, we must be expected to shoulder the responsibilities as well as the glory.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member will allow me, I will develop that point in


my own way. There should be laid down a ten years' scale of economic development, and for that purpose there should be a loan, in agriculture, education, health, roads, transport and other services. That must be backed by a development loan from this side, in order that Newfoundland may be put on her feet. That brings me to the point asked by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter). My colleagues and I do not accept the view for one moment that Newfoundland cannot give a decent standard of life to an even larger population than she has now if she is given the proper opportunity to develop. If this scheme of development were accepted, she could administer it on her own. That is the idea we have put before the Dominions Office. I do not accept the view that Newfoundland cannot feed herself. Moreover, the main part of her revenue is raised by taxes on imported goods. That in itself means, of necessity, an increased cost of living and bears most heavily on the poorest people in the community. When we were asked, "Cannot you do something to reduce the cost of living?" we replied, "It is impossible while you maintain that system of raising your revenue."<br/>
Denominationalism and sectarianism also have to be taken into consideration. We have put forward proposals for starting and developing a Civil Service Commission, somewhat on the lines of our own, which would be more effective than anything else in sweeping away this denominationalism and sectarianism. Each of us has written a report of over 30,000 words, apart from appendices, so the House can imagine how difficult it is to say all one wants to say in the available time.<br/>
With regard to the Motion on the Order Paper, by good luck there came to me in the post last night cuttings from recent issues of "The Evening Telegram" and "The Daily News," which are the newspapers in that island. Both bear out the testimony that they do not feel that they can yet be given the full state of responsible government. Let me give the House the benefit of their opinion. "The Evening Telegram" for 30th November states:
<q>In view of the absence of anything which could be described as an insistent demand by

the general public for the immediate restoration of Newfoundland's former status it is not an unreasonable inference that they were not particularly impressed with any desire for an immediate change.&#x2026;</q>
"The Daily News" for 3rd December states:
<q>As this newspaper has observed time and again we have failed as a people to exhibit active interest in our own political and economic destiny.&#x2026; Even now, when a debate on our political status is about to take place in Parliament, the public is satisfied to leave all public comment to the Press.&#x2026; It is at the door of the Commission of Government that failure to enlarge local government must be laid since the political education of the people of Newfoundland was a direct charge upon it. Local government will not develop far or fast if left to the voluntary decision of the people as the difficulties encountered in some communities amply demonstrate.&#x2026;</q>
Again, "The Evening Telegram" of 4th December states:
<q>It can scarcely be shown that up to the present the population has displayed the strong insistence which might reasonably have been expected to be restored the rights of the franchise &#x2026; neither the daily nor the weekly newspapers are deluged with letters demanding a return to responsible government.</q>
That is the view of Newfoundland.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows that these people represent more than anything those most clamorous for a return to the old affairs. They have changed their views considerably in the light of more recent events. That is the case I put forward. It would be ten times worse than last time if we gave responsible self-government to Newfoundland and she fell into the same trouble again. This House, the Government and the country will fail in their duty to Newfoundland if, while admitting and recognising the right to restore full self-government as soon as possible, they did not take steps to see that when they do so Newfoundland would be in a position to develop and maintain her country economically to the fullest possible extent. It is along those lines that we make our recommendations. We must use our thought, discrimination and sympathy in determining the right moment and the best possible circumstances to give Newfoundland full self-government. The proposals we have put forward will help to give them the guidance for which they have asked in these newspaper articles. We have to remember


the strategic importance of Newfoundland in the days to come. It is doubly essential that we should not run a risk by placing in her hands power which she will not be able to utilise properly. We should make sure that what we do for Newfoundland is well founded, so that she can not only stand on her own feet but will be able to walk.</p>

<p>I had hoped to catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, later in the Debate, but as the Debate itself started rather later than expected it might perhaps be for the convenience of the House if I followed the admirable speech of my hon. Friend the Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon). As he said, I will deal rather more with Newfoundland's economic problems and prospects, which will perhaps be of some assistance to the House in deciding whether or not to approve of the Motion. I would like to say how much I agree with everything my hon. Friend said and to associate myself with his remarks about the kindness we received in Newfoundland from the Governor, Lady Walwyn, the Commission and every section of the community. It is difficult, of course, to get public opinion where you have not much local government and where there is not even a village moot, such as our English "pub." But we went out into the highways and byways, and we met clergymen of every denomination. I should say that there must be more clergymen per man-power in Newfoundland than in any other country in the-world? We met merchants and fishermen of all classes. They are a delightful people, and, like all who wrestle daily with the forces of nature, they are very religious. We must remember that because, owing to religious training in Newfoundland there is less crime there than in any other country. They are very loyal and their outlook is very much the same as ours.<br/>
The people there are marvellously hospitable and have wonderful manners. Perhaps I might illustrate those manners by quoting the last signal which my hon. and gallant Friend the Senior Burgess for Oxford University (Petty Officer Herbert) and I received as we were leaving St. John's in a destroyer. The signal sent by some of our Newfoundland friends was:
<q>There are more tears than water in our whisky to-night.</q>

That signal gave us courage to feel that our journey was not in vain and that somehow we had got across. I would like to congratulate the Government on the boldness and rapidity of their announcement. I would like to congratulate the Secretary of State and the Deputy-Prime Minister, who was Secretary of State and who has been to Newfoundland and has taken a great interest in that country. I would like to thank him for the opportunity he gave me, and the privilege, of allowing me to go on the Mission. It has now been announced that Newfoundlanders themselves shall decide what form of Constitution they want. That, again, shows that our journey has not been in vain.<br/>
I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for North Camberwell said about the Commission of Government. They have done a fine job. They have increased health services, brought in compulsory education, though not quite so compulsory as we would like&#x2014;but it is on the right lines&#x2014;and they have instituted a permanent Civil Service. Before that there was the spoils system in which whole offices changed when the Government went out. Complicated by the fact that even down to crossing-sweepers people had to be given offices according to the proportion of their religious denomination. That has been swept away. The Commission of Government has also done great work in establishing co-operative societies. I admit, of course, that it is not a popular Government. No Government that has been in office for 10 years is very popular. But nearly every critic of the Commission of Government ended by saying, "Mind you, the Commission has done a great job." I do not think that the hon. Member for Bridgeton (Mr. Maxton) has ever given that much praise to this democratically elected Government of all parties and talents that graces the Front Bench.<br/>
I did find a great difference of opinion. Nobody wants responsible government now, and if such a proposal were put on the Order Paper by my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter) and were put to the vote, I do not think it would get any vote except his own. But I found that there was great doubt about after the war, and the curious thing is that trade unions and co-operative societies are more apprehensive about


return to responsible government than the merchants of St. John's. Many said they wanted responsible government <i>x</i> years after the war, but the further we journeyed from St. John's the greater the size of <i>x</i> grew. Perhaps my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Oxford (Petty Officer Herbert) will enlarge on the feeling in Newfoundland about St. Johns and its lack of popularity among the rest of the population.<br/>
I should like to turn to the really important question which is fundamental to our discussion, whether Newfoundland can stand alone. It has a population of 300,000, scattered over 6,000 miles of coastline, in a country not very much smaller than England. Some people have suggested that she might go in with the United States or amalgamate or confederate with Canada. I quite agree that that is a question that can only finally be decided by Newfoundlanders and Newfoundlanders alone, but I am sure if it was put to the vote it would be overwhelmingly defeated. But why should we be defeatist? This is a country which has more experience of Empire problems than any nation and are more likely to solve this difficult Imperial puzzle than any other. I believe this country alone can assist Newfoundland to become self-supporting. It may be asked what guarantee we have that the position will not lapse into what it was after the last war. Remember that Newfoundland imports nearly all her necessities of life and has to pay for them by exports. Her chief export is, of course, cod. It has been the custom of the Newfoundland fisheries in the past to catch the cod, split it and salt it and sell it to the Mediterranean, Spanish and South American countries, countries with the lowest standard of living. I think after the war there will be a demand for all kinds of food, because Europe will be more or less starving and there will be a demand for salt cod. But the great hope of the Newfoundland fisheries is the reorganisation of the fisheries which is now taking place. A new process has been established, and it is successful. It consists in buying the cod as it is caught from the fishermen, and filleting it, sharp freezing it, wrapping it in attractive celophane wrappers and sending it over to the British and United States markets. I do not know whether Great Britain will be able to take

this product after the war, but an enormous amount depends on whether the United States will import this attractive article of food. Contrary to what many people believe, the United States as a whole are not a great fish-eating nation, but they are now buying this new product, and it is getting to the American market. The Government after the war will, no doubt, by Trade Treaties endeavour to see that it enters the American market on favourable terms. If it can get into the American market&#x2014;I think it will&#x2014;the whole situation will be altered. Instead of selling the cod to countries with a low standard of living, they will be selling to the United States with a higher standard.<br/>
But that is not the end of the story, because at the moment in regard to the salt cod industry, the fisherman has to catch his cod and split it and salt it. He has to do that as well as fish. That means that he has not sufficient time to fish. Now he can sell direct to the factories and go back and catch more fish. In addition to that, the factories are employing girls, many of them of the fishermen's families, so that more money comes into the homes. Further, while in the salt cod industry only about 40 per cent. is used in the factories, the whole of the fish is processed and made into fillets, cod liver oil and the offal into fish meal and fertilisers. The new factories will attract in that way ancillary industries. The whole question depends on this new development, and many enterprising Newfoundland firms are erecting these factories. We saw any amount of them. But more money will be required, and the Government must help in the long-term development plan. I understand that the whole plan is in the Dominions Office. I hope it will not lie in the overburdened, weighed down and groaning pigeon holes of the Dominion Office, but will be put into practice.<br/>
The other prospect that I see for helping the country is agriculture and timber. I hope my hon. and gallant Friend will tell the House something about timber and the paper companies. I want to come to agriculture. No country can have a proper economic balance if it does not possess an agriculture. It is very difficult to farm in Newfoundland. You cannot just go out and dig or plough. You have to drain the bog, an expensive process, and clear the forest&#x2014;but I think it can be done. There have been various settlements established which are working well,


but it is a very heartbreaking job for a man to clear the timber before he begins to cultivate the land. I believe it ought to be done by the Government using skilled men to clear large tracts of land so that it will be possible to establish mixed farms. Newfoundland suffers from malnutrition and has the lowest consumption of fresh milk in the world. I am convinced that with a proper system of agriculture it will be possible to produce enough protective food, such as fresh meat, milk and vegetables and so on, to feed the people. Coupled with agriculture is the tourist industry. If properly developed, it can do an enormous amount and give employment. Newfoundland possesses wonderful sporting possibilities. It has the finest salmon rivers in the world. None of them have been sold or let. I hope that policy will be continued. Anyone who goes to Newfoundland can fish in the finest rivers in the world on payment of a small licence fee, but it is no good them going if they cannot go to the rivers and have nowhere to stay. The Tourist Association, a voluntary body, is doing very fine work and has put up some log cabins, but much more is required. It must be undertaken by the Government. They must build holiday camps and a certain amount of roads. I do not suggest a great road building programme which might not be economical.<br/>
Curiously enough, the future of the tourist traffic and the future of farming go very much together. The best salmon rivers and the best agricultural land are on the West coast running up to the Codonoy Valley to the Upper Humber. It will be quite easy, by connecting up some roads, to drive a road from Pont au Basque where the American tourists would land to the upper Humber and so develop the tourist traffic and agriculture. You would kill two birds with one stone, or shall I say develop two industries by one road by that means. This will require money, but I believe it can be done fairly cheaply by building roads and settlements, rest houses and hotels, by the use of skilled labour. By an extraordinarily fortunate coincidence we have in this country at this moment the Newfoundland lumber unit. I have just spent five days with them. The Newfoundland Forestry and Lumber Unit is doing a great work in Scotland. The men know each

other and are accustomed to building roads and erecting camps and clearing trees. I suggest that this unit ought to be kept together&#x2014;they are helping the United Nations to win the war&#x2014;after the war let them go back to Newfoundland as a unit and help to develop their own country.<br/>
Do not underrate the tourist traffic. We all know that France drew an enormous revenue from it before the last war, but does the House know that Canada, that great wheat and exporting country, actually got more from the tourist traffic before the war than from the whole of her wheat? That is an astonishing fact. Here is a country, with all these amenities, which might well attract a lot of visitors, and there can be no more attractive country in which to spend a holiday. Newfoundland is right on the map now in regard to Trans-Atlantic Air Travel. Anyone who has gone into the question knows that it is only profitable, or the least unprofitable, when the long hop is as small as possible. The longer the hop the greater the amount of petrol you have to carry and the less the pay load. Therefore trans-Atlantic aeroplanes will be bound to land at the nearest point each side of the Atlantic. The nearest point to Great Britain is Gander in Newfoundland. The other nearest point is Goose Bay in the Labrador. I am very sorry to hear that has been leased to Canada for 99 years. I must speak frankly and tell the House that Newfoundland resents this very much. I must tell the House what the feeling of Newfoundland in the matter is, but I hope at any rate that though Goose Bay has been leased for military purposes the rights of Newfoundland in regard to civil flying have been preserved.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend knows that they were not consulted then, nor were they consulted in regard to the leasing of the American bases, which they took in an extraordinarily good spirit and realised it was all part of the united war effort. I do not think any of us realise what that meant to Newfoundland. After all, you can sit in the middle of St. John's and see one of the bases that have been leased. I do not think, human


nature being what it is, they like it. We would not if Hyde Park had been leased to Canada for 99 years. The fact that you have a terminus is very important; we know trans ocean steamers give the most employment at ports of final destination. The Transatlantic aeroplanes will use Gander and Goose as the Western Atlantic Termini. I believe the proper development of air travel can help Newfoundland very much in employment and in bringing the Island into closer contact with this country.<br/>
I want to say a word about the Newfoundland war effort. Newfoundland has a population of 40,000 men between 20 and 40, and 10,000 of them have joined the Forces, while 3,000 have come over as lumbermen. Others are busily engaged in fishing and getting food for the United Nations. Yet 1,500 have joined the Mercantile Marine. It is a wonderful record. After the last war we took away the R.N.R. training ship&#x2014;one of the worst things we have ever done. They are marvellous natural seamen and they resented the training ship being taken away. After the war ships will be wanted to carry Newfoundland fish products, and they ought to be manned by Newfoundlanders. I hope that the Government will let them have an R.N.R. training ship there and start some scheme for training Newfoundlanders for the Mercantile Marine. Anybody who fought in France in the last war knew how wonderfully well the Royal Newfoundland Regiment fought. We went to their memorial service on the anniversary of Beaumont Hamel which they hold as their commeration day. After the war the regiment was disbanded. Now there are two Newfoundland Regiments of Artillery which are showing the usual Newfoundland spirit. We should not forget that Newfoundland Budget now shows a surplus and is lending a lot of it free of interest to this country. It would be a gracious act and much appreciated if we recognised the great war effort of Newfoundland by establishing a regular Newfoundland regiment, to be called the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. In order to ease the country's Budget, I suggest that it should be paid for by the British Treasury. I would not keep it in Newfoundland. Let it do its tour of duty abroad like any other regiment, and while

it is abroad let there be a British regiment in Newfoundland. That is a way to keep the two islands together. Why not go further and after the war let British regiments do their tour of duty in the Dominions and the Dominion regiments come and do their tour of duty in this country? That would be a fine way of bringing the Empire into greater personal contact.<br/>
The suggestions I have made, together with the suggestions of the hon. Member about social reforms, will cost money, but it would not be a fantastic figure. As far as I can ascertain, we could carry out this development programme and extend the social services at an expenditure of about &#x00A3;20,000,000 spread over 10 years. If we went in for a cheeseparing policy it might not cost less, but at the end we should have unhappiness and discontent. I suggest that with an expenditure which would be only about double as much as the grant-in-aid before the war, there would be something to show at the end of it. Surely it would be much better to spend money on developing the country and at the end have Newfoundland a proud asset and not an unwilling liability. For the constitutional reason it is important to help her to become self-supporting because if she does not she will be driven into choosing a half-way house. She can choose a half-way house if she likes, but I want her to be in a position in which she can go the whole hog if she so desires. How can this be done? I believe it can be done by working on some such lines as the Colonial Development Fund and Welfare Act. It would be possible under that Act to give a loan to Newfoundland free of interest for five years and at a low rate of interest for five more years. This would not interfere with her aim of self-government because, though that money might have to be under the control of the United Kingdom, it would in no way interfere with any of the ordinary functions which would come under the newly elected Government. I would put a string on that money because Newfoundlanders themsleves, who have a great suspicion of the old gang, would like to feel that it would be spent on development and would not be diverted to other purposes.<br/>
I left Newfoundland much more hopeful than when I went there. I believe that if we help her to develop herself, young progressive people and people who are


returning from overseas, realising that we see her worth and her importance, will be encouraged and will have faith in their own country. I did find a certain amount of defeatism. Let us help them to have faith and the will to get together and to organise among themselves in order to get a decent Government; they must not fail again. I am sure that if we take bold, far-sighted and generous measures the people in their turn will do their best to see that Newfoundland, which is not only the oldest Colony but the place, they and we are proud to remember, where the British Empire was founded, can become one of the more prosperous and the best governed parts of the British Empire.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in line 4, to leave out "as soon as practicable," and to add "forthwith."<br/>
I was reluctant to be called at this point, owing to the fact that the two hon. Members who would normally give me their support have unfortunately both had to leave the precincts, and in the event of their not coming back before I have concluded my oration. I am in the difficult position of being dependent entirely on the good will of other Members of the House and on my ability to persuade someone to second the Amendment. I want to bring to the notice of the House precisely what we have the opportunity of discussing to-day. The three hon. Members who formed the informal goodwill Mission to Newfoundland have put on the Order Paper a Motion in which they call upon the Government to take the necessary preliminary action for self-government as soon as practicable. All that I am suggesting in the Amendment is that the House should call upon the Government to take the necessary preliminary action forthwith. We do not ask that the Government should immediately take steps to get going a general election in Newfoundland. I am merely urging that the preliminary steps towards a restoration of self-government should not have to wait until the Government think it is practicable to take steps. I think that at the conclusion of this Debate the Government should have an instruction from the House of Commons to begin now to take the preliminary steps. I am making a very small demand. I am more insistent in making it because the Under-Secretary of State, in his speech on Government

policy in the Debate on the Address on Dominion affairs made this statement, and I have difficulty in understanding its true significance. In reply to an interruption by the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter), he said:
<q>My hon. Friend is very impatient. If he will wait a little, he will hear a little more. There is, however, a widespread feeling that the return by even one single step to full responsible government would be a great mistake."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd December, 1943: col. 599, Vol. 395.]</q>
It is the Government's view apparently that they must not take even one small step.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. Member has misunderstood what I said. What I meant was that to go straight from the present position back to the position which existed before the suspension of the Constitution and to do it in one single step would be a mistake, for public opinion in Newfoundland would be against taking one single step back to the position that existed before the suspension.</p>

<p>I know all about the alternatives. I wanted to be clear on the other point. I do not pretend to minimise the difficulties of this problem. I congratulate the three hon. Gentlemen who went out there on the very excellent work that they did. I chaffed about their going and made jests about it, but since they came back they have written reports of 30,000 words each. They were good enough to give me the opportunity of reading them, presumably all with the same idea that I required considerable education on the subject. I did each one of them the honour of reading the reports from beginning to end, and I admit that they were of great educational value to myself. In particular, I went through the report of the hon. and gallant Mem-


ber for Oxford University (Petty-Officer Herbert), hoping for light entertainment as I go to his other literary efforts. I was disappointed. There was a distinguished writer in my young days called Barry Pain, who delivered himself of the aphorism that nothing aggravates a man more than to be disbelieved on one of the few occasions when he tells the truth. A humorist must also feel that it is hard that on the one occasion when he does a bit of serious work it should be taken as a jest. I pay a tribute to the hon. Member and say that it was not a bit of humorous writing but a first-class study of both the geographical and the psychological problems involved.<br/>
Each of the hon. Members wrote his own report, and created a precedent which, I think, would be useful if it could be carried one step further. Those of us who have been members of Committees or Commissions appointed by this House know that usually we are got into alignment and append our names to some rather dull formal document. The three hon. Members in this case were too individualistic to do that and each produced his own bit of work. It should be carried one step further; the Government should allow the three documents to see the light of day. It is all wrong that they should be circulated only in the very limited way that individual Members can do it privately. They did excellent work in surveying the problems and setting forth their ideas, and it would have been more gracious if, instead of asking the three hon. Members to submit their own Motion to the House to-day&#x2014;and I argued for a Motion through the usual channels&#x2014;the Government had themselves put a Motion on the Order Paper in which, among other things, they expressed their thanks to the three hon. Members. Not only had they to do the job of going to Newfoundland but they have had to come back here and undertake Parliamentary propaganda for getting something done.<br/>
Having said those things, I come now to the issue before us. When the hon. Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon) was speaking he repeated what has been said again and again by the Government, that it was from the people of Newfoundland that the demand came for the taking away of their democratic assembly. Though that is true it is an

awfully unfair statement. This island of hard-working, simple folk came up in 1930&#x2013;31&#x2013;32&#x2013;33&#x2013;34 against economic difficulties that were facing the world. They were caught in a mess. They had borrowed money in London and in Wall Street and they were being messed about by their creditors. I suppose it would be regarded as immoral advice if I said the right thing for them to have done was what every business man does when he gets into an inextricable financial mess, He takes proceedings in bankrupty. He says, "There are my assets and there are my debts. Here you are, make the best of it." He pays, perhaps, 2s. 6d. in the &#x00A3;, or 6d., or something of that kind. But Newfoundland did not want to do that and the British Government did not want them to do it.<br/>
They were not the only country in the world that had this particular problem. Germany had it. No single problem in Germany leading to the rise of Nazi power was more potent than this problem of external debt and the inability to pay the interest. When the great Labour and Socialist International met in Vienna in 1931 to discuss ways and means of helping the German people in their difficulties, the one recommendation they could make was to tell them to change their bankers and get better terms for their external loans. In this country in 1931 the Labour Government, of which the hon. Member for North Camberwell was a member, came up against exactly the same thing. They were in difficulties with the bankers both in London and Wall Street, and there were the spokesmen of the Conservative Party on the Opposition Front Bench, and they just simply held up the white flag and surrendered and the National Government came into power The Newfoundlanders were not the only body of people who found in 1931 or round about that time that it was tremendously difficult for a democracy to keep its head above water. They were ground between the upper and the nether millstones. There were unemployed populations crying for bread on the one hand and bankers calling for their interest and dividends on the other. It was in these circumstances that the political leaders of Newfoundland requested that Newfoundland's Constitution should be suspended.</p>

<p>The hon. Member admitted it, but I am laying an entirely different emphasis upon it. I am pointing out that when the Newfoundlanders were up against problems that Russia solved by revolution, that Hitler met by a Fascist r&#x00E9;gime, and that this country met by a National Government, they said "We have thrown in our hand too. We cannot carry on." It is not fair, in my view, to bring that up as an argument in favour of our being rather leisurely about the restoration of self-government. I have the Statute and the report of the Debate in this House. The House is bound, in honour, to restore self-government to Newfoundland as soon as it has got out of its financial difficulties and is sailing again on an even financial keel. As I said in a previous Debate, Newfoundland is to-day in a better financial position than is Great Britain. We are getting into debt every month, every week; we are borrowing all over the place. Newfoundland is not only not borrowing but is lending, and lending to His Majesty's Government free of interest. Therefore, I say, the conditions have now been met that make it obligatory upon this House to restore self-government to Newfoundland. But there is the other point, and that is what the Government are resting upon now, and what the Commissioners are backing them up in, and that is that there must be a request from Newfoundland as well. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] What about the quotations that the hon. Member for North Camberwell read?</p>

<p>In the Schedule to the Act there are the two conditions: one, financial solvency, and the other an expressed wish from the Newfoundland people. We started asking Questions in Parliament about this business 12 months ago, on the initiative of people in Newfoundland, who remembered that when, in 1933, their Parliament

was taken away I had put up a fairly strenuous opposition to the change. Quite spontaneously, without any approach from me, letters and cables began to come to me from different sections of the community in Newfoundland&#x2014;from individuals, from professional men, from trades unions and from a body which has the resounding title of "The Board of Trade," though I understand that in Newfoundland it is not a part of the structure of Government, as is the case with the Board of Trade in this country, but is the representative organisation of the business community round about St. John's. Are the three hon. Members who went to Newfoundland trying to tell me that the trade union leaders, the professional men and the Board of Trade, who wrote to me urging that Newfoundland should have self-government restored have all changed their minds? I did not ask them to ask me, they did it on their own; and yet the three hon. Members come back and report to us that there is no desire among the people there for the immediate restoration of self-government and, indeed, that there is reluctance on the part of Newfoundlanders to take an active part in political life.<br/>
For the last three weeks I have been spending some time in a place called Acton, and the results of the activities out there were seen after Question time in the House to-day. There was returned to this honourable House after a three weeks' campaign a Member of Parliament who had fewer votes than his predecessor had a majority. Only 16 per cent. of the electors were sufficiently interested to go to the poll. That was in London, where the Mother of Parliaments lives, where they have the benefits of a great daily Press, where they have more Members of Parliament than we have for the whole of Scotland, where they have that great democratic assembly, the London County Council, and God knows how many local borough councils in addition&#x2014;28, I believe. Only 16 per cent. of the electorate took the trouble to vote after having been stimulated for about three weeks by four different groups. If I had wandered up to Acton, a stranger in a strange land, as the three good-will missionaries wandered into Newfoundland, and started calling on the people, as I understand our friends did in Newfoundland, or speaking to them in "pubs" or at street corners and saying


to them, "What do you think about a General Election; how do you think Great Britain ought to be governed?" what do hon. Members think their response would be? Some of my hon. Friends suggest that I could not tell what their answer would be without being vulgar, and I do not intend to be vulgar.<br/>
We had a two days' Debate on foreign affairs this week, and I heard hon. Member after hon. Member describe exactly how Germany is to be governed, how Yugoslavia is to be governed and what should be done about the Lebanon and Algiers. In fact they discussed what was to be done in almost every corner of the globe. It appears that we know just exactly what we are going to do; we are going to re-educate the Germans among other things. The British Empire that has had democracy for the best part of a century, and the three Commissioners and the Government all think that they are not fit to be trusted with democracy until a considerable period of time has elapsed and a process of re-education has taken place. That might be a good way to treat Germans; I do not know. I do not think it would even work with Germans.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Speaker. I can only apologise and say that I do not often have to merit your rebuke. I will keep very close to the matter under discussion, but I think that the word "forthwith" should be substituted for "as soon as possible," so that the preliminary steps can be put into operation immediately and an election held in Newfoundland. I feel that the people of Newfoundland should be brought up against their own problems as soon as possible, so that they can make up their minds how to face the responsibilities of self-government and so that they can begin to organise political parties and get people interested. They must face all the essentials now, before a General Election can be held. The fact that the Commission of Government will do this thing and the next thing, and so on, and that they will spend &#x00A3;20,000,000

in social services in exchange for democracy is no contribution to how Newfoundland is to be governed. I could give you a whole lot of advice as to the steps which ought to be taken. I could suggest to you that trade unionists who have the necessary knowledge could go out and get in touch with their opposite numbers in Newfoundland and get things done. I could suggest a whole variety of ways in which the people of Newfoundland could be stimulated into making the most of their island and getting a decent existence for themselves, but it is not my job. My job here is to see that the people of Newfoundland are put into the political position to do all these things for themselves, and, therefore, I am asking the House, while recognising the good work that the three visitors have done, and while recognising the statement that has been made twice from that bench, that the Government should recognise their statutory and moral responsibility in this matter. It is not good enough merely to recognise that responsibility in an academic way. The Dominions Office must be told that Newfoundland must start now to prepare for self-government. I beg to move.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I was not in the House when the independence of Newfoundland was taken away, but I was responsible for the various Amendments that were on the Paper at that time when the taking away of the freedom of the Newfoundland


people was determined on the Floor of this House. Consequently, I have a good deal of interest in this question. I think that the House would be doing a great service to the people of Newfoundland and a great service to the people of this country, and to the cause of democracy generally, if this Amendment were accepted and carried to-day. I would like to join with my hon. Friend in thanking the Commissioners who went to Newfoundland for their services, but at the same time I would desire to make the point that their political colour and their political outlook were practically the same. They were all Members of a very Conservative political outlook. It is possibly true that they were from different parties, but, possibly, the main difference in their political outlook was that their sense of humour was slightly different rather than their political sense. I do not think that there is any real ground now for not giving to the people of Newfoundland the immediate opportunity to govern themselves. They have fulfilled all their financial obligations They are just as well in the position to govern themselves as those wise men of Gotham who are in charge at the present time under the supervision of the British Government here.<br/>
When I look across at that Bench, and without wanting to be the least bit disrespectful to the Minister in charge today, I feel that some of the people I have met in Newfoundland would be just as capable of governing as anyone on that Bench. In seconding this Amendment I want to say this. Just now there is a great deal of discussion as to the future government of this country and that country. There is the question that arouses a great deal of attention in the United States of America as to what is going to be the future of the bases that the United States have got in several parts of the world. I notice also that the editor of a famous paper in the United States has suggested that Scotland should come into the United States of America as a new State, and I give the warning to this House to-day that unless it is prepared forthwith to give to Newfoundland its freedom and the right to govern itself, it is not beyond practical politics that the people of Newfoundland will say, "Well, if you are not willing to give us that freedom, we are going to take what steps lay open to us in the matter." An hon. Member said to me, "Never." That is exactly what this

House used to say in the days before the American independence. The same type of mind said "Never," in that determined way, but the United States did break away from this country. I can see Newfoundland in future becoming a State in the United States unless this country is prepared to honour its obligations as the Newfoundland people have honoured their financial obligations, and to give an opportunity forthwith to the full government of themselves. They are just as capable of doing that as any of the three Commissioners are of governing them, and perhaps the ordinary Tom, Dick or Harry is more capable than some of the Ministers who are obstructing our proposals.</p>

<p>I intervene for a short time to give a reason against the adoption of the Amendment. The desire of the Government is to get back to self-government as soon as it is practicable. Hon. Members below the Gangway want to do it whether it is practicable or not. The suggestion of the hon. Member who seconded the Amendment was that here is a wicked Government obstructing the burning desire of the people of Newfoundland at once to go back to Parliamentary government. I do not know on what the hon. Member forms his opinion. I will give briefly my experience.<br/>
When I went to the Dominions Office, I had been interested in this matter previously and, like hon. Members below the Gangway, I had opposed the setting-up of this particular form of government. I still think it was a mistake. I know that the Noble Lord the Member for Horsham and Worthing (Earl Winterton) took the same line. We also did not like the economic set-up in the island. I began to look into the matter. I had a report from my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich (Sir G. Shakespeare), who had just been out to Newfoundland. I thought the best thing to do was to see some of the people of Newfoundland, and I was able to visit a number of people who were working for the war, and particularly a large number in Scotland and some who were serving in this country. I thought that the best thing I could do as soon as possible was to go over and see what were the views of the people of Newfoundland themselves. I do not necessarily take resolutions of boards of trade at their face value, and I do not believe that newspapers are necessarily the voice of the people. They may be the voice of the proprietors. I


thought the best thing was to go there and get first-hand experience.<br/>
I did not have very long, and travel is difficult in that country. I only had about 10 days, but I did try to see as many people as I could. I saw leading merchants, officials, trade unionists, fishermen, judges and people of every kind in trying to collect the views of the people on this subject. I was interested when my three hon. Friends returned and they spoke to me, to find out that, after their longer experience and with the advantage they had of visiting many of the parts which I could not visit at that time, in no respect did they disagree with the views which I had formed in that rather short visit. It is not a question of whether the people in this country think or do not think that the people of Newfoundland are fit to govern themselves, but of what the people of Newfoundland think themselves. I agree with my hon. Friend that, up and down the country, there was not this unanimous desire to get back to the particular form of government they had before. Some thought there might be a half-way house, but no one that I met wanted to go back to just the form of government they had before.<br/>
The second thing that struck me was that, as it is now 10 years since representative government was done away with, it was a deplorable thing that, perhaps with some very slight exceptions, there was no local government on the island and therefore there had been no practice in forms of democracy. I do not hold with my hon. Friends below the Gangway that rather old-fashioned Victorian optimism that you merely tell people to govern themselves and everything goes all right. Experience shows that it is one thing to have the forms of democracy and another thing to be able to work them. We have seen many most excellent Constitutions fail owing to the fact that the people were not able to work them. In that island, there has not been this practice, and, furthermore, because there has been no practice for 10 years, adults right up to the age of 30 have never cast a vote.</p>

<p>I quite agree, but there are people like my hon. Friend carrying on their functions in Parliament, and therefore the people to whom he refers do know what representative government is. People have not had that advantage in Newfoundland, and they have had no object lesson. Another point which does not seem to have struck hon. Members below the Gangway is that Newfoundland is making a very notable contribution to the war effort. Youths of Newfoundland are serving on ships and in the Army, as well as in the lumber camps, and that again makes it difficult to have an immediate General Election or to take some immediate steps to restore self-government by a stroke of the pen. They are all British subjects, and they naturally wish to get back to self-government, but I can assure hon. Members that no one I spoke to wanted an immediate return to self-government or a return to exactly the form of self-government they had before.<br/>
The unfortunate&#x2014;as I think&#x2014;Act which was passed, against the views of some of us in this House, provided for the setting-up of a Commission, but did not provide any way for bringing it to an end or for setting up a new Constitution. It was a very remarkable omission. What we have said on behalf of the Government is that my Noble Friend will take steps to ascertain what machinery will be most acceptable to Newfoundland public opinion and to devise means to bring it into effect at an appropriate moment. I think it is really better that we should try to get from the Newfoundland people, by consultation, their view of the kind of machinery they would like set up&#x2014;to determine their future Constitution than to act on purely <i>a priori</i> lines, or the lines suggested by hon. Members below the Gangway; and put them back 10 years, where they were 10 years ago, and where it certainly does not appear they necessarily want to go to now.<br/>
Therefore, so far from there being any wavering about this, we have acted, first of all by inquiry, and a democratic inquiry. I was extremely obliged&#x2014;I think all the House was&#x2014;to my three hon. Friends who visited the island and made contacts, because it is not easy where there is not machinery for collecting public opinion, in a large country scattered into a number of small villages, with very few towns, to ascertain what the general run of public opinion is. I think an extremely


valuable service was done. I accept the views put forward by the three hon. Members who have visited the island and who did personally talk with the people of Newfoundland a good deal more willingly than I do the <i>a priori</i> view of the hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. Stephen), who has not been there and seen the situation, and who with all his ability must necessarily take his views at second hand. I suggest that this House would be right to take the line of the Government, that we should try to ascertain as soon as possible from the people of Newfoundland what they consider to be the most practical way for getting machinery set up, ascertaining the kind of Constitution they want, rather than taking the line of "Let us give them what we think would be good for them. Let us put them back exactly where they were."</p>

<p>The hon. Member is quite wrong. He is suggesting that now, without consulting the people of Newfoundland and against what our own Members who have been there have said is the view of the people, we should, in accordance with the theoretical views of my hon. Friend below the Gangway, proceed by giving them something which on the best evidence, as far as I can make out, they do not want at present. I suggest that full consultation of the people of Newfoundland in order to find out what they want is more democratic and more practical. I would ask the House to reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>If my hon.

It is obviously difficult, when there is no democratic machinery, to get the views of the

people, but there is this suggestion of trying to get a cross-section, to get a kind of convention in order that some kind of proposition might be framed to put before the people of Newfoundland. One has to remember that this matter has not been placed before them at all and to ask them "Yes" or "No" has all the disadvantages of a plebiscite.</p>

<p>I think we are all grateful to the Deputy Prime Minister first for helping to arrange this Debate and for giving this subject the time which it deserved. Also we are very glad that he has been able to get down to the House and make the statement he did, even if it was a somewhat limited one. In my opinion this House was not properly aware of the action that it took in 1933. There was a small group of Members who seemed to know what would happen, and the Deputy Prime Minister practically admitted that he was one of that group. What happened in this House in 1933 was a monstrous denial of democracy. Ten years have passed by, and because that has come to pass which everyone knew would come to pass, because the people of Newfoundland have lost their political instinct very largely, the Government are looking at the matter as though nothing could be done about it, almost with a sense of satisfaction, as if to prove that what they did in 1933 was right. Let us admit that there were desperate circumstances. Sir Richard Squire's Government had been in office for a long time and had become very corrupt. But this is something I have not heard in any of the Debates, that there was a General Election and that the Squire Government was swept out of office. I think every member of the party except two was defeated. A new Government was formed on the policy of retrenchment and reform, headed by Mr. Allerdice. The economic blizzard which had crashed Wall Street and which was to bring us to the very edge of bankruptcy struck Newfoundland. They could not meet the de-


mands for interest. They had not enough money in the Exchequer to pay their way, and the misery in their country was very great. The question has arisen to-day, and it has been said over and over again that Newfoundland asked us for a Commission Government. That is only partially true. They were <i>in extremis</i> and sent word to us, "Will you send a Royal Commission to inquire into our difficulties?" We did so. It was the Royal Commission that recommended that the Parliament House which had been open for a 100 years must be locked and barred.<br/>
All this happened in the oldest overseas territory this country had, which for 85 years had been a Dominion. Did we say to this new Government, this untried Government, "We will help you, we will co-operate with you"? Not a bit. The Royal Commission said, "You are finished. We will take from you your Dominion status. We will close your Parliament and we will put in a government by commission. That is what they recommended, and the Allerdice Government could do nothing but humbly petition his Gracious Majesty to wind up the democracy of Newfoundland.<br/>
In the Debates at that, time the noble Lord opposite played a very fine part in opposing it. So did the Deputy Prime Minister. There was another Member of the Government who I wish were here today to repeat the words he said with prophetic prescience on that occasion. I refer to the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Minister of Aircraft Production. This is what he said then. I ask the House to be patient with me if I quote him. We do not realise what we did at that time. The Minister of Aircraft Production said:
<q>This is the first time that there has been any inroad on democratic government of any dominion, the first time we have ever taken a retrogressive step in that gradual advance to free government within the Commonwealth.</q>
He added:
<q>It does not necessarily follow that the solution of the troubles of Newfoundland is bound up with the abolition of democracy.</q>
There for once, if he never did it again, he spoke in the language of Burke. He concluded:
<q>Capital punishment is not the only punishment for democracy.</q>

He went further. Realising that to take from the people of Newfoundland the exercise of democratic government, the exercise of the franchise, with the discussions and elections that go with it, would result in their becoming politically paralysed&#x2014;and the three hon. Gentlemen who have come back tell us that the people have lost political interest very largely&#x2014;the Minister of Aircraft Production moved an Amendment to the Bill, to limit the unhappy experiment to three years, because he said, "If you do not do that, these people will lose the political instinct." He foretold exactly what has happened.<br/>
What was the financial crisis that let Newfoundland down? It is not a pleasant story. It starts with the Squires Government. The Squires Government did many good things, but they became terribly corrupt. In 1933 Newfoundland owed, all told, about &#x00A3;20,000,000. Of that 26,000,000 dollars were owed to the bankers of New York in gold bonds payable at the gold price. Another 6,000,000 dollars had been loaned by the Canadian banks to help to pay the interest. The Canadian banks charged on that five and even five and a half per cent&#x2014;a very heavy rate of interest, indicating that they took a certain risk. The rest was owed here. Newfoundland tried to pay her interest. When she could not, we took the debt over. Her interest charges on her external loans were over &#x00A3;1,000,000 a year. Had she not had to pay that on the year when she went bankrupt, she would have had 3,000,000 dollars surplus in her Treasury to meet the cost of the social services.</p>

<p>They would have been able to raise the unemployment dole and so on, and pay for these health services which they wanted to create at that time. We helped Newfoundland out; there is no denying that. We converted the loan to 3&#x00BD; per cent., and we guaranteed it here. Then we paid back New York and the Canadian banks. The British investor, whose bonds had fallen to 25, had the satisfaction of seeing them rise to 85. Newfoundland owed us &#x00A3;20,000,000 when that conversion started. At the end she still owed us &#x00A3;20,000,000, but New York


had enjoyed the rather unusual experience of having had a debt paid by this country for Newfoundland and the Canadian banks, which had gambled a bit on the loan, got their money back. The British people had secured their investment. Then we decided to turn back the clock, and to bring to our oldest possession the institution of taxation without representation, something which one would have thought we had dropped from the time of the American rebellion.<br/>
These were the first three things we promised. We agreed to put Newfoundland on her feet as speedily as possible, secondly to promote the political education of her people, and thirdly to restore the Constitution&#x2014;which we had never revoked, but merely suspended&#x2014;as soon as the island was self-supporting again. In that Act itself there is no mention of a request from the Newfoundland people; that is in the Commission's recommendations, but not in the Act itself. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry; the Minister says that it is in appendix to the Act. In the actual Clauses it does not appear. The fact is that the Newfoundland Commission of Government have governed as civil servants always will, honestly, without imagination. To promote the political education of the Newfoundland people is our second pledge. Instead we have deprived the people of their political education. We are pledged to restore the Constitution when Newfoundland is solvent. You have heard that Newfoundland has been lending us money. She has been solvent for nearly three years; she has considerable cash reserves now. But we have decided that we must not honour our pledge to restore her independence&#x2014;I grant the Minister the point&#x2014;unless the people ask for it.<br/>
I ask the Under-Secretary to explain the position of the Government. Does he believe that we are trying to deal with Newfoundland on the basis of a means test, on a Micawber style of finance&#x2014;income &#x00A3;20, expenditure &#x00A3;20 0s. 6d., self-government; income &#x00A3;20, expenditure &#x00A3;19 19s. 6d., no self-government. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am afraid that I have it twisted: Mr. Micawber got things twisted too. At any rate, 6d. too much expenditure, no self-government; 6d. on the right side, self-government. It is a poor thing. Do this Government lay

down that Newfoundland must be solvent before we help her? That seems a very sad thing. I hope I carry my noble Friend with me on this point. When Newfoundland owed us money, we put in the Commissioners. You have heard how Newfoundland is now paying us money: I should say that we have had on deposit about &#x0024;10,000,000. Suppose we cannot pay it when the war is over. Will Newfoundland be entitled to send three Commissioners to Britain and close this House? It sounds absurd, certainly, but the principle is the same. I will not touch on the point about the bases, because that has been dealt with, but I suggest that to give a 99 years' lease to Canada or to the United States on Newfoundland territory without the people of Newfoundland being consulted, is a very dangerous thing. Suppose that when they get self-government they repudiate it. What is the charge that will be made against us by the nations with which we entered into the arrangements in the first place? This is storing up serious trouble.</p>

<p>Yes. After all, we have bases in Iceland, but Iceland takes them back when the war is over. The Prime Minister of Canada has laid it down that any territorial concessions to other nations by Canada will return to Canada when the war is over. Newfoundland has no voice: Newfoundland is run by the Dominions Office here. Can Newfoundland's High Commissioner raise his voice at the daily conference of High Commissioners in London? He cannot; because he is not allowed to attend. The man who was the High Commissioner is now a trade commissioner. The very offices of Newfoundland in Ottawa and Washington have been closed down&#x2014;there has been some talk in the Press of opening them again. But do the people want self-government? Our hon. Friends have been to talk to them. The Press has been quoted. I have not time to read all the Press clippings, but I have some that are very recent. Let me read one or two. This is from the "Daily News":
<q>The Commissioner Government has been the most degrading period in the history of this unhappy country&#x2014;a period of moral, spiritual, social, cultural, and except for the war, economic decline.</q>
These are very strong words. The "Daily News" says again:


<q>As long as the Commission system stands there will be a stigma on the name of Newfoundland.</q>
There are many other similar quotations. Let us look upon the future of Newfoundland as an Atlantic aerodrome. Ribbentrop described this country as the aerodrome anchored near the coast of Europe. Newfoundland is the aerodrome anchored near the Continent of North America. It is, from the point of view of a civilian aircraft base, most important. If war comes again, it will be doubly important to us. Are we to bind the people of Newfoundland to us in the only possible way? I put down an Amendment that there should be a General Election in three months' time, and if that Amendment had been called I would have explained what I meant. You cannot hand over the government of Newfoundland at once. You cannot do it automatically. But we should call a General Election in three months' time after 1st January to elect delegates to a Constituent Assembly for the purpose of creating a Provisional Government, that Government to work with the Commission Government for the gradual handing over, and then for it to go in one year's time to the country with a general reconstruction policy. They say we cannot do this because the young men of Newfoundland are overseas fighting. The one difficulty of that is that these young men are going to come back to their country to find a Government without any post-war policy at all. They do not want to come back to take part in politics; they want jobs, work and a future.<br/>
Let me end with these words. We never should have taken from Newfoundland the right of self-government. It was undignified and unworthy of the traditions of this country. I say to Newfoundland from this House, "We do not, as a Mother Country, give self-government as a prize, as a lollipop. We give it as a command." There comes a point in the history of every country of this Empire when self-government comes as a challenge and a command, and in that tradition we should say to Newfoundland, "Now call your leaders together, arrange to govern yourselves, and we will stand by you through bad times and good times, not rating less high your democratic rights than your financial solvency.

Govern yourselves, come side by side with us into the future," and let us end our own shame here for having closed a Parliament that had governed for 100 years.</p>

<p>Not all. But I make this request for the practical advantage of the House and the people. The background of this business is so complicated and important&#x2014;the House observed the modest way in which my two colleagues hurried through innumerable subjects. It is quite impossible unless you have that background, to understand what happened. You cannot discuss education in Newfoundland without a long description of the extraordinary denominational system to which reference has been made. You cannot discuss trade or agriculture without going into the Gulf Stream and the Labrador currents and thousands of other things. I have seen something of the Empire, but I think that little Newfoundland is about the most testing and complicated puzzle in the whole Imperial scene. Something of the religious, political and indeed, industrial problems of Ireland and of India, the size of Ireland, the title of a Dominion, the population of Bradford, the history and habits of Dominion government and the social services of a neglected Crown Colony&#x2014;all the problems of Empire are crammed into one little place. We have done our little best to try and make these things clear.<br/>
I ask the Government, though I acquiesced in the decision of the Dominions Secretary that our reports should not be published&#x2014;I recognise the reasons, though I think they were exaggerated&#x2014;to consider whether they would like to cut out any parts they think to be un-desirable


or "filthy pictures" and let the House have the rest of them. None of the passages which anybody is afraid of, by the way, are derogatory to Newfoundland. They are frank, honest people and we told them exactly what we thought about things when we were there.<br/>
The "simple"&#x2014;and I put "simple" in inverted commas&#x2014;questions we really have to answer are, Is Newfoundland likely to be self-supporting in the strict economic sense, say, within two years after the war? and, Is she to be denied self-government until she is self-supporting in that way? My answer to both questions is, "No." That sounds simple, but it is not; nothing is simple in this affair. It would be delightful and easy, and nothing would please me more than, to say, "Newfoundland is to have her two Houses of Parliament in action tomorrow." Whatever may be the truth about the history of this sad business&#x2014;I agree with a good deal of what my hon. Friends the Members for Bridgeton (Mr. Maxton) and Wood Green (Mr. Baxter) have said&#x2014;and whether they are right or wrong, I should like to thank them for having kept the name and affairs of Newfoundland so well before the people as they have done&#x2014;the present situation was not of our seeking and is no particular fun for us. It was no fun for us to go round that island as representatives of the British House of Commons, and responsible for an anomalous autocratic <i>r&#x00E9;gime,</i> sometimes popular and sometimes unjustly unpopular&#x2014;to go into their Houses of Parliament and find that we had made them a den of civil servants. If anyone "carries the baby" he expects to hear an occasional whimper from the child, but it must be very galling to my hon. Friends on the Front Bench here to be abused by friends of the baby for not incontinently throwing it away.<br/>
If my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green really doubts what we sadly say&#x2014;that there is political atrophy in Newfoundland&#x2014;I will read him a passage from one of the Newfoundland newspapers in a few moments. We may have caused this atrophy but there it is. The last time I addressed this House I pointed out that there were some 100 Members who did not know what the rights of Private Members were; that if they were given the opportunity of introducing a Private Bill to-morrow they would not

know how to begin. There is a similar sort of situation in Newfoundland. No man can name the national leader of the future. No man can say, "This is my party, and this will be my candidate when elections return." We saw the beginnings of a new Labour Party there, but we never heard of any other party. The whole gear is out of action. All that can be remedied, I think, by what we proposed, and by what I think the Government have in mind. But it is idle to ignore that that is the factual picture. I have here "The Daily News," from which almost everybody has quoted today. It states:
<q>If Mr. Baxter, with the backing of the Beaverbrook papers, which he appears able to command, wants to serve our cause most effectively he should come out here and talk to us and put himself into the position of a thoroughly informed advocate.</q>
That is a little unfair, because everyone cannot go everywhere. But here is the point:
<q>There are other questions besides sentiment about the self-government of this Dominion before we take up again the full responsibility of Dominion autonomy. To have self-government dropped into our laps before we have had the opportunity to prepare for it, to find leaders and national policies and to discuss financial and economic questions would be harmful to our interests.</q>
I mention that because it confirms our sad conclusions. The islanders are uncertain of themselves&#x2014;and it may be our fault&#x2014;both politically and economically. It is quite idle, although the Motion appears to do it, to consider either of these elements alone. Freedom is not enough: and prosperity is not enough. I am quite sure that if you gave two Parliaments to Newfoundland tomorrow and said nothing about their economic future they would not thank you very much. On the other hand, if you gave them all the money in the world they would still expect, rightly, I think, to have some say in their affairs. I put my name to the Motion and I do welcome the announcement of the Government, so far as it goes. I do not blame them for not having had time to make an announcement on the economic side, but I must warn them that this will not be the last Debate on Newfoundland if we can help it. At some fairly early date some positive pronouncement on the economic side must be made.<br/>
May I say a few words on the political and constitutional problem? I hope the


House will forgive me if I use the words "I" and "my" a good many times. Although we are substantially unanimous we differ on some points, and it is difficult to remember where we are unanimous. Three weeks after I reached the island I suggested that an announcement should be made on the lines of that which has been made. I thought, by the way, that the Deputy Prime Minister went a little too far&#x2014;though of course he was quoting his own experience&#x2014;when he said that nobody wanted exactly what they had before. We did meet some who want violently and loudly what they had before, although they may not be the majority.<br/>
We should announce, I suggested, that, say, two or three years after the war, or from now if you like, that we intended to restore full self-government to Newfoundland unless by a plebiscite one year before that they had chosen some other form of government. But that interim period should not be regarded as another period of autocratic alien rule but should be used by Newfoundland, with such assistance as we can give them, (<i>a</i>) to find out what they want, and (<i>b</i>) to prepare the people for a renewal of political activity, to help the emergence of leaders and the formation of parties and stimulate interest and the like. For that purpose I suggested the formation of a Council of Citizens, appointed by the Governor, from every class and body. There are a great many bodies in Newfoundland&#x2014;the West Newfoundland Association, the Board of Trade, co-operative societies, and so on, who are already studying the problems of the future. I suggested that they should frame the questions which should be put to the people at the plebiscite and that when they had finished that part of their task they should get on with the business of political education. The wireless, for example, has not been sufficiently used. In scattered communities in winter-time the only method by which the Government can reach the people is by wireless which should be used for political and, for that matter, for school education. We should send out lecturers to teach people how to take the chair at meetings, to make speeches, to teach the history of their country, the value of local government, and so on, and actively assist a resurgence of political interest and act.<br/>
If I may, I should like to go back to the question, What sort of alternatives

are there to the original form of government which might be worth discussing? My hon. Friend the Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon) mentioned the possibility that Newfoundland should elect their three Commissioners. That might do as a stop-gap for a short time, but it would not do for long, because the same troubles as there are now would exist. The people do not know what is going on. They cannot go into a Chamber like this and shake their fists at Ministers and ask them what they are doing&#x2014;for example, about Goose Bay. Whatever we do about electing Commissioners, that difficulty would still remain. In our last Debate on this topic I was attracted by a suggestion by my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham (Sir E. Grigg), who, I am sorry to say, is ill. It was that it may be possible to consider the inclusion of Newfoundland in the United Kingdom on lines roughly, but not exactly, similar to Northern Ireland. That again, I believe, has been rather turned aside in high quarters, but I hope that high quarters will consider it because it meets the dilemma, as some call it, of my two main propositions that (1) Newfoundland must govern herself and (2) we must help her financially.<br/>
That seems to be a constitutional dilemma, but, after all, it is happening all the time in Northern Ireland, and no one notices it at all. It rests upon Imperial taxation, and the Newfoundlanders have such a strong objection to any form of taxation that at the first suggestion the idea of Imperial taxation might frighten them into the sea. But of course it would not be ordinary Imperial taxation; it would be taxation adapted to their needs and resources. There would be a special Newfoundland Budget, and I suppose we might reserve a few services. I hope high quarters will consider whether that could be carried out.<br/>
That would be one of the things to be discussed by the Council, which should be presided over or assisted, I suggest, by a big constitutional expert from this country and attended by representatives of the Dominions Office able at any moment to say what was in the minds of the Department. [An HON. MEMBER: "Nominated or elected?"] The Council of Citizens would have to be nominated, because there is no machinery for electing anyone. But that is a detail. Then it is possible


that they might say, "We want Dominion status, with two Houses of Parliament and the rest of it," but although they want to have a say in their own affairs, they do not put on Dominion airs. You do not hear the words "Dominion status" at all. So they might think it better to have a single Chamber, as in Ceylon or Jamaica, with elected and appointed Members face to face instead of having a bogus House of Lords which no one ever sees and no one respects. That is another alternative. There are two or three ideas thrown out. When the Council or Convention has discussed all these things and found out the kind of strength that there is in this, that or the other, they can decide what question shall be put to the people at the plebiscite. The question of how soon is one of detail. I suggested, I think, two years after the war.<br/>
But all this will be of very small consequence to the Newfoundlanders unless they have some confidence about their economic future. We have all unanimously suggested the frightening phrase "A 10 years' plan." The House will be surprised to hear that I do not pose as an expert, but I am certain that even if, say, two years after the war Newfoundland is able to maintain her social services at their present level, which is a deplorably low one&#x2014;and that is doubtful&#x2014;it is certain that without assistance from someone&#x2014;and that someone must be us&#x2014;they will never be raised to a level which will be compatible with the dignity of a British people under the British flag. Therefore someone has to assist. As my hon. and gallant Friend says, the more we went about the more faith we had in the place, and the future of the place; and given such schemes as the reorganisation of the fisheries, which I believe the Government have already approved of, and given the development of agriculture, roads and so on, I think it can be most confidently predicted that in 10 years they may be able to sail alone on an even keel, though, even then, it might be better for them to form part of a bigger economic unit. A high official, at my request, gave me a rough unofficial estimate of what would be the cost of a 10 years' plan. He worked it out in detail, including costs of annual maintenance, and the figure surprised me. It came to 80,000,000 dollars&#x2014;&#x00A3;16,000,000. Over 10 years that is a very big figure to Newfoundland but a very small figure to us. I know that

there are a lot of "fleabites" about. The Empire is asking for "fleabites" everywhere, but, if that figure is correct, it is a remarkably small one, and it would make very little difference to us.<br/>
I know that it is asking a lot of this House and of British taxpayers, of whom I count myself no small part, to be generous not only with freedom but with finance. I never quite know what is meant by Imperialist, a word of which my hon. and gallant Friend is very fond. I am always rather surprised that a mind of such clarity should use such a woolly word. I am glad that England did not stay at home, does not stay at home and, please God, never will stay home. I am glad that we sent our sons from Bristol and from Poole to catch the cod and plant the flag of England and settle by the frozen seas.<br/>
But I recognise that, when they did so, they laid upon us an inescapable charge, and we cannot now avoid it. There they are still. Four hundred years ago Sir Humphrey Gilbert planted the flag of Queen Elizabeth on the spot above the harbour of St. John's, where on Commemoration Day they remember the Battle of Beaumont Hamel; and if you had stood there with us and seen the soldiers and sailors, the Girl Scouts, the Guides, the Church Lads' Brigade and the old gentlemen with their top hats and medals and ribbons and heard the talk of Devonshire and Somerset and Wales and Scotland and Ireland you would have said you were somewhere in the West of England, and you would also have said, "These are not people about whose future I can remain unconcerned." As I have said elsewhere, if anyone landed from a ship or a parachute in any part of that little island and listened to the talk he would say, "Perhaps I am in Devonshire or Somerset or Ireland or Wales." He would never say, "I am in the United States or in Canada."<br/>
In that simple physical fact is a great political truth, because I am sure that as long as we stand by them the last thing they want to do is to leave us. There is a picture of His Majesty in every home. There is an English name in every home. Ninety-nine per cent. of them are pure British. My interpretation of Imperialism is not, perhaps, everyone's. I never meet them, but I am told that some people think of the activities of our forefathers


in terms of dividends only. Others, more sensible, are thinking of duties and dividends, because not once or twice in our Island story the path of duty has led to dividends. In this case I address myself most earnestly to that part of the Imperial mind which is concerned with duty only. I am not offering any large capitalist enterprises to anybody, although there may be something coming that way.<br/>
I must, by the way, say a word about Labrador, because one of the things that has not been mentioned is that this island of 42,000 square miles, by a freak of history, a decision of the Privy Council and the cleverness of the present Lord Chancellor, who was their advocate, Newfoundland possesses 104,000 square miles of Labrador three times her own size. It is a rugged country which contains a large amount of timber, and it is believed a great many minerals which the Canadians are now prospecting for. I want to hear some announcement of Government policy about Labrador with regard not only to its development, but to the welfare of the people who live there, and consider themselves neglected. If we are to go on having the rule of Newfoundland, we musk see that Labrador is properly surveyed and developed. I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for doing me the honour of sending me on this interesting trip. I do not know that we can do anything rapidly for self-government, but the sooner we can do it the better, and we must couple it with some generous financial assistance.</p>

<p>I have hardly been here long enough to appreciate these delicate points of etiquette, but I hope that as I grow up I may learn some of them. In regard to the Motion which we are discussing, there is only one thing in it to which I wish to take exception. Had those who drew it up consulted the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter) and myself, we should have been able to help them to draft it in a more suitable form. I do not like the words which appear at the end of line 1 and towards the middle of line 2:
<q>on behalf of His Majesty's Government, of the acceptance in principle.</q>
I do not see why we want the words "in principle." Surely Newfoundland, as our oldest Dominion, should have it as of right and not in principle. I am glad to see the hon. Member for Bridgeton (Mr. Maxton) in his seat. I do not know whether this is a breach of etiquette or not, but I heard it rumoured abroad&#x2014;and like most other men and a few women I am prone to gossip&#x2014;that he said, when my name appeared as Seconder of the Amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for Wood Green, that he was glad to know that the hon. Member for Wood Green had his "Charlie Macarthy" to support him. I hope he will not take exception to my saying that. It is a new thing to me to be called a "Charlie Macarthy" by anyone, but when I have been here as long as the hon. Member it is very likely that I shall learn about that as well. I agree with a lot that the hon. Member for Wood Green said, but I also disagree with a lot. One of the things on which I disagree with him is that a lollipop is a prize. I should certainly not regard that as a prize. The hon. Member for Bridgeton is very much liked in this House and I think that now he has, perhaps for the first time, a very distinguished political future in that his party, now that it is allied with the powerful Common Wealth party, may well form the next Government of this

country particularly if the by-election at Skipton has the to days interval about which the hon. Baronet the Member for Barnstaple (Sir R. Acland) spoke. I do not know that I can refer to Acton as another hon. Member did. I should draw a different conclusion. I happen to be chairman of the Association of the party to which I belong for that area, and the Acton by-election result shows the importance of all parties observing the party truce. The hon. Member also mentioned the loss of deposits. If the candidates are wealthy enough, let them forfeit the deposit.<br/>
I pass now to the Motion which we are discussing. There is an old saying, I think it comes from Cicero, that lack of gratitude is the worst of all the vices and also the most common. What I am worried about is that Britain will be blamed for anything that goes wrong in Newfoundland, as we were in the days when we lost the 13 American Colonies. We were taught at school in England that the majority of the people in the American Colonies were in favour of Britain and that the majority of the people here were in favour of the 13 American Colonies at the beginning of that unfortunate war. That situation will not arise, but I am most anxious that we should not be blamed for anything that goes wrong in Newfoundland. We know that the American Colonies&#x2014;they do nut teach it in their history books, but that is the way it is taught here&#x2014;did not revolt until the Indian menace had been put down and the French menace in the whole of North America had been subdued. It was not till after that, that they decided it was time to revolt. We ought to learn a little from those past events, although perhaps the position is hardly analogous.<br/>
The hon. Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon), to whose speech I listened with great interest, mentioned several courses which were open to Newfoundland. One was to link up with the United States. I should hope, as I hope he and I am sure all the rest of us, and all Newfoundlanders as well would hope, that nothing of the sort will happen, but in that connection, and in regard to America I would like to say that when recently I spent six or seven months in America I found a curious frame of mind existing there. They think it is all right that America should have an Empire, but that


it is not a good thing for Britain to have an Empire. When they asked me about the British Empire and representative government I used to say to them, remembering that in some of the Southern States white people are outnumbered by two or three to one: "How many negro Congressmen are there in the American Congress?" The answer usually was that there did not happen to be any at the moment. The conclusion to be drawn from that is that it would be better for them to tidy up their own back garden before asking us to tidy up our front garden.<br/>
Another alternative is that Newfoundland should link up with Canada. I hope that to most Newfoundlanders that would be preferable. What is still most important is that they should be in a position to choose exactly what they want to do. I think that a function of Great Britain and of this House at the present time is to see that they are in a position to have self-government, to have what they want, go where they want and do what they want. That is what we can do and that is our function in the world, at any rate in regard to the British Empire. With regard to restoring Dominion status, I am not quite sure how vital that issue is at the moment, but I regard it as important that Newfoundland should have a Parliament of some sort. Frankly, I do not see how, otherwise, we can ascertain anyone's opinion there. We cannot take the voice of the Press. How representative is the voice of the Press? For example, when Mr. Roosevelt was re-elected, nine-tenths of the Press were against him. The Press is not always representative of the people's voice. Among the prefects of a school, very few are usually popular. I do not, therefore, see how government by Commission can ever be popular particularly as the Commissioners were appointed, I understand, in 1933. If they go on a little longer they will be like the 1922 Committee; we shall have to make the post hereditary.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might have a word with the hon. Baronet afterwards about that, and I may be able to convert him. Without a Parliament of some sort in Newfoundland, how can we possibly hear

what the popular voice of Newfoundland is? I would like to quote from a speech made by the Under-Secretary of State for the Dominions. I hope he can hear me without difficulty. We cannot always hear him. He referred on 2nd December to the recommendation:
<q>As soon as the island's difficulties are overcome and the country is again self-supporting.</q>
Are we really self-supporting? Suppose that the United States were to take over the government of these islands&#x2014;but I am certain that they would not&#x2014;are we self-supporting? How dare we lay down any stipulation like that? Let hon. Members be quite sure that if we are not prepared to put up some money for Newfoundland that country will not have to look far for someone who will gladly and willingly do it. The recommendation mentioned in the Under-Secretary's speech went on to say:
<q>responsible Government on the request from the people of Newfoundland, would be restored."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd December, 1943; col. 598, Vol. 395.]</q>
How in the world, without a Parliament in Newfoundland, can we find out whether the people of Newfoundland have made a request to Great Britain for Dominion status, or a return to self-government or however you wish to put it?<br/>
What worries me about this is that we should be blamed for anything which may go wrong. Furthermore, there is the question of the bases which have been mentioned many times before to-day. It is unfortunate that that action was taken when there was no Parliament to be consulted in Newfoundland. If there had been a Parliament it could have been asked for advice. We could still have sent commissioners and they might have asked Parliament to advise them on the question of those bases. When we restore self-government to Newfoundland the people will not like very much what has been done in that respect. There is an old American expression, dating from pre-Civil War days, which were the days of slavery in the slave states, and it is "Selling someone down the river." I am just a little afraid that there may be some such feeling about those bases.<br/>
I am not quite happy about the taxation system which exists in Newfoundland at the present time and I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary of State, or


whoever will reply to the Debate in the few minutes I shall probably leave him, would say something to justify the position of taxation in Newfoundland. We do not want anything to arise there in any way analogous to the bitterness which was caused before the War of Independence. I know that a declaration has been made. I do not like it altogether and I have criticised it as well as I could. I hope a further and better declaration will be made. We all know about the patriotism and loyalty and the contribution made to the Empire and Allied war effort by the people of Newfoundland but, as I have said, I do not see how they can decide anything without a Parliament. Mention was made by the hon. and gallant Member for Thornbury (Sir D. Gunston) of how valuable to Newfoundland and Canada the tourist traffic had been, but we must remember that when Canada had that very valuable tourist traffic&#x2014;as it still has&#x2014;they were the days of Prohibition in the United States. When people were not allowed to drink in the United States, they naturally drank in Canada and we exported whisky and gin in large measure, and that accounts to a large extent for the tourist traffic.</p>

<p>I am quite content with that reply. The hon. Baronet asked for the formation of a Royal Newfoundland Regiment which could come to Britain and other Dominions. I would only say that I cannot see what confidence this regiment, for which he said we should pay, or Newfoundland, could possibly have in the British Government if the Government do not immediately increase the pay of serving soldiers and allowances for the dependants of British soldiers.</p>

<p>The Labour Party have asked me to express to the good-will Mission our sincere thanks and appreciation for the excellent job of work they have done, for the clarity of their report to-day and the

constructive proposals which they have made to the Government and to the House. We should also like to say that we appreciate that the Deputy Prime Minister did initiate this particular type of investigation and thereby bring the matter so closely to the notice of the House. We rather regret that the three reports which have been prepared have not been published, because we feel that there is a good deal of meat in them, particularly the sections concerned with social and economic reconstruction. We feel that it would have been to the advantage of the House if the more detailed information of the reports could have been brought to our attention.<br/>
The Labour Party vigorously opposed, ten years ago, the introduction of the non-democratic <i>r&#x00E9;gime,</i> and it has, I think, shown its interest in the Newfoundland problem ever since by its constant questioning of the Government on the progress being made. Therefore we on this side of the House yield to no one as to the nature of our demands throughout the years for the creation as speedily as possible of the conditions whereby self-government could be restored. We have consistently criticised the complete divorcement of the peoples of Newfoundland from the work of government. We have complained as to the secret way in which the Commission Government has carried on its work, the inadequacy of that form of government, as well as the general absence over the years of any comprehensive economic and social planning. Let me also say that while we have been conscious that the restoration of self-government was conditioned by economic recovery as well as by the expression of the wishes of the people, we have protested in the past that financial solvency should be made the test of the practice of democracy. That has been our position.<br/>
Nevertheless, we fear we have to deal with a situation in which there is a limited desire only for the immediat restoration of full self-government, and that certain preliminary stages are necessary before it can be made an effective principle. We deeply regret these circumstances, but we cannot lightly set aside the opinions which have been offered us to-day by the good-will Mission, and we cannot look at this problem apart from its economic and political setting.<br/>
The Government have made clear what their policy is to be, and we shall press that they will vigorously pursue that course, that immediately after the war Newfoundland shall examine her future and the form of her government most suited to her, for herself, and that the Government will take steps to see that the wishes of the people shall be respected. Meantime the Government also tell us they will push on with the creation of more local government and with the work of reconstruction. I must say that we wish that the Government would have done a little more than that, would even in this interim period have brought the Commission Government much more closely in association with the peoples of Newfoundland. I believe that as the chairman of the goodwill mission pointed out, there are some interim steps which might be taken in regard to the election of the chairman and his functions in the commission government, that he would cease to preside; that the selection of three Commissioners should be by elections from the general population, and that greater discretion should be given to Treasury officials with regard to expenditure. We expect the Government to push on along the road they have so broadly indicated, and that they will at the same time drive ahead in the field of local government. We want also the reconstruction proposals indicated to-day energetically pursued.<br/>
I am not quite certain whether we can subscribe to one of the views put forward by the Senior Burgess for Oxford University (Petty Officer Herbert) as to the machinery which should be created for ascertaining the will of the people. That of course is a debatable point which we cannot enter into at the present time. But I would like to suggest that now proposals about the Constitution are under the active consideration of the Government that at least they should give serious attention to what the Mission have said in respect to the improvement of the quality of the Commission, to increasing the efficiency of the Civil Service, and also in restoring an immediate contact with the people. I would like further to underline the point made by the Senior Burgess for Oxford University that right away definite steps should be taken in the political education of the people. That is all I have time to say.<br/>
We in the Labour Party are anxious for the full restoration of democratic government at the earliest possible moment, and we look forward to the near day when Newfoundland will again take her rightful place as a Dominion in the Commonwealth of Nations. Her people in this war have played a great and splendid part, and the great causes we are fighting to establish in the world must be applied to Newfoundland in reality and practice as soon as she herself desires that status and responsibility.</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to my hon. Friend for giving way to me. I have only three minutes, or I should very much have liked to have said something on Newfoundland&#x2014;I happen to have been one of the few hon. Members of this House who have spent a considerable time there: I have spent more time there than that spent by all the members of the Commission&#x2014;but there is no opportunity now. I certainly make no complaint of the length of the speeches and particularly of the most eloquent speech of the Senior Burgess for Oxford University (Petty-Officer Herbert), which I heard with great delight. I should like to congratulate him upon the manner in which he put his points in the House and also for the very eloquent tribute he paid to Newfoundland in the columns of the humorous paper for which he so appropriately writes.<br/>
May I say just this before the hon. Gentleman gets up to reply? I very much hope that this matter will not be left completely where it is to-day. I do not think&#x2014;and here I think that those who have been out on the Mission will agree with me&#x2014;that it is right that we should devote only a small part of a Sitting to a discussion of this all-important subject. In supporting what my hon. Friends have said, may I pay a particular tribute to the hon. Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon), who opened the Debate, and to the valuable work they have done? As one in touch with some elements of opinion in Newfoundland, I who know the country would most earnestly beg the Government to afford a further opportunity for debate. I would suggest to Members in all parts of the House, if I may do so without offence, that we might get together at some future time and press the Government for a further discussion on this subject.</p>

<p>We have had, I think, a most useful Debate to-day, and I will bear in mind the views expressed by the Noble Lord who has just sat down. The House will have heard the speeches of the members of the good-will Mission with great interest. The Government welcome and accept the Motion which stands in their names. They have shown how careful and how thorough has been the investigation which they have made into the conditions in Newfoundland. The House will be impressed by the fact that the three Members, while each summing up the situation in his own way, have arrived at substantially the same conclusions. The Government are very grateful to them for the valuable work they have done and the sympathy and understanding with which they inquired into the problems of the island.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter) said he was not satisfied with the steps which the Government propose to take. He believes that, as the island has been able to balance its Budget&#x2014;as everyone knows, that has been only on account of war-time conditions&#x2014;representative government on the old model should be restored, without any kind of consultation with the people of the island. I would remind the House, as I did my hon. Friend, that the Annexe to the Newfoundland Act provided that self-government should be restored only after consultation with the people of Newfoundland. My hon. Friends the members of the good will Mission, who have a very recent acquaintance with the problem, have said that there appears to be little or no desire in the island for constitutional change during the war. The Newfoundland people look forward, as my hon. Friends have said, to a change after the war, but there is considerable difference of opinion as to what that change should be, in the circumstances which would be prevailing at that time.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bridgeton (Mr. Maxton) referred to a resolution passed by the board of trade of St. John's&#x2014;that is an unofficial body, similar to a chamber of commerce. That body did pass a resolution in favour of constitutional reform, and set up a sub-committee to consider the whole question. The deliberations of that body, however, served only to show how marked is the division of opinion in

the island. After examination, it confined itself to recommending that a Royal Commission should be appointed to hear evidence and to advise on the whole constitutional question; and even this suggestion met with very little support. I think hon. Members will agree that the proposals of the Government are in accord with the assurances given at the time when the Constitution was suspended, which met with the approval of the people of the island. It is our intention to act in every way up to the assurances we gave: it is not our intention to withhold responsible government from the people of Newfoundland.<br/>
The hon. Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon) and my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Thornbury (Sir D. Gunston), and I think also the hon. and gallant Member the Senior Burgess for Oxford University (Petty-Officer Herbert), referred to the proposals which they have made that three of the Newfoundland Commissioners should be elected and that the Chairman of the Commission should cease to be the Governor. My Noble Friend has carefully considered these proposals. He feels, however, that to introduce changes of this character at present might tend to prejudice the settlement towards which we are working. The election of half the Commissioners would raise questions of constitutional theory and practice. The Governor is responsible to the Secretary of State and, through him, to Parliament. If the three Commissioners were elected they would in a sense be responsible to the electorate, as well as to the Secretary of State. Divided loyalties might very well affect the efficiency of the Government. With regard to the position of the Governor it is not generally known that one of the reasons why the Royal Commssion recommended that the Chairman should be the Governor is that the Governor has a different status; and that his presence in the chair would keep a proper balance between the Newfoundland Commissioners and the United Kingdom Commissioner, and thus correct any tendency for the United Kingdom Commissioners to establish a dominating influence. In practice, there has never been any difference of opinion between the Newfoundland Commissioners on the one hand and the United Kingdom Commissioner on the other, but the presence of


the Governor in the chair has served to reassure public opinion that the local point of view will have full weight.<br/>
I would point out that the Governor of a self-governing community acts on the advice of his Ministers and that the Governor of a non-self-governing Colony is responsible to the appropriate Secretary of State. But in the special case of Newfoundland the Governor in Commission&#x2014;that is, the Governor acting on the advice of the Commission&#x2014;is responsible to the Secretary of State and, through him, to Parliament. If he ceased to be a Member of the Commission the Commissioners would be responsible to the Secretary of State direct, and not through the Governor. This would place the Governor in a very difficult position. Such a change, moreover, would be a departure from the arrangements made, with the consent of all concerned, in 1933, and it would be necessary to consult Newfoundland public opinion, to find out whether the people of Newfoundland would be agreeable to the change. My Noble Friend does not think that any minor change of this kind at the present moment would be desirable. The whole question of constitutional changes in Newfoundland will come up for consideration after the war.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for North Camberwell referred to the proposal which he put forward, for a 10 years' plan. It has been suggested in some quarters that if self-government was restored&#x2014;I think my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter) raised this matter&#x2014;the United Kingdom Government should continue to guarantee Newfoundland expenditure. Complete self-government, in the view of the Government, must mean responsibility for the island's finances. Any other course would mean a training in irresponsibility, rather than in responsibility.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend will wait I will carry my point a little further. This does not mean that any form of financial assistance should be ruled out. It means that the United Kingdom Government would not guarantee the island's finances. My Noble Friend feels that the Newfoundland people should consider their future prospects after the war and the possibilities of carrying on, allowing for capital expenditure and the maintenance of the social services. Only after making these calculations can they determine whether assistance will still be called for. If so, they should consider as the next step the bearing of the need for such assistance or the form of government best suited to the island.</p>

<p>No, Sir. The Government are going into all these suggestions. All I am saying is that as far as the people of Newfoundland are concerned that is how the Government feel they should approach this matter. We cannot indefinitely be responsible for their finances and say at the same time that they should have complete self-government restored to them while we were guaranteeing their finances. That was the only argument I was putting forward. I was not saying that the suggestions which my hon. Friend put to the House would not receive most careful consideration.</p>

<p>I cannot give my noble Friend any assurance about a Debate, but I have told the House that all these matters are being carefully considered by the Government at the present time. On the one item that does not

satisfy the hon. Member for Bridgeton but satisfies most of the House, the constitutional question, the hon. Member for North Camberwell touched on the question of political union with Canada. That is not a new proposal. It was considered at the time of confederation and also in 1895 and has been considered since then. It is a question which must be decided by the people of Newfoundland because His Majesty's Government would not wish to interfere in any way.<br/>
With regard to the question of political union with the United Kingdom, I would like to say a word or two in reply to the hon. and gallant Member the Senior Burgess for Oxford University. Newfoundland, the three Members said in the course of their speeches, is intensely loyal, but it is essentially part of the North American continent. The facts of geography remain and although the air has brought Newfoundland nearer to this country, it also brings the island nearer North America. The position of representatives of Newfoundland in the United Kingdom Parliament would be somewhat anomalous. They would in the very nature of things be more interested in Trans-Atlantic affairs than in our own domestic affairs here. They would have far less interest in United Kingdom business than would the representatives from Northern Ireland, which is after all a part of these islands. I do not think there is any strong demand, or even any demand at all, in Newfoundland for this solution.<br/>
I would like to refer to the question which was raised by the hon. and gallant Member for Thornbury and the hon. Member for Wood Green with regard to Goose Bay. There was no airport at Goose Bay two or three years ago and an arrangement was made with the Canadian Government which enabled them to build an airport at Goose Bay. Nothing could be said about the arrangement or the agreement which was made at that time because for operational reasons it had to be kept secret. The cost of construction of the airport was entirely borne by Canadian funds. In return it was agreed that the Newfoundland Government should grant a lease to the Canadian Government for 99 years. The lease was to be for Defence purposes and there was no transfer of Newfoundland sovereignty. The use of the airport for civil aviation will be considered after the war. The Government


were unable to explain the position to the people of Newfoundland, but as soon as the Agreement has been concluded it will be published.</p>

<p>We are, I can assure my hon. and gallant Friend, watching this matter closely. The Noble Lord referred in the last Debate to the social services, but I have very little time left in which to reply. Since the Commissioner Government have been in power they have made great strides in social services, as my Noble Friend knows. In 1934 2,800,000 dollars were spent on such items as education, public health, hospital construction, unemployment, widows' and orphans' and old age pensions, local councils, etc., but a large portion was spent on relief. This year that figure has risen to 5,000,000 dollars, of which only a small part has been spent in relief. It is chiefly in the field of public health that the Commissioner Government have made the greatest advances. When the Commissioners took over, tuberculosis and beri-beri were rampant and as a result of measures taken tuberculosis has very much decreased and beri-beri was stamped out by 1939, although there has actually been a certain recurrence of it during the past year. I think the proposals the Government have made are in general agreement with the views of the three Members who went out on the good-will Mission. They are in accordance with the provisions of the Newfoundland Act, and they reflect generally the views of the people of the island. The future form of government is a question which is left to the people of Newfoundland to decide after the war in Europe has ended, and His Majesty's Government have no desire to influence

their choice in any way. They will be prepared, with the assent of Parliament, to facilitate the change-over in any way that is practical when the decision has been made.</p>

<p>After the grave, complex Imperial questions we have been discussing I would like to recall to the House for a few moments a matter which is, I think, of some domestic significance. I think it is common ground that in the early stages of the war a very large number of men were drafted into the Army after insufficient medical examination. The consequences of that were that a large number of people returned to civil life in a state of invalidity. I first took up this matter in 1940, or at the beginning of 1941, with the then


Financial Secretary to the War Office, who is now the Minister of State. My right hon. Friend showed me his usual courtesy and kindness, but he manifestly had some difficulty in dealing with his Department. There was a good deal of passing the buck between the War Office and the Ministry of Labour. The medical staff of the Ministry passed the men into the Army, which then became responsible for them. The present Financial Secretary to the War Office is rather apt&#x2014;if my hon. and learned Friend will forgive me for the comparison&#x2014;to remind me of these words:
<q>Oh&#x0021; lover of my life,</q>
<q>My soldier saint,</q>
<q>Who thrust his breast,</q>
<q>Between the spears and me.</q>
His position is always to stand between an angry and political world and the General Staff in all its forms.<br/>
Sometimes, perhaps, he does not receive all the gratitude from the General Staff that he should receive in such matters. At any rate the Minister of State found difficulty in overcoming the objections of his Department, and my suggestions were turned down. Perhaps I may mention what they were, because I think they are still valid. I said I thought it possible that men below the category of A.1 who were passed into the Army should be medically examined from time to time. Most units possess medical officers. Most units consist of reasonably healthy and strong young men, or men in the prime of life, who do not make great calls on the medical officer, and it was the experience of most people in the last war and the earlier part of this that the medical officer of the unit at home was not overworked. Most of the men spend a good part of some days in the week in physical exercises and so on, which offer an opportunity, with a certain amount of organisation, to see that medical examinations are carried out. However that may be, I suggested to the Financial Secretary that it was not an insuperable problem, but the Department put obstacles in the way of doing anything about it. After a time I wearied of well-doing. The blitz was on at the time, and the Luftwaffe succeeded in dropping an explosive missile on the War Office which, I hasten to say, in case I am suspected of divulging security secrets, had no effect whatever. At a Departmental conference a member of the staff of the Foreign Office said,

"Will nothing move these people?" His colleague replied, "Only dynamite." Unfortunately even dynamite was insufficient. I felt that my dynamite ought to have been sufficient, and, as I say, I rather wearied of well-doing.<br/>
But I have repented of that, because I have found in the last year or so that the number of these people who come out of the Army has grown considerably. They go in for anything from six months to two years. Their career as a soldier is completely useless to the country, because before they are trained they have been found to be inefficient, for physical or mental reasons, and are marked for discharge. They are withdrawn from civil activities, often of a nature in which they could render very considerable service to the State at a very critical time. They are chargeable to the revenues of the State for an indefinite time afterwards by receiving pensions which, owing to the efforts of Members in all parts of the House, have now been put on a more satisfactory basis, but the fact remains that we are pensioning a great many people who ought never to have received pensions because they should never have been put into a position of having their health affected by military service. Most serious of all, these men have to look forward to a life of semi-invalidism in many cases. Practically any man who has his wits about him and two legs to stand on is able to get a job now, but their prospects, in spite of the efforts of the Ministry of Labour, of getting jobs after the war seem extraordinarily remote. They and their families are likely to suffer to the end of their lives in consequence of what has occurred, and all, I would suggest, with no profit to anybody concerned.<br/>
I would like to put it to my hon. Friend, who I know has very warm sympathy with this question, that something should be done now that we are tapping the older age groups and calling into the Army men who are round about middle age who have family responsibilities. Something should be done to keep a keen watch on these fellows and see that where they are unfitted for military life they are returned to civil life before their health is serious affected. I do not believe it is beyond the competence of the War Office and the wit of man to devise a system by which that can be accomplished.


I should like to give two examples which came to me in the last few weeks and which rather perturbed me, for they showed that the matter was still not being satisfactorily dealt with. A woman came to see me and said that her husband was in seriously bad health. His own doctor had diagnosed him as an epileptic and had sent him to King's College Hospital. They declined to confirm the diagnosis and wished to keep him in for treatment, but as a soldier he could not remain. They wrote to the man's unit and when he returned to the unit, the medical officer said, "You are all right; this is a lot of fuss about nothing." The woman said to me, "Is my whole life to be ruined because these people will take no notice of this matter at all?" As a result of the representations I made to him, my hon. and learned Friend took the matter up, and I am satisfied with the consequences. This man has now been seen by a specialist and his grade has been reduced. Suppose that woman had not come to me and had known nothing about her Member of Parliament. Her husband would never have gone before the specialist or seen by the medical board, and his health might have deteriorated to a considerable extent, all to no purpose.<br/>
The other case was that of a boy of 18 who was only 15 or 16 at the time of the blitz. This lad was buried with his mother and younger brothers and sisters when his house was struck. His father, who had an injury to his back, could not get into the shelter and had to stay upstairs. When they were dug out he was found to be seriously injured. The father was taken to hospital, and five weeks later he returned. The night after he returned the mother and younger brothers were out and came home to find the house had been struck a second time. The father was killed, and the lad was dug out from the <i>d&#x00E9;bris</i> seriously injured. Three years later the lad, physically recovered but in a nervous state, was called up to the Army. His doctor expressed the view that if he went into the Army it might have serious consequences and he might become a psycho-neurotic, of whom there are unfortunately too many at the present time. I hope that the War Office will do something about this case that if the lad comes out he will be paid a proper pension, because a com-

paratively young boy like that who has gone through experiences of that sort should be looked after properly by the State.<br/>
Those are two examples. I have no complaint against my hon. and learned Friend and only want to impress upon the House that this is a serious matter which I think needs looking into. We have been dealing in the last few weeks with very momentous questions and have heard one or two very moving appeals, one from my hon. Friend the Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon) yesterday and one from another hon. Friend last week. If we are going to establish some kind of unity in this country to found a new world, I suggest that it will only be done if we understand, and master, the problem of reconciling the highest interests and welfare of the individual with the highest interests and welfare of the greater unity, whatever it may be, State or Commonwealth or international combination, and I suggest that we cannot do better than begin at once by showing that we are going to look after those people who will be the citizens of the new world and who must be made to enter it whole in body and in mind by every method we can devise.</p>

Friend that whatever may have been the position in the early days of the war there has been no question of the War Office or the Ministry of Labour and National Service seeking to "pass the buck" from one to the other for the purpose of enabling me to deal with the matter which he has raised. I think it might be of interest, because it is obviously a very important consideration to most families in the country, if I were to give the House some idea of the system that has been and is in operation governing the medical examination of recruits into the Army. The medical examination of all Service recruits is carried out by medical boards set up by the Minister of Labour and National Service under the National Service Acts. The practice of the boards is governed by a code of instructions which was first issued in May, 1939. That code has from time to time been revised by a Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Horder, a very famous doctor. That Committee advises the Minister of Labour on all


questions in connection with the medical examination of men for the Armed Forces and representatives of the three Service Departments are on the Committee.<br/>
In regard to the method of examination, every man is examined by a medical board and is seen by four doctors, that is, the chairman of the board and his three colleagues. The great majority of both the chairmen and members are general practitioners, a considerable number are retired officers of the Navy, Army and Indian Medical Services, and a few of the chairmen are consultants, either retired or still in practice. The duty of examiner No. 1, if I may call him that, is to investigate the mental condition, nervous stability and previous health of each man and to examine his nervous system. The duty of examiner No. 2 is to examine the eyes and test the voice, to examine the teeth, throat, nose and ears, to note the physical development, to test the movements of joints, and to inquire into the history of injuries and operations. The duty of examiner No. 3 is to take the pulse rate, examine the heart and, where necessary, test the blood pressure, and apply the exercise tolerance test, to take the measurements of the chest and to examine the lungs and abdomen, and to confirm any abnormalities noted by the previous examiners. The duty of the chairman is to review the case as a whole, and, after consulting three colleagues, to decide the grading. Perhaps the House would be interested to know that, on the average, the examination takes just under half-an-hour. Any man about whom the board has any doubt may be referred to a consultant or specialist. Since June, 1939, about five per cent. of the men examined have been referred to an opthalmologist and five per cent. to other specialists or consultants.<br/>
As regards classification, recruits are classified in one of five grades, I, IIA, II, III and IV. Only those men who are placed in Grades I, IIA, and II are accepted for service. Grade I men are those who are subject only to such minor disabilities as can be remedied or adequately compensated by artificial means such as spectacles, false teeth and so on, and attain the full normal standard of health and strength and are capable of enduring physical exertion suitable to their age. Grade II men are those who are suffering from disabilities disqualifying

them for Grade I, do not suffer from progressive organic disease, have fair hearing and vision, are of moderate, muscular development and are also able to undergo a considerable amount of physical exercise not involving severe strain. Grade IIA indicates that a man has been placed in Grade II solely on account of defects either of visual equity or deformity of the lower extremities, or both.<br/>
This civilian medical board grade is subsequently translated into the corresponding Army categories A, A1, B, B1 and so on, and this is reviewed by the military medical officer when the man joins up for service. I want to be quite frank with the House; it is quite true to say that the Army medical officer does not undertake an exhaustive examination, although he does examine the man stripped; but he checks over the facts which have been ascertained by the Ministry of Labour medical board. It is sufficient for this lesser examination to take place when the man arrives at his unit, in view of the fact that the fuller examination has taken place by the Ministry of Labour medical board, and the facts contained in their report are with the military medical officer. Unless it is considered that there has been a definite error in grading, no category is changed by an Army medical officer until the man has been at least one month in the Army, except in the case of technical personnel. The interval between a man's medical examination under the National Service Acts and the date when he joins his unit does not normally exceed from six to eight weeks. The interval may be longer, it is true, in Some cases, for example where a man has secured postponement of his calling up on the grounds of exceptional hardship. In that case there may be a greater interval of time, but Regulations are about to be issued which will ensure that no man shall be called up for service who has not been medically examined or re-examined within the preceding six months.<br/>
Now the question may arise, What right of appeal, of protest, has a man if he disagrees with the findings of the Ministry of Labour medical board? A man who considers he has been wrongly graded by the Board can protest, and his protest will be considered by the Ministry of National Service. If there is any reason to think there has been a deterioration in his health since the first examination,


or if any fresh medical evidence can be produced, a re-examination is arranged. In addition, I am told that since September, 1941, there has been a note placed on the grade card given to a man at the time of medical examination which asks him to notify the Minister of Labour and National Service if before he is called up for service he has a serious illness or accident or otherwise has reason to believe that his health has deteriorated.<br/>
It may interest the House to know that the number of men who have been invalided out of the Army within six months as a result of what, in the opinion of the Army medical authorities, was an error in grading during the period 1st July, 1941, to 31st August, 1943, represents seven in every 10,000 of the total intake during this period and three in every 1,000 of the total invalided out of the Army during the same period. The figures for the period before 1st July, 1941, are unfortunately not available. It

appears therefore that the number of men who join the Army although they ought to have been rejected on medical grounds is very small indeed, and the figures quoted above, I suggest, can be regarded as satisfactory and are regarded as satisfactory by the Army medical authorities. I hope I have been able to give sufficient facts and sufficient explanation of the system that operates in regard to the intake of recruits from the point of view of their medical examination. I hope also that I have satisfied my hon. Friend that whatever does go wrong in individual cases, as I think is bound to be the case, and no doubt in spite of the arrangements that have been made will continue to be the case, the percentage is so small that the problem has been reduced to very minute dimensions, and the House and the country can take it that on the whole this problem has been very satisfactorily dealt with.</p>
