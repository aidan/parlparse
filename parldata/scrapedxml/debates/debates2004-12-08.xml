	<p>Echoing the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), I, too, pay tribute to the work of the DTI and the Law Society in returning money that rightfully belonged to miners, their widows and their families but was taken in percentages by claims handlers and other bodies. Can anything further be done to deal with that issue?</p>

	<p>I agree with my hon. Friend that there is great potential for small business investment from overseas countries including New Zealand and Australia, which I visited recently and met representatives of small and large businesses. As a result of a visit to China in April on behalf of Wales, a company has invested in Wales, and others are following.</p>
	<p>It is typically small minded of the nationalist group in the National Assembly to attack such visits, especially given that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) has said that Ministers should talk up Wales when they go abroad and the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) has said that we should use the instruments of the British state to promote Wales abroad more effectively. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy nods. He should sort out his Assembly group in Cardiff&mdash;he nods at that, too. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We will all help him to do that.</p>

	<p>Yes, but if the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make progress, I can specifically address that point. We are discussing the merger Bill today, not the efficiency savings that are in the agreements arising out of the Gershon review. My speech will touch specifically on the reductions in staff anticipated as a result of the departments being merged and duplication being removed. I will also touch on safeguards, efficiencies and the delivery of services. If the hon. Gentleman is a little patient, I will be happy to give way to him again if he feels that my remarks have not addressed the points that he has raised.</p>
	<p>The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise are among the oldest Government departments. The Inland Revenue can trace its history back more than 300 years&mdash;it is a rather junior partner in some senses&mdash;while a nationally organised customs system dates back to the 13th century.</p>
	<p>The new department will have more than 30 million taxpayers and stakeholders, of which 4 million are businesses. HMRC will collect more than &pound;400 billion a year in receipts and pay out over &pound;25 billion in tax credits and child benefit. The costs of running HMRC will amount to some &pound;4.8 billion a year, and the department will have nearly 100,000 staff; 20 per cent. of the civil service. It is a huge task and I very much understand the hon. Gentleman's point about the continuation of services through the period of change.</p>
	<p>Given the huge task, it is not particularly surprising that the Treasury Committee has suggested that further primary legislation is required fully to implement integration. Of course, as we the start the process of integration, I cannot confirm what will be needed, but I can say that we will be doing further work with David Varney, the prospective chairman of the new department, to look at how it should manage its business. If legislative change is needed to support our conclusions, it will be brought forward in an appropriate form for consideration by the House.</p>
	<p>Delivering real, meaningful integration is a process that should be measured in years, not weeks. That has been acknowledged by all those who have commented on the Bill. It must be an ongoing process of continual improvement; a process that identifies and responds to taxpayers' needs, involving proper consultation where appropriate to produce robust and effective new policies. It must develop and exploit new technologies and working methods to create the integrated, coherent and consistent approach that we all seek, and that taxpayers rightly expect.</p>
	<p>The Bill is, and can only be, the first step in that process, but it is a vital step. It creates the organisational structures within which the process of integration can develop. Without the Bill, that process of improving the way in which we deliver services to taxpayers cannot even start in the systematic way that we all want.</p>
	<p>I shall explain briefly why integration is so important. The O'Donnell review identified clear benefits from integration that will pay real dividends for people and businesses throughout the UK, and are vital to ensuring that this country remains a highly competitive place to do business. Foremost among those benefits are the improvements to taxpayer or customer focus that integration can deliver. The delivery of more joined-up services will result in a more consistent and coherent approach to taxpayers' affairs. Understanding taxpayers and taking a view across their affairs is essential to deliver a world-class service, built on support for taxpayers that is tailored to their needs.</p>
	<p>We have already started identifying areas where this approach would be beneficial. The Chancellor's announcement at the pre-Budget report of a new small business unit at the heart of the new department is a key example. Improvements to the use of information within the new department should, as IT capability is developed, reduce the need for taxpayers to supply the same information several times over. The Chancellor's pre-Budget report announcement of work to develop ways of minimising the requirements on small businesses through, for example, a single tax return for all taxes and a reduction in the number of forms, is a key component of this agenda. Returning to the point made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), that will bring efficiency savings for business and Government alike.</p>
	<p>The same developments that will improve the taxpayer experience will also improve the effectiveness of revenue administration, helping to reduce the tax gap. Better use of information, built around an ability to look across a taxpayer's affairs, will allow for more effective targeting of resources to areas of risk. That will improve fairness, making it harder for those who seek to avoid their obligations to succeed, and reducing unnecessary interventions in the affairs of honest taxpayers. There will also be efficiency improvements. Through economies of scale and alignment of common areas of activity, integration will produce efficiency savings of 3,200 posts by 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p>The Treasury Committee's report rightly suggested that a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of integration would be helpful. The regulatory impact assessment published alongside the Bill sets out the costs and benefits of the legislation. Future substantive proposals for legislative reform will also be accompanied by regulatory impact assessments in the usual way, so that the costs and benefits of particular measures to effect integration can be considered. That further addresses the hon. Gentleman's point with regard to progress on integration over a period of time.</p>

	<p>I want to be as clear as possible in giving the right hon. Gentleman an assurance on that point. I want to make it clear that all the department's current functions associated with tax and tax credits cannot be transferred under the Bill. The department could collaborate with a devolved Administration or undertake particular work&mdash;for example, the collection of student loans&mdash;on behalf of another department, but that does not include the administration associated with any of its revenue collection or protection duties.</p>

It does not introduce substantive changes to the administration of regimes, and existing powers for enforcing regimes therefore will be transferred to the new department without any change to the way in which or purposes for which they may be used. The Bill achieves that by ring-fencing powers to prevent their inadvertent extension within HMRC.</p>
	<p>Let me spell out what that means in practice. I think that the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) will recognise this from the time when he was Economic Secretary. It means that a VAT inspector will retain all her current powers in HMRC, with no changes. Similarly, the powers of a corporation tax inspector in HMRC will remain as they currently are in the Inland Revenue. The Bill ensures that the VAT inspector's powers do not become available to the corporation tax inspector, and vice versa. That applies across all HMRC functions. Powers in the new department remain as they currently are in the separate organisations.</p>
	<p>This is, of course, only a temporary position. As the Treasury Committee report acknowledged, delivery of integration in the longer term on the scale that I described is likely to require greater consistency of approach to enable effective working across different taxes and duties. To that end, I can announce today that the Government will issue a consultation document in January that will consider the suitability of the existing range of powers, including the requirement to provide information; interest and surcharge regimes for late payment; penalties for non-compliance and rights of appeal; and the modern regulations and practices that HMRC will need to be a high-performing 21st-century tax administration.</p>
	<p>The Government intend that following that initial consultation and the completion of the Bill's passage, HMRC officials should enter into more detailed discussions with representative bodies. The consultation exercise does not aim to deliver reform in time for the creation of HMRC, but will be the beginning of a thorough review, with the aim of legislating where necessary in the 2006 Finance Bill.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, to aid clarity on and public understanding of the powers available to HMRC for its different functions, an advice note on the powers available to officers of the new department will be published in time for the inception of HMRC. The Inland Revenue and Customs today placed a copy of the draft of that advice note on their internet site, seeking comments. It is also available in the Vote Office and the Library. The departments will also write to key representative customer and tax bodies to invite their comments.</p>
	<p>This considered and incremental timetable for change has been welcomed by key representative taxpayer bodies, as well as by the Treasury Committee. I hope that the House, too, will endorse it.</p>
	<p>The Bill confirms HMRC's authority to pool information internally so that information supplied for one of its functions can be used for any of its other functions. That authority is vital to deliver the joined-up services that the O'Donnell review envisaged and to capture the consequent benefits in service and effectiveness. Again, that has been recognised by key external commentators as a necessary prerequisite for the successful integration of services.</p>
	<p>I stress that HMRC will of course take taxpayer confidentiality every bit as seriously as the predecessor departments; the importance of that was recognised by the Treasury Committee's report. There will be no let-up in HMRC's commitment to safeguarding taxpayer confidentiality.</p>

	<p>I shall carry on more or less from where the Paymaster General left off, although I shall not try to match her symphony of heavenly length. That was partly because she gave way so generously that she had to make such a long speech, but I shall try to make mine in about half that time. I should like to thank her for inviting me, my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) and the Liberal spokesman, the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), to the Treasury to discuss the Bill. We found that briefing very helpful.</p>
	<p>I really will carry on from where the right hon. Lady left off in one particular regard. She talked about the culture of the departments. The Revenue departments come in for a lot of criticism, both from individuals and businesses&mdash;and sometimes from me&mdash;particularly when they fail to use common sense and end up making my constituents' lives a misery. Customs, in particular, has come in for a rough ride in recent years.</p>
	<p>At the outset, however, I want to say that we are lucky in this country with our Revenue departments. In many ways, they are the salt of the earth. They probably provide the least corrupt revenue service of any major country in the world, and are assiduous in protecting the Revenue. Above all, they have a sense of collective loyalty and duty that only the best organisations can hope to nurture.</p>
	<p>Some might think that I say all that because I might be sitting on the other side of the House shortly, so it would be handy for the early part of my tenure to have said it. As it happens, I say it because I believe it, having worked closely with both departments in the 1980s. I would like any criticisms and reservations that I and my party might express about the departments in the weeks ahead, as we consider the Bill, to be put in the context of those remarks.</p>

	<p>I shall not get drawn on the alcohol and tobacco point, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman's comment that a high proportion of the problems of Government departments are caused by politicians getting in the way and trying to run things, rather than getting out of the way and reducing the size of departments to enable the rest of the country to get on with their jobs.</p>
	<p>The Opposition will not force a Division on this issue tonight. Our primary concern is not that, in principle, there are no benefits to be had from merger, but that in practice, we are not yet convinced that the Government have thought through fully how to capture the benefits of merger, or even tried to measure them much.</p>
	<p>Although we have had the O'Donnell report, a regulatory impact assessment, a Bill and its explanatory notes, rafts of evidence to the Treasury Committee and much else, we have not yet obtained clear thinking from the Government on why we are merging these departments. The nearest that I have found to a clear summary for the reasons for merger is in Gus O'Donnell's March report&mdash;a very long report, which I have here&mdash;particularly in paragraphs 1.18 and 3.41. It would be far too tedious to read it all out, but I shall try to provide a summary, which I think the Paymaster-General will agree is connected to what she said earlier.</p>
	<p>Mr. O'Donnell says that there are four benefits of a merger: first,</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;more complete information and analysis to improve risk management across the tax system&quot;;</p>
	<p>secondly,</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;better and more flexible use of resources&quot;;</p>
	<p>thirdly,</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;a more focused approach to compliance across the tax system&quot;;</p>
	<p>and fourthly, &quot;better deterrence&quot; through increased</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;compliance allowing greater targeting of the non-compliant.&quot;</p>
	<p>I was not much the wiser having read that.</p>
	<p>In a speech only a few weeks ago, Gus O'Donnell had a go at his predecessor, Lord Bridges: he read out a passage of Lord Bridges's prose, which he described as something of which Sir Humphrey Appleby would be proud. I think that I have worked out what Gus O'Donnell meant in his passage. Great man though he is, he seems to have fallen into a similar mandarin trap.</p>
	<p>Much more worrying, however, is the lack of clarity in some of these documents about why the departments are being merged, which may conceal a lack of a sense of purpose in doing it. My concern is not just that it is not explained, but that those who are doing it may not be clear in their minds about why they are doing it.</p>
	<p>I sat down and tried to work out what tests we should use to measure whether a merger would be a success. Those can be much more simply stated than anything that I have seen in these documents. If the Paymaster General disagrees with what I say, I shall give way to her, and if I miss out a major item I am sure that she will be able to leap in.</p>
	<p>The primary task of a revenue department is to get the money in. Therefore, task No. 1 is to protect the yield. Will this merger get more money in with fewer mistakes? If so, how much? That is the first issue that needs to be measured.</p>
	<p>The second objective must be to reduce the hassle for millions of individuals, and hundreds and thousands of businesses throughout the country&mdash;the so-called compliance burden. Will that go up or down with this merger? The Paymaster General implied that it would go down. If so, by how much? What is her estimate?</p>
	<p>Two consequential questions flow from those two simple ones, and they also need answering. Are we confident enough about the possible gains in extra yield and better compliance to be able to justify what everybody agrees would be transitional costs? I refer not only to the &pound;75 million in the explanatory notes but to the enormous disruption that will take place&mdash;the Paymaster General implied at the end of her remarks that the merger was a Herculean task, with which I agree, and that will also impose a substantial transitional cost. Are we confident that the extra gains in yield and compliance are greater than those transitional costs?</p>
	<p>Finally&mdash;this relates to a point that I made at the beginning&mdash;we need to have in mind a long-run strategic objective. Even if the benefits outweigh the costs, are we confident that we can achieve that without a decline in the high standards that Revenue departments have set themselves, including their duty of confidentiality? Will the morale of the departments suffer in the long run? In particular, we must bear in mind that both departments, particularly Customs, face major criminal efforts at evasion.</p>
	<p>I have set out my four tests for attempting to measure the success of a merger. I agree that other considerations may be relevant, but the Paymaster General has not leapt to her feet to suggest that anything that I have said is mistaken or that I have missed out something substantial.</p>
	<p>Let us try to move forward. As we now have some intelligible yardsticks, how does the merger measure up to them? The first port of call should be the regulatory impact assessment, a relatively thin document for such an important issue. I can find in it no overall estimate of the effects on the yield. Virtually the whole of the economic costs and benefits are dealt with in five very short paragraphs. On efficiency savings, we are told that there will be 13,000 staff savings, but when we consider that carefully, and as the Paymaster General clarified earlier, more than 9,000 of those will come anyway under the Gershon review, even without the merger, and only 3,000&mdash;3,200 now, I think&mdash;as a result of integration. Incidentally, those figures have moved around a bit as they have been examined.</p>
	<p>The Treasury Committee did a very good job generally on this subject. It is sensible, particularly with regard to subjects that are not absolutely urgent and immediate, that debate should take place on the basis of thorough scrutiny by Select Committees. The Treasury Committee also did a good job on this specific point, and I commend the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt), who is in his place, and the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann), who showed in questions in Committee just how much the numbers on potential savings had moved around.</p>
	<p>We have arrived at the point of agreement that the Government are saying that staff savings directly from the merger will be about 3,200&mdash;just over 3 per cent. of the total work force. That is scarcely the sort of number that could justify what amounts to one of the biggest mergers in Whitehall, or indeed between any two organisations. No private sector institutions would go through all the administrative hell and business risk of a merger to secure 3 per cent. staff savings, but if we take the regulatory impact assessment at face value, that is what the Government appear to be saying as to why we should support the Bill.</p>
	<p>At least, that was the position in all the documentation until today. Today, the Paymaster General came up with a variation: she told us that the total merger savings amount to &pound;500 million. I should be grateful if she could tell us whether that &pound;500 million is directly connected to the 3,000 staff saving, or whether it is also connected to the further savings that will result from the Gershon review.</p>

	<p>I shall listen very carefully to what the Government have to say on this issue, but I am inclined to say no, I do not think it sufficient. I want to stay on the road that we are currently on, which is keeping the oath. In fact, we should extend the Revenue oath to all members of the new department. However, let us discuss this issue in Committee.</p>
	<p>Let me say a brief work on IT systems. Although not the most crucial questions, two important ones are: to what extent can these systems be merged, bearing in mind the different needs of the two departments; and what savings are to be made from such a merger? As David Varney said in giving evidence to the Select Committee, the new department will have 250 major IT systems and 3,000 staff working them. It will</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;put out 170 million forms a year and run 100,000 desktop computers.&quot;</p>
	<p>I was not at all surprised to see that, in its report, the National Audit Office told Customs that contingency plans were needed to deal with the O'Donnell review. Are the Government prepared to put into the public domain the necessary information to reassure us that contingency planning has indeed been conducted? Do the Government have a contingency plan for weaknesses in IT that they could publish, and can we please have it before we consider the Bill in Committee? I hope that the Government do not think that I am wasting officials' time by asking Whitehall to produce a document or amend an existing document before January.</p>
	<p>IT systems are never easy, but the truth is that the Government's record on them does not inspire confidence. My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) will discuss it in greater detail later, but let me give a few brief examples. The Child Support Agency's computer system, which cost nearly &pound;500 million, recently failed and staff at the Department for Work and Pensions were unable recently to process new benefits and pension claims for several days because the system went down. The computer systems of the Passport Service, the Criminal Records Bureau and National Air Traffic Services have also had problems. And so we go on.</p>

	<p>The merger of Customs and Excise with the Inland Revenue was proposed by the previous Treasury Committee and has been welcomed by the current one. On the face of it, as the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) touched on, it is a peculiar coupling. Customs and Excise has an image of speed boats and James Bond activity in remote inlets of the coast, whereas the Inland Revenue has the Bob Cratchit quill-pen image of someone at home in a dusty office with ledgers. That is not how it seems to many business people, who deal with one set of people to pay VAT and another set to pay company and income tax.</p>
	<p>Bringing those two cultures together with compatible IT systems will ostensibly lead to savings, as already mentioned, but realising the potential benefits that are pointed out in the O'Donnell report needs managing&mdash;indeed, a degree of management that has not always been apparent in the past. That said, we must not lose sight of the wood for the trees. The dominant and primary objective of this merger is not cost saving in organisation: the overriding aim must be to reduce the gap between the potential revenue to the Government from tax and what is realised. That tax gap is too large.</p>
	<p>The touchstone of success of this merger is not some recondite measure of administrative efficiency&mdash;it is the reduction, virtually to elimination if possible, of tax evasion. The amount of tax currently not paid by those who should pay VAT or company tax or income tax would make a significant contribution to the national accounts. At the same time, we must foresee and minimize the impact of new tax policy on the competitiveness of businesses.</p>
	<p>In that context, I welcome the proposal for retaining an ability to assess the business impact of tax proposals within the new organisation, while at the same time strengthening the Treasury's ability to assess the overall effect of tax policy. If there are to be adverse effects of new taxes, at least we should expect that they were known about and weighed against the benefits of the tax. Normally, we should expect that adverse effects are anticipated, and eliminated as much as possible.</p>
	<p>Above all, we must avoid the costs that honest organisations face in complying with tax law. I know very well that the CBI goes on and on, boringly, on the subject, as though all tax were an unnecessary imposition, and Digby certainly does moan an awful lot&mdash;but he is not always wrong.</p>
	<p>There is no real reason why the basis for calculating income tax, for example, should be slightly different from the basis for calculating national insurance contributions and so involve a different set of calculations. More generally, the accounting needed for tax purposes could be brought nearer to the principles involved in normal company accounts. I hope that the new tax policy unit will home in on such issues.</p>
	<p>A great gain for many businesses will be that they will have to deal with one inspector only for VAT, company tax and income tax. However, the primary measure of success of this reform will be the reduction of tax evasion, and the record is not good in either detection or prosecution.</p>
	<p>The case of the London bonded warehouse was a scandal that could be presented theatrically as a farce. Duty-free spirits were donated to the back doors of public houses throughout south-east England on a grand scale. They left the bonded warehouse heading for the continent, and so no duty was paid on them. However, they had a regular habit of turning round at the sight of the channel and returning to London. Once that was spotted, an exercise was established for acquiring the evidence needed for prosecution. The Exchequer lost the unbelievable sum of &pound;670 million just in the process of gathering the evidence.</p>
	<p>Then there was the case of Regina <i>v</i>. Doran, a large-scale drug dealer. He was caught redhanded in possession of a huge haul of class A drugs. Someone had to try really hard to allow him to avoid due punishment, but the case failed because of a legal mix-up in mounting the prosecution. After those two cases, the Roques report looked into the management and administration of Customs and Excise, and the Butterfield report analysed whether Customs and Excise should have its powers to mount independent prosecutions taken away.</p>
	<p>The Treasury Sub-Committee was assured that the findings of those two inquiries had now been acted upon. That is no doubt true, but I should like an assurance from the new chairman, Mr. Varney, that he is personally satisfied that these events could not be repeated in the new organisation. The Sub-Committee was not reassured when the previous Customs and Excise chairman was asked for an assurance that staff vetting procedures were such that no one with a criminal record could be employed in Customs and Excise. The answer was no, he could not give us that assurance.</p>
	<p>Likewise, action against cigarette smuggling is not reassuring. A few years ago, no duty was paid on one in four cigarettes sold in Britain. That 25 per cent. has been brought down to 18 per cent. but many cigarettes are still being smuggled, at a cost to the Exchequer of around &pound;2.5 billion per annum.</p>
	<p>The cigarettes in question were not made of mud and brick dust in a shanty town. They were made by three major UK companies&mdash;British American Tobacco, Gallahers and Imperial Tobacco Ltd, with the Government health warning printed on the side of packets. The total estimate of smuggled cigarettes in 2002&ndash;03 was about 12 billion, out of a total consumption of 75 billion. With duty avoided on that scale, I cannot believe that no one in those major companies knew what was going on.</p>
	<p>At a recent meeting of the Treasury Sub-Committee, we were told that progress had been made and that the companies involved had signed a memorandum of understanding to co-operate in reducing cigarette smuggling. So three major companies have decided that they are willing to co-operate in enforcing the law of the land, but that leaves rather up in the air the question of what went on before the memorandum. No doubt all will be revealed in due course.</p>
	<p>Mr. O'Donnell, the permanent under-secretary to the Treasury, said when he was commending this reorganisation that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;you need an organisation which is capable of managing different cultures within itself. For honest taxpayers you want a culture that is customer friendly. For dishonest taxpayers and, where there is fraud going on, you need a very tough, ruthless approach.&quot;</p>
	<p>I agree entirely that that is a good principle of operation, but we seem to have seen too little of the tough and ruthless approach. If anything, the approach seems to have been lackadaisical and benignly indulgent. The great fallacy would be to assume that, because we are setting up a new organisation, all the observations in the Roques and Butterfield reports would be complied with immediately. They will not be, unless there is a clear determination, and a management ethos, to crack down on the cheats and frauds mercilessly.</p>
	<p>The message that I should like to see go out from this debate to Mr. Varney, the chairman, and to his management team is that he should stick to the customer friendly approach for the honest taxpayer, but use every power available against the dishonest ones. If he does not have enough powers, he should come back and ask for more.</p>
	<p>There is a heavy dependence on management to put right the inadequacies that I have outlined. Legislation is not enough. The management arrangements of the Inland Revenue, as evidence to the Treasury Sub-Committee has shown, do not lead to unqualified confidence. The sale of all the Inland Revenue's properties on lease-back to a company registered in a tax haven did not imply a management with a highly developed sense of the ridiculous. Nor was a sense of worldliness obvious when a so-called comfort letter was given to the buyer that breached Treasury directives that apply to every Government Department. The then head of the Inland Revenue was not told about it, and neither was the Minister.</p>
	<p>The Treasury Sub-Committee has welcomed the steps taken to tighten management in the new organisation. We have supported the introduction of a framework document setting out who is accountable to whom, and for what. We also welcome the proposal for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor to issue an annual remit to the executive chairman outlining the organisation's new and continuing tasks. However, the proposal for the executive chairman to report to three different Ministers on different aspects of the organisation is a formula for confusion, delay and blurred accountability. It is important that the new organisation hits the ground running and puts the past behind it. A first year with management distracted by a flurry of memos around Treasury departments and fruitless co-ordination meetings will not achieve that. I hope that the Sub-Committee's recommendation that this arrangement should be looked at again will be acted on, not when the confusion has happened but without delay.</p>
	<p>This Bill is a good basic framework that recognises the inadequacies that have arisen in the past in both Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue. However, it must not be seen as a ritual incantation that in itself will provide a revenue and customs service relevant to the 21st century. It needs complementing by a highly motivated staff, who are managed to make full use of their abilities, directed to achieve clear objectives and provided with investment in technology. All that is vital to them ensuring that the taxation that this House votes for is fairly levied on everyone who has a lawful duty to pay. I am sure that the good wishes of this House go out to all who will be involved in an endeavour that is so fundamental to the life of this country. They will not be thanked by their customers: let us thank them in anticipation of their services.</p>

	<p>I join the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) in thanking the Paymaster General and the Economic Secretary for the briefing that they gave us a week or so ago. In particular, I thank the Paymaster General for returning to me an item of clothing that I left in her office at the end of our discussion. [Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] I should clarify that it was a coat. Her generosity in bringing it back to the House was welcome, especially as it was a cold day.</p>
	<p>I also join the hon. Gentleman in broadly welcoming the Bill. We share the view of Martin Taylor who, in the evidence that he gave to Gus O'Donnell's report, which was produced in March, said that the separation of tax-gathering departments is anomalous in a modern economy. That is an accurate assessment of the position and I pay tribute to those bodies, such as the Treasury Committee, whose Chairman and other members have been in their places today, for their work in drawing attention to the potential benefits of merger. I am especially pleased that they have indicated that they will continue to track the progress of this merger over the next few years, because that will be important.</p>
	<p>We share many of the detailed concerns that the hon. Gentleman outlined and I shall set out some of those in a minute. I am also pleased that the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), who is also a member of the Treasury Committee, emphasised in his contribution the importance of addressing the tax gap through the merger of the two departments. The Paymaster General gave a long, detailed and helpful speech, but the one area on which she was a little light was an emphasis on how, over time, the merger will seek to address that important issue. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman put it at the centre of what the Government strategy should be.</p>
	<p>Although I started by saying that we broadly welcome the Bill, we also share the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) and by many of the professional bodies about how the merger will work in practice, and we share Martin Taylor's view&mdash;set out in his submission to Gus O'Donnell&mdash;that the change will be risky, perhaps very risky. We also share the view of the Law Society that major gains could be made from the merger if it is conducted well. The devil will be in the detail and the delivery of the changes. If the Government and those people responsible for delivering and implementing the merger get the detail and the delivery wrong, what could be a triumph&mdash;in the Government's mind&mdash;could turn into a disaster. It is the risks on which I shall concentrate, bearing in mind that the Bill is essentially a modest mechanism to get the merger up and running, leaving some of the important decisions about powers for consultation and implementation to a later date.</p>
	<p>I shall start by setting out the points of agreement with the Government. The first is that although there are many areas in the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise with no obvious overlap in responsibilities, we can see the potential for cost savings within the new department and in compliance for businesses. We also believe that there is a potential for improving action against tax evasion and avoidance. In our view, and as the Treasury Committee concluded&mdash;the Government appear to agree&mdash;those gains are more likely to be secured by a merged department than by keeping the two departments separate and trying to institute measures to ensure co-operation between the departments, including some of the measures that have been in place in recent years.</p>
	<p>The second reason we support this change is that although it will lead to considerable overhauling of the two departments and, potentially, some disturbance to their activities in the next few years, I would be very surprised if it did not expose the scope for doing business considerably better and at less cost. When I was in the private sector, one particular company used to refer to Spanish practices that built up over time and institutionalised inefficiencies. I am not sure that it is politically correct to refer to such practices in that way now, but I am sure that the merger will reveal areas where things could be done considerably better.</p>
	<p>Thirdly, we welcome the mechanism through which the Government will deliver the merger. The O'Donnell report clearly set out different options for the Government in proceeding with the merger, including legislating rapidly for the new department on issues such as its powers or taking a more leisurely approach and allowing plenty of time for consultation on the powers of the new department. The Government have taken a sensible approach in introducing this modest enabling Bill and leaving time and scope for consultation. We share the welcome voiced by the hon. Member for Chichester for a consultation paper in January that will allow people an early chance to feed their views into the Finance Bill for 2006, regardless of which party will then be in power.</p>
	<p>The fourth area of agreement is on the establishment of a new Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office. As my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) said earlier, he has argued for such a body for some time, and it was also proposed in the Butterfield report. It is a sensible change.</p>
	<p>The fifth and final area is one in which I differ from the hon. Gentleman, although I acknowledge that he has more experience and skills in such matters, so I may be making a mistake. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the Government will take back some control over strategic leadership on tax policy from the two departments and put it in the Treasury. That is where it belongs.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman is right: ultimately, Ministers have accountability for determining tax strategy and pursuing it. I am sure he is also right to say that revenue Departments and Treasury officials, if given clear and helpful advice about how Ministers want the tax system to develop, would deliver the necessary policies. However, my sense of the way things have worked in practice over recent years is that that has not actually happened, partly perhaps because much of the tax policy expertise has been in the individual revenue Departments rather than centrally. I may be na-ve in thinking that this reform will change that aspect of the system, but I live in hope.</p>
	<p>As we debate the detail of the Bill, we must remember that many people outside in the real world, especially in the business world, will not be as interested in the small elements and small changes in the Bill as in what it will mean over time for the tax system as a whole. David Frost, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, summed up the general view of tax practitioners and business men about the British tax system when he wrote recently:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Britain's tax system has come into being piece by piece over the years . . . often without regard to the complexity of the whole. Our tax system is already over-complicated, but each year brings new additions and alterations. Tax simplification is often identified by the government as a goal, but progress is rarely achieved.&quot;</p>
	<p>I hope that setting up the merged department will be the opportunity for a more coherent tax strategy and that it will galvanise the Government into simplifying the tax system, because without simplification the benefits of merger will be much less than they might otherwise be.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-12-08.1199.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" speakername="David Laws" colnum="1199"  time="14:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041208/debtext/41208-13.htm#41208-13_spnew5">
	<p>I do not want to get bogged down on that particular point. Having discussed the issue with local representatives of the Inland Revenue offices in my area, I can tell the Paymaster General that they seem to feel strongly about the way in which the announcement was made, and the Government should be acutely aware of that in terms of taking staff on board for a strategy that will mean considerable change.</p>
	<p>To return to the Government's presentation of the matter, on 23 November, the Gracious Speech announced the merger in the context of</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;reducing bureaucracy and the costs of Government&quot;.</p>
	<p>In other words, the focus was very much on efficiency, costs and the staffing savings that could be made rather than on the tax gap&mdash;the point raised by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford earlier.</p>
	<p>As earlier exchanges in the debate showed, and the hon. Member for Chichester highlighted, there is considerable uncertainty about what the economics of the merger are. I hope that the Economic Secretary will be able to clarify an important point about the &pound;507 million savings when he sums up the debate. My understanding is that the savings of &pound;507 million over the spending review period relate to the total reduction in staff numbers, now set at 12,500 jobs net&mdash;16,000 jobs gross&mdash;rather than the 3,200 job cuts that relate specifically to the merger of the departments. I should think that 3,200 job cuts equate roughly to savings of &pound;75 million or &pound;100 million a year, cumulating upwards over a period of time as the cuts take place. I do not see how the Government can get to a figure of &pound;507 million over the spending review period, unless they are doing what the Paymaster General earlier criticised the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) for doing&mdash;conflating the general Gershon savings with the impact of the merger savings.</p>
	<p>We also know from the Government's regulatory impact assessment&mdash;thin though that is on the monetary costs and benefits of the merger&mdash;that certain costs will arise as a consequence of the merger. The Government put those costs at &pound;75 million for the two years 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. Presumably, that is just a small portion of the costs that will arise as a consequence of the merger, particularly given that the figure relates to two years and that not much expenditure will be incurred in the first year, 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p>Standing back, as the hon. Member for Chichester sought to do, and assessing whether the Government will make any such efficiency saving at all over the period of the spending review and, indeed, over the rest of the decade, I have considerable scepticism about whether any net saving will be made from the merger. When the Economic Secretary replies to the debate, I would welcome any clarification on whether he expects any net saving during either the period of the spending review or the rest of the decade from the merger.</p>
	<p>My confidence in the Government's lack of clarity about such things is reinforced by the O'Donnell report, which says on page 63, in section 3.99:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;when Jobcentre Plus was created the benefit of providing a unified contact point . . . in terms of efficiencies, job outcomes, and reductions in fraud and error, were projected to equal the investment cost within seven to eight years.&quot;</p>
	<p>In other words, it may be well into the next decade before any net annual saving is made from the merger of the Departments.</p>
	<p>Does it really matter whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Gracious Speech are rather over-hyping the potential to make efficiency savings, while the Government quietly, sensibly and rather elusively indicate in their own assessments that there may not be any net saving? I am not sure whether that is simply an issue of presentation, about which we should not concern ourselves. If the Government in presenting the merger and its justification put a great premium on the possible staff and efficiency savings and the Government are competing with other parties in the run-up to the general election to promise reductions in civil service numbers, a great deal of pressure could be put on the new department to make savings in staff numbers that might not be borne out by the sensible economies that the department would implement if left to its own devices.</p>
	<p>That point marries with the point made by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford, and it was made very effectively in an article in <i>The</i> <i>Tax Journal</i> by John Davidson of Baker Tilly on 19 April 2004, where he says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;If the motivation for the merger is to save money and to cut jobs, it could be to the long-term detriment of the Revenue and the taxpayer. It will save a large sum of money. At the average salary cost, the loss of 10,500 will give a saving of &pound;267 million. This, however, is just 0.08 per cent. of the revenue raised by the two departments&quot;.</p>
	<p>In the year that he cited, that revenue was &pound;338 billion, and I think that I heard the Paymaster General say earlier that it was rising to &pound;400 billion over the period that we are considering. The article continues:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;If job cuts cause a 0.1 per cent. loss of revenue, the savings&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>even those excluding the cost of the merger&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;will not have been worthwhile.&quot;</p>
	<p>The importance of the contribution made by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford is underlined by the similar point that Martin Taylor makes in his contribution to Gus O'Donnell's report. He says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the reduction of the tax gap is far the bigger prize, and should be the priority rather than costs . . . this should be made clear to the new management, who should not be judged primarily on the attainment of secondary objectives.&quot;</p>
	<p>That is exactly right, and the Paymaster General very helpfully and honestly acknowledged&mdash;she need not look worried when I say that&mdash;in her earlier comments that the 3,200 staff reduction figure from the merger is itself a guess.</p>
	<p>The Inland Revenue officials who gave evidence to the Treasury Sub-Committee, which is chaired by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), were clear that the 3,200 figure was taken from guestimates of previous changes, including those in the Department for Work and Pensions. So it could be that the 3,200 figure is unlikely to be delivered and that Mr. Varney could find himself working to promises that he has given to the Government to deliver staff reductions that he would not want to bear out in practice. I hope that when the Economy Secretary replies to the debate, he will give us a clear undertaking that he and the Paymaster General will advise the chairman to focus on reducing the tax gap and compliance costs and only to reduce staff numbers when the Government can be sure that doing so will not damage those two other objectives.</p>
	<p>I take some hope from David Varney's contribution to Gus O'Donnell's report, where he wrote:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;It will be a challenge to keep a long-term focus on the effectiveness prizes and not fall prey to the temptation to substitute short-term cost reduction objectives.&quot;</p>
	<p>David Varney knows very well what the priorities are, and I hope that the Economic Secretary and the Paymaster General will strongly support him in ensuring that those are the priorities. I wonder therefore whether the Economic Secretary could give us more information about those very important issues that relate to the merger's economic costs and benefits. Will he give us a time scale for the reduction of 3,200 jobs in the merger; or is that figure so uncertain that no time scale can be offered?</p>
	<p>Will the Economic Secretary be absolutely clear with us about whether the &pound;500 million savings relate to the merger or to the Gershon savings? Can the Government give us any guestimates of what the net savings will be from the merger over this spending review period, let alone any further round? Can the Economic Secretary give us any indication of whether there will be any net saving over the spending review period?</p>
	<p>Will any of the 3,200 job losses result from outsourcing in the two departments? I understand that Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue have different arrangements governing the extent to which they outsource work. I am sure that the Economic Secretary would not want any pressure to be put on the new department artificially to reduce job numbers by outsourcing, rather than doing what is in its best economic interests. In particular, is there any plan to outsource the debt collection facility of the combined department?</p>
	<p>On the number of total employees, is the Economic Secretary confident that both departments are able to carry out their current work, particularly with tax credits, which have caused a lot of problems recently, not least because of the huge backlogs at the call centre. Is the Economic Secretary confident that, despite the job losses, the combined department will be able to introduce the new proposals on child trust funds?</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Chichester is right to draw attention to the fact that the job numbers at the Inland Revenue and in the combined department appear to have increased quite a lot since 1997&ndash;98, but the O'Donnell report makes it clear that all the increase in job numbers at the combined department is a consequence of additional burdens imposed on the department in relation to issues such as tax credit, while the underlying number of staff who carry out the work that was done before 1997 has fallen slightly. We want to ensure that the staff are there to do those important jobs, particularly in relation to tax credits on which the lowest income people in the country depend.</p>
	<p>I want to probe the Government's thinking on a couple of other issues. Following the concern about the lack of clarity about costs and staffing, the second issue is the Government's expected improvement in compliance-related activity. It was clear from Gus O'Donnell's evidence to the Treasury Committee that even the Government accept that there is currently a huge tax gap in the United Kingdom. Mr. O'Donnell's evidence indicated that that gap was likely to be around 8 to 10 per cent. of revenues, which is in the order of magnitude of &pound;30 billion or &pound;40 billion.</p>
	<p>It is unusual for such an estimate to be volunteered by a senior Government official because the Government tend to be sensitive about acknowledging the extent of the problem of tax evasion and tax avoidance. Given that that figure has been put into the public domain and that Mr. O'Donnell was willing to acknowledge that the figure for uncollected VAT alone is estimated by the Government as 12 per cent.&mdash;&pound;12 billion a year that would be collected if people adhered to the letter of the tax law&mdash;I am interested to know whether they anticipate that the tax gap will be closed in any way by the merger of the two departments.</p>
	<p>I should have liked the Paymaster General to say more about the detail of how the Government plan to close that enormous tax gap, which after all is the central purpose of the two departments. We can talk as long as we want about improving service to customers, but, as the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) pointed out robustly in the evidence taken by the Select Committee, ultimately the purpose of the departments is to collect revenue for the Government's public services and other priorities. If &pound;30 billion or &pound;40 billion is going missing, it needs to be a high priority for the new department to tackle.</p>
	<p>On compliance, the new department must focus on those entities who are in the black economy, and who are probably avoiding contact with both Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, rather than simply focusing all efforts on the largely compliant group of businesses and taxpayers, which could be easier targets for it. Have the Government recently estimated the compliance cost to business, one of the recommendations by the Treasury Committee in its report in 2000? Will there be an opportunity, either now or in the year ahead, to estimate the savings to business from the reduction in compliance activity? Has the Economic Secretary considered whether the tax system, in particular the business tax system, can be simplified to reduce the compliance burdens on business?</p>

	<p>I am sorry that I missed the first part of the speech of my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General, but I heard the other speeches, and very good they were too. I compliment in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), whose speech was excellent.</p>
	<p>My concern is whether the Bill will close the tax gap or have the opposite effect. Given Labour's commitment to public services, anything that brings in more revenue to the Government is important. Some commentators have suggested that the Chancellor has a bit of a revenue gap. I would not necessarily argue that, but if he has, the extra revenue will help in the coming years.</p>
	<p>There is also talk of staff cuts. I have close relations with the civil service union, the Public and Commercial Services Union, which is worried about employment. Its members are dedicated public servants who are committed to the broad common good. The union wants the new department to do its job properly and wants it to be properly resourced.</p>
	<p>I hope that the new arrangements for prosecutions will also help to close the tax gap. If prosecutions are more effective, that will encourage those who are evading or avoiding tax to pay their taxes, as all good citizens should, so that we have more to spend on essential public services. However, the staff cuts worry me.</p>
	<p>I have some anecdotes of my experiences. Three or four years ago, I took it on myself to visit our local VAT inspectorate. I was impressed with what I saw. It was explained that had it got more staff, it could collect more revenue. The rough estimate was that every additional VAT inspector collected five or six times his salary in VAT every year. I wrote to Treasury Ministers, suggesting that we should have more inspectors because we could clearly bring in far more to the Exchequer than the cost of their salaries, which would be a good thing in every way. I got a bland reply, mentioning staff costs. I am afraid that I did not get a positive response.</p>
	<p>I also took it on myself a little while ago to visit customs officers at Luton airport. Again, the same story. They were doing a good job of catching people who were involved in smuggling drugs in particular. They wanted more staff so that they could do an effective job because they were stretched. Again, I wrote off, saying the same thing.</p>
	<p>PCS members and officers tell me that the same is true of personal and business taxation. With more tax officers specialising in those fields, they could collect more revenue, at a multiple of their salaries, so more staff rather than less would be good. It may be that other staff who are not inspectors and who are not directly concerned with tax collection could have their jobs modernised with IT systems or whatever, but inspectors can collect many times their own salaries. I ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to give that serious thought.</p>
	<p>I also had the experience&mdash;again, this is an anecdote, although I am sure the experience is not uncommon&mdash;of returning from the continent 15 years ago. As one does when returning from holiday in France, I had a certain amount of wine in my car.</p>

	<p>The House will be impressed by the integrity of the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), given his vignette about his return from France. He spoilt it only slightly by suggesting that under a Conservative Government there were fewer customs officers on duty. It is true that, under the Conservative Government, duty was much lower than it is now.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman made some important points about jobs, to which I shall return. It is important that Ministers address seriously the argument that the PCS has advanced. It has been put to the Treasury Sub-Committee. I am grateful for the kind words that have been said about the report of the Sub-Committee, which I have the honour to chair. The Committee, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire (Sir Michael Spicer) reminded us, has been on this track for some time. It was in 1999, when he chaired the Committee, that it first recommended that a feasibility study should begin of the prospects of merging these two great and historic Departments. It was a year later, after taking evidence about other countries that had merged the two services successfully, and notably Canada, that the Sub-Committee made its final report in April 2000, recommending a full merger between the two Departments.</p>
	<p>That recommendation was rejected by the Government, as has been said. One of the things that puzzled the Sub-Committee when we came to consider the merger again was why the Government had changed their mind. It is important for the Government to declare why they have now accepted the recommendation.</p>
	<p>I was alarmed by the permanent secretary's reply when he was asked why he had changed his mind. He pointed to the record of other bits of Whitehall being merged. He pointed to the emergence of the Department for Work and Pensions. I do not think that it is necessarily the case that the functions carried out by that Department are demonstrably better carried out now than they were when they were distributed among other Departments.</p>
	<p>Secondly, the permanent secretary suggested that the creation of the Financial Services Authority, which had taken on the functions of a number of different regulators, had also encouraged the Government to think again. I am not sure about that parallel either. Regulators are much smaller than the bodies that we are now considering.</p>

	<p>We probed hard on that point and I will come to the costs and benefits, but first I want to deal with the reasoning behind the merger. As I said, it is not enough to say that merging two departments like the ones covered by this Bill has worked with other departments or that the decision is simply strategic. In the business world, that would not justify a merger. I should remind the House of my business interests. One usually becomes involved in a merger in business because one can convince the board or shareholders that a merger will add value, reduce costs and make organisational sense. I had hoped that the Ministers behind the Bill and the Chancellor would have set the case out more clearly.</p>
	<p>To be fair to Ministers, they have set out some reasons. First, they have said that they hope that the merger will improve taxpayer compliance to close the tax gap. Several colleagues have already mentioned that important point. Secondly, Ministers have said that the merger will reduce the cost of compliance and, thirdly, that it will reduce the costs of collection. If those are the three stated objectives behind the merger, we should, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) implied, perhaps have had a stronger indication of the exact savings that can be quantified.</p>
	<p>Any merger in the private sector&mdash;David Varney has been involved in a number of mergers in the private sector&mdash;would have been preceded by a proper cost-benefit analysis. We pressed the permanent secretary and Mr. Varney hard on that point and, although it is hard to be sure, there appears to have been some attempt at quantifying the actual costs and benefits. However, that attempt seems to have been abandoned. We recommend in our report that such analysis should take place as soon as practicable. Even if we believe that the Government's explanation that we cannot properly cost the savings until some of the second-order issues are resolved, we are still entitled to ask for the cost-benefit analysis to be carried out as soon as possible.</p>

	<p>There is a contradiction and I would have expected the Sub-Committee to have been presented with more detailed analysis than we received.</p>
	<p>The explanatory notes on the Bill contain a particular figure. It is tucked away in paragraph 284, which tells us that integration</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;will lead to initial costs of around &pound;75 million over the two financial years 2004/2005 and 2005/2006.&quot;</p>
	<p>At least we have some indication of the initial costs.</p>
	<p>The Paymaster General has also told us today&mdash; I think for the first time&mdash;that there will be savings of &pound;500 million by 2007. It is still not clear where those savings will come from: whether they result from the 3,200 posts that will be scrapped directly, from the Gershon exercise or from a combination of the two. When the Economic Secretary winds up, I hope that he will be clearer with the House about the figure of &pound;500 million. As the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) said, it seems a large figure if we are simply talking about the 3,200 posts. I am not clear whether it is a cumulative figure&mdash;the Government have previously counted things several times&mdash;or whether it is the actual figure that directly relates to the cost savings.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-12-08.1208.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/881" speakername="Michael Fallon" colnum="1208"  time="15:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041208/debtext/41208-15.htm#41208-15_spnew8">
	<p>I am not clear on that point and it falls to the Economic Secretary to clarify the figure of &pound;500 million when he winds up. He must tell us how it has been arrived at, whether it is cumulative, whether it includes the 3,000 posts, whether it excludes Gershon and whether it relates to annual savings.</p>
	<p>The only other hint of further costs, rather than savings, is the reference on page 10 of the regulatory impact assessment. It suggests that there may be further costs to integration resulting from changes to join up some of the services that the two departments currently provide. It states:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;These cannot be quantified until the associated policies have been agreed.&quot;</p>
	<p>We are not quite clear what those costs are, but it is clear that they are costs and not savings. The Economic Secretary owes us a further explanation of the costs and benefits and I hope that he will reply to our specific recommendation&mdash;I do not think that the Paymaster General quite did&mdash;that the costs and benefits should be quantified as soon as practicable when the integration policies are agreed and brought back before the House.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Luton, North raised the important issue of jobs, which is well documented in the PCS's submission to the Sub-Committee. We are told that, as part of the Gershon review, 12,800 full-time posts will be scrapped and that, as a result of the merger, 3,200 specific posts will be lost. That is a rather one-dimensional view of efficiency savings. When one asks Ministers and David Varney about the savings that will result from merging these two great departments, they respond only in terms of the number of posts to be scrapped.</p>
	<p>As someone more distinguished in the Treasury keeps saying, it is not the job title that one holds but what one actually does that matters in government. It is not right simply to consider efficiency savings in terms of the number of jobs that will be scrapped. Instead, I would have expected to hear from the Government how the work load of the two departments, once merged, would be handled more efficiently.</p>
	<p>I would have liked the Government to have responded much more vigorously on the whole issue of reducing the costs of compliance for business. If it is true that a merged customs and revenue service is going to result in reduced compliance costs for individual taxpayers or for business, I would have expected the Government to have set themselves more vigorous targets.</p>
	<p>In an earlier Sub-Committee report, we said how impressed we were by the Finance Ministry in Holland in which officials have been set a specific target of reducing by 25 per cent. over four years the costs to business of complying with taxation. It has introduced modelling for the smallest businesses that enables it to measure the actual costs to small businesses, shopkeepers and medium-sized firms of filling in tax forms and of complying with the tax burden. Some 17 people in a unit in the Finance Ministry are dedicated to reducing the costs of compliance. I hope that Ministers will set the new service a much more specific target for reducing the costs of compliance for business.</p>
	<p>I turn to the Bill itself, which is only the first of two Bills. I have two problems with that. Because the Bill is so minimalist, there is a risk, as the regulatory impact assessment pointed out, that its scope is inadequate. Because it is so minimal and has been introduced so quickly, it may not fully cover the arrangements that need to be put in place. I was alarmed to hear that we are to be faced with Government amendments to the Bill as soon as it starts in Committee. I very much hope that when choosing the two-stage minimalist approach, the Government have drafted the Bill correctly.</p>
	<p>There does not appear to be a firm commitment to the second stage. The Department said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;More substantive change, and change requiring further legislation, will be considered as part of a longer term programme of work.&quot;</p>
	<p>That does not sound like an explicit commitment to a second-stage Bill, although I understood the Paymaster General to say earlier that there was a commitment to produce the second stage in 2006 or 2007. Perhaps the Economic Secretary could clarify that. It is worth some clarification, because we have some experience of two-stage reform. We are still waiting for the second stage of House of Lords reform, which still has not emerged some years after the first stage was introduced.</p>
	<p>Secondly, there is the issue of powers. I welcome the non-transferability of powers to prevent any inadvertent widening of powers in the new department. That will need to be scrutinised in Committee. It reinforces the need for further legislation and for that to be forthcoming reasonably early, to ensure that the powers are appropriate, proportionate and fit for purpose. If the Government are committed to those tests&mdash;that the powers they are taking are to be appropriate, proportionate and fit for purpose&mdash;they need to get on with the consultation and get the new powers into statute as soon as possible.</p>
	<p>One specific power that will concern anyone who scrutinises the Bill in detail is the power in clause 10 requiring officials to comply with</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;any directions of a general nature given to them by the Treasury.&quot;</p>
	<p>The explanatory notes are helpful. They state that that excludes directions on the day-to-day management of the service or on operational matters. The intention is fine, but the clause is not sufficiently tightly drafted. It might be helpful if the Government specified exactly what those</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;directions of a general nature&quot;</p>
	<p>might cover. It might seem odd to ask for a general direction to be specified, but it would be helpful if we knew what kind of directions Ministers had in mind, given that the drafting of the clause is so wide.</p>
	<p>I turn to confidentiality, on which I intervened on the Minister. That is a matter of concern to me and the rest of the Sub-Committee. We should always be concerned about confidentiality. I welcome the strength of the Paymaster General's view this afternoon. A further reason for concern is that the departments are being merged into the Treasury building. That puts into sharp relief the question whether we can ensure that officials who are using the same building, sharing the same cafeteria and meeting in the same corridors are properly separated from the Ministers and special advisers who have the more political function.</p>
	<p>Given that point, I hope that the Economic Secretary will clarify the downgrading of the oath and statutory declaration. We were told in evidence that it is no longer an oath but a statutory declaration. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) said, a statutory declaration made and witnessed at the beginning of each official's employment has some solemnity about it and brings home to the person making the declaration just how serious the matter is. It is therefore not sufficient to write the terms of the declaration into the statute. How many officials taking up office will read the Act? Ministers ought to look again at that and reassure the House. If it is part of the employment contract of staff of the new department, there could still be a case for making that a statutory declaration in front of witnesses, as part of the employment contract. That may be Ministers' intention, but it was not clear from the remarks of the Paymaster General. I think that she appreciates the concern and I hope that the Economic Secretary will clarify the matter.</p>
	<p>Finally, on the Bill, I turn to accountability. When we first heard about the merger a year or so ago, I expected that a single department would report to a single Minister. It now appears that the new merged department will report mainly to the Paymaster General, but also to the Economic Secretary on excise duties and green taxes, and to the Financial Secretary on stamp duty, taxes on savings and taxes on pensions. This is not a political point. The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) made the same point. It is cumbersome for a new single merged department to report to at least three Ministers. The Treasury Sub-Committee will want reassurance that the lines of accountability are not blurred and that everything possible is being done to narrow accountability to one particular Minister, who I expect to be the Paymaster General.</p>
	<p>I shall touch on two other issues that are not directly referred to in the Bill, but that flow from the merger proposal. The first is the department's estate&mdash;the buildings that it will occupy. I make no apology for returning to the issue of Mapeley, which has preoccupied my Committee and the Public Accounts Committee over the past two or three years. Because the departments are being merged, the case for rationalising the estate and being clear about the costings of that estate is all the more obvious and important. That brings us back to the Mapeley costings. As the House may recall, the National Audit Office estimated that the facility price&mdash;in other words, the cost that the departments will pay Mapeley, the private sector consortium looking after the offices&mdash;should have averaged out at about &pound;170 million a year over the 20 years from 2001. In a letter on 24 November, the Paymaster General told me that the payments to Mapeley in the first three years were &pound;235 million in 2001&ndash;02, &pound;306 million in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;311 million in 2003&ndash;04. Those payments were significantly higher than the NAO expected, and we must ask why. One would expect more rationalisation from a merger, and even after the Mapeley contract was signed&mdash;we will not go into the sad history of its offshore sourcing&mdash;one would have expected some variation to the contract to have been sought to reduce the number of offices occupied by the merged department.</p>
	<p>In her letter, the Paymaster General explained why the NAO price of &pound;170 million a year is nowhere near the &pound;300 million a year that she now pays:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;NAO modelling is based upon initial pre-contract modelling assumptions and as such would not be expected to capture changes in the profile of the estate due to new legislation or changes in the departments' business model.&quot;</p>
	<p>Why not? The merger will provide the department's new business model and changes in the legislation.</p>
	<p>One would have expected some rationalisation, but instead we have costs. I accept that the costs are for the first three years of a long contract, but they are now running at nearly twice the NAO assessment of the facility's price. The point of putting offices under private sector management is to get away from the department's business modelling and forecasting and into the real world, where people experienced in estate management and commercial property can weigh up matters and make the required savings. In the private sector, such a merger would yield immediate savings by sharing offices, rationalising space and utilising fewer, not more, square feet. In other words, the price paid to Mapeley should be falling, not rising.</p>
	<p>In the end, the Bill is about improving the service that the customer gets. In rather a chilling phrase, the Paymaster General said that she wants &quot;to improve the taxpayer experience&quot;. Over the past few years, taxpayers have had much experience of paying more and more taxes. Taking her comment at face value, it is important to focus on the aim of the exercise, which is to improve the service to individual taxpayers and, indeed, business taxpayers. The record over the past few years is not particularly good.</p>
	<p>The tax credit fiasco, on which my Sub-Committee reported, is not an encouraging precedent. The scandal of deficiency notices that are issued late or not at all again shows that the follow through is not particularly good when changes are made in Whitehall. Evidence is also emerging that the Revenue is not as good at running the benefits system as it was at running the tax system. We must focus on the service that the customer gets. From my experience of constituency casework, the Revenue and Customs must re-examine their interface with customers. For example, the helpline service is not nearly good enough and needs improving.</p>
	<p>I am not sure whether people&mdash;perhaps even hon. Members&mdash;are sufficiently aware of the function of the adjudicator, who rules on complaints against the Revenue and its various sub-departments such as the valuation office. Last year, the adjudicator investigated 374 cases in the Inland Revenue and 98 cases in Customs and Excise, which is not an awful lot. We should use the opportunity presented by the merger to revamp the way in which the Revenue and Customs treat those who pay for them and rely on their services&mdash;the situation could and should be better.</p>
	<p>Let me sum up. The merger was recommended by the Sub-Committee and is probably a good idea, but it needs to be driven by set objectives and against measurable benchmarks. I welcome this initial legislation and wish Mr. Varney and his team well in implementing it, but I put him, and Ministers, on notice that this is not the end of the story as far as the Treasury Sub-Committee is concerned. We will return to the merger at six-monthly intervals to see how it is getting on, because the stakes are very high indeed.</p>

	<p>It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), who, in his position as Chair of the Treasury Sub-Committee, has done a very thorough job in picking over the bones of this dry but important Bill.</p>

	<p>She obviously does not agree.</p>
	<p>The main unanswered question about the Bill is what lies behind the renewed enthusiasm for the merger. Until now, it has been a classic example of something that lots of officials think a good idea, so it gets taken off the shelf, dusted down, put back, forgotten about and eventually taken back down again. I would be rather worried about an idea that Mr. Gladstone considered and rejected. We missed out some of the history, because Prime Minister H. H. Asquith had a nibble at it when he merged Customs and Excise.</p>
	<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) said, another unanswered question is whether the exercise is worth the candle. We will find out as the Bill progresses. I suspect that my hon. Friend was on to something when he suggested that the Chancellor wants to do this to set an example before he starts to lay about Government Departments. He could have triggered it through a series of timed statutory instruments; indeed, he could have postponed secondary legislation almost indefinitely. The merger is to proceed so incredibly slowly that it does not need to have a great deal of effect, but it enables him to say to other Ministers, &quot;We've put our house in order&mdash;now put yours in order.&quot;</p>
	<p>Another unresolved matter, which I hope will be resolved shortly in the winding-up speeches, concerns how many staff will be involved. The figure seemed to change almost daily between the Chancellor's first announcement in March and the evidence given to the Treasury Sub-Committee in October.</p>
	<p>Some years ago, the Conservative Government considered what to do about the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise. It was the subject of much discussion. One suggestion was that the Inland Revenue should merge not with Customs and Excise but with the then Department of Social Security. That option has not been considered. As the Inland Revenue increasingly becomes a tax and benefit-paying operation, it almost makes sense for it to be part of the Department for Work and Pensions rather than merging with Customs and Excise, which, as we have heard, has a different philosophy from the Revenue.</p>
	<p>The original Excise men were military figures, with their cutlasses and armed ships. Indeed, they chased the forebears of my constituents who had a readily available supply of illegal whisky stills in the Northumberland hills. The Excise men would wreck the stills. It was said that they were given a reward if they found a still, so when a still burned out, its owner would tell the Excise man who then &quot;discovered&quot; it and collected a reward. The distiller would receive half, which helped him to build a new still further up the hills. That was Northumbria a long time ago&mdash;but it is rightly said that the philosophy of the two departments differs greatly.</p>
	<p>Customs and Excise clearly has much more of a policing role. That is well set out in the various submissions to the Treasury Committee by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, which is worried, probably rightly, about the gung-ho mentality that exists in the Customs service, as opposed to the gentler, more considered approach of the Inland Revenue. I know from experience of running a disorderly business&mdash;in its early days&mdash;that the VAT man was a sight tougher than the tax man. Anyone who fell behind with VAT payments had little leeway, whereas it was always possible to negotiate some settlement with the Inland Revenue. There are genuine concerns about the different attitudes.</p>
	<p>Let me comment on the problems that the Revenue experiences in paying the tax benefits. I am sure that all hon. Members have had constituency cases of overpayment of tax credits that are now being reclaimed, in some instances with a great lack of care for the victim. Obviously, some people must have realised that they had been overpaid, but others did not. They read the forms and thought that they were getting it approximately right. I have a constituent who received &pound;150 in tax credits and has had the sum reduced to &pound;30 a month. That has made a serious difference to her life. To echo my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks, it is almost impossible to get through to the helpline. My constituent came to me to circumvent the difficulty of contacting the helpline.</p>

	<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) said, we welcome the thrust of the Bill and the principle of merging the Inland Revenue and Customs. However, we temper our welcome with the important caveat that there will be much more detail in the draft regulations, which we look forward to receiving in plenty of time before we debate the Bill in Committee.</p>
	<p>I have for some time advocated the subsuming of the prosecution functions of the Inland Revenue into the Department under the aegis of the Attorney-General, and I strongly support what is now happening in that regard. I also strongly support the establishment of a separate, independent prosecution service and the fact that it is to be inspected regularly by the Crown Prosecution Service inspectorate. I presume that there will be some financial consequences, but it is difficult to judge what they will be. Since January 2003, the Customs prosecutors have come under the Attorney-General, and I wonder what additional staff&mdash;or perhaps whether fewer staff&mdash;have been employed since that time, and whether that has involved savings or additional costs.</p>
	<p>I welcome clauses 23 and 24. The recent establishment of the Independent Police Complaints Commission goes a long way towards answering the impossible question: who will guard the guardians themselves? It appears to be settling down well, but there are bound to be resource implications for the IPCC taking on this additional work. Do the Ministers have any idea what those implications will be? Some indication would be welcome. My second question relates to a difficult point. The IPCC is, and should be, independent, and it is up to the commission to run itself. However, it would be interesting to know whether the Ministers have a view on whether the police function within the IPCC should be separate from the Revenue and Customs functions.</p>
	<p>I want to refer to the matter of tone and culture, but before I do so, I want to say to the House that we shall debate information sharing and confidentiality in Committee, and that we shall also return to the necessary matter of powers. I am grateful to the Paymaster General for setting out just a few of the important points of principle. This impinges on what my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil said about the Treasury having a function on the macro side of setting tax policy. I hope that clear guidelines&mdash;there are already some&mdash;in relation to absolutely solid and enforceable duties of confidentiality will be provided for anyone who, under this Bill, has access to Revenue information As has been said, the Revenue has an enviable culture, and the vast majority of people do not want to break the law. Tax law, however, is extremely complex, taxpayers often do not have a clue what the law is, and it is difficult for small professional firms of advisers to keep up with the complexity of the law and its changes.</p>
	<p>In my experience, the Revenue is helpful, in so far as it is accessible locally and reasonably willing to give sensible advice&mdash;obviously, its view is not necessarily the correct one, but it is helpful. I hope that such local delivery will be a model of the new department, so that Customs specialists will also be at hand in local offices and will accept Inland Revenue practice.</p>
	<p>On training, I refer the Economic Secretary and the Paymaster General to Mr. Justice Butterfield's conclusions. Two particular points should be noted from that Customs inquiry, as hundreds of millions of pounds in duty were lost and an unfortunate series of bungled prosecutions occurred. First, Mr. Justice Butterfield recommended that there should be regular refresher training for investigators, and secondly, that investigators should be subject to systematic external scrutiny. In Committee, we will examine these matters in some detail, and we will want to hear exactly what has happened since the Butterfield report, and on what standards of training the new department will insist. I know from experience that the inspector of taxes course is of high quality and is also recognised in the private sector.</p>
	<p>To conclude on the question of culture and tone, I practised as a tax practitioner for 25 years, and I do not believe that in the course of that period I ever had cause to complain about the conduct of members of the Inland Revenue. I hope that, in 25 years' time, practitioners will be able to say exactly the same of the new merged organisation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-12-08.1216.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1204" speakername="David Ruffley" colnum="1216"  time="15:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041208/debtext/41208-17.htm#41208-17_spnew0">
	<p>This Bill on the merger of Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise carries the general support of the Opposition, although we remain concerned, as the House will have noted, about its practical implementation. We are dealing with two organisations that have between them 250 legacy computer systems and some 13 million customers. It is no mean feat to put those two together, and we will want to examine the details extremely carefully, not just during consideration of the Bill but in the first few months and years of the merger.</p>
	<p>I had the privilege of sitting on the Treasury Sub-Committee in 2000, which was then chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire (Sir Michael Spicer). In the course of our inquiry, we came to some conclusions: that the possibility of a merger had not, by 2000, been examined properly by Ministers; that differences in the functions of the two bodies were not insurmountable obstacles to a merger; and that a merger was in fact desirable.</p>
	<p>Our 2000 report noted several concerns relating to the closer working programme, which&mdash;I should say in all fairness&mdash;had been developed not since 1997 but since 1994. We concluded that the programme had not been a great success. There seemed to be no general philosophy or rationale underpinning the various areas chosen for closer working between the two departments. The witnesses whom we consulted could cite few specific benefits to businesses as a result of the programme, and Customs and Excise gave us no clear idea of how it intended the programme to develop in the future. We agreed with the programme's aims, but did not feel that it was achieving its objectives. When we examine the way in which the two departments have tried to co-operate so far, we do not see a happy set of antecedents.</p>
	<p>We were rather disappointed by the Government's response to the report. The possibility of a merger was rejected, and the explanation given was this:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;while the Government accepts that merger might bring some of the benefits outlined by the Committee, it believes that they can be achieved without the disbenefits of merger through a dynamic and focused programme of closer working.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Government have clearly done some more thinking during the three or four years since that statement was made. Like other Conservative Members, I am prompted to ask the reason for the turnaround&mdash;the sudden Damascene conversion&mdash;especially in the light of the paucity of statistical information and data about cost and efficiency savings in the medium term.</p>
	<p>We know that there will be transitional costs upfront, but although the Government seem to have moved to the right side of the argument, we have not seen enough of their working. Some indications of why their views had changed were given in the O'Donnell review, which concluded that a merger would be a good idea&mdash;although it noted at the same time that risks were involved in the &quot;business as usual&quot; tax collection model, and that the disruption of projects already planned could attend any merger.</p>
	<p>I wonder whether the rather sad events of spring and summer 2003 might have prompted the O'Donnell review. As we all recall and as was mentioned earlier, a computer system that was installed did not deliver, and the fiasco of the working tax credit and child tax credit payments ensued. The Treasury Committee, of which I was a member, took evidence that revealed an unfortunate set of management relations at the Inland Revenue. We also discovered that when the national insurance contributions office was taken away from social security officials in Whitehall and merged with the Inland Revenue, the left hand did not know what the right hand was doing. That led to the shambles of the deficiency notices: Ministers were not aware that they had not been issued, and large parts of the civil service did not know either.</p>
	<p>That brings me to two of my concerns, which have not been dealt with by my hon. Friends' trenchant criticisms of other aspects. They relate to information technology. The Treasury Sub-Committee noted the views of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;From past experience of the merger of the Inland Revenue and Contributions Agency, the proposal to merge the Revenue and Customs does not inspire confidence. As organisations, the Contributions Agency and the Inland Revenue had different computer systems and five years after the merger had been completed they still have computer systems which cannot exchange information and accordingly duplicate enquiries and impose unnecessary additional costs on taxpayers in general.&quot;</p>
	<p>In speaking to the Treasury Sub-Committee, David Varney made clear the scale of the IT problem for him and the associated risks. Indeed, he was very up front, and it might assist the House if I give a flavour of what he said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We have 250 major IT systems, and we have 3,000 staff&quot;</p>
	<p>working in IT.</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;It is a huge expenditure . . . We, per year, put out 170 million forms and we run 100,000 desktops. So this is a big issue for us. I think what we are bringing in&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>in the recent recruitment of a chief information officer&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;is expertise of somebody who has a track record of managing change in IT and delivering business benefits. We also have to get smarter at our pre-risking and big risk minimisation projects, talking through both the IT risk and the operation.&quot;</p>
	<p>Amen to that. The Paymaster General will doubtless work closely with Mr. Varney on the implementation of change in the IT systems.</p>
	<p>However, I offer a strong word of warning. When the computer failures occurred that were responsible for the working tax credit and child tax credit shambles, and for the deficiency notice problem&mdash;without even considering the Mapeley problem, which is different in qualitative terms&mdash;the chairman of the Revenue came before my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) and I, and said that the Revenue take this issue terribly seriously. He said that a lot of time had been spent stress-testing the system before putting it in place. He acknowledged that it was very complicated, and said that they would spend a lot time ensuring that they got it right.</p>
	<p>The problem is that warm words are no use when the system crashes or fails to work in an optimal fashion. Who suffers? The taxpayer suffers, and bad governance is the result. That does no good for the Government of the day, or for democracy and our constituents.</p>
	<p>I pray in aid the National Audit Office, which noted in its recent report:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Contingency plans are needed to handle any changes resulting from the O'Donnell review.&quot;</p>
	<p>I have great regard for the Paymaster General, who gets into the interstices of her brief. I hope that she will put contingency plans in place, and she will doubtless ask her officials to speak to the NAO and other stakeholders. We need to bear in mind the huge risk involved. We do not want a repeat of the IT shambles.</p>
	<p>My final point, to which reference has already been made, concerns enforcement and the culture of the departments that will be merged. I welcome the placing on a statutory footing of the new Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office, which will undertake all the new department's prosecutions. However, I am not entirely clear as to how it will be staffed, or how the varying expertise of the current Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise prosecutors will be melded.</p>
	<p>In 1999 and 2000, my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire and I examined how the experience of the Canada Revenue Agency compared with ours, and we discovered that it was similar. To put it bluntly, the expertise of those in the revenue departments here and in Canada is of a higher quality than of those in the customs and excise departments. That is simply a cultural difference. Melding the two to achieve an optimal solution is what this is all about. However, the most recent Select Committee report&mdash;the proceedings were chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks&mdash;stated that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;witnesses were concerned about the different approaches of the revenue departments and how this might impact on the new department.&quot;</p>
	<p>Those concerns were summarised by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, which said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The Inland Revenue is more prepared to negotiate and has a more human face. By contrast, mention Customs investigators to accountants and businesspeople and exasperation sets in. Once the Revenue has made a ruling, it generally sticks to it. VAT offices change their minds more often&mdash;partly because they tend not to commit themselves in writing.&quot;</p>
	<p>There is clearly a culture problem and I hope that, when the matter is put to bed, we adopt a pretty robust approach to change management. Ministers should adopt a hands-on approach to ensure that the execution of the merger takes the different cultures into account, but not use that as an excuse for things not going right. We need people to get thinking the right way and to do so quickly.</p>

	<p>First, I apologise for attending the debate so late. I had a constituency engagement, the Ealing Family Housing Association annual pensioners' Christmas dinner. When they reached the Christmas carols, particularly &quot;Oh Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;, I thought that it was time to come to the Chamber.</p>
	<p>Normally, out of politeness to the House, I would not intervene in a debate that I joined so late. However, I do not appear at risk of being trampled to death by other Labour Members wishing to speak so, in my capacity as chair of the Public and Commercial Services Union all-party parliamentary group, I shall make some comments about staffing matters.</p>
	<p>I want to begin with a general point about how legislation is considered these days, and what information is provided to the House in connection with staffing and manpower issues. Over recent years, the consideration of Bills has been refined. The explanatory notes accompanying a Bill now contain detailed assurances in respect of costs and compliance with human rights legislation. They also refer to staffing implications&mdash;that is, the impact on public service manpower.</p>
	<p>That information enables the House to try and identify individual costs and, in some cases, potential savings, but the system gives us a minimum amount of information about manpower issues. The one sentence on the topic in the explanatory notes for this Bill states:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;There will be a net reduction of approximately 3,200 posts as a direct result of the integration.&quot;</p>
	<p>Admittedly, the Treasury Committee looked in more detail at the staffing reductions consequent to the Bill, but even then the information provided was fairly peremptory. It identified that about 3,000 jobs would be cut as a result of this Bill, in the context of the other staffing reductions that were taking place. About 8,000 jobs will go as a result of the Gershon review and other studies, but the losses implied by the Bill will bring the total of jobs lost in the relevant departments to something like 12,500.</p>
	<p>Elsewhere in the public and private sectors when departments are rationalised and merged on such a scale, or when an organisation is reviewed or restructured, it would be expected that some significant detail about the new staffing levels would be made available. In addition, matters to do with staff structures would be covered in a report from the human relations department involved&mdash;what used to be called the personnel department&mdash;setting out the range of posts that would be lost, and the responsibilities that rested with those posts. Such a report would also outline the new structures being established, and possibly offer some detail about new posts and their functions. As a result, people could use that report to determine whether the new structures would be workable, in comparison with what had gone before.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, only a minimum amount of information on staffing implications has been provided with this proposal. More importantly, however, we know in some detail what went on before. The Treasury Committee has conducted many reviews and produced many reports over the years. Those studies have made it clear that both Customs and the Inland Revenue are world-class services. There is no doubt about their probity and the efficiency of their tax collection in many respects, but it is also clear that both services are open to innovation.</p>
	<p>I compliment the Government on their spend-to-save and spend-to-raise initiatives, which are proving exceptionally successful, and have enjoyed cross-party support. That success has been highlighted by the Treasury Committee.</p>
	<p>I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), as the Treasury Sub-Committee has also been very frank about mistakes that have been made. That may have embarrassed the Government, but the Select Committee has a job to do and it has done it effectively. To be candid, it is clear that most failures in the past have not been blamed on staff at Customs and Excise or the Inland Revenue. To a certain extent, we as politicians have to take the blame for some of the failures, because some of the policies were wrong and certainly some of the initiatives that we thrust on the staff were ill thought through. At no time has the Treasury Committee made extensive criticisms of the staff and their professionalism. Indeed, the reverse is true: the Committee has been complimentary.</p>
	<p>If we know that the existing staffing structures and levels work effectively&mdash;indeed, provide a world-class service&mdash;we need to be careful when we seek to adjust, review, revise or change those structures. Anyone who has gone through a merger, in the public or private sector, will know what turbulence it can cause in an organisation. Mergers can lead to breakdowns in efficient delivery of services. My anxiety about the proposals is that it is almost impossible to judge from the information that we have been given about staffing whether the proposals will be effective.</p>

	<p>I want to make some brief comments along the same lines as those of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell).</p>
	<p>I interrupted the Paymaster General twice during her opening speech to ask about the employment implications of the changes. She courteously indicated that the figure was 3,200, and that was that.</p>
	<p>When I entered the House more than 40 years ago, I had great problems, like many MPs, about which party it was right to go along with. I had the impression then, which was right, that the Conservative party was the party of efficiency, which went for change and would look after public money carefully. From the financial point of view, it was probably the party that best served the interests of the community. On the other hand, there was no doubt that the Labour party was the party that cared for people and had more concern for them, and that influenced me. However, having listened to MPs over the years, there is no point in hiding the fact that what worries me now is the impression I have received from recent statements by Ministers, including the one we heard today, that the Labour party is forgetting its care for people.</p>
	<p>I live in Southend-on-Sea and meet many people who work there in one of the biggest Customs and Excise operations&mdash;our VAT office, which has a fine tradition&mdash;so, in all sincerity, I can tell the Paymaster General that I know many of those people. I go to church with them, I go to meetings and dinners with them and they are very worried indeed about their future. Will they have jobs? Is the organisation to be changed dramatically? Will there be transfers to other places? That is a particular concern in a place such as Southend-on-Sea, which has traditionally had more unemployment than elsewhere in Essex and the south. The Paymaster General is a courteous and decent person, so I ask her, please, to realise the extent of the worry and concern that those major changes are causing.</p>
	<p>My second basic point is that all the efficiency changes made by the Government are not working terribly well for people. The one big change that we had in Southend-on-Sea was the closure of our social security office and the transfer of the work to Jobcentre Plus or to the new pensions office in Norwich. I can assure the Paymaster General that, whereas pensioners used to like visiting the office in Victoria avenue to talk someone about their problems and to ask for help to fill in their forms, they now face the nonsensical situation of making contact with Norwich.</p>
	<p>If the Paymaster General would like to phone that number herself, she would find out about all the nonsense involved in being switched from one place to another and hearing a voice that tells people what to do. In addition, the system is subject to long delays. Bearing in mind the number of people who have come to my surgery&mdash;I hold a weekly surgery&mdash;that is a horrible state of affairs for the pensioners, because they are not getting the same service and they are very distressed about that.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Paymaster General appreciates that the VAT office is one of the major sources of employment in Southend-on-Sea. We have only two major employers: one is called KeyMed and the other, of course, is the department. When an earlier proposal was made to transfer the office to another place, it was accepted that Southend had such a long-standing unemployment problem that some special measures should be taken for us.</p>
	<p>What are we trying to do? Of course, it would be easy to say, &quot;Let's scrap all these new plans and leave things as they are.&quot; That is difficult for the Conservative party, which works in the interests of efficiency. The Paymaster General should appreciate three things. First, it is desperately important that the local staff should be fully informed of what is happening, when it will happen and whether it will have a major impact on their employment. Secondly, facilities should be provided for meetings and discussions involving employees and trade unions. Frankly, unless that happens, people are simply being treated with contempt. Thirdly, the planned changes should take account of the fact that some areas have a tradition of high unemployment and special provision should be made for them.</p>
	<p>Although I would in no way suggest that the Paymaster General is a difficult person or is being unkind, I hope that she appreciate that there is sometimes a danger of forgetting people in the rush for efficiency and change. I also hope that she will appreciate that the people who work in that office are very worried indeed and that they are simply looking for some assurances.</p>
	<p>This issue was raised by the Treasury Committee, as the Paymaster General will probably know, and page 7 of the report that was made available today refers to a man called Mr. Varney, who is a Mr. Big in the organisation. He was asked what will happen if the redundancies take place. He was also asked whether the 9,000, 10,000 or 12,500 proposed staff cuts&mdash;the figures vary&mdash;that result from spending review settlement will involve job losses. He replied that he could not rule out redundancies, but he would try to avoid them. Frankly, a married person buying a house with a mortgage, with two or three children at school, who is suddenly faced with the possibility of being made redundant does not have much to look forward to. If people are made redundant, I hope that the Government will go out of their way to try to ensure that they are offered advice about the alternatives or another form of employment.</p>
	<p>I can appreciate the Government's desire to move towards greater efficiency, but as a local MP, I do not particularly like it because I found from the other changes that people previously benefited from personal contact with individuals and that they do not like the fact that they have to contact a remote office in Norwich and must do so by phone and by pressing buttons. That is not an improvement in the service for local people, so I hope that the Government will accept that such changes do not necessarily provide better services. In fact, because of all the problems with computers, people may get a worse service. The main thing is, however, that the people themselves do not think that it is better. They think that it is much worse. I hope the Government also realise that for those who face the possibility of redundancy is it frightening, horrible and cruel. I hope that they will go out of their way to reassure people, in particular those in areas of Southend, where this civil service work is a desperately important part of our local economy.</p>

	<p>It is a pleasure to sum up for the Opposition after what has been a high-quality debate. I pay tribute to the Paymaster General. It is true that she spoke for nearly an hour, but the principal reason for that was that she was generous in giving way to hon. Members on both sides of the House. We should acknowledge her courtesy.</p>
	<p>I join my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) in thanking the Paymaster General for kindly giving us a briefing on some of the detail of the Bill at the Treasury recently. We were grateful for that. We were also grateful for the whistle-stop tour, following the briefing, of the refurbished Treasury, but we resisted the temptation to pause and measure up the curtains. We felt that that might have appeared gauche. Nevertheless, it was kind of her to take us on the tour, which we enjoyed.</p>
	<p>In a thoughtful speech, my hon. Friend explained that we do not oppose the Bill in principle, because it is designed to facilitate the eventual merger of two large Government organisations. However, we are concerned about how the proposed merger is likely to take place in practice, and I shall concentrate on that in summing up our position.</p>
	<p>Before I do that, I want to refer to some of the contributions that we enjoyed. The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), who served as a member of the Treasury Sub-Committee, spoke knowledgably on the subject. He provided us with some of the background to the proposed merger, including the genesis of the Butterfield report. We are grateful to him for adding that element to our deliberations.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) spoke from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. He, too, broadly welcomed the Bill, but like us expressed scepticism about the ability to generate material savings over the spending review period. There has been quite a lot of to and fro about that, so we would all welcome clarification of two things. First, what are the specific savings that the Department estimates will result from the merger itself? I am not talking about Gershon in the broader context, but how much public money will be saved as a result of the merger. Secondly, over what precise timetable do the Government expect those savings to be realised? In which year can we expect the full-year effect of those savings to have kicked in? If, for any reason, the Government cannot answer those two pertinent questions on Second Reading, they are in trouble from the word go. We look forward to the Economic Secretary clarifying those two points.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) told us about discussions with his local trade unions relating to the merger, including during a recent visit to Luton airport. He amused the House with his valiant attempts to pay duty some years ago on his return from an enjoyable trip to France. As he mentioned consulting the unions, and as that sparked off a spat between the Paymaster General and the Liberal Democrats, perhaps the Economic Secretary will summarise what consultation has taken place with the unions to date, so that there is no confusion. Perhaps he could also say a few words about how the consultation process is likely to be taken forward with the trade unions as the merger rolls out. Given the comments that we have heard this evening, it seems that Members on both sides of the Chamber will be grateful for that clarification.</p>

	<p>That seems a pertinent point. Rather than repeat it for form's sake, I am sure that the Economic Secretary has heard it and will do his best to respond to it.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) chairs the Treasury Sub-Committee. We should pay tribute to the thorough and detailed job that that Committee did. On the basis of that work, he spoke knowledgeably about the proposed merger. He, too, argued for more specific information on the likely savings and how they are expected to be realised in practice. I hope that the Minister, having heard the Chairman of the Sub-Committee, has now well and truly got the message and that we will hear clear answers from him.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) has had something of a grin on his face ever since the result of the north-east referendum. I think that he still has that grin today, particularly when he was contemplating the taxpayer experience as some permanent exhibition. I do not know whether that will ever be established in practice, but if it were, I fear that it is the sort of thing that would have to be propped up with lottery money. The ticket sales might not meet the original estimates.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend also talked about problems arising from the maladministration of tax credits. He made some pertinent points on the basis of the real experiences of real individuals. I shall return to that subject in more detail.</p>
	<p>We also heard from the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett). He brings to the House his experience as a tax practitioner over 25 years, I think. If I heard him correctly, he also said that, over those 25 years, he never had cause to lodge a material complaint about the Inland Revenue. I am not certain whether all our constituents could provide such a blanket guarantee but I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester said from the Opposition Front Bench, which is that we pay tribute to the sometimes difficult work that members of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise undertake. I emphasise that some of the criticisms that I shall come on to relate to their senior managers and to Ministers rather than to staff at the coal face who are doing the job from day to day.</p>

	<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman spent a lively 25 years in dealing with the gentlemen of the Inland Revenue. I am sure also that the House knew what he was driving at, and I wanted to acknowledge the point that he made.</p>
	<p>We then heard briefly from the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), who raised the staffing implications of the merger. He made an important point on what is now becoming, in some respects, the impersonal nature of the system and the remoteness that many of our constituents feel when they have to deal with a call centre, especially when they cannot get through to the same person more than once. He introduced an important point and it is one to which I will return.</p>
	<p>We also heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor), who is my parliamentary neighbour. He raised particular concern about the staffing implications of the merger. I can well understand that because Customs and Excise has a major facility in Southend. I already know from our informal discussions that he has made representations on this matter on several occasions, as I believe has my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess). The issue affects Southend as a whole. The House will have heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East said this evening on behalf of people in Southend. I hope that his points will be taken carefully into consideration as the merger proceeds.</p>
	<p>I also wish to refer to the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley). He served with distinction on the Treasury Committee and was often a thorn in the side of Ministers. To a degree, he has achieved that in this debate. He spoke with particular force about the problems of information technology and how they cause difficulties for our constituents. I now turn to that subject.</p>
	<p>Given recent events, we have a strong concern about the risks that might arise from the IT aspects of the proposed merger. Between them, the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise have about 250 different legacy computer systems and deal with 13 million customers, including 3.75 million businesses of varying sizes and complexity. The departments already experience more than 250 million contacts a year, ranging from tax returns, letters and telephone calls to e-mails. The scale of the merger in IT terms alone is therefore huge, as is the potential risk to the Government's revenue stream if it all went wrong.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, even a brief examination of the Government's track record in managing major IT programmes is very far from encouraging. There are already serious problems at the Inland Revenue itself even before the merger commences and several hon. Members have touched on that issue already. The Revenue is now responsible for the administration of the Chancellor's complicated system of tax credits. The computer system designed for that purpose has been exposed as being prone to error, including a particularly unhelpful tendency to overpay tax credits to people in one year and then try to claw them back in the next. My hon. Friend the Members for Hexham and for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) made that point.</p>
	<p>The Public Accounts Committee, which examined the performance of the Inland Revenue in this respect, came to a damning conclusion. In a press release of 22 April 2004, the Committee's Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), commented:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The problems that arose when the Inland Revenue introduced the New Tax Credits scheme are well known. It was nothing short of disastrous, with hundreds of thousands of claimants not paid on time, inevitable hardship for some, inconvenience to employers, and disruption to other parts of the Revenue's business. The Revenue should have been more realistic in setting the timetable and have put in place better contingency arrangements.&quot;</p>
	<p>That is a sword of Damocles to hold over the Government's head.</p>
	<p>In facilitating the proposed merger, it will also be important to learn lessons from the recent problems&mdash;some of them very serious&mdash;at the Child Support Agency. By way of comparison, several years ago the Government decided to transfer CSA cases on to a new bespoke computer system known as CS2. The new computer cost almost &pound;500 million of taxpayers' money but, according to an article on the BBC News website entitled appropriately, &quot;Basically, it doesn't work&quot;, operators could be working on the system when it would suddenly lock them out without warning. It would take weeks before the case file could be electronically reactivated and properly dealt with. According to a briefing note from the Library, up to 150,000 cases are now stuck in the CSA system in this way and are effectively unable to proceed.</p>
	<p>Ministers are still wrestling with whether to try to fix the existing system or write off a great deal of public money and start again with an alternative. This has been a fiasco, and it led to the resignation of the chief executive of the CSA. Such events must be avoided in the merger that we are discussing, particularly as the merged entity would have to deal not just with individuals but with companies.</p>
	<p>It is important to remember that we are not just dealing with statistics, even though some of the numbers for the problem cases involved are very large. I say in all sincerity to the Economic Secretary that these are real people, many of whom rely on receiving money for which they have budgeted in all good faith, but which fails to reach them through no fault of theirs.</p>
	<p>Commenting on the syndrome of Government computer failures, the National Audit Office, in its November report on improving IT procurement, a copy of which I have, concluded that the failure of public sector IT contracts is due to a number of key factors, including a lack of a clear link between the project and the organisation's key priorities, a lack of effective engagement with stakeholders who will need to use the system, and a lack of clear senior management and ministerial ownership and leadership. That is a damning indictment from the NAO, in addition to the previous one from the PAC.</p>
	<p>As the merger is implemented, it will be important to try to avert what might be described as ordeal by Government call centre. Too many of our constituents experience a substandard service because the Government switch work into call centres backed up by inefficient or unreliable computer systems. The syndrome, which is all too familiar to many CSA and Inland Revenue tax credit customers, can be summarised as follows.</p>
	<p>The Department's computer generates a letter that is incorrect on an account that was previously operating well. The aggrieved constituent telephones the number on the letter and is put through to a departmental call centre. After the electronic rendition of &quot;Greensleeves&quot; or whatever the music happens to be, they get the inevitable menu of options. Having fought their way through that, they are eventually put through to a member of staff. They give their reference number and the details, and attempt to explain the specifics of their case. That is all taken down and the caller is told something like, &quot;I will send an e-mail to our computing department and have it sorted out for you. Don't worry.&quot;</p>
	<p>Two or three weeks later the constituent receives another letter showing that nothing has happened and nothing has changed. Frustrated, they ring up the call centre again, are put through to a different person and go through the whole saga a second time, only to discover a fortnight or so later that again the problem has not been put right. The problems with tax credits and overpayments are a perfect example of the syndrome. Eventually, in a state of high dudgeon, the constituent arrives at their Member of Parliament's constituency surgery to vent their wrath. I am sure a number of hon. Members have had that wonderful experience already.</p>

	<p>This has been a full debate, and I shall try to do full justice to the detailed contributions made by nine hon. Members from both sides of the House since my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General opened it earlier this afternoon.</p>
	<p>The Bill is important and will bring important changes. It concerns the machinery of government, but it matters to 30 million HMRC customers, including 4 million businesses around Britain. It enables the early steps in bringing together the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise&mdash;full integration is a long-term, large-scale undertaking. As my right hon. Friend said, the process goes beyond a simple merger between two departments.</p>
	<p>Between them, the two departments collect &pound;400 billion in revenue each year. They pay out &pound;17 billion in tax credits and a further &pound;9 billion in child benefit, and they handle almost 40 million telephone contacts. The two departments employ 100,000 staff, operate from more than 300 locations, run 250 separate IT systems and carry out a wide range of functions from traditional tax gathering and assurance to enforcement of the minimum wage, payment of tax credits, facilitating British exports and securing the UK's frontiers. Between them, Customs and the Revenue have a proud history of more than 1,000 years' service to the British state and the British people. I pay tribute to their professionalism, their technical expertise and their commitment to the public service ethos, which have been the special hallmarks of both departments over the years.</p>
	<p>Some have questioned the case for integration. Earlier this year, Gus O'Donnell, the permanent secretary at the Treasury, produced the O'Donnell report, which examined not only the case for integration but a couple of other options not involving integration. It set out the clearest conclusions on the case for integration, and I refer hon. Members on both sides of the House to page 6:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The case for organisational change rests on potential improvements in customer service, effectiveness and efficiency. It results from an analysis of</p>
	<p>*</p>
	<p class="indent">international experience, which has shown that the current separation of direct and indirect taxes in the UK, as opposed to organising around functions and customers, is behind best practice;</p>
	<p>*</p>
	<p class="indent">the functions of the revenue departments, which shows that there are benefits from bringing them closer together;</p>
	<p>*</p>
	<p class="indent">the experience of closer working between the departments since 1994, which has been promising but limited in its results; and</p>
	<p>*</p>
	<p class="indent">the success of the creation of the Department for Work and Pensions, with the formation of several customer-oriented agencies, including the integration of benefits and employment advice in Jobcentre Plus&quot;.</p>
	<p>The Treasury Committee has been in no doubt about the sense in creating a single Revenue department. I, like others, pay tribute to the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), who led the work on the recent report, and to his colleagues, both past and present, who have contributed to this afternoon's debate. Last month, the Sub-Committee produced its report, which welcomed the decision to merge the two departments and reminded us, as the hon. Member for Sevenoaks did this afternoon, that the Treasury Committee, under different chairmanship, recommended a merger in 2000.</p>
	<p>The Sub-Committee observed that witnesses believe that the merger should produce benefits for both taxpayers and the Government. It endorsed what the Government saw as the pragmatic approach adopted in this initial Bill to create HMRC, which will be followed by further work. Finally, although this is not related to the Bill, the Committee endorsed steps to strengthen the Treasury's capability in the area of strategic tax policy making.</p>
	<p>In that respect, the Committee was reporting afresh on an issue that was first examined by one of its predecessor Committees in 1863, although that Committee published two reports that year which came to exactly opposite conclusions on amalgamation. The Committee chaired by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks has had no such second thoughts. Indeed, it made recommendations to the Government about proceeding on integration. It made further recommendations on quantifying the expected costs and benefits; on ensuring that business as usual is a top priority during the merger period; on proper parliamentary scrutiny, including a second stage of legislation for any substantive changes; and on safeguarding the confidentiality of taxpayer information. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General explained that we have taken those recommendations into account in framing the Bill, and she set out the Government's point-by-point response to them.</p>
	<p>I shall try to do justice to the very detailed contributions that hon. Members made to the debate, starting, if I may, with the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie). He said that as a country we are very lucky in our Revenue departments; we would share that sentiment. He said that he worked with both departments in the 1980s; I fear that he may have to wait for a little longer than a few months until he gets the chance to do so again. He mapped out the rationale for integration and quoted a section of the O'Donnell review, which summarised the principal benefits on page 7 of its report.</p>

	<p>It is not an arbitrary target&mdash;it is a realistic target. What has been done for HMRC is exactly what has been done and is being pursued in other departments.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), who has served for some time with distinction on the Treasury Committee, urged us not to lose sight of the wood for the trees. Like the hon. Member for Yeovil, he stressed the main concern, which should be to close the tax gap, as he put it, and reduce it almost to the point of elimination of evasion. I want to underline that HMRC has public service targets set throughout the current spending review period and throughout the period of the initial stages of integration, which cover reducing the amounts of unpaid VAT to the Exchequer and reducing the underpayment of direct taxes.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford also gave some indication of the potential gains for business: a single inspector; single inspection visits; and a single point of contact. I am sure that he looks forward to the publication, which my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General mentioned, of the consultation paper on further steps and changes in powers in January. We look forward to his views and those of the Treasury Committee as part of that consultation. He was also concerned that integration should not distract the departments from their continuing duties. The Treasury Committee was right to stress that, and Ministers have made that clear to the new chairman, David Varney, who has certainly made it clear to his staff that that cannot be the case.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked why the Government have changed their mind since 2000, which was a point echoed by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. It is less that we have changed our mind than that we have undertaken a serious study, led by the permanent secretary to the Treasury, which gives us a better basis as Ministers to take such a decision to move to integration. It is also based on a couple more years of experience in government of such large-scale mergers than when the Committee first took evidence and produced its report. I welcome the second report from his Committee, as I have made clear, and its conclusions.</p>
	<p>The Committee urged us to treat this as a staged process, and to evolve the new department rather than to do it in one go, although, curiously, the hon. Members for Sevenoaks and for Hexham then started raising concerns about the second stage of the process. I hope that the former will be reassured by confirmation that the consultation on this second stage will begin in January, and that it is clear to him that we do not expect that to be completed in time for the setting up of the new department under this Bill. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General has made it clear that we regard the Finance Bill in 2006, or appropriate legislation, as the likely timing for introduction of the succeeding stage. Of course, we will delay no longer than necessary, as to do so would be to delay gaining the benefits that we set out to achieve from integration.</p>
	<p>On the concern raised about geographic location and the move of Customs and Revenue staff to Parliament street&mdash;I will come on to the similar point made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) in a moment&mdash;location is not an issue. The existing convention whereby Ministers and their officials do not intervene in individual cases will be strictly maintained. As now, Ministers and their officials will not have access to individual taxpayer and customer information in the Treasury.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked where the new RCPO staff would be housed. They will have two offices, one at New King's Beam house in London and one at Ralli Quays in Manchester. They will share those larger Government buildings with some HMRC staff and some staff from other Departments. However, the respective operational areas will be quite distinct. RCPO staff will report directly to their new director, who will be accountable to the Attorney-General and not to Treasury Ministers.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman asked about the extra staff in the Customs and Excise Prosecutions Office since the line of accountability led to the Attorney-General rather than Treasury Ministers. The new arrangement is settling down, as he said, and the numbers have also been settled: there are just over 200 staff. The hon. Gentleman also asked about resources for the extension of the functions of the IPCC to the new HMRC. They are still being agreed, and for reasons that he will understand I cannot yet give him a definite answer. He asked about confidentiality, the principle of new powers, the quality and nature of investigators' training post-Butterfield and the external scrutiny that we deem necessary for investigators post-Butterfield. I look forward to discussing and probing those matters with the hon. Gentleman in Committee.</p>
	<p>I will pass on the tributes paid by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) to the excellent job done by Customs and Revenue staff. He urged us to be prepared to invest in, among other things, more staff when there is a case for doing so, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) mentioned what he described as our &quot;spend to raise&quot; programmes. What we have done in the past has had an impact on the VAT gap, and helped to close the gap in the collection of tobacco excise duties. I was a little concerned when my hon. Friend was reciting his experiences at the port, until he explained that they had happened 15 years ago. He will recall that one of our first moves when we came to office in 1997 was to cancel the Conservatives' planned cut of 300 Customs posts.</p>

	<p>The first answer&mdash;to the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)&mdash;is that I have received no request from a Minister to make a statement. The House will know that it is up to the Government to decide how they make information available to the House. That is a matter of judgment, and from time to time there will be differences of view about how that judgment is exercised; it is a matter for the Government in each case.</p>
	<p>I understand that the documents are available to Members, but if there has been a delay I will certainly ensure that it is investigated.</p>

	<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. In a reply given during Health questions yesterday by the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), on the new dental contract, the hon. Lady suggested that negotiations with the British Dental Association were going reasonably well, yet within hours of her making those comments the British Dental Association withdrew. The hon. Lady had plenty of opportunity during subsequent supplementary questions&mdash;not least from me&mdash;to correct that erroneous impression. Given the collapse of the talks between the BDA and the Government, would it be in order for the Minister to come to the House to correct the erroneous impression she made?</p>

	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) on securing this evening's debate. I have no doubt that his constituent is grateful for the interest that he has taken in the matter over a long period of time.</p>
	<p>I regret the fact that the hon. Gentleman has had such a torrid time getting responses. It is difficult to see what excuse there might be for the lack of courtesy that he experienced.</p>
	<p>I am aware that the hon. Gentleman has corresponded with both the primary care trust and the relevant acute trust, which are the appropriate bodies to deal with the issue. I sympathise with Mr. Patrick. It is a tragedy for a young person to be losing their sight and not to be responding to treatment. I doubt whether any hon. Member would not sympathise with him&mdash;indeed, we sympathise with all people who are not responding to the available treatments.</p>
	<p>I listened carefully to the points that the hon. Gentleman made, but I hope that Mr. Patrick and he accept that my powers are limited. Furthermore, I hope that he agrees that, in line with patient confidentiality, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the individual aspects of that particular case. He may have been given leave to raise those issues in public, but I have not, so I must largely limit myself to general comment.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman raised several points about the handling of Mr. Patrick's case by Moorfields eye hospital and his local primary care trust. The first reason why my powers are limited is because the key trust involved, Moorfields eye hospital, is an NHS foundation trust. Foundation trusts are independent organisations that are no longer accountable to the Department of Health or to Ministers. Instead, they are accountable to four other groups and bodies: first, their members, via a board of governors; secondly, primary care trusts, for the delivery of NHS services; thirdly, Monitor, the independent body responsible for regulating foundation trusts; and fourthly, Parliament, which is responsible for the legislation that creates foundation trusts.</p>
	<p>Because of foundation trusts' independent status and separate, local route of accountability, Ministers are no longer in a position to comment on or become involved in their day-to-day activities. We also have no powers of direction or intervention over those trusts. Freeing foundation trusts from the backstop of the Secretary of State's powers of direction and Department of Health control means setting out and applying clear sets of rules for the regulation of foundation trusts and intervening only when things go wrong, which is the task of the foundation trust regulator, Monitor.</p>
	<p>Monitor needs to ensure that foundation trusts are fully compliant at all times with their terms of authorisation&mdash;a sort of licence to operate&mdash;and the legislation, so that they deliver NHS services to NHS patients effectively, efficiently, economically and confidently. It has powers to intervene where necessary in the running of a foundation trust in the event of failings in its health care standards or other aspects of its activities that amount to a significant breach of the terms of its authorisation. That ensures that a foundation trust that is failing to meet its obligations can be brought back into line. Monitor will intervene only if it feels it necessary.</p>
	<p>In this particular case, I am aware that Monitor has considered Mr. Patrick's treatment, which it considers a matter for Moorfields eye hospital. That brings me to the specifics on the approval or non-approval of the treatment, and I stress that the issue does not concern funding. Instead, this is a case in which the PCT and the trust have not prescribed a drug because it is not licensed for that particular indication and because no new evidence exists to support its use. When a patient is treated at any hospital, whether or not that hospital is within a foundation trust, the consultant may prescribe any drug, including unlicensed medicines, as appropriate. That is what my noble Friend Lord Warner said in his letter to the hon. Gentleman. However, trusts have multi-disciplinary drugs and therapeutics committees that oversee the clinical and cost-effective use of medicines within their organisations, and all prescribing should have the support of that committee.</p>
	<p>Of course, consultants are ultimately responsible for their own prescribing decisions. They should always satisfy themselves that the medicines that they consider appropriate for their patients can be safely prescribed, that patients are adequately monitored and that, where necessary, expert hospital supervision is available.</p>
	<p>In March 2002, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommended the use of Infliximab for highly active rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have failed to respond to at least two standard drugs. However, Infliximab is not licensed in the UK for the eye condition that Mr. Patrick has and there is no sufficient or conclusive evidence to support its use for that condition, hence the decision taken by Moorfields.</p>
	<p>A group of experts&mdash;the drugs and therapeutics committee&mdash;has decided that the potential harm to the patient from this treatment, including severe blood disorders and septicaemia, outweigh the unproven benefit for his condition at this time. I stress that the decision was taken by the drugs and therapeutics committee, which is a committee of experts, not a group of managers or people without expertise in such matters. Moorfields, as advised by its drugs and therapeutics committee, does not currently include this drug within its supported formulary.</p>
	<p>If I might offer a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, I am assured that the position could change as further evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of the drug in ophthalmic treatment becomes available. At the moment, however, the trust's position is that further research will need to be done before the clinical governance body will review the decision. I understand that the trust will continue to explore other possibilities that might help Mr. Patrick and other patients, including access to existing or future research trials.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Gentleman spoke, I was struck by the length of time that this case has gone on. That might indicate that the clinical governance body last reviewed it before some of the evidence that he brought to the House's attention was available. One of the courses of action that could be taken, if it has not been done already, is for the consultant to put that body of evidence before the body and ask whether it considered it before making its decision.</p>
	<p>I understand that it was hoped that a research programme could be set up in the Moorfields area that might have been able to help Mr. Patrick, but unfortunately that has not happened.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman asked about the relationship between the trust and the primary care trust. Sussex Downs and Weald, the PCT that commissions services for residents, including Mr. Patrick, has considered the case. The PCT has a contract for specialist eye services with Moorfields, and general services are available locally. However, the specialist treatment that Mr. Patrick's consultant recommended is not supported by the trust, and therefore the PCT cannot fund it. I am assured by the PCT that, if different treatment options that were licensed for Mr. Patrick's condition were suggested, or if sufficient clinical evidence emerged to support the use of this unlicensed treatment, the PCT would consider funding. However, the PCT has made it clear that it cannot and would not attempt to force Moorfields to prescribe the drug when its clinical governance body has decided that the evidence does not support its use. The decision was not taken by accountants or managers, nor by the PCT. Like Moorfields, the PCT did not decide against the treatment for financial reasons.</p>
	<p>Clinical governance is the collective responsibility of the clinicians at the hospital. Those clinicians have decided that the available evidence does not support the use of Infliximab in ophthalmology at the present time. The PCT has made it clear that it will continue to be guided by Moorfields as to the appropriateness of the drug as and when further clinical evidence is forthcoming.</p>
	<p>If a drug is prescribed privately, the clinician will be bound by codes of clinical governance but will be held entirely responsible for the consequences if the clinician decides to prescribe it. But when, as in this case, a drug is prescribed or requested to be prescribed on the national health service, the NHS must share responsibility for the decision.</p>
	<p>The rules for arriving at decisions about the drugs that can be prescribed, the validity of the evidence of efficacy and risk and the balance of the two are, therefore, agreed with the clinicians at the trust and they cannot be overturned by an individual clinician. Of course, that clinician has the opportunity to put forward reasons and make the case for the drug to be prescribed. The clinician has the opportunity to bring forward evidence that he or, in this case, she thinks has been overlooked and can even explore the opportunities for becoming involved in trials to establish that evidence. However, in the absence of that evidence, or having failed to establish a convincing case, the clinician cannot expect to have his or her personal judgement put in the place of that of his or her colleagues. He or she cannot try to make the case that everyone else's judgment is flawed.</p>
	<p>I assume that the consultant has based the view that the drug may help the hon. Gentleman's constituent on evidence. If it is strong enough to convince the consultant, it should also be strong enough&mdash;if the consultant puts the case&mdash;to convince the clinical governance committee. I therefore encourage the hon. Gentleman to speak to the consultant to ascertain whether new evidence, which the committee has not yet considered, has recently emerged, and to have another go at making the case. If the consultant can be convinced, so can the committee.</p>
	<p>Politicians should not question the good faith of those who made the decision&mdash;that would be disingenuous to say the least&mdash;and claim that the decision must have been made on the ground of cost. The decision in the case that we are considering was not made on that ground, although I can understand why the hon. Gentleman is becoming angry with the trust's chief executive if he cannot even get information or responses to correspondence.</p>
	<p>As I said earlier, I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's constituent but I cannot and will not intervene. I certainly would not want anyone to see the decision changed until safety issues are resolved. However, if the hon. Gentleman and his constituent are dissatisfied with the answers that they have received from the trust, Mr. Patrick can, of course, complain to Moorfields about his treatment.</p>
	<p>New regulations&mdash;the National Health Service (Complaints) Regulations 2004&mdash;came into force on 30 July this year. Although those regulations do not require foundation trusts to have a local complaints procedure, they will more than likely have their own process for addressing patients' concerns. In any event, patients can complain to the Healthcare Commission and ultimately the health service ombudsman if they are unhappy with the treatment that they have received from a foundation trust. Mr. Patrick can also complain about the actions of the PCT if he wishes by first setting out his concerns to the PCT. If he remains unhappy, he can approach the Healthcare Commission and, ultimately, the health service ombudsman.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman said that he was satisfied with the efforts that the PCT had tried to make on his constituent's behalf and I am pleased to hear that. However, he is clearly far from satisfied with the efforts of Moorfields. I therefore strongly urge him to consider the complaints route and, if necessary, approach the Healthcare Commission. The chief executive reports to a board at the foundation trust. If the hon. Gentleman believes that the chief executive is not dealing with the issue appropriately, he might wish to approach members of the board and ask for the issue to be raised. The Healthcare Commission will make Monitor aware of all complaints that relate to foundation trusts. It will therefore be told of the matter if the hon. Gentleman pursues a complaint.</p>
	<p>I hope that the matter reaches a satisfactory conclusion but I must stress again that it is for the NHS to resolve on the basis of evidence and expert clinical opinion. It is not a matter of money&mdash;it never was&mdash;and to suggest that that is the case is deeply unfair and, more important, will mislead Mr. Patrick and may indeed give him false hope.</p>

	<p>Will the Solicitor-General commend the work of Nottinghamshire Crown Prosecution Service and its chief prosecutor, Kate Carty, in introducing information technology systems? Will she also ensure that excellent IT is complementary to, and not a substitute for, the softer skills of local prosecutors meeting police officers and the local community informally to deal with misunderstandings and undertake a process of mutual education?</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend is right and I thank him for his comments on the workings of the CPS. Of course it is important that people communicate not only through IT but in person and that the CPS work closely not only with the police and the courts but with the local community and MP. I welcome the involvement that he seeks with the CPS, which is after all an accountable service, although it works independently.</p>
