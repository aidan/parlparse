	<p pid="a.1493.6/1">RAF Valley is an integral part of the Anglesey community, has been so for over 60 years, and is a major contributor to the region. The recent positive announcement by the Ministry of Defence on locating the search and rescue headquarters and the new Hawk integrated operational support contract at Valley is credit and gives confidence to both the civilian and military work force. Does he agree, however, that the academy at St. Athan offers further potential for RAF Valley to benefit and to broaden its skills base, and that a party with the aim of independence would jeopardise that?</p>

	<p pid="a.1495.6/1">I agree with everything that my right hon. Friend has said. I know from the hard work that he did in ensuring the passage of legislation to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses that he is an expert in the field. The facts are clear: businesses in Wales are growing and are being created faster than ever before, and all the surveys indicate that the Government's regime is working.</p>
	<p pid="a.1495.6/2">Of course we will resist any attempts to gold-plate European regulation.

In Newport alone we have benefited from a huge amount of investment, resulting in thousands of new jobs in EADS, Yellow Pages, International Rectifier and the Quinn Group. Is that not largely due to the strength of the partnership between the Labour-controlled Welsh Assembly and Labour-controlled Government, which would be put at risk if it fell into the instability of an Assembly controlled&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1496.2/1">Surprisingly, I agree, yet again, with my hon. Friend. What he says it true, although that success is happening not just in Newport but in my constituency: we now have record levels of employment where we used to have record levels of unemployment. Indeed, it is true throughout Wales. Ibsen Biopharm has announced an investment of more than &pound;39 million in a pharmaceutical plant in Wrexham, and the Amazon investment was announced only last month.</p>

Members: &quot;Tories!&quot;] I am sure that some are also concerned about the resurgence of the Tories in Wales. I am particularly concerned about the 81 per cent. decline in the number of curlew, for instance, since 1993, and the water vole has also declined by some four fifths in the past 20 years or so. I do not blame the Government for this, but what can the Minister and the Welsh Administration do to reverse this decline in biodiversity in Wales, and to establish better wildlife conditions for the benefit of all the people in Wales?</p>

	<p pid="a.1500.1/1">The hon. Gentleman asks an interesting question. It is true that certain species have been recorded as being in decline, whereas others are improving. Species such as the otter are now returning to many Welsh rivers in which they have not been seen for decades, so the picture is mixed. However, it is important that factors such as climate change be addressed, as well, because they may well have an effect on biodiversity not just in Wales, but throughout the world. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman read the Climate Change Bill, which will put in legislation clear targets to try to address the threat that we all face from climate change.</p>

	<p pid="a.1504.0/1">I am afraid that what I object to is the idea that somehow there has been an attempt not to provide the truth up to now. I do not believe for a single instant that the ISC did not get to the truth; indeed, they had the information revealed in Operation Crevice before them and looked into it in immense detail. Some of what has appeared in the media is, frankly, misleading and wrong; what the shadow Home Secretary has been saying is also wrong&mdash;I think he said in a newspaper article the other day that MI5 and the security services had been starved of resources after 9/11. That is simply not correct. The budget has been doubled and we have dramatically increased the number of people working for our security services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1504.0/2">The whole point is that those people do an immensely difficult task. They went along to the ISC; the then head of MI5 gave evidence three times and special branch gave evidence&mdash;again contrary to what the shadow Home Secretary has said. The Committee was able to call for whatever information it wanted. If we now say, effectively, that the ISC inquiry was not adequate and if we hold another inquiry, I have to tell the right hon. Gentleman that we shall simply cause great anxiety and difficulty in the service and we shall not get any more truth&mdash;because the truth is there in the ISC; what we shall do is undermine support for our security services and I am not prepared to do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1509.1/1">A company called Whipp and Bourne, which is one of the country's largest manufacturers and exporters of switchgear, announced this week that it is to close, with the loss of 200 exceptionally well skilled jobs. The rumour is that the company may be intending to move to China or India. How can the Government encourage companies like Whipp and Bourne, first, to remain in my constituency and, secondly, to remain in the UK? I am meeting the trade unions on Friday, and I would like to give them some hope.</p>

	<p pid="a.1509.2/1">First, we should extend our sympathy to those who have lost their jobs and been made redundant as a result of the decision that the company has taken. It is difficult for us to prevent companies from deciding to relocate. The best thing that we can do for business and industry is to keep our economy strong, improve the levels of investment in skills, and make sure, as we now do, that where major redundancies are announced, we provide proper structured help for those who are made redundant. Where we can, of course, we also encourage companies to keep their location here in this country. I am sure my hon. Friend will have an opportunity of discussing those possibilities with the Department of Trade and Industry. It is an unfortunate fact here and round the world that companies are highly mobile. The most important thing, however, is to keep the economy sufficiently strong so that we are always generating new jobs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1510.5/1">There has been a big change in the way in which we deal with situations in which there are large numbers of redundancies. I pay tribute to the work that my hon. Friend has done in respect of the collapse of Rover, as that was an important part of our bringing together all the different partners. We made a big investment from Government, and as I saw for myself when I visited his constituency, a large proportion of those people have now found alternative work and employment. An immense amount of effort has gone in, and I think that that is what a modern welfare state is about&mdash;not trying to pretend that we can stop companies closing if they are not profitable or a decision is made to relocate them, but getting underneath the work force and supporting them in their desire to achieve new work and be able to cope with the process of that redundancy. That has been immensely successful in relation to MG Rover, and I pay tribute to everyone engaged in it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1522.2/1">The Minister mentioned national responsibilities. Does the directive extend to international negotiations? He will know that once a directive is implemented domestically, it gives the Commission and the EU sole&mdash;or, in Euro-speak, exclusive&mdash;competence in negotiations between member states and countries outside the European Union? Can he specifically assure us that, after the directive is implemented, our ability to negotiate and conclude agreements about security and infrastructure assets with third parties will not be inhibited?</p>

I know that the proposal by the Commission was rebuffed by the Government, and I hope it will not appear again, because it was over-ambitious; but what about the channel tunnel? It is a critical piece of infrastructure linking two countries, and only two countries.

	<p pid="a.1525.0/1">The Minister has commended the motion to the House, but with a degree of scepticism and lack of enthusiasm that I find refreshing. I hope that he will be as sceptical and as questioning when he comes to negotiate with his European counterparts over the further deliberations on this set of instruments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/2">I am grateful to the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase>, for initiating the debate. Although not many of his Committee colleagues are here, I think it important for the Government to experience head-on the feeling of the House as a whole about this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/3">Something that has already emerged in the debate&mdash;partly from the remarks of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> and those of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, but also from those of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>&mdash;is the cultural difference between the Westminster and the European systems for creating legislation. What we see in this great volume before us is a set of fairly vague proposals which, although no doubt benignly motivated, lack the detail that we commonly expect in a piece of British parliamentary legislation. It is important for the Government to remember that when they negotiate with the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/4">The timing of today's debate may be fortuitous or it may be deliberate, but it coincides with the conclusion of what has become known as the Crevice trial at the Old Bailey, at which a number of dangerous conspirators were convicted of involvement in acts relating to and preparatory for terrorism. It is possible that had those men succeeded in their endeavours, hundreds or even more people would have been killed and the institutions and infrastructures of our country would have been placed under huge strain. Let us hope, although I fear it will be a forlorn hope, that the long sentences given to the defendants will deter others of similar mind and intention, and that the measures we are discussing will&mdash;in one form or another, but not necessarily as set out in the documents&mdash;be implemented and placed in a state of readiness, but never activated in response to a threat to the critical infrastructure of a number of European Union member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/5">The Crevice trial provides us with some useful lessons about threats to our national security and our national infrastructure. The definition of critical infrastructure in the documents before us is:</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Those facilities and networks, services and property the destruction of which would have a serious impact on the health, safety, security or economic well-being of citizens or the effective functioning of government in the member states. Such infrastructure includes systems for electricity and gas production and distribution, telephone exchanges and other communications systems, sewage plants, food distribution and key government services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/7">It is surely the duty of Government in every member state to identify all facilities and services which come within that wide definition, and I trust that our Government&mdash;irrespective of the events made public through the recent trial, and regardless of the outrages of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase> and what might have happened on<phrase class="date" code="2007-07-21">21 July</phrase>&mdash;have done exactly that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/8">It is clear that the House does not need a list comprising the infrastructure. However, given what we now know about the information relating to the Crevice defendants which was known in advance of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase> by our security services and the police, we need to be assured that the Home Office and its Ministers&mdash;especially the Home Secretary&mdash;will ensure that the fullest possible inquiry is undertaken by an independent figure of some standing into the events, failures and mishaps that have now been revealed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/9">We know, for example, that there were six good-quality photos of Sidique Khan, although the Intelligence and Security Committee was told that there was just one poor-quality photograph. First we were told by the ISC that identities were unknown&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1527.0/1">My hon. and learned Friend has referred to a voluntary approach. He will know&mdash;this follows from his earlier remarks&mdash;that there are security assets and facilities both in this country and in other countries that we would prefer not to declare, for security reasons. Is he aware that under the draft directive we would have not only to declare those assets, but to draw up and operate a security plan and appoint a security liaison officer, all of which would presumably be public? Would it not be a grave threat to our internal security if all of that were known as provided for under a directive, and if the final arbiter of that were the European Court of Justice?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1528.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" speakername="Edward Garnier" colnum="1528"  time="013:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0006.htm#07050240001070">
	<p pid="a.1528.0/1">My right hon. Friend points to a matter that I hope will be thoroughly negotiated out of these documents by the Minister. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The Minister says from a sedentary position that my right hon. Friend is wrong. Well, my right hon. Friend has referred directly to the document in question. <i> [Interruption.] </i>He is now holding it up for the Minister's edification. I shall allow my right hon. Friend and the Minister to have private discussions behind the Speaker's Chair, but the point that my right hon. Friend makes is entirely valid. There are assets and infrastructures that we own nationally and there are assets and infrastructures that we jointly own or in respect of which we are tenants in common through, for example, NATO and certain aspects of the EU, and which should not become the subject of open-air discussion. It alarms me to think that our foreign policy and our counter-terrorism policy might be subjected to debate or decision of the ECJ, and I trust that that also alarms the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/2">As I have said, it is suggested in the documents that a European plan for critical infrastructure protection should be drawn up and that it should identify, among other things, critical infrastructure and produce a common approach to its protection and information sharing. That is of relevance to the point my right hon. Friend made a moment ago. I might have misunderstood the nature of EU critical infrastructure while at the same time having a clear understanding of the delicate nature of our own national infrastructure, but it seems to me&mdash;I do not mean to sound complacent, as no one could be so given the attacks on our country over the past 40 years&mdash;that as we are an island we might have some geographical protection from attacks on other EU states' water systems, electricity grids, telephone and communications systems and key Government services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/3">That point is not a case of relying on the sentiment behind the pre-war London newspaper headline, &quot;Fog over channel: Europe cut off&quot;, but I understand that in continental Europe other factors might apply. The Benelux countries, France and Germany, France and Italy, France and Spain and the Baltic countries&mdash;to give just a few obvious examples&mdash;will have integrated infrastructures that far outstretch the examples that apply to the United Kingdom, such as the channel tunnel, the shipping traffic between the UK and Europe, and the services shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/4">The hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk mentioned the channel tunnel. It is a subject that will cause some debate. From one point of view the channel tunnel looks like a bilateral infrastructure between France and the UK, but the manufacturers of, for example, Belgium, Italy or Spain who wish to export goods from their country to ours via road or rail might say that it affects more than two countries within the EU, and that therefore it is an EU infrastructure asset which ought to come under the control of the directives. I foresee endless discussion in dark committee rooms in Europe of such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/5">Of course we know that attacks on food supplies, or attacks on, or interference with, the internet and electronic communication systems or the banking and financial sectors at a strategic level can have a cross-border effect, regardless of whether they are the result of terrorist activity or natural causes such as storms and floods. To destroy the London stock exchange is to damage the global trade in financial instruments; to poison the Rhine is to damage the natural environment&mdash;river, sea and land based&mdash;in many countries; and to corrupt the immigration authorities of one member state will have a knock-on effect on other EU states. However, I question whether we need to raise the need for sensible, thoughtful, well planned international co-operation at a multilateral or bilateral level to the level of having an EU institution with all the expenditure, directives, regulations and bureaucracy&mdash;and infrastructure&mdash;that these documents urge upon us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/6">How, for example, do we define whether a particular piece of infrastructure is critical to the EU as a whole, or to at least two states, or only to one? We cannot do that without creating endless directives following endless committee meetings in several locations, at which the representatives of member state Governments and the Commission argue about whether country A's sewerage system is of European significance whereas country B's telephone system is only of national significance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/7">The documents tell us that EPCIP</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/8" class="indent">&quot;will be an ongoing process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/9">We need have no doubt of that. We are also told that its action plan will have three work streams, that there will be a critical infrastructure warning information network or CIWIN, and that there will be expert groups. There will be a CIP&mdash;critical infrastructure protection&mdash;information-sharing process and an identification of interdependencies. There will be national critical infrastructures, contingency planning and an external dimension, and there will be an &quot;all hazard&quot; approach&mdash;which would be a fitting description of the present jostling for the leadership and deputy leadership of the Labour party.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/10">There is no doubt that those matters, when stripped of the jargon, are sensible things to think about and deal with, but I am concerned that we should not as a country or a Government allow ourselves to be distracted with yet further EU navel gazing when we have plenty to do at home to provide better national security of all types and when there is so much that we can do bilaterally and multilaterally in discrete areas to protect our vital infrastructures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/11">Terrorism, even outside the confines of the Crevice trial, is universally to be condemned and all of us, in and out of the EU, must take steps to prevent it and to create conditions that do not allow it to thrive or to take hold. However, we should not allow these documents and the policies that lie behind them to dilute our resources and efforts, no matter that we are acutely aware that an approach that goes beyond terrorism is in other jurisdictions appropriate, and more immediately so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/12">Our primary, if not our total, focus must be on counter-terrorism and on protecting our constitutional framework, national institutions and liberties, as citizens of this parliamentary democracy. We must have the confidence to realise and understand that, despite the attacks we have seen from the IRA, al-Qaeda and so-called animal rights activists, the systems of Government, Parliament and local authorities and our emergency and public services are resilient and robust and, more importantly, democratically accountable. I do not denigrate the motives behind the policies outlined in these documents, but I do question their utility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.0/13">I urge the Government to be strong in their EU discussions, and to ensure that we arrive at a scheme that is relevant, proportionate and cost-effective. The concerns outlined by the Minister, which we share, should be taken on board by his counterparts when he travels to Europe to meet them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1530.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" speakername="Michael Connarty" colnum="1530"  time="013:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0006.htm#07050240001071">
	<p pid="a.1530.0/1">I have to tell the Minister that my one disappointment with the motion is that, at a time when there is so much to be negotiated and so much is left unanswered in our correspondence&mdash;and will remain unanswered even after today's debate&mdash;it does not simply say that we &quot;take note&quot; of the documents and of the Government's position. Rather, it says that this House</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.0/2" class="indent">&quot;supports the Government's intention to secure adoption of these documents in Council, subject to a satisfactory resolution of outstanding concerns.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.0/3">Despite the work of my European Scrutiny Committee, which took this issue very seriously, and the Minister's original, very detailed explanatory memorandum of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-12">12 February</phrase>, there remain many unknowns regarding what the Government will cede. They have certainly moved from their original position when we first looked at the directive, having, of course, considered the Green Paper for almost two years. In the explanatory memorandum of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February</phrase>, they seemed to be adopting a firm position. However, a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-09">9 March</phrase> to the Committee in response to our further inquiries appeared to indicate what I define as Government slide&mdash;a phenomenon that I have noticed repeatedly through my work on the Committee. That is in contrast to the original directive, which was an example of Commission creep. The Commission wants to creep into power; meanwhile, between <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-09">9 March</phrase> the Government appear to have shifted position, and to now be willing in their negotiations to slide out of power.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.0/4">I turn to the reasons why the Committee wanted this issue to be debated on the Floor of the House. Our main concern was that what is proposed is the adoption of a legally binding European Council directive in what we consider a sensitive field. We felt that this was legally doubtful and questionable in principle. Our second concern was the extensive role that the Commission has allocated to itself. As has been said, neither the so-called counter-terrorism co-ordinator's name nor his position was included in the Commission's proposal. It intends that it shall put together a committee of the Commission to oversee this process. That concerned us greatly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.0/5">The third problem is that there is not just a possibility but a probability of the extension of Community competence into the field of national security. There is no doubt that if that proposal goes ahead, it will affect bilateral agreements and infrastructures; in fact, it is Commission creep into the field of national security. We felt that that proposal should not be agreed to before being debated in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.0/6">In the February explanatory memorandum, the Minister discussed the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection, which will probably be referred to for ever by Eurocrats as EPCIP; as a result, no one will know what it means. The memorandum recognised that bilateral co-operation between states was to be encouraged, but we shared the Government's concern, which they expressed strongly, that EPCIP should not cover bilateral arrangements. In that regard, the Government referred to the channel tunnel and to cross-border co-operation between the UK and Ireland, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> said.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.0/7">Our Committee felt that there was no reason for the Commission to be involved in these matters. However, its starting point was that bilateral agreements were not outwith EPCIP. The Government are resisting that view, but they are asking us today to approve their signing up to the document, subject to negotiations. However, the Minister has said nothing today that would satisfy my Committee that lines in the sand have been drawn that we will not allow the Commission to cross. That is very worrying, given that we have been asked not just to note that the Government are negotiating, but to support them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.0/8">We have debated this issue and we have given the House its best chance to influence the Government. The Government will then be left to negotiate whatever they wish to negotiate at the final stage, in the European Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.1531.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not find this situation perhaps a little disappointing? Assuming that his Committee had reached a completely different conclusion from the content of the documents and had advised the House to vote against the &quot;take note&quot; motion, it would have made little difference. The Government are independently able to carry on doing what they think best, irrespective of the advice of his Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.1531.1/1">I hope that we do not get to the point of voting. I hope that the Government will take on board the fact that, when we say we support them, we support them. Hopefully, the House will support them, too, on the basis that the motion includes the phrase</p>
	<p pid="a.1531.1/2" class="indent">&quot;subject to a satisfactory resolution of outstanding concerns.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1531.1/3">Those concerns are those expressed in February's explanatory memorandum, and not the weaker position that, sadly, seemed to be indicated by the Government's strong support for proceeding with the directive, as expressed in the letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-09">9 March</phrase>. As I said, we sensed Government slide, which the explanatory memorandum gave no indication of. I hope that the Government will vigorously defend their position as outlined in the February explanatory memorandum, and that they will not perform an about-turn on any of these issues when they enter into negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531.1/4">The Committee also asked whether the adoption of the directive is necessary or justified. The arguments for a legally binding directive under the terms of article 308 of the European Community treaty are unconvincing. We studied that article extensively and we will publish a report on it shortly. We are clear that in our view, there is no need for legally binding rules in the sensitive area of designating infrastructure; however, and as I pointed out, that is what will happen. The Government said that they want the proposal to be dealt with through commitology, and in such a way that it is passed by qualified majority voting in the Council. If there was a dispute, the matter would then be ruled on by the European Court of Justice. Our Government would be unable to go against that ruling, and they could be forced into positions that they did not originally wish to adopt, and to which they did not originally think that they had ceded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531.1/5">We believe it is wrong for the Commission to be allowed to use infraction procedures in respect of any European country, and particularly this one, which has a highly developed national security policy. However, the Commission would go to the European Court of Justice if there were any dispute. Why could the objective of creating a common procedure for designating critical infrastructure not have been achieved by voluntary co-operation between member states? That is how we have advanced in the past. It is a good idea to have guidelines, benchmarks and some form of sanctions or penalties. It is also a good idea to have incentives throughout the EU. We may have reservations about some of the countries in the EU and their ability to meet the standards, but we should be aiding and abetting them, not giving power to the Commission to rule over our standards in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531.1/6">We will always dispute with the Government, the Commission and the Council the legal basis of article 308, because on many issues it has nothing to do with the common market. Our Committee was certainly concerned by the throw-away lines about competitiveness and cost at the end of certain sections, so that it could be argued that it was a competition question: it is not. It is a justification for using an original clause that was entirely about the common market to force through several items so that the Commission gets its way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531.1/7">We questioned the consequences of adopting a legally binding European directive on this issue in our report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March</phrase>. We were worried that it would lead to unpredictable legal obligations being imposed on the UK. The Minister questioned the definition of European critical infrastructure, the disclosure of information, and the legal obligations imposed to produce operator security plans and appoint security liaison officers. In the explanatory memorandum, the Government appeared to take a firm stand against all of those issues, but each would fall to be determined and interpreted by the European Court of Justice. In other words, every objection that the Government have put up could be overruled by the ECJ. That could happen if the Commission took infraction proceedings against a Government who are resisting the imposition of the Commission's will, which could lead to very unpredictable results. We question whether the Government should make any concessions that would take risks in that area. In security terms, we need to be firm, to be sure of our ground, to know where our authority lies, to know that we can call on that authority at any time and that it has not been given to another party. That is another reason why we wanted the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531.1/8">The Minister confirmed that the adoption of the European directive would affect the UK's ability to conclude agreements with third-party countries&mdash;the question asked in this debate today&mdash;for example, with the United States. It is clear that giving competence to the Commission means ceding competence from one's own Government to make agreements without the permission of the Commission. We have always thought that that was an unnecessary downside to any agreement to give power on issues on which we should retain it. Unless the Minister is telling us that that is a clear red line and he will not sign up to the directive unless there is clear agreement that the UK can conclude agreements with non-EU countries on a bilateral basis, we would be taking a grave risk in doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531.1/9">The Minister has told the Committee that &quot;it is not considered&quot; that the directive would affect the UK's ability to make agreements with third-party countries on the exchange of information and techniques for protecting infrastructure, but he did not provide the authority for that conclusion in any correspondence. A matter that would fall to be determined by the ECJ is one of the imponderables. We do not know whether the ECJ would rule that we still had that power or did not have that power. The question for my Committee was: why put the present freedom and power of the UK to make agreements with third parties at risk by adopting the directive?</p>
	<p pid="a.1531.1/10">After eight years as a member of the Committee, and five years as a member of a Standing Committee before that, I know that entering into such legal obligations may have unpredictable results in the future. Why should Britain risk our present freedom to make bilateral security arrangements and decide what sensitive information we choose to share? I have not heard any argument as to why we should give up either of those two vital powers. I cannot see what the UK can possibly gain by accepting the directive, and that was the unanimous view of the Committee across all parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.1534.0/1">The House certainly has highs and lows. We have had the high drama, intensity and complete transparency of Prime Minister's questions, and then we come to this debate, which is&mdash;unless one has engaged with the subject matter&mdash;probably miles from the immediate thoughts of most people. I came to the subject fresh, because it would normally fall to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" name="Nicholas Clegg">the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)</phrase> to participate in this debate, but he cannot be here today. I looked at the issue from first principles, and have ended up with a huge amount of reading over the last week. Thanks to my keen and enthusiastic assistant, I understand the issues at least to some degree.</p>
	<p pid="a.1534.0/2">I am glad that we are having this debate. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> that it is right that we should have a European Scrutiny Committee and that it is able to say, as it did on this issue, when something is legally and politically important and should be debated on the Floor of the House. The numbers present may be small, but that is related more to other factors in the British political firmament than to the importance of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1534.0/3">This is an important issue because we are talking about what used to be called emergency planning. Everyone realises now that local government needs to undertake emergency planning, for all the sad but familiar reasons. When the Greater London Authority was set up, there was a long debate about the arrangements in London. Similar debates about how to keep the capital and the country safe took place after 9/11, and such questions are back on the agenda after the events of July a couple of years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1534.0/4">Emergency planning is the Government's rightful responsibility, and the Home Office has traditionally taken the lead in its work with other Departments. I understand the Minister when he says that he is not at liberty to share some information to do with planning in respect of terrorist threats to our infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1534.0/5">Some threats have been evident for years. For example, the IRA attacked Canary Wharf as it was being built, and we have heard about the plans to attack the Ministry of Sound night club in my constituency. However, I am talking about something different&mdash;that is, threats to the sewerage system, or to the water or gas supply. Those are important matters, and I am glad that the House has an opportunity to express its views.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1535.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="1535"  time="013:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0007.htm#07050240001078">
	<p pid="a.1535.1/1">I do agree about that, and I want to deal next with article 308. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/2" class="indent">&quot;If action by the Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community, and this Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, take the appropriate measures.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/3">In June 2004, the Council of Ministers asked the Commission to come up with a proposal in respect of EU infrastructure. In other words, the bureaucrats did not initiate this, the politicians did. The Council of Ministers is free to say that it is not going to agree the Commission proposal, with the result that the whole thing has come round full circle and the matter is up for negotiation. The Government will &quot;take note&quot; of this debate, in the way that our procedures allow, but they also have the right under article 8 to veto the outcome. If the UK decides that the proposal should be taken no further, it can act alone to prevent that from happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/4">Does article 308 justify the motion before us? The House of Lords Committee that looked at this matter said that we should not get fixated by article 308 and that we should look at the substance of the motion. The advice that I have been given is that Parliament has accepted similar measures proposed under article 308, and I look forward to the forthcoming report from the European Scrutiny Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/5">These are serious matters. Article 308 is the EU's instrument to cover &quot;anything else extra&quot;, and we must be careful to ensure that what it is used to introduce is justified. I am not going to argue that the proposals before us cannot work under article 308, although I notice that the European Scrutiny Committee believes that the Government have not made their case about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/6">I turn now to the substance of the motion. The Minister was helpful in his responses to interventions, and I want to pick up on a couple of matters that he mentioned. He made it clear that the proposal is justified only if we are talking about matters that are European, critical and to do with infrastructure. That may be a tautology, but it is true. However, I want to put it on record that I share what I believe is the common view of the House about last December's draft directive definition of EU &quot;critical infrastructures&quot;. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/7" class="indent">&quot;'European Critical Infrastructure' means critical infrastructures the disruption or destruction of which would significantly affect two or more Member States, or a single Member State if the critical infrastructure is located in another Member State.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/8">We believe that that provision is too generous, as it is not sufficient that only two member states are affected. Earlier, I gave the example of the UK and Ireland. We have a common interest in some matters, especially in respect of Northern Ireland, and other bilateral agreements cover energy, transport and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/9">The hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk mentioned the much more interesting debate to be had about whether the Eurotunnel involves two member states, or more than two. I believe that disruption to the Eurotunnel would significantly affect more than two member states. For instance, the tunnel goes to Belgium as well as to France, but disruption would have onward consequences for the transport of goods throughout the EU. That would mean that more than three countries would have an interest, and that is why we need a higher threshold than just two member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/10">I also agree that the UK occupies a position that is entirely different from the one occupied by many other countries. For instance, the Benelux countries share many aspects of infrastructure, and a new member state such as Poland may well get some power from the Czech Republic, or vice versa. Countries that are adjacent territorially, with no water between them, are much more likely to share elements of infrastructure, transport and so on. Indeed, that is likely to be common, and the situation between the UK and Ireland, or Cyprus and Malta, is likely to be much less common. I therefore hope that Ministers will negotiate a higher threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/11">The motion asks us to support</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/12" class="indent">&quot;the Government's intention to secure adoption of these documents in Council, subject to a satisfactory resolution of outstanding concerns.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/13">That is rather a catch-all wording&mdash;and I am being generous to the Minister by saying so. It more or less says that the Government have made a request, the Commission has made a proposal, and this is how far we have got. The motion then asks the House to give the nod to further negotiations to secure a satisfactory outcome. To be blunt, a lot of work remains to be done, and the Minister is right to suggest that it is unlikely to be completed in June, especially as we are already in May.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/14">I want to make a couple of final points. Earlier, we had an interesting discussion about the fact that the motion deals with something theoretical, but it was clear that the House was also interested in the specifics. It is important to realise that much work has been done in some sectors, as listed in the supporting papers provided by the European Commission. For instance, work has been done in the IT sector on public electronic communications networks, and in the health sector on epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/15">Work has also been done in the financial sector on euro retail payment systems. Such matters can be seen as part of the infrastructure, as the sudden collapse of the ability to perform bank transactions across Europe would have implications for the financial sector, in which London has a huge interest. Work has been done in the transport sector on ship and port facility security, maritime security and civil aviation security. It is not as though nothing has been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/16">There are many bilateral aspects already, and clearly the Government have thought about them. The Home Office is in the lead, but the issues are cross-governmental; the critical infrastructure sectors listed in the annexe show how broad they are&mdash;energy, nuclear industry, ICT, water, food, health, financial matters, transport, chemical industry, space and research facilities. That substantive list shows that the matter is at a slightly higher macro-level than the provision of public toilets across the EU&mdash;although I realise that the Minister was joking. Like him, I have been involved in London politics for many years. We have not yet got the provision of public facilities in London sorted so we can hardly teach anybody else how to do it. There is work to be done much nearer home.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/17">The proposal is that if there were a directive it would include non-binding and binding measures. That mix is probably right if we can reach agreement about the binding measures&mdash;by definition, it would then be up to us to opt into the others rather than being committed to them. Colleagues in the Lords who have studied the proposal from their perspective as Members of the European Parliament warn us that we must not get into an over-bureaucratic system. The current proposal seems far too extensive, complex and bureaucratic. To take one example, there may be a need for participation in</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/18" class="indent">&quot;critical information protection expert groups at EU level&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/19">but that simply means that it would be good to have somebody from each country who knows what they are talking about and can work out what we need to do. That is sensible and civil servants should be working on that aspect. Information-sharing is good, but we must do it in the least bureaucratic and most practical way possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/20">I end with the conclusion we have already reached. Most of the specific proposals appear perfectly feasible through co-operation, information exchange and best practice. That seems to cover most of the needs and expectations. Subsidiarity and proportionality mean that we should not try to give the EU more functions and responsibility than it needs. We must do what we can in this country. The UK, as a group of islands, is more likely to resolve these matters nationally than on a cross-EU basis, but if there is a need for legislation&mdash;after all, a directive is EU legislation, with which we have to comply&mdash;people have to make a case for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1535.1/21">If the measure is on the agenda, it is because Governments have asked for it to be there because they were worried about terrorism or the risk to European energy supplies. As the Minister said in his intervention, this is not only about our people in this country; Britons are working, living and studying all over the EU, as are people from all the other EU countries. We have a collective responsibility to look after the European Union countries properly, but only inasmuch as it needs to be done on a more-than-national or more-than-bilateral level should it be a matter for the EU. I hope that Ministers will proceed accordingly and negotiate only a measure that is simple, straightforward and the minimum required to deliver the perfectly reasonable objectives that they asked the Commission to consider a few years ago.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1538.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="1538"  time="014:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0007.htm#07050240001079">
	<p pid="a.1538.0/1">First, I make a small apology. I have only recently been appointed to the European Scrutiny Committee and was not party to its discussions. However, I have read the paper prepared for the debate and I have listened carefully to the speeches of other Members. They very much reflect my own feelings; there seems to be consensus that we must take a much firmer line with the Commission and the Council of Ministers, so I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister, in his typically robust way, will do so. I hope that he will take particular note of what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> said, because he went to the nub of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.0/2">The Minister's first response to the communication was robust. He stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.0/3" class="indent">&quot;responsibility for national critical infrastructure is a national responsibility and, secondly, that protection of European Critical Infrastructure is the responsibility of the Member State within which the infrastructure is located&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.0/4">That strong statement seemed to have the Committee's support, but when a series of questions was put to the Minister in writing, his response was less robust. I thought that perhaps someone had toned down his replies, because they did not want them to be too non-communautaire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.0/5">I have had some experience of European committees in Brussels&mdash;although not at the elevated level of the Council of Ministers&mdash;so I know about the style; one does not raise issues strongly. One listens to the reports and then goes away&mdash;possibly for a splendid Brussels lunch. However, in my time I was one of the awkward squad, who always asked the difficult questions in what seemed to be regarded as the British way; we say, &quot;Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, but isn't there a problem?&quot; and other people look round in surprise that anybody should have raised an issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.0/6">I am confident that my hon. Friend the Minister will be one of the awkward squad and that he will raise the issues that have been set out in the debate and speak robustly not just for Britain's interests but for common sense, which suggests that many of the areas covered by the phrase &quot;critical infrastructure&quot; are not that critical&mdash;at least to Europe as a whole, although they might be critical for the interests of a particular nation state. Some things are critical and of serious interest; for example, nuclear power generation poses appalling risks to life if things go wrong, so there is clearly an international interest in it. We are heavily dependent on the supply of gas from Russia via a pipeline going through Germany, so we should take a great interest in that. With other Members, I recently attended a meeting in the House at which a German academic read a paper that suggested that Germany was working closely with Russia to make sure that gas went through Germany, because the Germans wanted to maintain a strong interest in the control of the gas supply. As we saw, Russia made life uncomfortable for Ukraine over gas supplies, so those aspects of critical infrastructure give rise to serious issues in which we and our European colleagues have an interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.0/7">The key is to make sure that there is a hierarchy of risk and interests, but we should not get into deep water over&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;water, which is much more of a national provision. By and large, water is not transported between nation states, certainly not to Britain; although the Welsh might complain that they are supplying water to us in England, we are still&mdash;I think&mdash;the same nation state. Some aspects can be put to one side, because they should not be covered. I have mentioned the areas of interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.0/8">The proposals make a powerful case for nation states such as Britain to generate as much of their own energy as possible and to become less dependent on supplies from other parts of the world that are sometimes unstable and may not be friendly towards us in future. There is a powerful case for generating electricity safely and securely through tidal barrages, especially across the Severn and Thames estuaries, offshore wind farms, microgeneration and combined heat and power. Locally supplied generation and microgeneration is much less vulnerable to the risks we have been debating. Europe-wide structures for energy are much more vulnerable than local, domestic and microgeneration. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1748" name="Alan Simpson">the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)</phrase> speaks on the subject frequently and he is absolutely right to emphasise the importance of looking to renewable sources, and I urge Ministers especially to consider those that are local, micro, national and less vulnerable. Perhaps that goes rather wider of the debate than you might wish, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but it is an important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.0/9">I look forward to my hon. Friend the Minister coming back from Europe having secured a common-sense agreement, having got positive answers to all the issues raised here and by the European Scrutiny Committee, and having spoken for the British national interest and for common sense.</p>

	<p pid="a.1539.0/1">As I indicated in an intervention on the Chairman of the Committee earlier, to a certain extent my concern turns on the manner in which these decisions tend to get taken by Government. I am not going to engage in a hostile confrontation with the Minister over this matter. As much as anything, it is a matter of attitude. The problem is as follows. Albeit that in 2004 the Council of Ministers asked for these questions to be considered, the reality is that in terms of the critical mass of the institutional changes, the attitude of mind&mdash;which is that everything should be Europeanised because that is the nature of the underlying concept of the European constitution, which has by no means been given up&mdash;means that all matters and questions of legal capacity have to be decided against the background of an assumption. That assumption is that if a choice has to be made, it would be better made at a European level than otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1539.0/2">There is also the issue of terrorism, which the Committee has stressed in this context, noting the fact that it had not been dealt with properly in relation to the role of the European Union counter-terrorism co-ordinator, Mr. de Vries, who was brought into the issue somewhat late in the day. The fact is that there are often decisions&mdash;particularly in relation to matters of national security&mdash;where the question of why something is being done is in lower case. It is something that emerges only in the course of a debate of this kind. Of course, it is precisely because the European Scrutiny Committee is so diligent and accurate in its analysis&mdash;given our expert advisers and legal advisers&mdash;that we are in a position to be able to challenge the assumptions on which things otherwise would simply roll forward. For example, in some other countries&mdash;the Minister might take note of this&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister was wandering around the House like a caged lion. I do not know whether he is a lion or a mouse.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1543.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" speakername="Jim Murphy" colnum="1543"  time="014:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0008.htm#07050240001087">
	<p pid="a.1543.5/1">I am pleased to report to the House that, just as the Bill left this place in a good condition, with a strong consensus, that approach was maintained in the other place, where all of those with a keen interest in this important issue played an important part in helping to maintain that consensus. There has been continued engagement with stakeholders, disability organisations and others. It is fair to say at the outset that that has been assisted by the consensus approach across political parties in this and the other place. The one exception is the Scottish National party, which played no role whatsoever in our proceedings at any part of the process. Indeed, today SNP Members have not shown up to their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/2">There are five areas of the Bill and its policy aims that are the subject of amendment. I would like to talk about each briefly in turn. First, I will talk about the issue of the annual report on the operation of the revised personal capability assessment. Amendment No. 1 concerns the operation of the new benefit, the employment and support allowance. The amendment introduces a requirement for the Secretary of State to lay an annual independent report before Parliament on the operation of the revised personal capability assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/3">As I previously confirmed, it has always been our intention that there should be ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of the revised PCA. I gave an undertaking on Report that there would be ongoing independent monitoring by the technical working groups for the first two years following implementation of the revised assessment. My noble Friend Lord McKenzie of Luton gave a similar undertaking in the other place and made a further commitment that monitoring would continue for the first five years following implementation and report to Parliament. That is reflected by the duration of reporting required by the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/4">Lords amendments Nos. 2, 13, 15, 16 and 55 relate to health care professionals other than doctors carrying out a medical examination to provide information used in making a decision on entitlement to benefits. From the outset, the Bill provided for the use of heath care professionals in assessments for ESA. However, shortly after the Bill left the Commons, it became clear that the current legislation did not include the power to make full use of health care professionals in the provision of medical services for customers claiming other benefits, such as disability living allowance, attendance allowance and industrial injuries benefits. Lords amendment No. 13 will enable us to take full advantage of the skills that health care professionals offer in the delivery of medical services for purposes involving social security benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/5">Lords amendment No. 2 will commit us to using only health care professionals who are members of regulated professions. It gives a consistent definition of a health care professional across the benefit system. All health care professionals will, of course, be given full training. They will need to be approved by the Secretary of State before they are able to carry out assessments. Lords amendment No. 55 will ensure that all health care professionals carrying out medical examinations will be bound by the same duties of confidentiality as departmental staff with respect to information about individual customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/6">Lords amendments Nos. 3 to 7 relate to the contracting out of welfare to work services. They will ensure that the Secretary of State cannot authorise a contractor to undertake decision making that could lead to sanctions under the ESA conditionality regime. The Government made such amendments to the Bill in response to concerns expressed about the possible problems associated with the contracting out of sanctions decision making. While, of course, there are potential advantages in moving decision making closer to front-line services, we accept that there is more to be done before we will be aware of how that will work in practice. We will thus not take such a power in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/7">The fourth group of amendments covers sanctioning following an eviction for antisocial behaviour. Lords amendment No. 9 relates to the housing benefit sanction following an eviction for antisocial behaviour and a refusal to accept support. We believe that the sanction will be an important power for local authorities to use in tackling antisocial behaviour in our communities. The amendment provides for a limit to the piloting period. The Government will thus be allowed to press ahead with piloting the scheme, but if there is to be a scheme in place after <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase>, further primary legislation will be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/8">We have made a commitment that piloting will be a key element of our plans. If the measure works as we intend and the threat of sanctions encourages antisocial households and families to engage in support programmes, the end date of <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase> that is specified in the amendment will mean that we will have sufficient time to learn lessons that could inform national design and possible implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/9">The fifth group is, by necessity, made up of technical drafting amendments. The Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee reported on the Bill and we tabled appropriate amendments following those reports. Lords amendments Nos. 8, 22 and 23 will mean that the regulations that will be made under the identified powers relating to entitlement to components and the loss of benefit will be subject to the affirmative procedure. Lords amendments Nos. 10 and 11 make it explicit that the powers in clause 40 relating to the use of social security information are to be used solely to encourage people to claim the benefits to which they may be entitled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/10">Lords amendment No. 17 to schedule 3 will ensure that the Secretary of State will have an obligation to review the relevant ESA amounts in each tax year to determine whether they have retained their value. Lords amendments Nos. 21 to 54 will amend schedule 4 to provide a power to migrate those with an existing award of a benefit relating to incapacity or disability to ESA. The amendments do not affect the policy position that we have taken previously on the migration of existing customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.5/11">I urge the House to agree to the Lords amendments to this important Bill. During the Bill's passage, we have managed to maintain a remarkable degree of well-considered consensus between both sides of the House. Together we can be confident that the Bill will make a real and lasting change to the lives of many people who were written off for so long in the past.</p>

	<p pid="a.1545.0/1">I welcome the Minister's remarks. The modern Conservative party supported the principles of the Bill, the details of which required non-partisan, thorough and vigilant scrutiny in Committee here and in another place. I believe that it has been given such scrutiny. It has been hugely assisted by the advice, wisdom and insight of many groups and bodies that work hard and tirelessly to help those who need the support of a modern welfare state. I pay tribute to them as the passage of the Bill draws to its close.</p>
	<p pid="a.1545.0/2">The key purpose of Lords amendment No. 1 is to ensure that the scrutiny of the Bill's operation continues long after it has been passed. The requirement for annual reports will put Ministers to the test when they explain how the new ESA is benefiting&mdash;as we hope and trust that it will&mdash;many claimants who are able to work, but need support to get back into work. We know that many such people want to work. A welcome improvement was made to the Bill in the other place&mdash;Lord McKenzie was the Minister&mdash;through the insertion of a provision requiring the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament an annual independent report on the operation of the limited capability for work test and the limited capability for work-related activity assessment for the first five years after they came into effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1545.0/3">I welcome the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform's decision not to disagree with that proposition of the Lords. However, it is important that we underscore concerns that are being expressed by outside bodies about the new PCA. There is worry that the early stages of the design of the PCA have, albeit in a well-meaning way, been subject to dummy runs. It is clear we must get right something as important as a gateway to a new incapacity benefit&mdash;ESA&mdash;because it will affect millions of people. The Government have promised that the PCA will be rigorously evaluated. The Minister himself has explained that a two-part evaluation is being carried out to ensure that the revised PCA constitutes a fair, robust and evidence-based assessment of limited capability for work. However, we must be vigilant. We believe that the annual reporting requirement will deliver rigorous scrutiny.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1546.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1468" speakername="David Ruffley" colnum="1546"  time="014:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0009.htm#07050240001090">
	<p pid="a.1546.0/1">I thank the Minister for that. I associate myself with his charitable and generous comments about the work of the Under-Secretary. It was a delight to debate matters with her in Committee, and I think that our debates generated a lot of light. It is important to remind ourselves as proceedings on the Bill draw to a close of the critical importance of the PCA and the vital need to ensure that its operation is not just looked at over a long period of five years but is evaluated annually. The disability benefits consortium has made the point that genuine evaluation must include examination of whether the assessment of capability to work was accurate, as it does not believe that there is a check to achieve that objective under the current arrangements. It suggests that health or social care providers who know the claimant could be asked whether they believe the new score to be a fair assessment, and it asks whether that could be designed into the new PCA. It says that claimants themselves could be asked whether they agree with their new score, and that members of the PCA could be asked to convene technical groups to interview people who are disqualified by the new PCA, but who qualified under the old PCA, to gain a fuller sense of whether they should, or should not, be considered to have limited capability for work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/2">Ministers may find it difficult to accept those propositions, but they are an example of the way in which an iterative process must be used when officials and practitioners at the sharp end implement the new test. We must always have an eagle eye and constantly evaluate the impact of the measures on claimants. The Minister, and Ministers generally, do not regard the new PCA as a draconian measure to choke off the flow of future employment and support allowance claimants, and I congratulate the Government on the fact that they have not used the macho rhetoric of the stick. Ministers, no more than the rest of us, want claimants, past, present and future, to be intimidated by the language that the welfare state uses about their future. I do not doubt the Minister's good intentions or those of future Ministers. The Minister might&mdash;who knows?&mdash;be moved onward and upward in the impending summer Government reshuffle in recognition of his great work on welfare reform. Whoever occupies his seat will want sensitive application and implementation of the new PCA, but annual, independent evaluation is required. A key reason is that problems may be discovered in the first year, new problems may be discovered in the second year, and yet more problems may be discovered in the third year, so in their lordships' view&mdash;and in my view, too&mdash;it is essential that a rigorous, independent annual evaluation is conducted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/3">We accept that the Government have listened to those entreaties in another place, and that they are going to undertake qualitative evaluations. Research studies are undertaken anyway by the Department for Work and Pensions, the rollout of pathways to work is being evaluated, and academic research is accessed on top of that. We accept that all those things were going to be done anyway&mdash;Lord McKenzie made that point&mdash;but the amendment makes provision to pull everything together in a single annual report, and stops a piecemeal analysis with bits and pieces all over the shop. It ensures rigorous, regular scrutiny of that important test.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/4">The Minister referred to Lords amendment No. 2, which clarifies the Bill's wording to ensure that it includes a tighter, more specific definition of a health care professional. There were concerns that the original definition was too broad, and that less than qualified people would fall into the category of health care professionals and be allowed to carry out medical examinations. It was thought that that would affect only a small minority of individuals. Nevertheless, the disability benefits consortium was surely right to welcome the amendment, which specifies the staff who may carry out a work-focused health-related assessment of a disabled person's ability to engage in work-related activity and the kinds of adaptation and support they may need to enable them to undertake such activity. It went on to say that concern had been expressed by disabled people and those who represent them that unsuitably trained staff with relatively little experience of disability and health-related issues might be used. However, the amendment specifies the professionals qualified to undertake interviews, and that will provide important reassurance to disabled people who go through that gateway in future and who are assessed under the new process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/5">We support, too, Lords amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 to clause 15. They remove from the Bill the ability to contract out decision making leading to sanctions. The category of excluded decisions includes all the decisions that can lead to sanctions, as well as decisions about the sanction itself. As a result of the amendments, decisions on sanctions will be made by Jobcentre Plus staff. The Secretary of State cannot, at this stage, authorise contracted-out providers either to deliver the sanction or to make decisions leading to sanctions. Again, it is important to reflect the non-ideological nature of the conversation that we have been having for several months. Contracting out is not an across-the-board, ideological fix. It depends on how it is used, and what it is used for. It was the judgment of shadow Ministers that it was not appropriate for contracted-out providers to make those decisions. Conflict of interest could obviously arise, particularly when contracted-out providers are paid according to outcomes, and are given a fee for success, as it were. The implication is that they might be seen by claimants as having an interest in wielding the stick, applying sanctions so that people are more likely to work and the provider can earn more fees as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/6">I was never one for thinking that the private sector would be so crass as to go down that route. Most of the private sector contractors to whom I have spoken overthe past year have a genuine caring mission in taking people from welfare into work. Yes, there is a commercial advantage in their doing so, and they have to make a profit but, by and large, they do so with great skill, compassion and concern for the customer. I never thought that the possibility that Ministers would want to contract out sanctioning to the private sector would be a major problem, but insofar as it worried outside lobby and support groups that help disabled people and claimants, it was likely to worry claimants. We made it clear that we wanted the state, not a private outsourced contractor, to make those potentially sensitive decisions on sanctioning. It was interesting to read in the report, &quot;Reducing Dependency, increasing opportunity: options for the future of welfare to work&quot;, which was published in March, David Freud's recommendation that sanctions be administered though Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/7">The outside groups that expressed concern to me and to others&mdash;Mencap, the disability benefits consortium, Leonard Cheshire and many others&mdash;should be pleased with the outcome of their lobbying efforts and persuasion throughout the Bill, including on this point. They can say that Parliament and Ministers have been listening and have made the decision that they wanted. If Ministers want to give a power of sanction to the outsourced contractors, they will again have to argue the case in Parliament. We shall see whether that is necessary in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/8">We had an interesting debate in Committee about sanctions attaching to housing benefit. Some of us thought that there were sufficient sanctions in the system already. For totally unacceptable behaviour by tenants, the sanction is eviction. The provisions in the Bill suggested that in addition, after evictions proceedings had gone through, there would be a further benefit sanction if the recalcitrant tenant causing misery for neighbours did not mend their ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/9">We then moved on to the topic of piloting. In fairness, Ministers always envisaged that the new housing benefit sanction after evictions proceedings had kicked in needed to be tested. We were concerned that the piloting would be open ended. We argued for a two-year sunset clause, in effect, enabling Parliament to monitor the pilots for up to two years. I am delighted that the amendment, which the Minister supports, means that if the Government want a scheme to run after December 2010, further primary legislation will be required, as the hon. Gentleman indicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/10">I conclude by endorsing the Minister's remarks about the generally bipartisan cross-party consensus on the principles of the Bill. That does not mean to say that the job is done. Pursuant to the Bill, detailed future regulations will be produced, and as we all know, the devil is always in the detail. Those regulations will not be subject to substantive amendment, but with the provisions that we have discussed today, particularly the annual report, I am confident that the Government of the day, whoever they are, will be put under scrutiny to make real the possibility of those on welfare getting a better deal in Britain in the 21st century, a better chance to get out of welfare and into work, out of dependency and living more fulfilling lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/11">I am grateful to the Minister for listening to what was said in the other place on these important groups of amendments, and for contributing so well to our deliberations in this place. I hope, like him, that the Bill is at least a starting point in making Britain a better place for those who want to get out of dependency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1551.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That this House do now adjourn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I am pleased to have this opportunity today to debate the current situation in Sri Lanka, and I am grateful to the right hon. and hon. Members present for their interest in this important issue. There has been mounting concern about the continuing violence and tragic displacement of people from their homes on that beautiful island. I want the House to know that this debate is the result of expressions of concern from right hon. and hon. Members. It is not, as some propagandists and partisan elements have claimed, a debate generated by any faction of Sri Lankan politics or by any lobbying organisations claiming to represent any part of the large Sri Lankan diaspora residing in Britain, pro or anti-LTTE.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551.1/3">I participated in a debate on Sri Lanka a year ago, when I expressed the hope that its Government and the LTTE&mdash;the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam&mdash;would fulfil the commitments that they made at talks in Geneva in February 2006, which were the first talks for three years. The Government had pledged that no armed group or person other than Government security forces would carry arms or conduct operations. For its part, the LTTE had pledged to ensure that there would be no acts of violence against the security forces and the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551.1/4">Sadly, those commitments remain unfulfilled. We have over the past year seen worsening violence. Extra-judicial killings, disappearances, intimidation and violence by paramilitary groups are all too common. The violence has fuelled an atmosphere of extreme mistrust and polarisation, which has fuelled further antagonism and violence. Innocent civilians have borne the brunt. There are now more than 100,000 displaced persons in the eastern district of Batticaloa and hundreds more arrive every day. There have been more than 700 cases of missing persons in the Jaffna peninsular, and nearly 500 are still unresolved. There have been more than 50 abductions in Colombo in the past year, and nine media workers have lost their lives in recent months. In the past few weeks, bus bombings have killed dozens of people simply going about their daily business. These are despicable terrorist acts that are totally without justification.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551.1/5">The responsibility of the LTTE for violent acts over the years is well documented. It is a proscribed organisation under the Terrorism Act 2000. The EU listed the LTTE as a terrorist organisation in May 2006. We have repeatedly urged the LTTE to move away from the path of violence. In the absence of a full renunciation of terrorism in deed and word, there can be no question of reconsidering its proscribed status. LTTE involvement in killings, torture, detention of civilians and denial of freedom of speech is a reality. The LTTE does not tolerate any expression of opposition and its continuing recruitment of child soldiers is a matter of great concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551.1/6">The ability of the LTTE to raise funds overseas helps to sustain its ability to carry out violent acts and reduces the incentive to move way from the path of violence. LTTE fundraising activity in the United Kingdom encourages war, not peace. It will not be tolerated, and I have recently met our security authorities to discuss how we can counter the bullying, threats and acts of fraud that are used regularly to extract money from the Tamil population and others in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551.1/7">The LTTE is not the only source of violence in Sri Lanka, however. Civilians in Government-controlled areas regularly fall victim to brutal attacks by paramilitary groups, often acting with apparent immunity. Reports of the Government's links with the faction led by Karuna, a former LTTE commander, concern us a great deal. We believe Karuna and his faction to be responsible for extra-judicial killings, abductions, intimidation of displaced persons and child recruitment. Karuna's record is appalling, and we will be watching very closely whether he acts on his commitment to the United Nations to address the child recruitment issue. We will want to see clear evidence that he has delivered against his welcome promises. Karuna needs to go further and cease all acts of violence and intimidation against civilians.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551.1/8">There must be no question of the Government of Sri Lanka allowing Karuna to perpetrate those crimes. If they are serious in their desire to find paths to an inclusive, peaceful Sri Lanka that embraces all its peoples and cultures, they must disassociate themselves completely from all acts of abuse, terrorism, intimidation or torture, no matter who commits them or what agency encourages them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1555.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is not to know this, but we have had quite a number of meetings with Tamil groups from around the country. As well as talking to the Sri Lankan Government, we have met all kinds of representatives. Let me assure him that this is a completely balanced approach. Securing this debate is part of that process, and I hope that he will contribute to it. Our approach seeks not to take sides either with the Sinhalese Government or with the LTTE but to try to use our good offices and our experience in Northern Ireland, among other places, to try to find ways in which it might be possible to help the Norwegians to make the ceasefire work, and then to take that peace process forward, put the issues on the table, and get everyone around the table to try to resolve the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.4/2">Some 60,000 people have died in this war so far, and perhaps 1 million people have been displaced. It is a very serious conflict by any standards in the world, and we are working very hard to try to resolve it, but, believe me, there is no easy way forward on this one&mdash;it will take a long time. This conflict has been going on for a very long time. Before you took your seat in the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, Mr. Deputy Speaker was telling me that he remembers it kicking off when he was out there in 1983&mdash;in fact, it was the day after he left; I do not know whether he was to blame.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.4/3">We complement our high-level engagement with more practical assistance through a joint Department for International Development, Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office peace-building strategy for Sri Lanka. The focus includes people-to-people contacts between communities, mechanisms to provide early warning of potential for conflict, and development of civil society capacity to monitor conflict. We are involved in all those processes. We believe that quiet activity of that kind has an important role to play in these difficult times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.4/4">I know that many in the Sri Lankan diaspora have been pleased to see Britain's active involvement in Sri Lanka. We believe the Sri Lankan diaspora in Britain to be perhaps as much as 200,000 strong. It is important that we take into account their views and insights as we try to formulate a balanced policy on Sri Lanka. Right hon. and hon. Members present will understand that there is a wide range of views within the community on a way forward for peace and the role of Britain in Sri Lanka. We try to listen to all perspectives within the community, and we value those opinions and insights.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1557.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="1557"  time="015:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0010.htm#07050240001109">
	<p pid="a.1557.2/1">I congratulate the Minister on his calm and balanced introduction to the debate. We have had a good start to a debate on a subject that evokes passions. It is important to debate it in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/2">Sri Lanka is a beautiful island with a population of approximately 19.5 million people and it has been my pleasure to visit it. It is rightly a popular tourist destination&mdash;it has more than 600 miles of beaches, with resorts on the west, south and east coasts. It also contains deep jungle and mountain slopes, where high quality Ceylon tea is grown.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/3">Sri Lanka has an ancient and historic civilisation, some of which I have explored through ruined cities and buildings such as palaces, dagobars and Buddhist temples throughout the island. I am conscious of the substantial archaeological interest in various sites, including Anuradhapura, Mihintale, Polonnaruwa, Sigirya, Dambulla and Kandy, where the glory of the island's past can be witnessed at first hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/4">I have been welcomed by the friendly people of Sri Lanka when I have visited. It is therefore especially sad, given its natural richness, that the troubles and deep divisions persist on that beautiful island. I note that the Minister visited in February. As he said, the problems have been going on for far too long. The dispute in Sri Lanka does not get as much international attention as it deserves when compared with Darfur, Somalia or Burma. That is a travesty, given the long-standing nature of the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/5">Its recent history began in 1975, when a Tamil, Vellupillai Prabhakaran, began to form an extremist wing, which is now known as the Tamil Tigers&mdash;the LTTE. The Foreign Office estimates that, since that conflict began, nearly 70,000 people have been killed and perhaps more than a million people have been displaced. It is a major conflict in anybody's terms. In recent times, the conflict and death rates have escalated. In answer to a written parliamentary question from me earlier this year, the Minister said that there were 1,000 civilian deaths last year and 40 this January alone. I also note that some 64,857 internally displaced persons are in the process of being resettled. That is expected to happen by the end of July.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/6">The conflict has brought untold misery to many more throughout the country who have been injured, displaced or lost loved ones. The international community should make renewed efforts to inject momentum into the peace process. As the Minister repeated several times, a political solution, agreed by all the parties involved in the dispute, is the only lasting answer to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/7">To begin to resolve the conflict, both sides must recognise that that will not happen by military means. As the United Kingdom Government discovered in Northern Ireland, there must be a political solution. There will never be a military solution to the Sri Lankan problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/8">Given the deeply ingrained feelings of mistrust on both sides, resolution is not an easy prospect, as the Minister said. Yet we should not stop trying. It should be our purpose today to discuss what we can do to facilitate the end of the violence in that beautiful country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/9">There is almost daily violence between the armed forces of the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE. On Friday, three Sri Lankan navy personnel were killed by members of the LTTE in a gun battle in Trincomalee on the east coast. On Thursday, Sri Lankan army troops launched an attack on the rebel mortar position in the north-west of the country, where clashes the previous day left 23 combatants dead. The sad truth is that similar incidents happen every day and will probably continue to happen unless something is done to stop them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/10">As the Minister said, only five years ago, the position appeared a great deal more positive, when the 2002 peace agreement brokered by the Norwegian-led peace envoy was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-02">2 February</phrase>. Both parties agreed to</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/11" class="indent">&quot;recognise the importance of bringing an end to hostilities and improving the living conditions for all inhabitants affected by the conflict... bringing an end to the hostilities is also seen... as a means of establishing a positive atmosphere in which further steps towards negotiations on a lasting solution can be taken.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/12">Unfortunately, from that high water mark, it is clear that a solution in Sri Lanka is in desperate need of a positive atmosphere, demonstrated by the working of that peace accord.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/13">I greatly welcome and appreciate the efforts of the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" name="Paul Murphy">the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>, who is present today. He visited the country in November and met not only members of the Sri Lankan Government but non-governmental organisations and senior members of the LTTE. His wealth of knowledge of how the Northern Ireland peace solution evolved should be invaluable to both sides of the conflict. I welcome the friendly way in which he felt able to discuss that matter with me. It has been a considerable help in understanding the problems of Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/14">I believe that the example of Northern Ireland is particularly pertinent when considering a solution in Sri Lanka. For a long time, the IRA pursued a violent military campaign to try to force the British Government to concede to its demands, yet it finally realised that the British Government and the British people would not buckle to its tactics. Thankfully, we have now seen an end to the IRA's campaign of violence. The LTTE and others should take their lead from the IRA and involve themselves in the political process. The simple reality is that no Government can or should give in to the demands of those who would kill and maim innocent civilians. The use of violence to make one's voice heard is unacceptable in a civilised society.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/15">Independent reports of bombings, shootings, the recruitment of child soldiers by the LTTE have resulted, as we heard today, in the organisation becoming proscribed by the EU, the US, Australia and India. The LTTE seeks to justify its actions because it claims that it faces discrimination from the Sri Lankan Government, while also claiming that it is denied the right to an independent homeland. However, there is never justification for a campaign of aggression on the scale that we have seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/16">Let me turn briefly to deal with the role that the Sri Lankan Government could play in this conflict. The Government are internationally recognised as the democratically elected Administration of the country. Equally, it cannot be said that the Sri Lankan Government have played no part in exacerbating the conflict. I think that the Sri Lankan Government's decision to close the main A9 road to Jaffna and leave it closed for such a long time was unhelpful and I know that many right hon. and hon. Members, including myself, called on the Government to open that road during the period that it was closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/17">What makes the Sri Lankan Government's decisions unacceptable is that they have refused access to international aid agencies, which bring much-needed humanitarian relief to the people of that troubled north-east region. I know that the Minister met the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka and doubtless made that point to him. I also met him when he came here in early March and made precisely that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/18">Political representation for the Tamil minority in Sri Lankan politics is another issue that needs serious consideration. If Sri Lanka is to be capable of creating a long-term and peaceful solution to its problems, engagement in an inclusive political process is essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/19">The Tamil community has claimed for a long time that it faced discrimination by the Sinhalese establishment. It complains that it has been and continues to be marginalised and stopped from reaching positions of power. I believe that the Government of Sri Lanka should take that very seriously and should make every effort to rectify it and foster a lasting sense of understanding between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil population that will ultimately lead to peace. It must be made clear that the Tamil people will be allowed to share power and that their political involvement will be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/20">The best way for the Sri Lankan Government to defeat insurrection is to offer the Tamil people a peaceful and meaningful democratically accountable role in the Sri Lankan Parliament. Those affected by the conflict must be desperate for an alternative that will end violence, yet while no realistic alternative exists, the LTTE will continue to gain support from their populations. The Sri Lankan Government should seek to win hearts and minds in order to cut off support to that base and the extremists.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/21">I welcome the actions of the Sri Lankan Government's security forces, including paramilitaries, but they must be careful that they are not seen to be abusing human rights. In that respect, I welcome the independent group of eminent persons, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> mentioned, so ably chaired by the respected Indian judge, Mr. Bhagwati, as well as Sir Nigel Rodley and an EU representative. The work that this independent acceptable group could do would be commendable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/22">The international community is rightly concerned that the Sri Lankan Government have not necessarily addressed serious human rights abuses, including torture, being perpetrated by the LTTE against civilians. The Minister recognised today that the LTTE is accused by UNICEF and others of having recruited more than 6,500 children for its armed campaign. That is quite unacceptable. As the Minister told me in a written parliamentary answer:</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/23" class="indent">&quot;Officials regularly make clear that the use of child soldiers in Sri Lanka cannot be tolerated.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-10-09.453"><i> Official Report, </i>9 October 2006; Vol. 450, c. 453-4W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/24">I was very pleased to hear him restate that again today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/25">Similarly, the LTTE continues to make allegations against the Government. It recently accused them of killing 10 Indian fishermen who had strayed into Sri Lankan territorial waters. The Tamil Nadu state Government in India, however, confirmed that the LTTE was responsible for killing the Indian fishermen. Clearly, there is a certain amount of spinning and false propaganda.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/26">How is it funded? I am sure that hon. Members will be aware that the weapons used by the LTTE have increased in sophistication. Indeed, it recently acquired a light aircraft with a range of 600 miles in which it was able to carry out a series of air strikes across the country, damaging an oil depot owned by Royal Dutch Shell and the Indian Oil Corporation. The LTTE hit the main airport in Colombo earlier this week and the flights of three international airlines&mdash;Cathay Pacific, Singapore and Emirates airlines&mdash;have been suspended. Evidence suggests that some of air raids were assisted by Canadian-trained Tamil engineers. With an economy that is heavily reliant on the tourist industry, the aims of the LTTE are obvious. It seeks to cripple the island's economy with its acts, harming the entire island's economic well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/27">Where does LTTE funding come from? The US State Department's annual country terrorism report, published on Monday, suggests that the LTTE finances itself from the Tamil diaspora based in North America, Europe and Australia, as well as by imposing &quot;local taxes&quot; on businesses operating in the areas of Sri Lanka that it controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/28">As I said in my intervention, a chief fund raiser of the LTTE, Karunakaran Kandasamy, was arrested last week in the United States under charges of raising funds to support terrorism and fomenting terrorism in the United States. The assistant director of the FBI said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/29" class="indent">&quot;Karuna hasn't merely supported the LTTE cause, he has orchestrated support in the US.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/30">In a similar case yesterday, the Australian federal police arrested two men under suspicion of diverting funds intended to go to victims of the 2004 Boxing day tsunami to the LTTE in order to buy arms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.2/31">In addition to those two cases, numerous others demonstrate that the LTTE has a sophisticated and complex international fundraising network. The Minister was right in his response to some of his Back Benchers that we would need to be incredibly careful about de-proscribing the LTTE as a terrorist organisation. I hope that the Minister who replies to the debate will be able to tell the House what efforts the British Government are making to work with the international community to root out those who would raise money for the LTTE and other terrorist groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.1562.0/1">I hope that, when the Minister responds to the debate, he will be able to confirm that our deputy high commissioner in Sri Lanka is to visit the headquarters of the LTTE tomorrow to have precisely the kind of dialogue that my hon. Friend has described.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1562.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="1562"  time="015:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0011.htm#07050240001115">
	<p pid="a.1562.3/1">I have made it clear that I want to see an inclusive political dialogue, and there can be a dialogue only between two parties. That means that the Sri Lankan Government must also become fully engaged in the process. As the Minister and I have said repeatedly, there cannot be a military solution, so it is in the interests of the Government and the people of Sri Lanka that we promote this dialogue from all sides. Anything that the international community can do to foster and facilitate that will be a good thing. I do not want to get into the internal politics of Sri Lanka&mdash;that is not our business&mdash;but I urge the Sri Lankan Government fully to participate in the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/2">Before I conclude, I want to consider the role of the Indian Government, who have a significant role to play in solving the problems in Sri Lanka. It is clear that there is support for the cause of the LTTE among the people in the nearest Indian province to Sri Lanka&mdash;Tamil Nadu. I asked the Minister what representations he and the Foreign Office had made to the Indian Government to determine how we might stop some of the funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/3">I am sure that the House will join me in supporting the reinvigoration of the peace process and the Norwegian-led Sri Lankan monitoring mission&mdash;the so-called SLMN. We need to promote peace through this means. I also congratulate the co-chairs whom the Minister mentioned. However, a BBC news report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">30 March</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/4" class="indent">&quot;There was always the suspicion that the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan Government turned up&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/5">to the peace talks in Geneva&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/6" class="indent">&quot;only because of international pressure and without any real desire to talk peace...and a lack of progress seems to prove this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/7">I do not know whether that it true or not; that is the BBC's view. Suffice it to say that anything that the British Government and the international community can do to encourage the Norwegian-led peace process has to be a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/8">There are some who say that Britain should take a stronger role. However, I believe that the position of Britain as the former colonial power opens us up to allegations of interfering in independent territories. Similarly, the large number of members of the Sri Lankan diaspora in this country makes if difficult for us to take a bilateral role. Of course we should encourage the Norwegian-led peace process and any UN peace process, and we should welcome the all-party report that is about to be presented in the Sri Lankan Government, but it would be wrong for the British Government to take up a bilateral role.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/9">To conclude, I have a number of questions, and I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary of State for International Development were able to answer them when he sums up. What further ideas do the British Government have to resolve the situation? How can the Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission be strengthened? In the Government's view, does it have adequate funding, resources and access to all sides in the debate? Do the Government have any plans, during our chairmanship of the Security Council, to raise the matter in the Security Council or General Assembly? What direct representations has the Minister or the Foreign Office made to the Indian Government, to whom I have just referred, regarding the advancement of the peace process or the funding to the LTTE from the main continent of India?</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/10">As I asked the Minister, is intelligence between the EU, United States, Australia and India being properly co-ordinated, and are the Government satisfied that all the necessary channels of communication are in place to do that? I want to ensure particularly that those who commit atrocities, who are well known, should be brought to trial, and that external funding to purchase the increasingly sophisticated weaponry that I have mentioned is halted, as it seems to me that it can only worsen the terrorist insurrection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.3/11">Sri Lanka is a beautiful island&mdash;some have called it &quot;the gem of the Indian ocean&quot;&mdash;with a wonderful, friendly, hospitable people, whose suffering as a result of this dispute is a monumental tragedy. It is the responsibility of anyone who has interests in the future prosperity and well-being of the people of Sri Lanka to ensure that their actions do not facilitate further violence. Above all, it is the duty of the international community to act in a co-ordinated way to help to facilitate a much-needed peace solution.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1564.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" speakername="Paul Murphy" colnum="1564"  time="015:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0011.htm#07050240001118">
	<p pid="a.1564.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister of State and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> for their kind comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/2">The interchange between <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1683" name="Jim Dowd">the hon. Member for Cotswold and my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd)</phrase> touched on the issue of human rights, and that must be set in the context of the 65,000 to 70,000 people who have perished on that island in about 30 years. I will deal with the Northern Ireland comparison later, but the two situations are uncannily similar in terms of the proportionate number of people who have died, been injured or been displaced: Northern Ireland has a population of approximately 1.5 million, and some 3,500 people died there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/3">When I visited the island in November I was struck, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State and the hon. Member for Cotswold said, by what a beautiful island it was, and how talented, courteous and decent the people, from whatever background they came, were&mdash;certainly to me personally, in my limited experience. Incidentally, I saw no examples of religious intolerance on that island. Travelling late at night from the airport to the capital city, we turned one corner and saw a statute of St. Anthony of Padua, and turned another corner and saw a Buddhist shrine. When I went to the north, I saw a cathedral at the end of a street, and the sacred cows of the Hindus walking in the same street. Of course, a substantial minority of Muslims also play an active role in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/4">I was struck by the fact that all those to whom I talked, whatever their background or experience, were very complimentary about our own country. I felt that, in accordance with the deep relationship between Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom and its people&mdash;not least, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Minister, the diaspora of 200,000 who live in our land&mdash;those on the island were still very sympathetic to us, as a country and as British people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/5">I want to say something about the small role that I played back in November, and to share my experiences with the House. The President of Sri Lanka had asked the Prime Minister if we could send someone to share our experiences of peacemaking in Northern Ireland with the Government and peoples of Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister asked me to go, as a former Minister of State and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, along with Chris MacCabe, political director of the Northern Ireland Office. My experience in Northern Ireland went back a dozen years; his went back nearly four decades. His experience, knowledge and expertise proved very important in our meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/6">During our visit I met the President, a number of Ministers and civil servants, the peace secretariats, non-governmental organisations, the armed forces, different political parties, bodies set up by the Government to consider the country's constitutional future and a panel of experts, and I travelled to the north of the island to talk at some length with the LTTE. In all those encounters, I met nothing but courtesy and friendliness. I also met representatives of the business community in Columbia, who are very important to the country's future regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/7">The message that I tried to get across did not involve preaching to anyone, or telling the people of Sri Lanka what to do. That would have been entirely counterproductive. I think that the reason for the point we have reached in Northern Ireland&mdash;over the whole 10-year period of the peace process, and over the last few weeks in particular&mdash;is that the people of Northern Ireland themselves created the peace process and the peace settlement. Similarly, it is for the people of Sri Lanka to complete their own peace and political processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/8">In many ways, I was in Sri Lanka to tell a story&mdash;a success story, I am delighted to say, and I am sure we are all delighted about it. I wanted to know whether people in Sri Lanka, within or outside politics, could look to us and Northern Ireland as an example in bringing peace to their country. The first message that I hoped to convey to the people and their representatives was one that had been given to them, only weeks before I went to Sri Lanka, by Mr. Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister-elect and the chief negotiator for Sinn Fein in the Northern Ireland peace talks. He had gone to Sri Lanka and said what my hon. Friend the Minister has said: that no one can win the war in Sri Lanka, just as no one could win the war in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/9">It is possible to continue such a war, of course. More people can die, more people can be injured and more people can be displaced. Ultimately, however, comes the realisation that a military solution is not possible. I say that without reference to either side: it applies across the board, like our tests on abuse of human rights, torture, and all the other terrible things that have happened in that country. I lay no blame on anyone. I simply say that, at the end of the day, military action leads nowhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/10">How is it possible for those in Sri Lanka to look to our peace process in Northern Ireland, beyond that central message, and for peace to come to Sri Lanka? One answer is that there must be absolute parity of esteem, the phrase that we used in Northern Ireland. It means that all people must be treated equally, regardless of their past or who they might be. Every single idea or concept&mdash;some might be dotty, some good; it matters not&mdash;must be put on the table. Such inclusiveness had to apply not only to the constitutional settlement&mdash;that is being worked on in detail in Sri Lanka&mdash;but also to the issues of language, social and economic equality, human rights, freedom of information and all the other things that divide people. Such issues have divided people in Northern Ireland, and they do so in Sri Lanka, and none of them should be excluded from discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.0/11">Another lesson that can be learned is that there must be an international dimension to any solution in Sri Lanka. I pay tribute to our Norwegian friends, who have done a tremendous job in Sri Lanka in holding things together as best they can. They have often managed to engage in difficult circumstances where almost everybody was against them because they were in the middle. This House and the Government should pay tribute to the work that the Norwegians do, and we should also pay tribute to the co-chairs. When I was in Sri Lanka, I met the ambassadors of the EU, Japan, India and the United States, and our own high commissioner, who is doing a good job.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1566.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" speakername="Paul Murphy" colnum="1566"  time="015:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0012.htm#07050240001120">
	<p pid="a.1566.1/1">I have a view, but I would not want to propose it to either side in Sri Lanka as a solution to things. I suggest that the Northern Ireland peace process was ultimately successful because it was held in Northern Ireland. There was also international chairmanship from three different countries. People were constantly working on a peace process. Members will recall that people were elected to be negotiators in Northern Ireland, and that they were, in effect, locked up in Castle buildings in Belfast for almost three years, and they were paid, and had support, to do nothing but negotiate. It is important that there is that constant working at a peace process&mdash;as is the fact that in negotiations people inevitably come together. They have to come together because they are physically together and they are talking together.</p>
	<p pid="a.1566.1/2">That issue of talking is very important. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> touched on that. Even at the most desperate times over the last 30 years in this country, there were lines of communication between those in Northern Ireland who were engaged in the strife there and our Government. We should read the history books about what happened over the past 30 years. At no time did the lines of communication cease. That is missing in Sri Lanka. The British Government and our allies should constantly press for there always to be a proper line of communication. There is a line of communication with the Norwegians, but another could be set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1566.1/3">In Sri Lanka, I met the people who had been displaced in the eastern part of the island. That brought dramatically home the appalling tragedy for ordinary human beings of situations such as that in Sri Lanka. We are talking in this nice Chamber this afternoon, but the reality is that there are men, women and children who are constantly and severely suffering because of the lack of peace, and the lack of a proper peace process, such as there was in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1566.1/4">There is an issue to do with the diaspora which is also comparable to the Northern Ireland situation. We have talked about what happened in our case. One of the key reasons why the Northern Ireland process was successful was that the attitude of the Irish diaspora&mdash;in Australia and other countries to an extent, but most importantly in the United States&mdash;changed towards what should happen in Ireland. Nowadays, almost everybody in the USA&mdash;such as Irish-American politicians and business people&mdash;has signed up to the Good Friday agreement. If we can get the Sri Lankan diaspora across the world to have a similar frame of mind&mdash;if they begin to think that they can sign up to a process and then help the people of Sri Lanka economically and commercially&mdash;that will be a considerable improvement. However, that cannot happen unless there is a proper ceasefire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1566.1/5">The other great lesson that people across the world, and particularly in Sri Lanka, can take from our experiences in Northern Ireland is that a ceasefire has to be meaningful. Only when violence effectively ended in Northern Ireland did we see success. Of course, sporadic violence occurred, and to a certain extent it will continue to occur among criminal elements in Northern Ireland, but when the fighting stops and the ceasefire is effective, everything is possible. To me, that is the first and most important thing that should happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1566.1/6">There is another, political issue. In the past 30 years in this Chamber, there has been a bipartisan approach and unanimity among all political parties on the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland. That has not happened in Sri Lanka, but we should applaud the fact that it is beginning to happen. If the political parties do not adopt a unified approach, the issue of peace will become a political football, which is the last thing that should happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.1567.1/1">It is a vital part of the process. As part of the peace-making negotiations in Northern Ireland, the tiniest of the parties elected had exactly the same say in the process, even though their votes did not necessarily carry the same weight. The necessary will, trust and confidence also have to be there. They can sometimes take many months&mdash;even years&mdash;to develop, but will, trust, confidence, parity of esteem and the equality of treatment of everybody, whatever their views might be, are essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1567.1/2">I hope to visit Sri Lanka in the not too distant future and to take part in telling the story of our peace process in Northern Ireland. I am reminded of something that Lee Kuan Yew said, which some Members might also remember. When he was building Singapore, he wanted his country to become something like Ceylon, as it was then called. Now, of course, it should be the aim of everybody in Sri Lanka to ensure that their country becomes as prosperous, dignified and civilised a country as any other in the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.1574.0/1">I have never visited Sri Lanka. My knowledge of the problems in Sri Lanka stems from my experience as the MP for Tooting for the past two years and as a councillor for Tooting ward between 1994 and 2006. There is a large Tamil diaspora in Tooting. In my experience, the Tamil community has helped to regenerate Tooting town centre and contributed to Tooting's vibrancy. It has also brought cultural enrichment to our community in Tooting and Wandsworth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/2">Members of the community first came to the area as asylum seekers. Many of them became refugees and went on to become nationals. Most of them then became British citizens. They are proud to be Tooting Tamils. Tooting has a vibrant and well-used temple: the Sivayogam temple on Upper Tooting road. The White Pigeon charity on Upper Tooting road does a great deal of charitable work in Sri Lanka. The Tamil rehabilitation organisation is on Garratt lane. The South London Tamil welfare group, Wandsworth Tamil welfare association and many other groups do a tremendous amount of work not only in the community in Tooting, but in Sri Lanka. In my contribution I will articulate the concerns that those groups have raised with me. My experience of Sri Lanka comes through the eyes of my constituents, many of whom come to my surgeries to seek help and still have family members and loved ones in Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/3">As hon. Members have said, over the past four months, fighting has continued to rage between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam&mdash;the LTTE. The 2002 ceasefire agreement that was signed by the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE now seems like years ago. It is worth remembering that up to 2002, the civil war in Sri Lanka had claimed the lives of at least 64,000 people, most of whom were civilians. Men, women and children were indiscriminately killed and seriously injured.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/4">The Sri Lanka monitoring mission made some progress. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> commented, Norway deserves tributes for the role that it has played, but the US Government, the EU, Japan, the Indian Government and ourselves have also played a big role.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/5">Many of us have used the BBC as our source of reference. It estimates that 4,000 more people, mainly Tamil civilians, have been killed in Sri Lanka since late 2005, when violence began to escalate once again, bringing the total number of people killed since the outbreak of civil war to 68,000. I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) and for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) for reminding us of the history of Sri Lanka and where any blame for the civil war should be apportioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/6">Hon. Members will be aware that although the LTTE was a party to the 2002 ceasefire agreement, it was&mdash;and still is&mdash;proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 in the UK. The US and India have also proscribed the LTTE and declared it to be a terrorist organisation. In mid-May 2006, the European Parliament passed a resolution in support of declaring the LTTE a terrorist organisation. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-29">29 May</phrase>, it was confirmed that EU Foreign Ministers had decided to list the LTTE as a terrorist organisation. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-31">31 May</phrase>, the EU announced in a statement that sanctions against the LTTE were in force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/7">I accept that in the UK it is open to the LTTE to challenge proscription using the route set out in the Terrorism Act, and<i> </i>I understand that when the Home Secretary recently met Tamil groups he made it quite clear that any challenge would have to be made via that route. I take on board the serious points made by my hon. Friend the Minister, and it is right that they should be addressed. However, may I tell the Government and colleagues that there is a perception among the Tamil diaspora of double standards? The House of Commons Library note states, in the context of violence:</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The main protagonists are the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/9">There is a belief that only the LTTE has been penalised. The Tamil diaspora cannot be confident that the EU is an impartial broker, following its declaration that the LTTE is a terrorist organisation, and there are fears that that will seriously weaken the Sri Lanka monitoring mission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/10">Colleagues will know from other debates in the Chamber going back many years the arguments about one man's terrorist being another man's freedom fighter. Concerns have been raised by my constituents about a dirty tricks campaign that is being waged against the Tamil diaspora in the UK. We have all seen&mdash;and it has already been mentioned&mdash;the press coverage on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-21">21 April 2007</phrase>, in which a representative of the Sri Lankan embassy in London claimed that the LTTE was behind a scam involving petrol station employees in the UK, in which credit cards were cloned, PIN numbers recorded and money withdrawn and allegedly used by the LTTE. On the other hand, Humberside police say clearly and unequivocally:</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Our evidence does not suggest that there is a definite link with Sri Lankan gangs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.0/12">There is a perception in the communities of the Tamil diaspora that allegations and aspersions can be made without their having any recourse to try to clear their name. We should understand their frustration, and colleagues have articulated the snowballing of perceived unfairness, whether real or not, leading to other forms of discomfort and actions that we all condemn.</p>

	<p pid="a.1576.2/1">My hon. Friend has made many important statements on the Floor of the House, and the statement that he has just made is so important that it needs to be underlined. My own Tamil friends, neighbours and constituents have been agonisingly hurt by the statement that there is some sort of terrorist funding scam operating at petrol stations. It is crucial that my hon. Friend put that lie to bed, and it is important, too, that we recognise that many members of the Tamil community work extremely hard in petrol stations. We should be grateful to them for their hard work and their contribution to the economy, and we should not seek to spin them into an atmosphere of blame.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1576.3" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02b.1576.3" matchtype="changes"/>

	<p pid="a.1576.3/1">I am extremely grateful for that intervention from my friend and hon. Friend. I deliberately made a point in my introduction about the cultural enrichment that the Sri Lankan community has brought to Tooting and London, as well as the regeneration to which it has contributed. What impact do those press reports have on community cohesion, if labels about the Tamil community are so easily thrown around?</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/2">Colleagues have referred to atrocities in Sri Lanka, and they are right that the blame rests with all parties&mdash;there is no single party that can be completely exonerated. However, we must not ignore the fact that impartial international organisations objectively confirm the atrocities that have been committed. The UN working group on disappearances commented in December 2005 that</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/3" class="indent">&quot;of more than 12,278 cases of disappearances in Sri Lanka submitted to the government, 5,708 remain unclarified and this is the highest number of disappearances in the world next to the case of Iraq with 16,517 disappearances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/4">The problem of internally displaced persons and refugees has been mentioned by many of my colleagues. The Tamil-speaking population of Sri Lanka has, by percentage, one of the highest rates of internally displaced people in the world today. Most of them have been bombed out of a number of locations. Most estimates show that more than one third of the remaining Tamil-speaking population on the island are displaced and living in makeshift camps and welfare centres. In addition, many others have recently fled to India, which has already had hundreds of thousands of refugees from past periods of the conflict and from the tsunami.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/5">The Tamil diaspora represents one third of the Tamils from Sri Lanka and now numbers over 1 million persons. The camps for the IDPs are in deplorable condition, owing to lack of food, water, sanitation, medical care, schooling and adequate shelter. Some of the IDPs are housed in schools, making the schools for those local communities unusable. In a moving contribution, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" name="Paul Murphy">the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>, the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, mentioned the impact that visiting the IDPs had had upon him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/6">In its report in December 2005 the United Nations committee against torture commented on the atrocities in Sri Lanka, and in March 2006 the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial executions submitted a powerful report. Finally in relation to independent corroboration, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated clearly and unequivocally in December 2006, in a powerful report that I recommend to all colleagues:</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/7" class="indent">&quot;There is an urgent need for the international community to monitor the human rights situation in Sri Lanka as these are not merely ceasefire violations, but grave breaches of international human rights and humanitarian law . . . In the latest phase of its ethnic conflict, now more than 20 years old, Sri Lanka has witnessed a re-emergence of some of its most frightening ghosts: disappearances, abductions and killings by unidentified gunmen.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/8">In Tooting, the White Pigeon charity, which does a tremendous amount of invaluable work in Sri Lanka, tells me that a few weeks ago White Pigeon's prosthetic technical workshop was bombed and destroyed by the air force in the Mullaitivu district. The charity also tells me that the ongoing daily bombing by the air force is adding many new physical disabilities to the people with whom it works in the Tamil communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/9">I am told by the Tamil rehabilitation organisation in Tooting that there are 160,000 people whom it is helping who have no food and lack water and shelter. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> spoke about the A9 road, which is a main road into the northern province that has been blocked since August 2006. The blockage has prevented clothes, medicine and food from getting to people in Jaffna.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/10">The UK and Sri Lanka have a special historical relationship. Until 1948, Sri Lanka was part of the British empire, and since 1948 and Sri Lanka's independence, it has been part of the Commonwealth. Sri Lanka also has a special relationship with the Labour party. It was a Labour Government who gave Sri Lanka its independence. We have a special role to play in helping Sri Lanka in its current troubles. I call on my Government to use our special relationship to persuade all the parties and factions to recommit to the 2002 agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/11">I agree that terrorism and violence, whether state-sponsored or not, can never be the way to achieve a negotiated solution in Sri Lanka or elsewhere. I am aware that the work that my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen has done and will continue to do may lead the way to progress being made. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister confirmed that any advice and help that we can give, based on our experiences in Northern Ireland, will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/12">The international players must square a circle, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> commented. Although they accept that extensive autonomy for the north-east is the only realistic basis for a sustainable peace, they do not wish to reward the LTTE for its actions over the past few years. Once again, there are lessons that can be learned not only from Northern Ireland, but perhaps from South Africa. I am pleased that the Home Office has looked again at how we treated asylum seekers, and I welcome the fact that Sri Lanka has at last been taken off the white list of safe countries. Its inclusion in the list was causing my constituents and those of other hon. Members huge problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.3/13">An early return to negotiations is crucial. I ask our Government to continue to use all the levers, public and private, at their disposal to alleviate the suffering of all the Sri Lankan people, so that peace and tranquillity can return to this beautiful island once again.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1578.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" speakername="Peter Luff" colnum="1578"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0014.htm#07050240001145">
	<p pid="a.1578.0/1">It is a great privilege, Madam Deputy Speaker, to be called to speak in this debate, which is on a very important subject. It would be possible to take the Panglossian view that the affairs of Sri Lanka have no impact on us and are a matter of local concern for that country on which we can turn our backs, but that would be not only immoral, but blinkered. I therefore welcome this debate and I congratulate the Minister on the tone in which he opened it. I was particularly moved by the speech made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" name="Paul Murphy">the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>, whom I wish every success in his work. I was also impressed by the tone struck by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, who spoke for the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/2">What always concerns me in such debates is where we should strike the balance between what it is right and proper for the British Parliament to say, and where matters must be left to local populations to determine for themselves. I am thinking, for example, of the parallel debate about Kashmir&mdash;a matter that I am convinced must be left to the Pakistani and Indian Governments to resolve for themselves, and on which it is wrong for us to start prescribing solutions. I am nervous about some of what has been said in this debate so far today. I am not even sure that the Liberal Democrats are right to have gone as far as they have done in prescribing a solution. The people of Sri Lanka must have the opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/3">In that context, I fully support the calls that have been made for dialogue, which is clearly an important part of the process, as we saw in Northern Ireland. This period has, however, been an extraordinarily violent one in Sri Lanka's history. There have been some 4,000 dead since 2005 and 70,000 or so dead since the violence began in 1983. To put that in context, leaving Iraq on one side, about 7,000 deaths a year occur in the world because of terrorist-related activities. One can see how big an issue the violence is in international terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/4">I intervened on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> to inquire about the LTTE's commitment to democracy. Perhaps I did not explain myself clearly. I have severe reservations about whether the LTTE is seriously committed to a democratic process. Its leader is on the record as wanting to establish a one-party independent Tamil state without democratic elections. I see in the LTTE an organisation that is led by a very dangerous individual whose techniques and ruthlessness have caused great concern. Although I share the views expressed by all hon. and right hon. Members in saying that dialogue is important, I question whether the LTTE is an organisation that is capable of holding such dialogue. I hope that I am wrong; I would like to be so. In an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold, I pointed out that our deputy high commissioner in Sri Lanka will tomorrow be engaging in dialogue with the political wing of the LTTE. I hope that that dialogue is profitable and constructive, but I worry about what we are dealing with in the LTTE. It is a sophisticated and well equipped organisation, uniquely so for a terrorist organisation&mdash;and I regard it as a terrorist organisation that can fight on land, on sea and in the air, although it is wrong to describe it as having an air force; I think that there is one light aircraft<i> &mdash;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am told that there are five aircraft, but they have significantly enhanced its fighting capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/5">Unless the conflict in Sri Lanka is dealt with, not only will it place an intolerable burden on the people of that war-torn country, but there will be a danger that the LTTE's techniques will act as an inspiration for other so-called freedom fighters elsewhere in the world and other terrorist groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/6">I am also nervous about the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold about the role of the Indian Government in the dispute. We have been very careful about involving India in this matter. I have in my hands a map from the Tamil Nadu Liberation Front. It is a map of greater Tamil Nadu, which of course takes into its compass most of the southern states of India, as well as north and east Sri Lanka. We remember what happened last time India involved itself, in a military sense, in the affairs of Sri Lanka&mdash;it led to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.</p>

	<p pid="a.1580.0/1">Of course, that is a geopolitical point that one cannot argue with. However, India has to play its cards with great care. It will find it difficult, for similar reasons to those that often make it difficult for Britain to intervene in post-colonial situations. In a way, the dispute has its roots in the British colonial handling of this troubled island.</p>

	<p pid="a.1580.1/1">We all recognise that India's involvement in this problem is very sensitive, as well as what happened in the past when it became involved militarily. Nevertheless, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1652" name="Mike Gapes">the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes)</phrase> pointed out, there is a big Tamil population in Tamil Nadu, and there is a suspicion that a lot of support of one kind or another, particularly financial, comes from that state. if we are to try to defeat this terrorist problem, it is important that the international community should include the Indian Government in discussions and intelligence-sharing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1581.2/1">My intervention on the right hon. Member for Torfaen about proscription was important. The Sri Lankan Government encouraged him to talk to senior representatives of LTTE and the Tamil community. If such peace negotiations can take place in Sri Lanka, it is much easier. When organisations are not proscribed, it is easier for a peace process to take place.</p>

	<p pid="a.1581.5/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. It is vital that both sides take courageous steps to achieve the ceasefire that we all crave. I have no axe to grind except that, when I hear of a death in the name of politics, I am angry. I worry that today we have heard criticism of the Sri Lankan Government for closing roads to the north and east of the country, thus inhibiting reconstruction after the dreadful tsunami. My reading of the behaviour of the LTTE in those areas is that it, too, inhibits reconstruction. It suits such a group to keep people in some subjugation and blame others for their misfortune. That is a familiar technique of tyrants through the ages. Although I deplore any action by the Sri Lankan Government that makes reconstruction more difficult, the LTTE inhibits the process, and that may suit its political objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1581.5/2">I want to emphasise my concern about human rights more broadly in Sri Lanka. I referred to the Human Rights Watch document, which&mdash;as far as I can see&mdash;sets out objectively and fairly the problems on both sides. It is a powerful account. I note that the Archbishop of Canterbury is visiting Sri Lanka next week. The Christian community in that country suffers considerable persecution at the hands of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1581.5/3">The current edition of the Foreign Office human rights report mentions Sri Lanka's anti-conversion laws and moves</p>
	<p pid="a.1581.5/4" class="indent">&quot; to consolidate the position of Buddhism by constitutional amendment and legislation that would control 'unethical conversion', in part through criminal sanctions. The bill, which appears to undermine the guarantees of religious freedom enshrined in the Sri Lankan constitution and to be inconsistent with Sri Lanka's international human rights obligations, is still being debated.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1581.5/5">Things may have moved on since the report was written. It continues by saying that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1581.5/6" class="indent">&quot;there have been consistent and credible reports of harassment, intimidation, destruction of property and occasional violence against Christians over the last three years... Sri Lankan authorities' lack of capacity to protect Christians and members of other faiths, and their failure to prosecute those responsible for inciting and committing violent acts&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1581.5/7">are highlighted. That is an especially worrying example of human rights abuses in Sri Lanka that are firmly at the door of the Sri Lankan Government. For even-handedness, we must understand that there are problems on both sides.</p>
	<p pid="a.1581.5/8">We must be careful about imposing&mdash;or being seen to or wishing to impose&mdash;specific solutions to any internal conflict in a sovereign state from these Benches in the United Kingdom. However, we need to convey a clear message that terror begets only terror, and violence begets violence. That is an iron rule of politics and history. In a world hungry for peace, as we all are now, it is my view that if the LTTE could bring itself to renounce its terrorist activities and take the first brave steps to peace, it would find that respectability would follow remarkably quickly on the heels of such a brave and right decision.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1582.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" speakername="Keith Vaz" colnum="1582"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0014.htm#07050240001158">
	<p pid="a.1582.0/1">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> because of his great interest in sub-continent matters. It always interesting to hear what he has to say about countries other than India, which he has a particular interest in. I did not agree with everything in his contribution and in my contribution I will explain where I disagree. What is significant, however, is that for the first time we are debating these issues in Parliament today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/2">Had it not been the eve of local elections in other parts of the country&mdash;other than London&mdash;the Chamber would probably not have a majority of London Members in their places. I realise that many members of the Tamil community live within London and the M25 area, but they also live in other parts of the country&mdash;Leicester being one where many members of the Tamil community have settled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/3">I want to pay a special tribute to the Minister for the Middle East. This date was originally chosen for a discussion between him and more than 60 MPs who had shown an interest in Sri Lankan issues, particularly in what is happening to the Tamil community. I think that he was surprised at the level of interest and he decided, of his own volition, to put to the Leader of the House the view that there should be a debate today. That has proved to be a much better way of dealing with these matters&mdash;having an open debate involving as many MPs as possible on the Floor of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/4">The Minister for the Middle East is, in my view, a special and exceptional Foreign Office Minister&mdash;not the usual type that we get. He is prepared&mdash;I have seen him operate&mdash;to listen to views without necessarily taking the Foreign Office line. On this issue, he has been particularly concerned to listen to the views of hon. Members, to understand them and to relate them to his own experience when he visited Sri Lanka. I thank him for his special interest. His remit is so large, as he has to look after at least a third of the world&mdash;he would probably say the most interesting third of the world. On the two issues where I have engaged with him&mdash;Yemen and Sri Lanka&mdash;he has been very forthright and listened very carefully to what I said. I thank him for his interest in what is happening there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/5">I also pay tribute to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" name="Paul Murphy">the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>. In all my discussions with members of the British Tamil community, I have found that they are full of praise for the work that he has done. As we heard today, he has not taken sides on the issues, but has focused the British Government on a particular problem. I am grateful&mdash;and I think that we are all grateful&mdash;for the fact that he has brought to bear his vast experience of Northern Ireland, which must have been just as complicated as the situation in Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/6">Apart from his day job, which he mentioned, he has allowed himself to go over to Sri Lanka in order to be the eyes and ears of our Prime Minister and to report back on these issues. I hope that we can formalise his role. He may not want that, but I think that it would be a good idea if the Government looked to formalise his role so that it was no longer just on an ad hoc basis. He could be given formal envoy status, which would allow him to play the role that we all would like to see this Parliament get involved with.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/7">On Monday, we established the House's first ever all-party Tamil group. I was privileged to be elected chair of the group; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> was elected vice-chair; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1522" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> was elected secretary; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> was elected treasurer, as was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2002" name="Angus Robertson">the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase>, in his absence in Scotland. That shows that it really is an all-party group, because all parties are represented in this cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/8">The group was determined not to be just like any other all-party group. We were determined to take the issue forward, and on that basis we agreed three things. First, at the end of September a delegation of all party members should visit Sri Lanka, particularly areas under the control of the Tamil Tigers, to engage in a dialogue in a positive and constructive way. We also agreed to invite the chief negotiator for the Tamil Tigers to visit the United Kingdom and to come to Parliament so that we could hear his views on what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/9">The third thing that we agreed was to hold a summit meeting here in July at which all the various parties could participate as a means of exploring how to take the issue forward. Although we have not had a debate of this kind in the House before, listening to the experience of so many right hon. Members and hon. Members reminds me that we have had many such discussions outside Parliament. It really is time to make progress, rather than simply discussing these issues from time to time as we do now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/10">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> pointed out that we are also concerned with the Tamil community here, and that that is what drives us. Many of us are interested in foreign affairs, but what drives us as constituency MPs is our constituents coming to see us in our surgeries, at public meetings and at various projects in our constituencies to point out the contribution that the British Tamil community has made. When my hon. Friend mentioned the Tooting Tamils, I thought that that made them sound so British that they could be a local football club. They are as British as you and I, Madam Deputy Speaker, and they make a full contribution to this country. They contribute to the economy and to the national health service, as the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire pointed out. Almost 2,500 Tamils work in the NHS, not just as GPs and other doctors; one of the leading pre-natal surgeons is based in a hospital in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/11">The British Tamils have become first-class contributors, and they therefore deserve to have us debate these issues in the House. For the reasons mentioned earlier by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, they are constantly aware of what is happening to their friends and relatives in Sri Lanka. That is why they deserve to hear these issues discussed, and to have them taken forward, rather than just discussed in the usual parliamentary way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/12">I was present at a very useful meeting that the British Tamil Forum had with our Home Secretary, who reminded us of the phrase&mdash;I cannot remember who said it originally, but I am sure that someone here will know&mdash;&quot;One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter&quot;. I am sure that it was not the Home Secretary's phrase; he was merely reminding us of it. This was in the context of a discussion on how to lift the ban. I firmly believe that the ban on the Tamil Tigers&mdash;certainly as regards the way in which they operate in this country&mdash;should be lifted as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/13">The proscription by the Government of various organisations in 2001 happened because of certain events that were occurring worldwide at the time, and we reacted by imposing that ban on a number of organisations, including a Sikh organisation that operated from my constituency. I know that Governments sometimes have to react in a knee-jerk manner, but six years have now passed and it is time to reconsider the ban and to look at ways in which we can help to ensure that the dialogue proceeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/14">I know that that is different from what the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire suggested, because he believes that we cannot hold discussions with people unless they renounce violence. As we have heard from colleagues on both sides of the House, however, without such discussions we would never have reached the stage at which we could look with mild amusement at a photograph of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1375" name="Ian Paisley">the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)</phrase> and Martin McGuinness&mdash;with EU President Barroso in the middle&mdash;sharing a joke. Other right hon. and hon. Members who have had to sit through debates on Northern Ireland, as have I, would never have believed that possible even a few years ago. However, thanks to the work of my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen and many others, it has become possible. It is possible to move on, but we cannot move on unless we have a dialogue, and we cannot have a dialogue if we proscribe and ban the groups involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.1586.5/1">The hon. Gentleman is allowed to make a correction, but not another speech in the middle of mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.5/2">We have heard the shocking statistics, and it is right that we should repeat them again and again: 80,000 internally displaced people; 900,000 children, 15 per cent. of the total child population, living in conflict-affected areas, and more than 300,000 directly affected by the conflict. The figures have varied between different Members' speeches, but I have been given the figure of 68,000 lives claimed by the war since 1983, with 4,000 deaths since November 2005, and, according to the United Nations, more than 300,000 civilians displaced by the renewed fighting as of April 2007. We need to take account of those shocking statistics if we are to make progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.5/3">Yesterday the Sri Lankan President unveiled proposals to abolish the executive presidency, adopt a bicameral parliamentary system and ensure that both the police and the armed forces are more multi-ethnic. That, however, does not deal with the basic problems that have created the present difficulties. All ethic groups should be treated equally, and they and their values should be respected. I hope that those proposals signal a change, but I do not think that the change will happen unless we move it forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.5/4">I mentioned the Tamil Tigers and the ban that we imposed on them. I hope very much that the LTTE will be able to challenge that ban. When we met the Home Secretary he said that one challenge had been successful, so they are in new territory, but they certainly have my support in their desire for a lifting of the ban. We heard that the Minister would be visiting Sri Lanka, and that is terrific.</p>

	<p pid="a.1589.1/1">I am grateful for that contribution. It could be said that we have both angles covered, as the Norwegians are independent but they are also co-sponsors who have the support and assistance of the EU, the USA and Japan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1589.1/2">If the Sri Lankan army is considering an extra push in the north-east of the island, that is a worrying development as it will lead to further suffering and loss of life. If the advances are resumed, it is likely that the LTTE will wish to reply in kind, and it could be years before there is a reduction in the violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1589.1/3">Meanwhile the LTTE has started making deadly air strikes on both Government troops and the infrastructure of Colombo. There have recently been strikes on an oil depot and on the main airport in the capital city, timed to coincide with the cricket world cup final. The Foreign Office website describes the situation in Sri Lanka as &quot;no peace no war&quot;, but the brutal reality is that since the 2002 ceasefire the conflict has resumed and is in danger of escalating to a much greater scale. The ceasefire needs to be rekindled and the international community must make every effort to secure it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1589.1/4">Britain has a historical connection, of course, with Sri Lanka, and we should do whatever we can to bring peace to the island. I am mindful, however, that some former colonies are wary of British involvement in their now independent countries, which is why our involvement should be handled with sensitivity, helping as is necessary and appropriate. The Norwegians, operating with the support of the USA, Japan and the European Union, successfully negotiated the February 2002 ceasefire. They deserve our utmost praise and respect, and we should offer them all the support that they need and want from us. The ceasefire may have collapsed, but to the Norwegians' credit they have continued to maintain good links with both sides in the conflict, which may lead to further peace proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1589.1/5">We should also use our position in the international arena to encourage other countries to press both sides for peace. Britain has considerable influence in the United Nations by virtue of being a permanent member of the Security Council. Although we might sometimes have disagreements with our European Union counterparts, we still have influence in the Union. Nor should we forget our many friends in the Commonwealth, who should also be urged to press for peace.</p>
	<p pid="a.1589.1/6">India, too, has a major role to play in this conflict, not least because of its proximity to Sri Lanka and its own large Tamil population in Tamil Nadu. As India heads toward becoming a 21st-century superpower, it is important that it be included in the peace negotiations because of its own vested interest and its global and regional influence, which is increasing daily.</p>

	<p pid="a.1591.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that as the Under-Secretary of State for International Development will reply to the debate it might be an opportunity for him to state that the British Government, working with the various non-governmental organisations in the area, are making forceful representations to reopen the blockaded road? As the hon. Gentleman said, the impact is devastating and is destroying communities that have historically been well-to-do, but are now in absolute poverty and dire crisis.</p>

	<p pid="a.1591.2/1">I bring to this debate no expertise, and I have not been fortunate enough to have a holiday in Sri Lanka. However, I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, who has set up the all-party group, and I hope and trust that I will be able to participate in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/2">Like many other hon. Members who have spoken in the debate, a very significant number of my constituents arrived in this country as asylum seekers and refugees from Sri Lanka. They now belong to the Tamil community that thrives in Lewisham, and in my constituency of Lewisham, Deptford in particular. As others have said, the families are settled British citizens, and they bring a great sense of commerce and endeavour to our communities. They not only run petrol stations but convenience shops, and play various roles in the NHS and the IT industry. Members of the Tamil community make an extremely valued contribution, and I very much support their work. They also bring a sense of culture to my area, which I especially enjoy. I should like to mention Vani fine arts, where young children are taught to play the sitar. It is the most wonderful experience to be at one of their concerts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/3">However, the Tamil community has a great and continuing sense of grievance, and members of it have made me aware of that for the two decades that I have represented the area in this House. In that time, I have seen blood-curdling films of the terrible atrocities committed against Tamils in Sri Lanka, and I have sometimes felt completely unable to suggest any way out of that terrible conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/4">My feeling about the situation in Sri Lanka was the same as that I felt about Northern Ireland for many years. As a mere politician, I felt that I could not propose a way forward, but the breakthrough that came in 2002 was a great relief to the Tamils in this country. Sri Lanka is a place of great diversity, and the news that a peace process was under way was appreciated by people of many faiths.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/5">For quite a while, no political meetings were held in my constituency to discuss the situation in Sri Lanka. On looking back, and having read the excellent paper produced by the Library, it is clear that Sri Lanka has a history of absolute discrimination, with the minority being oppressed by the majority ever since independence. That oppression is so deep-rooted that, as with our experience with Northern Ireland, the beginning of a peace process is not seen as likely to produce a result in a short time. If the Sri Lankan Government had been more determined and committed to the peace process, or if the LTTE had shown more flexibility, it is possible that more success could have been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/6">I was therefore very distressed and alarmed when last summer the Tamil community in my area asked for another political meeting to discuss the appalling outbreaks of violence that had taken place. I went to that meeting, and heard about the many grievances that people had. I also heard the horror stories about what people in Jaffna had suffered. There was a lack of food and medicine in the city, and people who previously had been entirely self-sufficient were now relying on people from Britain to get to them the drugs, money and so on that they needed. It is a matter of enormous concern to me, as it is to all Members who have contributed today, that the violence has continued to escalate and to add to the terrible toll of previous decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/7">It would appear that the hardliners on both sides are now in the ascendancy. I have been reading the catalogue of events that took place between January and April. The army has made significant progress in the east. Many towns and villages that were controlled by the LTTE are apparently now under the administration of the Karuna faction, which Human Rights Watch has alleged continues to recruit child soldiers, like its erstwhile allies in the LTTE. Defence expenditure, in a country that can hardly afford it, reportedly rose by 30 per cent. in 2006. The LTTE's capacity to retaliate has not entirely diminished, either. In recent weeks, as we have heard, it has shown that it has acquired some air capability by launching two aircraft attacks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/8">I shall repeat what many colleagues have said today. Recent estimates suggest that about 4,000 more people have been killed in Sri Lanka since late 2005, bringing the total killed since the outbreak of the civil war to 68,000. In addition, many people have suffered injuries that will affect the rest of their lives, and tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes and are no longer able to carry on a normal existence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/9">We are all grateful for the Norwegian-led peace efforts and I pay tribute to them. It is incredibly important that the Norwegians stay in Sri Lanka and that they do not take sides. It is also important that both sides in the conflict&mdash;the Government and the LTTE&mdash;have said that they would be willing to return to negotiations, although in truth we do not see that there is much prospect of that at the moment. That is why we all encourage the efforts of the UK Government, and particularly those of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" name="Paul Murphy">the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/10">I want to ask Ministers some questions that have been put to me by my constituents. I asked one in a formal parliamentary question last year about aid following the tsunami. In October, I received a detailed reply from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development about the amount of aid and where and on what it was to be disbursed. I hope that in his winding-up speech he will tell us how that aid was distributed. As others have said, it is critically important for us to know that the aid was distributed fairly to the people most in need and that aid destined for Tamil areas was not impeded by the Government or the LTTE. I hope my hon. Friend can give us some assurance about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.2/11">A point made by one my constituents was that we should not supply aid at all in the prevailing situation in Sri Lanka. I disagree with that view, so I hope my hon. Friend can tell the House why it is important that we continue to give aid and that the aid is&mdash;we hope&mdash;used effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.1597.0/1">I am extremely pleased that we have had this debate this afternoon, as it is a long, long time since there was a debate on Sri Lanka in the House. Like many other hon. Members who have come to the Chamber to take part, I have a very significant number of Tamil constituents who, over the years, have talked to me about their concerns about the situation in Sri Lanka. Of course, it is a long-standing problem, and in its present form, the violence goes back over 20 years. The serious violence that occurred in 1983 was one of the factors that led to many members of the Tamil community coming to this country. There have been periods of hope, and as a result of the good work of the Norwegian Government there have been ceasefires. The ceasefire that was put in place in 2002 with high hopes clearly has not lasted and is in serious trouble.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.0/2">I shall not labour the points that have already been made&mdash;that the only way a solution will be reached is through negotiation, and that that must involve the LTTE. There is no question about that. A solution will not be reached without negotiations that involve the LTTE. That is true whether that organisation is recognised or banned in the UK. Reference has been made to keeping lines of communication open. I think it is not particularly helpful that the LTTE is banned, although I am under no illusion about some of the things that it has done and still does, such as the involvement of child soldiers, about which we have heard. I have met people and I know members of the Tamil community in the UK who are here as refugees because of the LTTE. There are two sides to the story.</p>

	<p pid="a.1598.1/1">That message is right. If we look back at the history of Northern Ireland over the years, we could find some examples where we did not behave according to conventions, but it did not do us any good when that happened. That is the message that must be put across.</p>
	<p pid="a.1598.1/2">I have been labelled an LTTE supporter in the past, and been told that I was supporting terrorists. I am well aware of things that the organisation has done that I do not approve of. I am convinced, as I am sure are other hon. Members, that money is being raised in this country which goes to the LTTE. Whether or not the story about the petrol stations is true, I am sure that I am not the only person who has heard the stories of taxing, whereby people are more or less required to contribute money. That happens, and let us not be under any illusion or pretend that it does not. The bottom line, however, is that there will be no settlement and solution unless the LTTE is involved in developing them and in the negotiations. The Tamil politicians in Sri Lanka, and the Members of Parliament who are members of the Tamil National Alliance, which I know is sometimes described as an LTTE proxy, but comprises elected Members of Parliament, will say exactly that&mdash;that the LTTE is the body that represents the view of the majority of Tamils.</p>
	<p pid="a.1598.1/3">There has been long-standing evidence of the disregard for human rights in Sri Lanka to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> drew attention, and the failure to live up to basic human rights standards. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, whom my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> quoted, has made the same point. The commission that has been established to look into extra-judicial killings and disappearances is welcome, but concerns have been expressed that there are shortcomings in the national legal system that could hamper the commission's effectiveness. Previous commissions have made recommendations, but they have not been put into effect. The commission should be looking not only at individual responsibilities for acts that may be regarded as crimes, but at the broader patterns and the context in which such acts occur. It is no good merely looking at the individual case if nothing then happens to change the overall context.</p>
	<p pid="a.1598.1/4">The overall context at the moment is extremely worrying. There is no question but that there has been very serious deterioration in the situation over the past year or so. Relief organisations are expressing concern, and the Red Cross has recently told us that there are up to 120,000 displaced civilians in the Batticaloa district. Just in the past week or two, more than 40,000 people have fled their homes in that district. We have heard the claims about restrictions on humanitarian provision, as the A9 road has been closed, which is preventing essential medicines and humanitarian aid from getting through. Human Rights Watch and others have expressed concern that the Sri Lankan authorities are using threats and intimidation to compel civilians who fled recent fighting to return home when it is far from safe for them to do so. Those are not the actions that one would expect from a Government; one would not expect anybody to be forced to return home when they feel it is unsafe to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1598.1/5">As to what can be done, I understand perfectly well that we as a Government are not in a position to dictate solutions to the Governments of any other countries. The solution will be achieved in the end through negotiation and through the people of that country, the LTTE and its Government. I was interested to hear what my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" name="Paul Murphy">the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)</phrase> and the Minister had to say about the initiatives that are being taken, in which we can export experience. It is also perfectly legitimate for us to express our opinions on the initiatives that are being suggested. I have read the recent reports about the devolution proposals unveiled by the Sri Lanka Freedom party. It seemed to me that the proposals were highly unlikely to lead to a solution. In fact, they will probably be regarded as a step backward, as they implied devolution of power at a very local level, rather than any significant devolution of power that would give any real autonomy to a region or province. The proposals seem a step backward in respect of some of the suggestions made a few years ago, and it would not be helpful to the peace process if they were pursued. It is not for me to say what the detail of any solution should be, but it will not last if it does not give a significant degree of autonomy to the north and east provinces&mdash;the parts of the country with very significant Tamil populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1598.1/6">We must carry on with the initiatives that the Minister talked about in his opening remarks. We must offer our experience and support, but send a clear and consistent message to both sides&mdash;the Government and the LTTE&mdash;that there is not a military solution to this problem. I am worried about the attitude of the Sri Lankan military, who seem to think that they are on the way to crushing the LTTE and that just another push will do it. If that is their mindset, I am afraid that things will get far worse than they are now. That is the important message that we have to send.</p>

It is absolutely crucial that we send a message from this House that we are jointly resolved on the need to put pressure on the Sri Lankan Government, particularly as regards their growing view that there could be a military solution to this problem.

	<p pid="a.1600.0/2">Sri Lanka has often appeared to me to be the forgotten tragedy in the world. We hear a great deal about theatres of war such as Darfur and Zimbabwe&mdash;of course, they are appalling&mdash;but Sri Lanka has been going on, like a running sore, for many years. It has not received the attention that it deserves from this House&mdash;that is why I welcome this debate, which has been partly stimulated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, and congratulate the Government on holding it. This subject has also been forgotten by the British media, and I hope that the BBC and Fleet street will give it the coverage that it deserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.0/3">Like other Members, I come to this debate as a constituency MP having listened to my Tamil constituents' concerns over many years. In engaging with them, we have the wonderful experience of learning about the Tamil culture and seeing how Tamils contribute so positively to British society. One of the highlights of my year is going to Kingston's Institute of Tamil Culture and seeing the children play their instruments, dance, sing and tell jokes in Tamil&mdash;I get them translated for me. Sometimes it goes on for rather a long time, but it is always very enjoyable. When we engage with them properly and listens to their concerns, we hear stories of tragedies. When I have spoken to them at political meetings, I have always taken the view that we should approach this on a human rights basis, with equality across the communities. Like the hon. Member for Walthamstow, I have been accused of being an LTTE sympathiser, but I reject that utterly. I have always tried to take a balanced approach. The idea that in this House and in this country we can suggest a solution that we can somehow impose on people is clearly nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.0/4">When we talk to Tamil constituents and say that we want to take a balanced, human rights approach, we cannot help but feel their anger, frustration and pain, because they have families who have been killed, they have seen killings themselves, and they look at communities of theirs that have been devastated by the violence. It is impossible, as a constituency MP, not to listen to those stories, and not to share their concern and anger.</p>

	<p pid="a.1603.1/1">I totally agree with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.1/2">Sri Lanka has the potential to be one of the powerhouses of Asia, and the world. Just three decades ago, it was held up as a model society. Professor Amartya Sen used to write in glowing terms that here was&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;a socialist economy and society that had managed to reduce infant mortality, improve literacy and achieve many other key indicators of human progress. Sri Lanka had done a tremendous job. However, the strife that we have seen over the last 30 years has, unfortunately, seen the society go backwards and social progress reversed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.1/3">I am sure that those achievements can be regained&mdash;but what it will take to do that is peace. It will take Governments such as ours and the European Union putting even more pressure than they have hitherto on both parts of the island to come together. The biggest aid package that we could ever give to the island would be to help it to promote peace. It would no longer need our support or aid&mdash;it is more than capable of becoming prosperous by itself, without a pound of aid&mdash;if we helped it to restore peace. I am delighted to see that a Minister from the Department for International Development is to respond to the debate, and I hope that his Department, working with the Foreign Office, can give Sri Lanka that aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.1/4">When the tsunami occurred, I hoped that it would help to stimulate peace and reconciliation, because the response to it was building on the ceasefire agreement that had been working, particularly under Prime Minister Wickramasinghe. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Some of the negative voices from the old Kumaratunga regime, and subsequently from the Rajapakse regime, had their way, and we have seen a deterioration in the situation ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.1/5">When we were considering how individual MPs and communities in this country could help, one project that I was delighted to support was the fish and ships scheme. Many fishermen had lost their boats, and their livelihoods, as a result of the tsunami, but some British people living in Sri Lanka got together with the fishermen and the communities and said, &quot;If we supply you with ships and get you contracts with British supermarkets for your fish, that will help to revive your economy.&quot; And that has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.1/6">If we help people in such ways, Sri Lanka can be a wonderful place again. But there is a precondition: peace. Let us not wait another five or 10 years before the House again debates this issue and puts pressure on the Government to do more. Let us keep coming back to the subject again and again, because the cause of peace in Sri Lanka deserves our attention, and deserves to be one of the key issues to which we pay attention.</p>

	<p pid="a.1604.0/1">First, I should like to apologise for not being here for the opening speeches. This debate started earlier than expected, and I was chairing a Select Committee evidence session on Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/2">I am speaking in two capacities: as the MP representing a constituency with a large Sri Lankan Tamil community and as the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I am in an unfortunate position, in that the Committee is publishing a report on south Asia on Friday, but it is embargoed so I cannot quote from it&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>Yes, I am holding it in my hand. I can at least refer to the evidence. The report examines the whole regional context, but we have of course touched on the serious situation in Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/3">Before I refer to the report, however, I should like to place on record the fact that I agree with most of the contributions that I have heard today, and certainly with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> said about the cultural contribution of the Tamil community. We have a chariot festival in Ilford every year, and the community contains temples and prosperous businesses. The area of my constituency around Ley street has become a centre of the Tamil community, enriching and enlivening the cultural life of the borough of Redbridge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/4">Given the contribution that most Tamil people in the UK make, it is tragic that many of them are suffering grievously because of what is happening to their relatives and friends in Sri Lanka. A letter was faxed to me two days ago in which one of my constituents says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/5" class="indent">&quot;I am deeply grieved at the deplorable state of affairs at the moment, especially the disappearance of innocent civilians. A pathetic state of affairs, indeed, for an agreement which once looked so promising, but five years since it came into effect, the Ceasefire Agreement is almost defunct.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.0/6">I could go on. Other Members have reported many similar things. The sad thing is that the hope for the co-operation that might have resulted following the terrible tsunami, and the possibility of building on the ceasefire agreement have clearly gone backwards. In the past few months, we have all no doubt received from our constituents pictures of the consequences of the air raids and the bombing of civilian areas, and of people who have died in many parts of Sri Lanka. At the same time, terrorist actions and criminal activities are going on, and the population in many areas is suffering grievously as a result.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1605.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1652" speakername="Mike Gapes" colnum="1605"  time="018:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0018.htm#07050240001201">
	<p pid="a.1605.0/1">I agree. We also need to support all the international institutions, the UN processes that have been mentioned, the attempts made by individual Governments, and the attempt of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1880" name="Paul Murphy">the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>, whom I had the great pleasure of serving as Parliamentary Private Secretary during the Northern Ireland peace negotiations when the Labour Government were first elected. Nobody could be better qualified to try to assist the process in Sri Lanka, but I wish him luck, because the complexities of the politics in Sri Lanka are even worse than those in Northern Ireland. Therefore, no easy solution can be reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.1605.0/2">The violence has had an enormous economic impact, as has been mentioned. Sri Lanka's growth and economic development has been held back, and its once successful tourist industry has been harmed&mdash;it would be harmed even more if the BBC were to give some coverage to the appalling situation in Sri Lanka. Our media do not give the conflict in Sri Lanka the coverage that some other conflicts receive. Some of my constituents who demonstrated outside the House of Commons a few months ago were enraged that the hundreds of people complaining about the human rights situation in Sri Lanka received no coverage whatever. It is interesting to ask why. The reason might be the malign role of the LTTE and the image that it gives the community. I am an advocate not of the LTTE, but of my constituents and those who have suffered from the terrible things going on in their country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1605.0/3">Reference has been made to the number of people in refugee camps, the internally displaced people and the refugees who have gone all over the world in the Tamil diaspora. Human rights abuses have been committed on both sides. Many people in Sri Lanka today have suffered as a result of the recruitment of children into terrorist organisations. From evidence given by Human Rights Watch to our Committee and information from other sources, it has become clear that the Karuna faction, which was previously with the LTTE and has gone across to fight on behalf of the Sri Lankan Government, has been recruiting children for its forces and carrying out terrible crimes. The LTTE has also recruited children, and the tactic has been used in the conflict for many years. That is completely against all the international norms and conventions, and we need to denounce that loudly and press for the practice to end.</p>
	<p pid="a.1605.0/4">As has been mentioned, the Norwegians have tried hard to get a political solution over the years. But the situation today requires renewed international efforts. Along with the efforts of our Ministers and my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen, I hope that the Government of India will use whatever influence they have. We must bear in mind the sensitivities, especially given that a Prime Minister of India was assassinated as a result of involvement in the Sri Lankan conflict. Politicians in India might therefore be a bit wary of getting too involved. Nevertheless, if India aspires to be a regional power and player, and certainly if it aspires to a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, it has a role to play in thinking more about how it might assist in achieving a solution to the conflict on the island to its south.</p>

	<p pid="a.1606.0/1">I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is speaking, given that he chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee. I think I am right in saying that Sri Lanka does not feature in the report that his Committee has just produced, which deals with human rights matters around the world and covers what happened last year. Will he take the issues we have raised back to the Committee, and ensure that Sri Lanka is raised in next year's report?</p>

	<p pid="a.1606.1/1">Our human rights report did not refer to every country in the world. We tried to highlight a few instances in which we thought the Government's report was inadequate or required further comment. As we were conducting an inquiry on south Asia and would be publishing our report at about the same time, we felt that duplication was unnecessary. However, when our report is published on Friday it will contain comments about human rights in Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606.1/2">I am sure my Committee colleagues will consider what we do in future human rights reports, but I cannot commit my Committee. As the hon. Gentleman knows, it is a democratic Committee whose 14 members make collective decisions. I hope we will examine the situation in Sri Lanka in the round in the coming year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606.1/3">I believe that this conflict deserves much greater attention. I believe that there is a role for our Government and for Parliament in trying to facilitate dialogue and a political solution, but I also believe that tactics such as blowing up buses, assassinating political leaders and bombing villages cannot be excused, justified or apologised for, whoever employs them. I therefore believe that members of the various communities&mdash;the diaspora, and those in Sri Lanka&mdash;who are concerned about these issues must try to find the best way of returning to a political solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606.1/4">As other Members have said, we must get back to politics. Only politics, dialogue and negotiation will provide a solution. The slow, difficult processes in which my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen&mdash;and many other Members in all parts of the House&mdash;played a part for the many years that it took to secure agreement in Northern Ireland will be needed again in Sri Lanka. We must all maintain international support for that approach, just as we received support from the United States, the European Union and the international community.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1611.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="1611"  time="018:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0019.htm#07050240001209">
	<p pid="a.1611.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, in a little while I shall come on to deal with matters such as the fact that the President has set up all-party talks about a possible settlement offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/2">I was talking about the effects of the tsunami. By the beginning of 2006, almost all the children in the areas affected were attending school. Not surprisingly, the situation has deteriorated since then, and school attendance in the north and east is now severely affected by the security situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/3">Almost all families that were still in our camps now have access to much sturdier transitional shelter. More than 70 per cent. of families are back in their own homes, and more than 75 per cent. of people have regained their livelihoods. Moreover, progress is being made with the building of improved education and health facilities. We had anticipated that this year major infrastructure programmes would forge ahead and that the pace of progress in building permanent housing would pick up. However, Members will not be surprised to learn that the resurgence of the conflict has had serious consequences for the reconstruction effort and for development more generally, particularly in the north and east of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/4">We committed aid of about &pound;7 million immediately after the tsunami struck. About &pound;500,000 is outstanding. We set that money aside to try to help to develop the capacity of the north-east provincial council to lead the recovery process, but the money is unspent because of the impact of renewed conflict. Other money we gave is being well spent, as I saw on my visit to the Ampara district in June 2005. I visited a Tamil rehabilitation organisation camp where money we gave the Adventist development and relief agency was helping to provide water tanks and carriers for some of the 5,000 displaced families in the district.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/5">We contributed about &pound;250,000 to World Vision UK to help fund the distribution of food and basic shelter materials to more than 120,000 people in Sri Lanka. We gave aid to help the Save the Children Fund in the distribution of food, shelter, household items and water purification material to about 100,000 families across Sri Lanka, including in the north and east. We also helped to fund the UN operation in Sri Lanka. The UN led the international response to assist the Government of Sri Lanka and we helped to fund its capacity to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/6">Whatever the form of the final settlement to the ethnic conflict that is scarring Sri Lanka, it must emerge through inclusive negotiations between representatives of the different communities, as Members have said. That will mean making difficult compromises, as the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire pointed out. Some people in Sri Lanka may prefer not to make those compromises, believing that a military solution is a better option. Bluntly, as has been said in all the contributions, a military solution is not the better option. Twenty-four years of fighting in Sri Lanka have shown that neither side is capable of a total military victory. Even if a military solution were possible, a settlement imposed following a military victory would be a source of considerable resentment and future conflict; it would not have the makings of a genuinely sustainable peace.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/7">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey asked about our conversations with the Sri Lankan Government. The all-party committee initiated by President Rajapakse provides an opportunity to reach a consensus, especially among southern politicians, on what devolution might look like in the Sri Lankan context. We welcome that initiative and hope that the final proposal for devolution will be ambitious in its efforts to accommodate the aspirations of all Sri Lankans.</p>

	<p pid="a.1614.0/1">I will come on to the question of the UN and the discussions that we have been having through it. We have made it clear that access is necessary by road and sea. I take this opportunity again to urge the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka to recognise that they have a responsibility to facilitate access for humanitarian and development agencies. That is a responsibility on the Government of Sri Lanka, but it is also one that the LTTE must recognise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1614.0/2">I touched on what we as a Government have been able to do to respond to the humanitarian needs. In September last year, we contributed $1 million to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross for their response to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Sri Lanka. An assessment mission has recently returned again from Sri Lanka and we will assess the recommendations in its summary report in the next few weeks with a view to considering what else we can do to help mitigate the impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.1614.0/3">Much has been said about human rights. As a number of hon. Members have said, in areas under LTTE control, there is no tolerance of dissent or of freedom of expression. The LTTE needs to develop its role as a credible partner for peace. It cannot continue to persecute Tamils just because they have opposing views. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1683" name="Jim Dowd">the Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd)</phrase> made clear in one of his interventions early on, there have been credible reports that members of the Government security forces have been involved in extra-judicial killings and there have been repeated allegations that some civilians detained during large anti-terrorist operations have disappeared. I know of concerns from my own constituency case load, as well. It appears that anti-LTTE paramilitary groups have also been engaged in violence and intimidation. Despite promising to do so, the Government of Sri Lanka have not succeeded in preventing those armed groups from operating in Government-controlled areas. There are allegations of collusion by the security forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1614.0/4">The four leading international players in the peace process&mdash;the co-chairs&mdash;have made it clear that they believe that both parties have failed to deliver on their responsibilities in that respect, including on the commitments made at the Geneva meeting in 2006. We share that view and the concern that has been raised in the House about the serious restrictions that have been put on freedom of expression, with journalists and newspaper distribution agents being intimidated and, in some cases, killed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1617.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1717" speakername="Siobhain McDonagh" colnum="1617"  time="018:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0019.htm#07050240001217">
	<p pid="a.1617.2/1">May I start by saying that, unusually, I did not want to call for this debate, but Barclays bank has given me no choice? That is the same Barclays bank that, only weeks ago, announced record profits of &pound;7 billion. It is the same Barclays bank that paid one of its executives &pound;22 million last year alone. We all know that Barclays likes to make a killing in the City, and we congratulate it on its success, but hand-in-hand with success goes the corporate responsibility to be reasonable to customers, particularly the most vulnerable customers. I have discovered that there is a sinister side to Barclays, and I want to share it with Members this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/2">Like many Members, I write tens of thousands of letters a year on behalf of my constituents&mdash;there are thousands and thousands of names on my casework system&mdash;but I do not ask for Adjournment debates on every single case that comes along. I would only do so in extreme cases when every other effort has failed. This is such an occasion. My constituent, Mr. Aranda, first saw me at one of my advice surgeries in February. He lives very modestly in a small flat at The Beeches in Morden. Mr. Aranda is not a profligate man&mdash;he works hard and he wants the best for his family. He started a small business cleaning carpets, because he wanted to get on. He speaks very little English, and I have been dealing with him mainly through his daughter. When he came to my surgery, he had stomach cancer, and was very poorly. He was not recovering as fast as expected, and he was clearly under stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/3">Through Mr. Aranda's daughter, I found out that before his illness, he had taken out a couple of loans with his bank&mdash;Barclays. He had been a good customer of Barclays for many years, and he went to his local branch believing that it would give him a good deal. Before I go any further, I should confess that I am not usually the greatest expert on financial small print. I understand that there may be in the not too distant future a vacancy for the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer. I should like to reassure the House that I will not be applying for any such vacancy. I may struggle to decipher the small print of financial contracts, but at least I understand English. Mr Aranda does not understand English very well. Barclays sold Mr. Aranda his loans in English, and it also sold him two insurance policies to cover him in case of illness. Those policies were with Barclays Insurance Dublin.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/4">It is not clear whether Mr. Aranda would have obtained a better deal elsewhere on his loan, or whether he should have obtained his insurance with another company. It is not even clear whether the loan depended on buying insurance from Barclays in Dublin, or whether Mr. Aranda believed that he had to buy his insurance from Barclays. Nor is it clear whether Mr. Aranda should have been advised about insurance that covered all his financial commitments, including his overdraft and credit cards. It is clear, however, that Mr. Aranda was sold Barclays products in a language he barely understands, with small print that even native English speakers find confusing, by a member of staff who was under pressure to maximise sales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/5">Barclays has form when it comes to selling unnecessary financial products to confused customers. In March, the BBC broadcast the results of a nine-month investigation into its sales techniques. An undercover investigator was told by a bank trainer that he &quot;loved&quot; receiving calls from customers complaining about bank charges. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/6" class="indent">&quot;They'd phone up, start crying and blaming you and telling you their kids are going to starve. And I'd be like, 'I don't know you&mdash;I don't care.&quot; I was just thinking, 'you're not getting it back.' I was a right git.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/7">The investigator revealed that her trainer, whom Barclays had chosen to teach the bank's new staff how to behave to customers, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/8" class="indent">&quot;I hate it when they say the customer is always right. It's just ridiculous. Someone was stoned when they made up that policy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/9">The reporter said that a</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/10" class="indent">&quot;cynical attitude to sales&mdash;and to customers&mdash;permeated every aspect of my work with the bank.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/11">After her experience of working for Barclays, she added:</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/12" class="indent">&quot;Barclays, like most banks, has a system of targets and bonuses to encourage its staff to sell. I saw the effects of the ruthless target-driven environment. In just four weeks in my branch, I saw one of my colleagues break down in tears because of the pressure to sell and I heard about another from a different branch being suspended, accused of a series of misdemeanours...Mis-selling seemed to be rife.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/13">Naturally, Barclays denied the contents of the documentary, but I can well imagine how confused Mr. Aranda may have been when he was sold his loans and insurance policies. He had a current account with Barclays, an overdraft with Barclays, and a Barclaycard credit card with Barclays. I should have thought that the best thing would have been to get an insurance policy that covered those high interest products, but that is not what happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/14">Leaving aside the question whether Mr. Aranda was mis-sold financial products, once he became ill, surely the insurance policy would simply pay out and his financial concerns would be behind him. Unfortunately, when Mr. Aranda was taken ill that was not his experience at all. Mr. Aranda was ill for some time before the specialists confirmed that it was cancer. In order to find out what was wrong with him, he had to undergo some very invasive and distressing procedures. He was finally diagnosed with stomach cancer, and ultimately underwent major surgery in September last year. But he had been struggling with work for much longer than that. He became reliant on means-tested benefits, and had been in financial difficulties from as early as January 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/15">Instead of making things easy for Mr. Aranda when he got into financial difficulties, Barclays imposed onerous conditions on its policies. It refused to pay out unless he provided several medical certificates a month. These cost &pound;80 and more for every month, and the cost of the certificates was not covered as part of his insurance. Barclays simply expected someone suffering from cancer and dependent on benefits to shell out &pound;80 a month to get what he was owed. That was equivalent to one week's income per month.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/16">Barclays is not the only villain of the piece. I shall use this opportunity to highlight the activities of Morden Hall GP practice. I am very concerned that GPs, who have been given extremely generous new contracts under the Government, are continuing to levy unfair charges on their patients. Morden Hall GP practice was charging Mr. Aranda &pound;20 for each of the medical certificates, no matter how often they were required, and no matter what the real cost of writing them. Each certificate would have taken just a few minutes to write, yet the charge was &pound;20 each time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/17">When the public affairs industry spotted that I was holding a debate on banks, I received several calls asking whether I was going to raise the issue of excessive charges for writing simple administrative letters. Well, I am, and I hope that the House will send out a message tonight to GPs that MPs are angry about the way they charge patients. The practice should cease. GPs should not charge people like Mr. Aranda for certificates. They should not charge MPs like me for correspondence when we write on behalf of our constituents. They are very well paid, and that is part of the service that we expect. However, that is a debate for another occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/18">Mr. Aranda was struggling to get a payout from Barclays and struggling to pay for all his medical certificates when he came to see me in February 2007. He wanted me to see what I could do to make things a little easier. He also revealed some extremely disturbing practices by Barclays. He first attempted to claim his insurance in March 2006. Barclays admits that the claim was delayed, although it blames this on the GPs. However, his insurance did not cover all his commitments, and he used the payments that he did receive just to get by, or to keep his overdraft down.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/19">Throughout 2006, Mr. Aranda started to get more and more threatening phone calls from the Barclays' collections team. Even Barclays admits that it instigated 34 phone calls to Mr. Aranda. He says he was telephoned more often than that. Indeed, he claims that some of the calls were at 8 o'clock in the morning, even at the weekend. Not surprisingly these threatening phone calls demanding repayment were not good for Mr. Aranda's health. His consultant, Mr. Allum of the Royal Marsden, has written to me, stating that he suspects that the calls were</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/20" class="indent">&quot;contributing to a relatively slow recovery which Mr. Aranda is experiencing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/21">He added:</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/22" class="indent">&quot;I would stress that the financial pressures under which he is living . . . will contribute adversely to his recovery.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/23">So I decided to take up Mr. Aranda's case. I put him in touch with a financial expert from the citizens advice bureau, thanks to the help of the Wimbledon Guild of Social Welfare, and I wrote to Barclays, asking it to deal with Mr. Aranda compassionately. Normally, when I write to such organisations, I expect matters to be dealt with in good time and fairly. In total, I have written eight letters to Barclays and four letters to Barclays Insurance in Dublin, and the issue is still not resolved. At first, Barclays Dublin refused to answer me, because I had not completed the correct consent forms. I wrote back with a copy of the statutory instrument that showed that that was not required from MPs. Some of the answers that I received were confusing and unclear, so I wrote asking to meet somebody to discuss the case. Barclays refused. A customer relations manager said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/24" class="indent">&quot;I understand you have requested a meeting with ourselves at Barclays on a number of occasions to try and bring matters to a resolution, however, to date we have not arranged for this to take place. Having reviewed Mr Aranda's case, I do not believe there is any benefit in us holding a meeting at this present time. Regrettably, this is not a matter which can be resolved within a meeting.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/25">I felt that that was a deeply unsatisfactory response, and phoned Barclays. I was sent from pillar to post. I still have dreams about the music that was played while I was kept on hold.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/26">I phoned the chief executive. I did not expect that he would answer my call, but I did think that somebody in his outer office might have the courtesy to speak to me. No; I was referred to a polite young woman who worked in the call centre. She could not answer my questions&mdash;there is no way in which she could have done so&mdash;so I wrote to the chief executive to say that if no representatives would meet me, I had no choice but to take the company's behaviour to the Floor of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/27">I had no reply, so I was true to my word. I requested an Adjournment debate, and I still had no reply. The debate was granted, and its title was published. Still I had no reply. Barclays' competitors contacted me to ask whether they could help, but there was still no reply from Barclays. Yesterday, however, the British Bankers Association told Barclays what everyone else already knew&mdash;that I was going to complain about its conduct in the House. Finally, Barclays wanted to speak with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/28">If anyone says that being an MP cannot achieve anything, nobody should believe them. After 10 years as a Member of Parliament, I am privileged to tell the House that I have finally received the supreme accolade&mdash;a phone call from Barclays. I was called by Katherine French, the customer services director, and Wendy Deller, the public affairs director. Then, last evening&mdash;it was like several buses arriving at once&mdash;I received a third call, from Gary Hoffman, the group vice-chairman of Barclays. They were all obviously concerned about the publicity that this debate might generate, but while they were very interested in me and the damage that I might cause, they did not seem very interested in Mr. Aranda. They did not once ask me how he was or whether he was finally recovering. No, they were more concerned about me and the damage I could do than about their customer. They tried to convince me that such cases did not usually happen and that they normally deal with MPs better. They said that the letters to me should have been drafted by someone more senior, and apologised for the tone of their letters to me and to Mr. Aranda, although I could not get an apology for their contents. More to the point, I did not get an apology for the threatening phone calls that he had received at all times of the day and night. They did not apologise for worrying a man suffering from cancer to distraction with their harassment. They claimed that the poor quality of the letters was an exception to their usual rule. However, if they had been genuinely concerned about the welfare of their customer, I might have believed them. But that never happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/29">I hope that this debate has helped raise the issue of potential mis-selling by banks, and Barclays in particular. I hope that it has highlighted the techniques that Barclays uses when its customers become ill and are unable to maintain payments on their loans, even when they have insurance policies with their bank. I hope that it has demonstrated the difficulty that such people encounter in squeezing any money out of their insurance company, Barclays Insurance Dublin. I hope that it shows the low priority that such banks give to customer services when things go wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/30">If banks such as Barclays refuse to deal with customers as ill as Mr. Aranda with any degree of humanity, I hope that the Government will call the banks in and remind them of their responsibilities. If further regulation is required to instil even a smidgeon of kindness into their activities, I hope that the Government will consider imposing it on Barclays. If Barclays can afford to pay &pound;22 million to just one of its executives out of its profits of &pound;7 billion, it can afford to pay just a little respect to my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1617.2/31">Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to put this case forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-05-02a.1621.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury"  colnum="1621"  time="019:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070502/debtext/70502-0020.htm#07050240001218">
	<p pid="a.1621.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1717" name="Siobhain McDonagh">the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)</phrase> both on securing this debate and on her persistence and tenacity in pursuing the interests of her constituent. That is clearly a tribute to her efforts, as well as a model and a lesson on which other Members of Parliament may want to draw in understanding how to deal with situations where it feels as though bureaucracy has put up a brick wall.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/2">On behalf of all other Members in the House, I join my hon. Friend in expressing my great regret at the stress and severe illnesses that her constituent has suffered and send him our best wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/3">My hon. Friend said that it often feels as though one waits a long time for a bus and then three arrive at once. I, too, have been contacted on this issue by senior figures at Barclays. I will return to the fourth bus in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/4">Before I do so, let me respond more broadly to the points that my hon. Friend made. As she said, she is not only raising the particular case of her constituent but wanting wider lessons to be drawn from it. I agree with her on two points. First, banks play an important role in our economy. Having a strong and efficient banking sector is necessary for the effective working of the national and, indeed, the global economy. I know from my experience that Barclays plays an important role globally in our economy. Secondly, banks play an integral role in our society and have important responsibilities as institutions, and as an industry, in ensuring not only that all consumers get a fair deal but that the most vulnerable members of society are properly supported and protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/5">Over the past year, one of my responsibilities at the Treasury has been to work with the banks to try to reduce the number of individuals in our society who are disadvantaged because they do not have access to mainstream banking services such as a bank account, to ensure that banks play the role that they should in helping to get advice to people about financial products and services, and to ensure that when individuals get into financial distress banks recognise their responsibility to support them. One of the proposals that the Treasury has made to the review of the banking code that is being undertaken by an independent reviewer is aimed at ensuring that the code contains proper procedures, expectations and obligations as to how all individuals who get into financial distress should be supported. I hope that we will be able to make progress in that area so that the problems that my hon. Friend discussed can be prevented in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/6">As my hon. Friend will know, it is difficult for me, as a Minister, to comment on the individual specifics of a case. Let me explain why. One of the reforms that the Government introduced was the setting up of the Financial Services Authority and the creation of a single financial ombudsman scheme within the framework provided by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. We have tried to ensure that regulatory oversight of often complex financial products is performed properly and with the needs of consumers firmly in mind, so that consumers are treated fairly but regulatory and compensatory bodies are in place for when things go wrong. It is vital that the Financial Ombudsman Service is, and is seen to be, independent of Government so that it can deal with complaints against financial services firms and provide a safety net for consumers. Its credibility, authority and value to consumers would be undermined if we started to intervene, case by case, in individual cases. That is why I do not want to comment in detail on the merits of the particular case that my hon. Friend raises, although I would say that any constituent of hers can always go to the FOS if they believe that they have been badly advised or treated unfairly. She might want to consider that further.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/7">My hon. Friend also raised several wider issues, based on the specific case, and I will comment on them. First, she referred to payment protection insurance, specifically the selling of such products. Payment protection insurance typically protects a borrower's ability to maintain credit repayments in the event of becoming unable to do so owing to, for example, accident, sickness or unemployment. It can provide valuable protection when people are at their most vulnerable, and the Government recognise its potential value, if sold properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/8">That, however, has clearly not always been the case, and the Government are fully aware of the concerns that have been expressed about the suitability of those products for some individuals. We are closely monitoring the work of the Competition Commission and the FSA on that. We fully support efforts to improve consumer protection and raise selling standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/9">Secondly, my hon. Friend raised PPI selling to consumers who do not understand the policy fully because they do not have a good grasp of English. There are no specific FSA rules to deal with that. However, under the umbrella of treating customers fairly, the FSA requires firms to disclose sufficient information to consumers to allow them to make an informed decision about the product they are purchasing. Current FSA work is testing industry progress in improving selling standards. I shall ensure that it specifically examines the issue that my hon. Friend raises about language and comprehension as part of its work. After the debate, I will write to the chairman of the FSA to alert him to my hon. Friend's concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/10">With an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; purchase such as PPI, it would be impractical for firms to provide individual information. If customers want more specific or tailored information, they should clearly seek appropriate advice. I repeat that I will raise the specific issue to which my hon. Friend referred with the FSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/11">My hon. Friend also raised the high cost of complying with insurers' requests for medical information. As she knows, the way in which claims are tackled will form part of the terms and conditions between the insurer and the person buying the insurance. For PPI polices, the insurer will require the policyholder to provide evidence of any illness or unemployment. For illness, the insurer is likely to require a medical certificate that will justify the claim. That may be at the cost of the policyholder, depending on the specific insurance contract that is being sold. I understand that Barclays requires the policyholder to provide and pay for any proof that is required, although if it asks the policyholder to undergo a medical examination, it will pay the fee. I am told that that is not out of line with market practice. It is important that that is clearly stated in the policy terms and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/12">As my hon. Friend said, however, the key issue is whether the terms and conditions are properly understood and explained at the time. Although I do not comment on the specific case that she raised, a general problem in the PPI market is that, too often, the policy has not been properly explained. It has therefore not been properly comprehended.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/13">My hon. Friend raised wider points about the role of GPs. Commenting on that would take us outside the terms of the Adjournment debate and my role as a Minister. However, as a colleague and fellow Member of Parliament, I say that the sort of examples that she gave cause me&mdash;and probably all of us&mdash;some concern. The danger that the most vulnerable people in our society are not getting the support that they need because they cannot find the sort of sum that she mentioned is genuinely worrying.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/14">Let me deal with the conduct of Barclays. My hon. Friend raised the wider issues that the BBC's &quot;Whistleblower&quot; programme covered. I stress that the Government and the regulators are taking the allegations in the programme seriously. The Banking Code Standards Board and the Financial Services Authority are looking into some of the issues that came out of the programme. For example, the Banking Code Standards Board is looking at the upgrading of current accounts, and later this year the FSA will carry out work on information security, which will include staff vetting for working in a bank. My hon. Friend will understand that I cannot comment on the &quot;Whistleblower&quot; case, but, as I said, we take these issues very seriously indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/15">Finally, let me return to the conduct of Barclays in this case. It is not right for me to comment on the individual complaint and fetter the discretion of the independent financial ombudsman, but, like my hon. Friend, I have had some communication with Barclays, which contacted my office today. It might help my hon. Friend if I read out the position as summarised by Barclays bank to me. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Barclays views the prompt and fair handling of complaints as of the highest priority, whether they come from a Member of Parliament or not. Clearly, on this occasion, which we view as an exceptional case, we fell well short of the standards to which we aspire. We have apologised unreservedly to Ms McDonagh for any failings in our handling of this case, and offered to meet her with a senior director to resolve any outstanding issues. We can only express our deepest regret to Ms McDonagh, and her constituent, that she has had to go to these lengths in this case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/17">It is not for me to comment on this statement of Barclays. However, it has made very clear its regret for falling short of the standards to which it aspires. If has offered to meet my hon. Friend to resolve any outstanding issues, and it has expressed its deepest regret that she has had to go to these lengths.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/18">I think that if the outstanding issues can be resolved, my hon. Friend's constituent will be very pleased that she has been willing to go to such lengths to see proper treatment of this problem. I commend my hon. Friend for the action she has taken, for the efforts she has made and for bringing the case to the House's attention, so that we can draw any wider lessons and ensure, where we can, that we avoid a repetition of these unfortunate incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/19" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621.0/20" class="italic"> Adjourned accordingly at twenty-seven minutes past Seven o'clock.</p>
